                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. This section prescribes rules pertaining to the deposit of Statements of Account and royalty fees in the Coypright Office as required by section 111(d)(2) of title 17 of the United States Code in order for secondary transmissions of cable systems to be subject to compulsory licensing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. (1) Gross receipts for the ``basic service of providing secondary transmissions of primary broadcast transmitters'' include the full amount of monthly (or other periodic) service fees for any and all services or tiers of services which include one or more secondary transmissions of television or radio broadcast signals, for additional set fees, and for converter fees. In no case shall gross receipts be less than the cost of obtaining the signals of primary broadcast transmitters for subsequent retransmission. All such gross receipts shall be aggregated and the distant signal equivalent (DSE) calculations shall be made against the aggregated amount. Gross receipts for secondary transmission services do not include installation (including connection, relocation, disconnection, or reconnection) fees, separate charges for security, alarm or facsimile services, charges for late payments, or charges for pay cable or other program origination services: Provided That, the origination services are not offered in combination with secondary transmission service for a single fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Gross receipts for the ``basic service of providing secondary transmissions of primary broadcast transmitters'' include the full amount of monthly (or other periodic) service fees for any and all services or tiers of services which include one or more secondary transmissions of television or radio broadcast signals, for additional set fees, and for converter fees.

A system that meets this definition is considered a ``cable system'' for copyright purposes, even if the FCC excludes it from being considered a ``cable system'' because of the number or nature of its subscribers or the nature of its secondary transmissions. The Statements of Account and royalty fees to be deposited under Sec.  201.17 of this section, shall be recorded and deposited by each individual cable system desiring its secondary transmissions to be subject to compulsory licensing. The owner of each individual

cable system on the last day of the accounting period covered by a Statement of Account is responsible for depositing the Statement of Account and remitting the copyright royalty fees. For these purposes, and the purpose of Sec.  201.17 of this section, an ``individual'' cable system is each cable system recognized as a distinct entity under the rules, regulations, and practices of the Federal Communications Commission in effect on the last day of the accounting period covered by a Statement of Account, in the case of the preparation and deposit of a Statement of Account and copyright royalty fee. For these purposes, two or more cable facilities are considered as one individual cable system if the facilities are either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In contiguous communities under common ownership or control or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Operating from one headend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> FCC means the Federal Communications Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In the case of cable systems which make secondary transmissions of all available FM radio signals, which signals are not electronically processed by the system as separate and discrete signals, an FM radio signal is ``generally receivable'' if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It is usually carried by the system whenever it is received at the system's headend, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As a result of monitoring at reasonable times and intervals, it can be expected to be received at the system's headend, with the system's FM antenna, at least three consecutive hours each day at the same time each day, five or more days a week, for four or more weeks during any calendar quarter, with a strength of not less than fifty microvolts per meter measured at the foot of the tower or pole to which the antenna is attached.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The terms primary transmission, secondary transmission, local service area of a primary transmitter, distant signal equivalent, network station, independent station, noncommercial educational station, primary stream, multicast stream, simulcast, primary transmitter, subscriber, and subscribe have the meanings set forth in Section 111(f) of title 17 of the United States Code, as amended by Pub. L. No. 94-553, Pub. L. No. 103-369, and Pub. L. No. 111-175.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A primary transmitter is a ``distant'' station, for purposes of this section, if the programming of such transmitter is carried by the cable system in whole or in part beyond the local service area of such primary transmitter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A translator station is, with respect to programs both originally transmitted and retransmitted by it, a primary transmitter for the purposes of this section. A translator station which retransmits the programs of a network station will be considered a network station; a translator station which retransmits the programs of an independent station shall be considered an independent station; and a translator station which retransmits the programs of a noncommercial educational station shall be considered a noncommercial educational station. The determination of whether a translator station should be identified as a ``distant'' station depends on the local service area of the translator station.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> For purposes of this section, the ``rules and regulations of the FCC in effect on October 19, 1976,'' which permitted a cable system, at its election, to omit the retransmission of a particular program and substitute another program in its place, refers to that portion of former 47 CFR 76.61(b)(2), revised June 25, 1981, and Sec.  76.63 (referring to Sec.  76.61(b)(2)), deleted June 25, 1981, concerning the substitution of a program that is primarily of local interest to the distant community (e.g., a local news or public affairs program).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> For purposes of this section, the ``rules and regulations of the FCC'', which require a cable system to omit the retransmission of a particular program and substitute another program in its place, refers to 47 CFR 76.67.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> For purposes of this section, a cable system ``lacks the activated channel capacity to retransmit on a full-time basis all signals which it is authorized to carry'' only if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All of its activated television channels are used exclusively for the secondary transmission of television signals; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The number of primary television transmitters secondarily transmitted by the cable system exceeds the number of its activated television channels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Accounting periods and deposit.

Thereafter, the Office will examine the Statement and fee for obvious errors or omissions appearing on the face of the documents, and will require that any such obvious errors or omissions be corrected before final processing of the documents is completed. If, as the result of communications between the Copyright Office and the cable system, an additional fee is deposited or changes or additions are made in the Statement of Account, the date that additional deposit or information was actually received in the Office will be added to the official record of the case. However, completion by the Copyright Office of the final processing of a Statement of Account and royalty fee deposit shall establish only the fact of such completion and the date or dates of receipt shown in the official record. It shall in no case be considered a determination that the Statement of Account was, in fact, properly prepared and accurate, that the correct amount of the royalty fee had been deposited, that the statutory time limits for filing had been met, or that any other requirements to qualify for a compulsory license have been satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Statements of Account and royalty fees received before the end of the particular accounting period they purport to cover will not be processed by the Copyright Office. Statements of Account and royalty fees received after the filing deadlines of August 29 or March 1, respectively, will be accepted for whatever legal effect they may have, if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In the Register's discretion, four years after the close of any calendar year, the Register may, close out the royalty payments account for that calendar year, and may treat any funds remaining in such account and any subsequent deposits that would otherwise be attributable to that calendar year as attributable to the succeeding calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Forms.

For these purposes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The description, the number of subscribers, and the charge or charges made shall reflect the facts existing on the last day of the period covered by the Statement; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Each entity (for example, the owner of a private home, the resident of an apartment, the owner of a motel, or the owner of an apartment house) which is charged by the cable system for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions shall be considered one subscriber.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The designation ``Gross Receipts'', followed by the gross amount paid to the cable system by subscribers for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions of primary broadcast transmissions during the period covered by the Statement of Account. If the cable system maintains its revenue accounts on an accrual basis, gross receipts for any accounting period includes all such amounts accrued for secondary transmission service furnished during that period, regardless of when accrued:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Less the amount of any bad debts actually written-off during that accounting period, excluding bad debts for secondary transmission service furnished before January 1, 1978;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Plus the amount of any previously written-off bad debts for secondary transmission service which were actually recovered during that accounting period, excluding bad debt recoveries for secondary transmission service furnished before January 1, 1978.

If the cable system maintains its revenue accounts on a cash basis, gross receipts for any accounting period includes all such amounts actually received by the cable system during that accounting period, excluding amounts paid for secondary transmission service furnished before January 1, 1978; however, amounts received before January 1, 1978, for secondary transmission

service furnished after that date, are to be considered as if they had been received during the accounting period in which the service covered by such payments was furnished.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The designation ``Services Other Than Secondary Transmissions: Rates,'' followed by a description of each package of service which consists solely of services other than secondary transmission services, for which a separate charge was made or established, and which the cable system furnished or made available to subscribers during the period covered by the Statement of Account, together with the amount of such charge. However, no information need be given concerning services furnished at cost. Specific amounts charged for pay cable programming need not be given if the rates are on a variable, per-program basis.

If a DSE is rounded off in any case in a Statement of Account, it must be rounded off throughout the Statement. Where a cable system has chosen to round off, and the fourth decimal point for a particular DSE value would, without rounding off, have been 1, 2, 3, or 4, the third decimal point remains unchanged; if, in such a case, the fourth decimal point would, without rounding off, be 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, the third decimal point must be rounded off to the next higher number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For the purposes of computing DSE values, specialty primary television transmitters in the United States and all Canadian and Mexican primary television transmitters shall be assigned a value of one.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Computation of copyright royalty fee: subscriber groups.

A cable system located partly within and partly without the local service area of a primary television transmitter (``partially distant station'') computes the royalty fee specified in section 111(d)(1)(B) (ii), (iii), and (iv) of the Copyright Act (``DSE fee'') by excluding gross receipts from subscribers located within that station's local service area from total gross receipts. A cable system which carries two or more partially distant stations with local service areas that do not exactly coincide shall compute a separate DSE fee for each group of subscribers who are located outside of the local service areas of exactly the same complement of distant stations. Computation of the DSE fee for each subscriber group is to be based on:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The total distant signal equivalents of that group's complement of distant stations, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The total gross receipts from that group of subscribers.

Such computation shall be made as provided for on Form SA3. The calculations shall be based upon the gross receipts from all subscribers, within the relevant communities, for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions of primary broadcast transmitters, without regard to whether those subscribers actually received the station in question.
