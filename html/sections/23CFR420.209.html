                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As a condition for approval of FHWA planning and research funds  for RD&T; activities, a State DOT must develop, establish, and implement  a management process that identifies and results in implementation of  RD&T; activities expected to address high priority transportation issues.  The management process must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An interactive process for identification and prioritization of  RD&T; activities for inclusion in an RD&T; work program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use of all FHWA planning and research funds set aside for RD&T;  activities, either internally or for participation in transportation  pooled fund studies or other cooperative RD&T; programs, to the maximum  extent possible;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Procedures for tracking program activities, schedules,  accomplishments, and fiscal commitments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Support and use of the TRIS database for program development,  reporting of active RD&T; activities, and input of the final report  information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Procedures to determine the effectiveness of the State DOT's  management process in implementing the RD&T; program, to determine the  utilization of the State DOT's RD&T; outputs, and to facilitate peer  exchanges of its RD&T; Program on a periodic basis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Procedures for documenting RD&T; activities through the  preparation of final reports. As a minimum, the documentation must  include the data collected, analyses performed, conclusions, and  recommendations. The State DOT must actively implement appropriate  research findings and should document benefits; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Participation in peer exchanges of its RD&T; management process  and of other State DOTs' programs on a periodic basis. To assist peer  exchange teams in conducting an effective exchange, the State DOT must  provide to them the information and documentation required to be  collected and maintained under this subpart. Travel and other costs  associated with the State DOT's peer exchange may be identified as a  line item in the State DOT's work program and will be eligible for 100  percent Federal funding. The peer exchange team must prepare a written  report of the exchange.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Documentation that describes the State DOT's management process  and the procedures for selecting and implementing RD&T; activities must  be developed by the State DOT and submitted to the FHWA Division office  for approval. Significant changes in the management process also must be  submitted by the State DOT to the FHWA for approval. The State DOT must  make the documentation available, as necessary, to facilitate peer  exchanges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The State DOT must include a certification that it is in full  compliance with the requirements of this subpart in each RD&T; work  program. If the State DOT is unable to certify full compliance, the FHWA  Division Administrator may grant conditional approval of the State DOT's  work program. A conditional approval must cite those areas of the State  DOT's management process that are deficient and require that the  deficiencies be corrected within 6 months of conditional approval. The  certification must consist of a statement signed by the Administrator,  or an official designated by the Administrator, of the State DOT  certifying as follows: ``I (name of certifying official), (position  title), of the State (Commonwealth) of --------, do hereby   certify that the State (Commonwealth) is in compliance with all  requirements of 23 U.S.C. 505 and its implementing regulations with  respect to the research, development, and technology transfer program,  and contemplate no changes in statutes, regulations, or administrative  procedures which would affect such compliance.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The FHWA Division Administrator shall periodically review the  State DOT's management process to determine if the State is in  compliance with the requirements of this subpart. If the Division  Administrator determines that a State DOT is not complying with the  requirements of this subpart, or is not performing in accordance with  its RD&T; management process, the FHWA Division Administrator shall issue  a written notice of proposed determination of noncompliance to the State  DOT. The notice will set forth the reasons for the proposed  determination and inform the State DOT that it may reply in writing  within 30 calendar days from the date of the notice. The State DOT's  reply should address the deficiencies cited in the notice and provide  documentation as necessary. If the State DOT and the Division  Administrator cannot resolve the differences set forth in the  determination of nonconformity, the State DOT may appeal to the Federal  Highway Administrator whose action shall constitute the final decision  of the FHWA. An adverse decision shall result in immediate withdrawal of  approval of FHWA planning and research funds for the State DOT's RD&T;  activities until the State DOT is in full compliance.  (The information collection requirements in Sec. 420.209 have been  approved by the OMB and assigned control number 2125-0039)</p>
