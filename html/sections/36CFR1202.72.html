                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> NARA will acknowledge receipt of a request to amend a record  within 10 workdays. If possible, the acknowledgment will include the  system manager's determination either to amend the record or to deny  your request to amend as provided in Sec. 1202.76.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When reviewing a record in response to your request to amend,  the system manager will assess the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and  completeness of the existing record in light of your proposed amendment  to determine if your request to amend is justified. If you request the  deletion of information, the system manager also will review your  request and the existing record to determine whether the information is  relevant and necessary to accomplish NARA's purpose, as required by law  or Executive order.</p>
