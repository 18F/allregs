                            <p class="depth0">The Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (HCQIA), as amended,  title IV of Public Law 99-660 (42 U.S.C. 11101 et seq.) (hereinafter  referred to as ``title IV''), authorizes the Secretary to establish  (either directly or by contract) a National Practitioner Data Bank  (NPDB) to collect and release certain information relating to the  professional competence and conduct of physicians, dentists, and other  health care practitioners. Section 1921 of the Social Security Act  (hereinafter referred to as ``section 1921''), as amended, (42 U.S.C.  1396r-2) expanded the requirements under the NPDB and requires each  state to adopt a system of reporting to the Secretary adverse licensure  or certification actions taken against health care practitioners, health  care entities, providers, and suppliers, as well as certain final  adverse actions taken by state law and fraud enforcement agencies  against health care practitioners, providers, and suppliers. Section  1128E of the Social Security Act (hereinafter referred to as ``section  1128E''), as amended, (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7e) authorizes the Secretary to  implement a national healthcare fraud and abuse data collection program  for the reporting and disclosing of certain final adverse actions taken  by Federal Government agencies and health plans against health care  practitioners, providers, and suppliers. Information from section 1921  and section 1128E is to be reported and distributed through the NPDB.  The regulations in this part set forth the reporting and disclosure  requirements for the NPDB, as well as procedures to dispute the accuracy  of information contained in the NPDB.
