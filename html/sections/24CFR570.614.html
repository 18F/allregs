                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157) requires certain Federal and Federally funded buildings and other facilities to be designed, constructed, or altered in accordance with standards that insure accessibility to, and use by, physically handicapped people. A building or facility designed, constructed, or altered with funds allocated or reallocated under this part after December 11, 1995, and that meets the definition of ``residential structure'' as defined in 24 CFR 40.2 or the definition of ``building'' as defined in 41 CFR 101-19.602(a) is subject to the requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157) and shall comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (appendix A to 24 CFR part 40 for residential structures, and appendix A to 41 CFR part 101-19, subpart 101-19.6, for general type buildings).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12131; 47 U.S.C. 155, 201, 218 and 225) (ADA) provides comprehensive civil rights to individuals with disabilities in the areas of employment, public accommodations, State and local government services, and telecommunications. It further provides that discrimination includes a failure to design and construct facilities for first occupancy no later than January 26, 1993, that are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. Further, the ADA requires the removal of architectural barriers and communication barriers that are structural in nature in existing facilities, where such removal is readily achievable--that is, easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense.
