                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. This section applies to all Class I freight railroads, beginning on January 1, 2005.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Testing requirements. Each railroad subject to the provisions of this section shall annually test a sample of locomotives in its fleet. For the purpose of this section, a railroad's fleet includes both the locomotives that it owns and the locomotives that it is leasing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> Except as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section, the number of locomotives to be tested shall be at least 0.15 percent of the average number of locomotives in the railroad's fleet during the previous calendar year (i.e., the number tested shall be 0.0015 multiplied by the number of locomotives in the fleet, rounded up to the next whole number).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section, the number of locomotives to be tested shall be at least 0.15 percent of the average number of locomotives in the railroad's fleet during the previous calendar year (i.e., the number tested shall be 0.0015 multiplied by the number of locomotives in the fleet, rounded up to the next whole number).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After December 31, 2015, the number of locomotives to be tested by railroads with 500 or more locomotives shall be at least 0.10 percent of the average number of locomotives in the railroad's fleet during the previous calendar year (i.e., the number tested shall be 0.0010 multiplied by the number of locomotives in the fleet, rounded up to the next whole number). After December 31, 2015, the number of locomotives to be tested by railroads with fewer than 500 locomotives shall be zero. The provisions of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii) apply only when:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> No new locomotive emission standards have taken effect during the previous 5 years;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Locomotive emission controls have not changed fundamentally, during the previous 5 years, in any manner that could reasonably be expected to have the potential to significantly affect emissions durability; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Testing during the previous 5 years has shown, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that the degree of noncompliance for tested locomotives is low enough that the higher rate of testing specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is not needed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Administrator may allow a railroad to perform a smaller number of tests than specified in paragraphs (b)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section, where he/she determines that the number of tests specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section is not necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Testing shall be performed according to the test procedures in subpart B of this part, unless otherwise approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Test locomotive selection. (1)(i) A representative sample of locomotives shall be randomly selected for testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> A representative sample of locomotives shall be randomly selected for testing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A representative sample of locomotives shall be randomly selected for testing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unless otherwise specified by the Administrator, the selection shall be made by the railroad.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The railroad shall select locomotives from each manufacturer and remanufacturer, and from each tier level (e.g., Tier 0, Tier 1 and Tier 2) in proportion to their numbers in the railroad's fleet, except where specified or allowed otherwise by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Locomotives tested during the previous year shall be excluded from the sample.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Locomotives may not be excluded from the sample because of visible

smoke, a history of durability problems, or other evidence of malmaintenance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> Locomotives selected for testing according to the provisions of this section shall have been certified in compliance with requirements in subpart A of this part, and shall have been operated for at least 100 percent of their useful lives.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Locomotives selected for testing according to the provisions of this section shall have been certified in compliance with requirements in subpart A of this part, and shall have been operated for at least 100 percent of their useful lives.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where the number of locomotives that have been operated for at least 100 percent of their useful lives is not large enough to fulfill the testing requirement, locomotives still within their useful lives shall be tested. In this case, the locomotives must have been operated longer than at least 80 percent of the locomotives in the railroad's fleet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where specified by the Administrator, the railroad shall test specified locomotives in its fleet, including locomotives that do not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reporting requirements. All testing done in compliance with the provisions of this section shall be reported to EPA within thirty calendar days of the end of each year. At a minimum, each report shall contain the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Full corporate name and address of the railroad providing the report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each locomotive tested, the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Corporate name of the manufacturer and last remanufacturer(s) (including both certificate holder and installer, where different) of the locomotive, and the corporate name of the manufacturer or last remanufacturer(s) of the engine if different than that of the manufacturer or remanufacturer(s) of the locomotive;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Year, and if known month of original manufacture of the locomotive and the engine, and the manufacturer's model designation of the locomotive and manufacturer's model designation of the engine, and the locomotive identification number;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Year, and if known month that the engine last underwent remanufacture, and the engine remanufacturer's designation which either reflects, or most closely reflects, the engine after the last remanufacture, and the engine family identification;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The number of MW-hrs and miles (where available) the locomotive has been operated since its last remanufacture; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The emission test results for all measured pollutants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any railroad that performed no emission testing during a given year is exempt from the reporting requirements described in paragraph (d) of this section for that year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In lieu of some or all of the test data required by this section, railroads may submit equivalent emission data collected for other purposes. The Administrator may also allow emission data collected using other testing or sampling procedures to be submitted in lieu of some or part of the data required by this section with advance approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> All reports submitted to EPA in compliance with the provisions of this subpart must be addressed to: Group Manager, Engine Compliance Programs Group, Engine Programs and Compliance Division 6403-J, Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.</p>
