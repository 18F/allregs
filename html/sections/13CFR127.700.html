                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Presumption of Loss Based on the Total Amount Expended. In every  contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, cooperative research and  development agreement, or grant which is set aside, reserved, or  otherwise classified as intended for award to EDWOSBs or WOSBs, there  shall be a presumption of loss to the United States based on the total  amount expended on the contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement,  cooperative research and development agreement, or grant whenever it is  established that a business concern other than a EDWOSB or WOSB  willfully sought and received the award by misrepresentation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Deemed Certifications. The following actions shall be deemed  affirmative, willful and intentional certifications of EDWOSB or WOSB  status:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submission of a bid, proposal, application or offer for a  Federal grant, contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, or  cooperative research and development agreement reserved, set aside, or  otherwise classified as intended for award to EDWOSBs or WOSBs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submission of a bid, proposal, application or offer for a  Federal grant, contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement or  cooperative research and development agreement which in any way  encourages a Federal agency to classify the bid or proposal, if awarded,  as an award to a EDWOSB or WOSB.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Registration on any Federal electronic database for the purpose  of being considered for award of a Federal grant, contract, subcontract,  cooperative agreement, or cooperative research and development  agreement, as an EDWOSB or WOSB.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Signature Requirement. Each offer, proposal, bid, or application  for a Federal contract, subcontract, or grant shall contain a  certification concerning the EDWOSB or WOSB status of a business concern  seeking the Federal contract, subcontract or grant. An authorized  official must sign the certification on the same page containing   the EDWOSB or WOSB status claimed by the concern.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limitation of Liability. Paragraphs (a)-(c) of this section may  be determined not to apply in the case of unintentional errors,  technical malfunctions, and other similar situations that demonstrate  that a misrepresentation of EDWOSB or WOSB status was not affirmative,  intentional, willful or actionable under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C.  Secs. 3729, et seq. A prime contractor acting in good faith should not  be held liable for misrepresentations made by its subcontractors  regarding the subcontractors' EDWOSB or WOSB status. Relevant factors to  consider in making this determination may include the firm's internal  management procedures governing EDWOSB or WOSB status representations or  certifications, the clarity or ambiguity of the representation or  certification requirement, and the efforts made to correct an incorrect  or invalid representation or certification in a timely manner. An  individual or firm may not be held liable where government personnel  have erroneously identified a concern as an EDWOSB or WOSB without any  representation or certification having been made by the concern and  where such identification is made without the knowledge of the  individual or firm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Penalties for Misrepresentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Suspension or debarment. The SBA suspension and debarment  official or the agency suspension and debarment official may suspend or  debar a person or concern for misrepresenting a firm's status as an  EDWOSB or WOSB pursuant to the procedures set forth in 48 CFR subpart  9.4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Civil Penalties. Persons or concerns are subject to severe  penalties under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729-3733, and under the  Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act, 331 U.S.C. 3801-3812, and any other  applicable laws.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Criminal Penalties. Persons or concerns are subject to severe  criminal penalties for knowingly misrepresenting the EDWOSB or WOSB  status of a concern in connection with procurement programs pursuant to  section 16(d) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 645(d), as amended,  18 U.S.C. 1001, 18 U.S.C. 287, and any other applicable laws. Persons or  concerns are subject to criminal penalties for knowingly making false  statements or misrepresentations to SBA for the purpose of influencing  any actions of SBA pursuant to section 16(a) of the Small Business Act,  15 U.S.C. 645(a), as amended, including failure to correct ``continuing  representations'' that are no longer true.
