                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For an existing affected source, you must demonstrate compliance by conducting the monitoring activities in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must perform periodic inspections and maintenance of each baghouse according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must conduct weekly visual inspections of the system ductwork for leaks.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must conduct inspections of the interior of the baghouse for structural integrity and to determine the condition of the fabric filter every 12 months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As an alternative to the monitoring requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you may demonstrate compliance by conducting a daily 30-minute visible emissions (VE) test (i.e., no visible emissions) using EPA Method 22 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the results of the visual inspection or VE test conducted under paragraph (a) of this section indicate a problem with the operation of the baghouse, including but not limited to air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in PM emissions, you must take immediate corrective action to return the baghouse to normal operation according to the equipment manufacturer's specifications or instructions and record the corrective action taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For each new affected source, you must install, operate, and maintain a bag leak detection system according to paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each bag leak detection system must meet the specifications and requirements in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (viii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting PM emissions at concentrations of 1 milligram per dry standard cubic meter (0.00044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of relative PM loadings. The owner or operator shall continuously record the output from the bag leak detection system using electronic or other means (e.g., using a strip chart recorder or a data logger).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm system that will sound when the system detects an increase in relative particulate loading over the alarm set point established according to paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, and the alarm must be located such that it can be heard by the appropriate plant personnel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In the initial adjustment of the bag leak detection system, you must establish, at a minimum, the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity (range) and the averaging period of the device, the alarm set points, and the alarm delay time.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Following initial adjustment, you shall not adjust the averaging period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time without approval from the Administrator or delegated authority except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Once per quarter, you may adjust the sensitivity of the bag leak detection system to account for seasonal effects, including temperature and humidity, according to the procedures identified in the site-specific monitoring plan required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> You must install the bag leak detection sensor downstream of the fabric filter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must develop and submit to the Administrator or delegated authority for approval a site-specific monitoring plan for each bag leak detection system. You must operate and maintain the bag leak detection system according to the site-specific monitoring plan at all times. Each monitoring plan must describe the items in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Installation of the bag leak detection system;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection system, including how the alarm set-point will be established;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Operation of the bag leak detection system, including quality assurance procedures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> How the bag leak detection system will be maintained, including a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> How the bag leak detection system output will be recorded and stored; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Corrective action procedures as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. In approving the site-specific monitoring plan, the Administrator or delegated authority may allow owners and operators more than 3 hours to alleviate a specific condition that causes an alarm if the owner or operator identifies in the monitoring plan this specific condition as one that could lead to an alarm, adequately explains why it is not feasible to alleviate this condition within 3 hours of the time the alarm occurs, and demonstrates that the requested time will ensure alleviation of this condition as expeditiously as practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each bag leak detection system, you must initiate procedures to determine the cause of every alarm within 1 hour of the alarm. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section, you must alleviate the cause of the alarm within 3 hours of the alarm by taking whatever corrective action(s) are necessary. Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Inspecting the fabric filter for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in PM emissions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sealing off defective bags or filter media;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise repairing the control device;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Sealing off a defective fabric filter compartment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe or otherwise repairing the bag leak detection system; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Shutting down the process producing the PM emissions.</p>
