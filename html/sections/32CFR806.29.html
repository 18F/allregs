                                Sec. 806.29  Administrative processing of Air Force FOIA requests.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section is a checklist format of processing steps and  explanations of Air Force and DoD guidance. Each MAJCOM may elect to  prepare its own checklists to tailor FOIA processing actions within its  own organizations to meet their specific needs, so long as it remains  consistent with guidance contained in DoD 5400.7-R, DoD Freedom of  Information Act Program, and this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures: FOIA requests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Note the date the request was received, give the request a  unique identifier/number, and log the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assess the request to determine initial processing requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determine what Air Force elements may hold responsive records.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Are responsive records kept at the same or different  installations?</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is referral of (all/part) of the request required?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Determine appropriate processing track (simple/complex/ expedited). (Air Force FOIA offices without backlogs do not multitrack  FOIA requests.)</p><p class="depth3">Note: Requesters have a right to appeal an adverse tracking decision  (for example, when it is determined their request will not be  expedited). Also, if their request qualifies for the complex track, tell  requesters so they may limit the scope of their request in order to  qualify for the simple track. FOIA managers must assess a request before  placing it into a specific processing track, and must support their  actions should the requester appeal. If a request is determined to be  complex, or is not expedited when the requester sought expedited  processing, you must advise the requester of the adverse tracking  decision in writing. See Sec. 806.27 for sample language for this kind  of letter to a requester.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Simple. Defines a request that can be processed quickly, with  limited impact on the responding units. The request clearly identifies  the records, involves no (or few) complicating factors (e.g., there are  few or no responsive records, involves only one installation and there  are no outside OPRs, involves no classified records (Exemption 1), a law  exempts the responsive records from disclosure (Exemption 3), no  contractor-submitted records (Exemption 4), no deliberative process/ privileged materials (Exemption 5), records contain no (or limited)  personal privacy information/did not come from Privacy Act systems of  records concerning other individuals (Exemption 6), release of records  would have minimal impact on law enforcement (Exemption 7); no time  extensions expected, other than the additional 10-workdays allowed in  situations outlined in the FOIA). If the requested data must come from  electronic records, response can be completed on a ``business-as-usual''  basis; requires no (or limited) reprogramming of automated information  systems and would cause no significant interference with operation of  information systems by processing a simple request/providing a response  in the electronic format requested.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Complex. Defines a request whose processing will take  substantial time,   will cause significant impact on responding units. Complications and  delays are likely (e.g., the request is vague (poor description of  records, unclear who or when records were created), records are massive  in volume, multiple organizations will receive tasking, records are  classified (Exemption 1), records came from another command/service/a  nongovernment source (Exemption 4), records are part of the Air Force's  decision-making process, and not incorporated into a final decision (IG/ audit reports, legal opinions, misconduct or mishap investigations etc.)  or are attorney-client records (Exemption 5), records are largely  personal information on another individual or came from Privacy Act  systems of records (Exemption 6), records describe law enforcement  activities or information from (and/or identities of) confidential  sources (Exemption 7); response cannot be completed on a ``business as  usual'' basis and would require extensive reprogramming or cause  significant interference with operation of the automated information  systems. (Advise requester, in writing, of right to limit the scope of  their request in order to qualify for simple track.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An expedited request is when a requester asks for expedited  processing and explains the compelling need (imminent threat to life or  physical safety; urgently needed by a person primarily engaged in  disseminating information; due process; or humanitarian need) for the  requested information. In order to receive expedited processing,  requesters must provide a statement certifying their ``demonstration''  (description) of their specific ``compelling need'' or due process/ humanitarian need is true and correct to the best of their knowledge.  When a requester seeks expedited processing, FOIA offices must respond  in writing to the requester within 10 calendar days after receipt of the  request approving or denying their request for expedited processing.  Requesters have a right to appeal an adverse decision (e.g., when it is  determined their requests will not be expedited). There are four  categories of FOIA requests that qualify for expedited processing:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The requester asserts a ``compelling need'' for the records,  because a failure to obtain records quickly could reasonably be expected  to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an  individual.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The requester asserts a ``compelling need'' for the records,  because the information is ``urgently needed'' by an individual engaged  in disseminating information to inform the public (primarily news media  requesters; and could also include other persons with the ability to  disseminate information).</p><p class="depth5">Note: ``Urgently needed,'' in this case, means the information has a  particular value that will be lost if it is not disseminated quickly.  This normally would apply to a breaking news story of general public  interest. Information of historical interest only, or sought for  litigation or commercial activities would not qualify, nor would the  fact a news media entity had an internal broadcast deadline of its own,  which was unrelated to the ``news breaking nature'' of the information  itself, cause the requested information to qualify as ``urgently  needed.''</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Failure to obtain records quickly could cause imminent loss of  substantial due process rights or providing the information quickly  would serve a ``humanitarian need'' (i.e., disclosing the information  will promote the welfare and interests of mankind). While FOIA requests  falling into these third and fourth categories can qualify for expedited  processing, process them in the expedited track behind the requests  qualifying for expedited processing based on ``compelling need'' (the  first two types of expedited FOIA requests).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Determine fee category of requester (commercial/educational--- noncommercial scientific institution--news media/all others) and assess  fee issues. When all assessable costs are $15.00 or less, waive fees  automatically for all categories of requesters. Assess other fee waiver  or reduction requests on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Apply fee waiver/fee reduction criteria in appropriate cases  (when requester asks for fee waiver/reduction).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Find the responsive Air Force records (if any).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Send the request to the appropriate OPRs to search for  responsive records and to decide whether to recommend release of any  responsive   records. Include a DD Form 2086, Record of Freedom of Information (FOI),  or a DD Form 2086-1, Record of Freedom of Information (FOI) Processing  Cost for Technical Data, in each request. The OPR must complete and  return the appropriate forms and statements to the FOIA office.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the OPRs find no responsive records, or if the OPRs desire  to withhold any responsive records from release to the requester, the  OPRs must provide a written certificate detailing either their  unsuccessful search, or their reasons why the documents should be  withheld from release under the FOIA; the written OPR statements must  accompany the copies of the records the OPR desires to withhold as the  FOIA action is processed (e.g., include it in any denial or appeal  file).</p><p class="depth4">Note: If any part of a FOIA request is denied, and the requester  appeals that denial, include all forms, certificates and documents  prepared by the OPRs in the FOIA appeal package required in paragraph  (d)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contacts with FOIA requesters and non-Air Force submitters of  data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of  this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contacts with the FOIA Requester. See Sec. 806.27 for samples of  language to use in various types of Air Force FOIA letters. If any part  of a FOIA request is denied, and the requester appeals that denial,  submit documents sent by Air Force elements to the requester in the FOIA  appeal package in chronological order (see paragraph (d)(5) of this  section). Letters that Air Force FOIA offices may need to send to a FOIA  requester include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An initial notification letter that the FOIA request was  received. This letter may advise the requester that processing of the  FOIA request may be delayed because:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> All or part of the requested records are not located at the  installation processing the FOIA request (see Sec. 806.29(c)(2)(ii)).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> An enormous number of records must be collected and reviewed.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Other Air Force activities or other agencies, to include (if  applicable) the nongovernment submitter of information, need to be  involved in deciding whether or not to release the records.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> If you cannot complete processing of a FOIA request within 20  workdays, advise the requester of the reasons for the delay and give a  date (within 30 workdays after receiving the request) when the requester  can expect a final decision.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The initial notification letter may advise the requester all/ part of the request was referred to another Air Force element or  government activity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The initial notification letter may advise the requester of  the appropriate fee category. In cases where fees are appropriate, and  requesters have not agreed to pay for responsive records and fees are  likely to be more than $15.00, seek assurances that the requester agrees  to pay appropriate fees. If more information is needed to make a fee  category determination, or to determine whether fees should be waived/ reduced, inform the requester. FOIA offices may determine fee waiver/ reduction requests before processing a FOIA request; if a fee waiver/ reduction request is denied, the requester may   appeal that denial; he/she may also appeal an adverse fee category  determination (e.g., asked for news media fees, but was assessed  commercial fees.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The initial notification letter may advise the requester the  request does not sufficiently describe the desired records. If possible,  help the requester identify the requested records by explaining what  kind of information would make searching for responsive records easier.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If Air Force elements can complete a FOIA request within the  statutory 20-workday processing period, you may elect to send only a  single letter to the requester, along with responsive records that are  released to the requester in full.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A letter to the requester that the responding FOIA office uses  multitrack processing due to a significant number of pending requests  that prevents a response determination from being made within 20  workdays. This letter advises the FOIA requester that track the request  is in (simple/complex); in this letter, if expedited processing was  requested, the requester is advised if the request will be expedited or  not. If the request is found to be complex, you must advise the  requester he/she may alter the FOIA request to simplify processing. If  it is determined the request will not be expedited, the requester must  be told he/she can appeal. (This may be the initial letter to the  requester, for Air Force elements with multitrack processing; if that is  the case, this letter may include sections discussed in  Sec. 806.29(c)(2)(i)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Subsequent letters to the requester on various subjects (for  example, releasing requested records; advising reasons for delays;  responding to the letters, facsimiles or calls; advising the requester  of referrals to other Air Force units or government activities; involves  a non-Air Force submitter, etc.).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> A release letter to the requester, forwarding releasable  responsive records with a bill (if appropriate).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> A ``no records'' response letter to the requester if there are  no responsive records, or, a denial letter, if any responsive records  are withheld from release. FOIA managers may sign ``no records'' or  ``requested format not available'' responses; they may also sign a  letter that advises a requester the fee category sought was not  determined to be appropriate, or that a fee waiver/fee reduction request  was disapproved, or that a request for expedited processing has been  denied. An IDA must sign any letter or document withholding responsive  records. When denying records, you must tell the requester, in writing:  the name and title or position of the official who made the denial  determination, the basis for the denial in enough detail to permit the  requester to make a decision concerning appeal, and the FOIA exemptions  on which the denial is based. The denial letter must include a brief  statement describing what the exemptions cover. When the initial denial  is based (in whole or in part) on a security classification, this  explanation should include a summary of the applicable executive order  criteria for classification, as well as an explanation of how those  criteria apply to the particular record in question. Estimate the volume  of the records denied and provide this estimate to the requester, unless  providing such an estimate would harm an interest protected by an  exemption of the FOIA. This estimate should be in number of pages or,  for records in other media, in some other reasonable form of estimation,  unless the volume is otherwise indicated through deletions on records  disclosed in part. Indicate the size and location of the redactions on  the records released. You must also tell the requester how he/she can  appeal the denial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Contacts with non-Air Force submitters of data. Before releasing  data (information or records) submitted from outside the Air Force,  determine whether you need to write to the submitter of the data for  their views on releasability of their data. In many cases, this non-Air  Force data may fall under FOIA Exemption 4. If it appears you must  contact the submitter of the data, advise the requester in writing that  you must give the submitter of the data the opportunity to comment  before the Air Force decides whether to release the information. Give  the submitter a reasonable period of time (30 calendar days) to object  to release and   provide justification for withholding the documents. If the submitter  does not respond, advise the submitter in writing that you have not  received a reply and plan to release the records. Provide the submitter  with the reasons the Air Force will release the records, and give the  submitter your expected release date (at least 2 weeks from the date of  your letter). This permits the submitter time to seek a temporary  restraining order (TRO) in federal court, if they can convince the judge  to issue such an order. See Sec. 806.27 for samples of language to use  in Air Force letters to both the FOIA requester and nongovernment  submitters. Remember to include a copy of Sec. 806.31 as an attachment  to the letter sent to the nongovernment submitter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The notice requirements of this section need not be followed if  the Air Force determines that the information should not be disclosed,  the information has been lawfully published or officially made available  to the public, or disclosure of the information is required by law.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the submitter objects to release of the records, but the Air  Force disclosure authority considers the records releasable, tell the  submitter before releasing the data. Include in the letter to the  submitter a brief explanation and a specific release date at least 2  weeks from the date of the letter. Advise the submitter once a  determination is made that release of the data is required under the  FOIA, failure to oppose the proposed release will lead to release of  submitted data. Also advise the requester such a release under the FOIA  will result in the released information entering the public domain, and  that subsequent requests for the same information will be answered  without any formal coordination between the Air Force and the submitter,  unless the information is later amended, changed, or modified. A person  equal to, or higher in rank than, the denial authority makes the final  decision to disclose responsive records over the submitter's objection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When a previously released contract document has been  modified, any contract documents not in existence at the time of an  earlier FOIA request that are responsive to a later FOIA request for the  same contract, will be processed as a first-time FOIA request for those  newly created documents. Notify the nongovernment submitter of the  pending FOIA action, and give them the same opportunity to respond as is  detailed above. Passage of a significant period of time since the prior  FOIA release can also require Air Force elements to comply with the  notice requirements in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Denying all or part of a request. When responsive records are  withheld from release (denied), the appropriate offices must prepare a  denial package for the IDA. Air Force elements must send the request,  related documents, and responsive records through their IDA's FOIA  office to the IDA for a decision. The denial package must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The FOIA request and any modifications by the requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A copy of the responsive records, including both records that  may be released and records recommended for denial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Written recommendations from the OPRs and an Air Force attorney.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The exemptions cited and a discussion of how the records qualify  for withholding under the FOIA. This discussion should also include the  reasons for denial: to deny release of responsive records requested  under the FOIA, you must determine that disclosure of the records would  result in a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by a FOIA  exemption (or exemptions), that the record is exempt from release under  one or more of the exemptions of the FOIA, and that a discretionary  release is not appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any collateral documents that relate to the requested records.  For example:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the requested records came from a non-Air Force or non-U.S.  Federal Government submitter, include any documents from the submitter  that relate to the release or denial of the requested records. If you  are not sure whether or not the non-Air Force or non-U.S. Federal  Government submitted information is potentially exempt from release  under the FOIA, contact an Air Force attorney. FOIA Exemptions 3, 4, 5,  6, and 7 may apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the requested records came from Privacy Act systems of  records,   include a written discussion of any Privacy Act issues.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If any requested records came from another Air Force element,  or release of the requested records would affect another Air Force  element, FOIA offices should coordinate with that other element. If the  FOIA request is not completely referred to the other element, include  documents from that element.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If any requested records are classified, include a written  certification from a classification authority or declassification  authority stating the data was properly classified originally, that it  remains properly classified (per E.O. 12958), and, if applicable, that  no reasonably segregable portions can be released.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> FOIA appeal actions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an IDA, or a FOIA office responding on behalf of an IDA,  withholds a record from release because they determine the record is  exempt under one or more of the exemptions to the FOIA, the requester  may appeal that decision, in writing, to the Secretary of the Air Force.  The appeal should be accompanied by a copy of the denial letter. FOIA  appeals should be postmarked within 60 calendar days after the date of  the denial letter, and should contain the reasons the requester  disagrees with the initial denial. Late appeals may be rejected, either  by the element initially processing the FOIA appeal, or by subsequent  denial authorities, if the requester does not provide adequate  justification for the delay. Appeal procedures also apply to the denial  of a fee category claim by a requester, denial of a request for waiver  or reduction of fees, disputes regarding fee estimates, review on an  expedited basis of a determination not to grant expedited access to  agency records, and for ``no record'' or ``requested format not  available'' determinations when the requester considers such responses  adverse in nature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Coordinate appeals with an Air Force attorney (and the OPR, if  appropriate) so they can consider factual and legal arguments raised in  the appeal, and can prepare written assessments of issues raised in the  appeal to assist the IDA in considering the appeal. MAJCOM FOIA offices  and 11 CS/SCSR (for OPRs at HQ USAF and SAF), send all appeals to the  Secretary of the Air Force through AFLSA/JACL for consideration, unless  the IDA has reconsidered the initial denial action, and granted the  appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a requester appeals a ``no records'' determination,  organizations must search again or verify the adequacy of their first  search (for example, if a second search would be fruitless, the  organization may include a signed statement from either the records OPR  or the MAJCOM FOIA manager detailing why another search was not  practical). The appeal package must include documents (to include a  certification from the records OPR) that show how the organization tried  to find responsive records. In the event a requester sues the Air Force  to contest a determination that no responsive records exist, formal  affidavits will be required to support the adequacy of any searches  conducted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> General administrative matters. FOIA requesters may ultimately  sue the Air Force in federal court if they are dissatisfied with adverse  determinations. In these suits, the contents of the administrative  appeal file are evaluated to determine whether the Air Force complied  with the FOIA and its own guidance. Improper or inadequate appeal files  make defending these cases problematic. Include all the documents  related to the requester's FOIA action in the appeal file. If appeal  file documents are sensitive, or are classified up to the SECRET level,  send them separately to AFLSA/JACL, 1501 Wilson Boulevard, 7th Floor,  Arlington, VA 22209-2403. Make separate arrangements with AFLSA/JACL for  processing classified appeal file documents TOP SECRET or higher. Cover  letters on appeal packages need to list all attachments. If a FOIA  action is complicated, a chronology of events helps reviewers understand  what happened in the course of the request and appeal. If an appeal file  does not include documentation described below, include a blank sheet in  proper place and mark as ``not applicable,'' ``N/A,'' or ``not used.''  Do not renumber and move the other items up. If any part of   the requester's appeal is denied, the appeal package must include a  signed statement by the IDA, demonstrating the IDA considered and  rejected the requester's arguments, and the basis for that decision.  This may be a separate memorandum, an endorsement on a legal opinion or  OPR opinion, or the cover letter which forwards the appeal for final  determination. Include in the cover letter forwarding the appeal to the  Secretary of the Air Force the name, phone number and e-mail address (if  any) of the person to contact about the appeal. The order and contents  of appeal file attachments follow.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The original appeal letter and envelope.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The initial FOIA request, any modifications of the request by  the requester or any other communications from the requester, in  chronological order.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The denial letter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Copies of all records already released. (An index of released  documents may be helpful, if there are a number of items. If the records  released are ``massive'' (which means ``several cubic feet'') and AFLSA/ JACL agrees, an index or description of the records may be provided in  place of the released records. Do not send appeal files without copies  of released records without the express agreement of AFLSA/JACL. Usually  AFLSA/JACL requires all the released records in appeal files. If you do  not send the released records to AFLSA/JACL when a FOIA requester has  appealed a partial denial, retain a copy of what was released for 6  years.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Copies of all administrative processing documents, including  extension letters, search descriptions, and initial OPR recommendations  about the request, in chronological order.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Copies of the denied records or portions marked to show what  was withheld. If your organization uses a single set of highlighted  records (to show items redacted from records released to the requester),  ensure the records are legible and insert a page in the appropriate  place stating where the records are located. (An index of denied  documents may be helpful, if there are a number of items. If the records  denied are ``massive'' (which means ``several cubic feet'') and AFLSA/ JACL agrees, an index or description of the records may be provided in  place of the denied records. Do not send appeal files without copies of  denied records without the express agreement of AFLSA/JACL. Usually  AFLSA/JACL requires all the denied records in appeal files. If you do  not send the denied records to AFLSA/JACL, when a FOIA requester has  appealed a denial, retain a copy of what was denied for 6 years.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> All legal opinions in chronological order. Include a point-by- point discussion of factual and legal arguments in the requester's  appeal (prepared by an Air Force attorney and/or the OPR). If the IDA  does not state in the cover letter he/she signed, that he/she considered  and rejected the requester's arguments, asserting the basis for that  decision (e.g., the IDA concurs in the legal and/or OPR assessments of  the requester's arguments) include a signed, written statement  containing the same information from the IDA, either as a separate  document or an endorsement to a legal or OPR assessment. Include any  explanation of the decision-making process for intra-agency documents  denied under the deliberative process privilege and how the denied  material fits into that process (if applicable).</p>
