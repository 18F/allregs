                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Outfalls and discharge points. All permit effluent limitations,  standards and prohibitions shall be established for each outfall or  discharge point of the permitted facility, except as otherwise provided  under Sec. 122.44(k) (BMPs where limitations are infeasible) and  paragraph (i) of this section (limitations on internal waste streams).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Production-based limitations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of POTWs, permit  effluent limitations, standards, or prohibitions shall be calculated  based on design flow.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except in the case of POTWs or as provided in paragraph  (b)(2)(ii) of this section, calculation of any permit limitations,  standards, or prohibitions which are based on production (or other  measure of operation) shall be based not upon the designed production  capacity but rather upon a reasonable measure of actual production of  the facility. For new sources or new dischargers, actual production  shall be estimated using projected production. The time period of the  measure of production shall correspond to the time period of the  calculated permit limitations; for example, monthly production shall be  used to calculate average monthly discharge limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)(1)</em> The Director may include a condition establishing  alternate permit limitations, standards, or prohibitions based upon  anticipated increased (not to exceed maximum production capability) or  decreased production levels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> of this section, is substantially below maximum production  capability and that there is a reasonable potential for an increase  above actual production during the duration of the permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the Director establishes permit conditions under paragraph  (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The permit shall require the permittee to notify the Director at  least two business days prior to a month in which the permittee expects  to operate at a level higher than the lowest production level identified  in the permit. The notice shall specify the anticipated level and the  period during which the permittee expects to operate at the alternate  level. If the notice covers more than one month, the notice shall  specify the reasons for the anticipated production level increase. New  notice of discharge at alternate levels is required to cover a period or  production level not covered by prior notice or, if during two  consecutive months otherwise covered by a notice, the production level  at the permitted facility does not in fact meet the higher level  designated in the notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(ii)(B)(1)</em> of this section, in which case the permittee  shall comply with the lower of the actual level of production during  each month or the level specified in the notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The permittee shall submit with the DMR the level of production  that actually occurred during each month and the limitations, standards,  or prohibitions applicable to that level of production.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Metals. All permit effluent limitations, standards, or  prohibitions for a metal shall be expressed in terms of ``total  recoverable metal'' as defined in 40 CFR part 136 unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An applicable effluent standard or limitation has been  promulgated under the CWA and specifies the limitation for the metal in  the dissolved or valent or total form; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In establishing permit limitations on a case-by-case basis under  Sec. 125.3, it is necessary to express the limitation on the metal in  the dissolved or valent or total form to carry out the provisions of the  CWA; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All approved analytical methods for the metal inherently measure  only its dissolved form (e.g., hexavalent chromium).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Continuous discharges. For continuous discharges all permit  effluent limitations, standards, and prohibitions, including those  necessary to achieve water quality standards, shall unless impracticable  be stated as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Maximum daily and average monthly discharge limitations for all  dischargers other than publicly owned treatment works; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Average weekly and average monthly discharge limitations for  POTWs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Non-continuous discharges. Discharges which are not continuous,  as defined in Sec. 122.2, shall be particularly described and limited,  considering the following factors, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Frequency (for example, a batch discharge shall not occur more  than once every 3 weeks);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Total mass (for example, not to exceed 100 kilograms of zinc and  200 kilograms of chromium per batch discharge);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Maximum rate of discharge of pollutants during the discharge  (for example, not to exceed 2 kilograms of zinc per minute); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Prohibition or limitation of specified pollutants by mass,  concentration, or other appropriate measure (for example, shall not  contain at any time more than 0.1 mg/1 zinc or more than 250 grams (\1/ 4\ kilogram) of zinc in any discharge).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Mass limitations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All pollutants limited in permits shall  have limitations, standards or prohibitions expressed in terms of mass  except:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For pH, temperature, radiation, or other pollutants which cannot  appropriately be expressed by mass;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When applicable standards and limitations are expressed in  terms of other units of measurement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If in establishing permit limitations on a case-by-case basis  under Sec. 125.3, limitations expressed in terms of mass are infeasible  because the mass of the pollutant discharged cannot be related to a  measure of operation (for example, discharges of TSS from certain mining  operations), and permit conditions ensure that dilution will not be used  as a substitute for treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pollutants limited in terms of mass additionally may be limited  in terms of other units of measurement, and the permit shall require the  permittee to comply with both limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Pollutants in intake water. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Upon request of the discharger,  technology-based effluent limitations or standards shall be adjusted to  reflect credit for pollutants in the discharger's intake water if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The applicable effluent limitations and standards contained in  40 CFR subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be applied on a  net basis; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The discharger demonstrates that the control system it proposes  or uses to meet applicable technology-based limitations and standards  would, if properly installed and operated, meet the limitations and  standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand  (BOD) or total suspended solids (TSS) should not be granted unless the  permittee demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in  the effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the  generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional  limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or  elsewhere.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the  applicable limitation or standard, up to a maximum value equal to the  influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine  eligibility for credits and compliance with permit limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Credit shall be granted only if the discharger demonstrates that  the intake water is drawn from the same body of water into which the  discharge is made. The Director may waive this requirement if he finds  that no environmental degradation will result.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> This section does not apply to the discharge of raw water  clarifier sludge generated from the treatment of intake water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Internal waste streams. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When permit effluent limitations or  standards imposed at the point of discharge are impractical or  infeasible, effluent limitations or standards for discharges of  pollutants may be imposed on internal waste streams before mixing with  other waste streams or cooling water streams. In those instances, the  monitoring required by Sec. 122.48 shall also be applied to the  internal waste streams.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limits on internal waste streams will be imposed only when the  fact sheet under Sec. 124.56 sets forth the exceptional circumstances  which make such limitations necessary, such as when the final discharge  point is inaccessible (for example, under 10 meters of water), the  wastes at the point of discharge are so diluted as to make monitoring  impracticable, or the interferences among pollutants at the point of  discharge would make detection or analysis impracticable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Disposal of pollutants into wells, into POTWs or by land  application. Permit limitations and standards shall be calculated as  provided in Sec. 122.50.
