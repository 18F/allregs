                                Sec. 740.18  Agricultural commodities (AGR).
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility requirements. License Exception AGR permits the  export of agricultural commodities to Cuba, as well as the reexport of  U.S. origin agricultural commodities to Cuba, provided your transaction  meets all of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The commodity meets the definition of ``agricultural  commodities'' in part 772 of the EAR;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The commodity is EAR99. You must have an official commodity  classification of EAR99 from BIS for fertilizers, western red cedar and  live horses before you submit a notification under this license  exception. See Sec. 748.3   of the EAR for information on how to submit a commodity classification  request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The export or reexport is made pursuant to a written contract,  except for donations and commercial samples which are not subject to  this contract requirement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The export or reexport is made within 12 months of the signing  of the contract or within 12 months of notification that no objections  were raised (if no contract is required). In the case of multiple  partial shipments, all such shipments must be made within the 12 months  of the signing of the contract or within 12 months of notification that  no objections were raised (if no contract is required); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You notify BIS prior to exporting or reexporting according to  the procedures set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. If you intend  to engage in multiple shipments during the one-year period after the  signing of the contract, you need only notify BIS prior to the first  shipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Restrictions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No export or reexport to any individual or  entity designated as a Specially Designated Terrorist or Foreign  Terrorist Organization may be made under License Exception AGR (see part  744 of the EAR).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No export or reexport to or for use in biological, chemical,  nuclear warfare or missile proliferation activities may be made under  License Exception AGR (see part 744 of the EAR).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No U.S.-owned or controlled foreign firm may export from abroad  to Cuba a foreign produced agricultural commodity containing more than  10% U.S.-origin content. Such U.S.-owned or controlled foreign firms  require a specific license from BIS as well as the Department of the  Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Transactions not  subject to the EAR (under 10% U.S.-origin content) require a license  from OFAC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prior notification--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General requirement. You must notify BIS  prior to any export or reexport (or prior to the first of multiple  shipments) under License Exception AGR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedures. You must provide prior notification of exports and  reexports under License Exception AGR by submitting a completed  application in accordance with Sec. 748.1 of the EAR. The following  blocks must be completed, as appropriate: Blocks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (by  marking box 5 ``Other''), 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22 (a), (e), (f), (g),  (h), (i), (j), 23, and 25 according to the instructions described in  Supplement No. 1 to part 748 of the EAR. If your commodity is  fertilizer, western red cedar or live horses, you must confirm that BIS  has previously classified your commodity as EAR99 by placing the  Commodity Classification Automatic Tracking System (CCATS) number in  Block 22(d). BIS will not initiate the registration of an AGR  notification unless the application is complete.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Action by BIS. Within two business days of the registration of  the AGR notification, BIS will refer the notification for interagency  review, or if necessary return the notification without action (e.g., if  the information provided is incomplete). Registration is defined as the  point at which the notification is entered into BIS's electronic system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Review by other departments or agencies. The Departments of  Defense, State, and other agencies, as appropriate, may review the AGR  notification. BIS must receive department or agency objections within  nine business days of the referral. Unlike the provisions described in  Sec. 750.4(b) of the EAR, there are no provisions for stopping the  processing time of the AGR notification. If, within 11 business days  after the date of registration, any reviewing agency provides a written  objection that the recipient may promote international terrorism or the  transaction raises nonproliferation concerns, you may not use License  Exception AGR. In such cases, BIS will notify you that a license is  required for the export or reexport. BIS will then process the AGR  notification as a license application in accordance with the provisions  described in Sec. 750.4 of the EAR, and the licensing policies set  forth in the EAR. At this time, BIS may request additional information.  When BIS confirms that no agency has raised an objection within eleven  business days (as described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section), you  may proceed with the transaction provided that you satisfy all   other requirements of License Exception AGR, including the requirement  to have a written contract prior to any shipment (unless a donation or  commercial sample). (Note that the fact that you have been advised that  no agency has objected to the transaction does not exempt you from other  licensing requirements under the EAR, such as those based on knowledge  of a prohibited end-use or end-user as referenced in general prohibition  five (part 736 of the EAR) and set forth in part 744 of the EAR.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Status of pending AGR notification requests. You must contact  BIS's System for Tracking Export License Applications (STELA) (https:// snapr.bis.doc.gov /stela) for status of your pending AGR notification or  verify the status in BIS's Simplified Network Applications Processing  Redesign (SNAP-R) System. STELA will provide the date of registration of  the AGR notification. If no department or agency objection is raised  within 11 business days, STELA will, on the twelfth business day  following the date of registration, provide you with confirmation of  that fact. You may not proceed with your shipment unless you confirm  with either STELA or SNAP-R that no objection has been raised. If an  objection is raised, STELA and SNAP-R will indicate that a license is  required. The AGR notification will then be processed as a license  application. In addition, BIS may provide notice of an objection by  telephone, fax, courier service, or other means.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Donations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Donations of agricultural commodities are  eligible for export and reexport to Cuba under License Exception AGR,  provided the transaction meets the requirements and procedures of this  license exception (except the written contract requirement).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Donations of food items to non-governmental organizations (NGOs)  and individuals in Cuba may also be eligible for License Exception GFT.  See Sec. 740.12 for eligibility requirements of gift parcels and  humanitarian donations under License Exception GFT.
