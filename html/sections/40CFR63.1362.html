Alternatively, for a process that has been operating for less than 3 years but more than 1 year, the baseline factor may be calculated for the time period from startup of the process until the present. For any reduction in the HAP factor achieved by reducing a HAP that is also a VOC, an equivalent reduction in the production-indexed VOC consumption factor (VOC factor) is also required (the equivalence is determined on a mass basis, not a percentage basis). For any reduction in the HAP factor that is achieved by reducing a HAP that is not a VOC, the VOC factor may not be increased.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> As an alternative to the provisions in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the owner or operator may combine pollution prevention with emissions control as specified in paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The HAP factor shall be reduced as specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section except that a reduction of at least 50 percent shall apply for the purposes of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The total annual HAP emissions from the PAI process unit shall be reduced by an amount that, when divided by the annual production rate and added to the reduction of the HAP factor yields a value of at least 85 percent of the baseline HAP factor. The total annual VOC emissions from the process unit must be reduced by an amount equivalent to the reduction in HAP emissions for each HAP that is a VOC (the equivalence is determined on a mass basis). For HAP emissions reductions that are achieved by reducing a HAP that is not a VOC, the total annual VOC emissions may not be increased. The reduction in HAP air emissions must be achieved using one of the following control devices:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Combustion control devices such as incinerators, flares, or process heaters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Control devices such as condensers and carbon adsorbers whose recovered product is destroyed or shipped offsite for destruction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any control device that does not ultimately allow for recycling of material back to the PAI process unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Any control device for which the owner or operator can demonstrate that the use of the device in controlling HAP emissions will have no effect on the HAP factor for the PAI process unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Emissions averaging provisions. Except as provided in paragraphs (h)(1) through (7) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing affected facility may choose to comply with the emission standards in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section by using emissions averaging procedures specified in Sec.  63.1365(h) for organic HAP emissions from any storage vessel, process, or waste management unit

that is part of an affected source subject to this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A State may restrict the owner or operator of an existing source to use only the procedures in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section to comply with the emission standards where State authorities prohibit averaging of HAP emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Group 1 emission points that are controlled as specified in paragraphs (h)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section may not be used to calculate emissions averaging credits, unless the equipment is approved for use in a different manner from that specified in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, and a nominal efficiency has been assigned according to the procedures in Sec.  63.150(i). The nominal efficiency must exceed the percent reduction required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section for process vents and storage vessels, respectively, exceed the percent reduction required in Sec.  63.139(c) for control devices used to control emissions vented from waste management units, and exceed the percent reduction required in Sec.  63.138(e) or (f) for wastewater treatment processes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Storage vessels controlled with an internal floating roof meeting the specifications of Sec.  63.119(b), an external floating roof meeting the specifications of Sec.  63.119(c), or an external floating roof converted to an internal floating meeting the specifications of Sec.  63.119(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Emission points controlled with a flare.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Wastewater streams that are managed in waste management units that are controlled as specified in Sec.

Sec.  63.133 through 63.137 may not be included in any averaging group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Processes which have been permanently shut down and storage vessels permanently taken out of HAP service may not be included in any averaging group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Emission points already controlled on or before November 15, 1990 may not be used to generate emissions averaging credits, unless the level of control has been increased after November 15, 1990. In these cases, credit will be allowed only for the increase in control after November 15, 1990.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Emission points controlled to comply with a State or Federal rule other than this subpart may not be included in an emissions averaging group, unless the level of control has been increased after November 15, 1990, above what is required by the other State or Federal rule. Only the control above what is required by the other State or Federal rule will be credited. However, if an emission point has been used to generate emissions averaging credit in an approved emissions average, and the point is subsequently made subject to a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, the point can continue to generate emissions averaging credit for the purpose of complying with the previously approved average.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Opening of a safety device. The owner or operator that opens a safety device, as defined in Sec.  63.1361, is not exempt from applicable standards in order to avoid unsafe conditions. If opening a safety device results in the failure to meet any applicable standard, the owner or operator must still comply with the general duty to minimize emissions. If opening a safety device results in a deviation or excess emissions, such events must be reported as specified in Sec.  63.1368(i). If the owner or operator attributes the event to a malfunction and intends to assert an affirmative defense, the owner or operator is subject to Sec.  63.1360(k).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Closed-vent systems. The owner or operator of a closed-vent system that

contains bypass lines that could divert a vent stream away from a control device used to comply with the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section shall comply with the requirements of Table 3 of this subpart and paragraph (j)(1) or (2) of this section.
