                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Interstate movement. For interstate movements of plant pests a  label shall be attached to each parcel containing the pests as evidence  that the movement of the plant pests is authorized. Such label shall  also disclose the contents of the parcel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Movement into or through the United States from places outside  thereof by mail or cargo. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a permit authorizing the movement of  plant pests into the United States from any place outside thereof is  issued to an applicant under this part, it will be accompanied by  distinctive labels, with instructions for their use by the foreign  shipper. Such labels will be issued in quantity sufficient to permit  attaching one to each parcel to be moved. The labels will direct the  parcels to specified inspection stations of the Plant Protection and  Quarantine Programs, or other designated points, for clearance. The  stations will be notified by the Deputy Administrator in advance of the  expected arrival of the plant pests. Plant pests so moved by mail may be  refused entry unless the containers thereof bear such labels. Cargo  shipments of plant pests so moved may be refused entry unless they bear  such labels or are otherwise plainly marked to identify the contents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any labelling requirements with respect to the movement of plant  pests through the United States will be included in shipping  instructions issued as conditions of the permits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Misuse of labels. No labels unused in accordance with the terms  of the permit may be used for the movement of any other plant pest. The  Plant Protection Act provides for a penalty \2\ for the misuse of such  labels. Any unauthorized movement of plant pests under a label will be  refused by the inspector, and the plant pests may be destroyed or  otherwise dealt with as set forth in Sec. 330.106 if deemed necessary  as an emergency measure. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\2\ Section 424 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7734) provides  that persons who violate this act, or who forge, counterfeit or--without  authority from the Secretary--use, alter, deface, or destroy any  certificate, permit or other document may, after notice and opportunity  for a hearing, be assessed a civil penalty that does not exceed the  greater of: (a) $50,000 for individuals, except that the civil penalty  may not exceed $1,000 in the case of an initial violation by an  individual moving regulated articles not for monetary gain; $250,000 for  any other person or legal entity, such as partnerships, corporations,  associations, or joint ventures; and $500,000 for all violations  adjudicated in a single proceeding; or (b) twice the gross pecuniary  gain derived from or loss caused by any violation, forgery,  counterfeiting, unauthorized use, defacing, or destruction of a  certificate, permit, or other document provided for by this act. Section  424 of the Plant Protection Act also provides penalties for criminal  violations, under which knowing violators of the act may be found guilty  of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, fined in accordance with title 18  of the United States Code, imprisoned for a period not to exceed 1 year,  or both.
