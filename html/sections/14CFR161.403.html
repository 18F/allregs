                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A request for reevaluation must be submitted by an aircraft  operator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An aircraft operator must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the  FAA that there has been a change in the noise environment of the  affected airport and that a review and reevaluation pursuant to the  criteria in Sec. 161.305 is therefore justified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(ii)</em>. The change in the noise environment or in  the noncompatible land uses may be either an increase or decrease in  noise or in noncompatible land uses. An aircraft operator may submit to  the FAA reasons why a change that does not fall within either of these  parameters justifies reevaluation, and the FAA will consider such  arguments on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A change in the noise environment justifies reevaluation if the  change is likely to result in the restriction not meeting one or more of  the conditions for approval set forth in Sec. 161.305 of this part for  approval. The aircraft operator must demonstrate that such a result is  likely to occur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A reevaluation may not occur less than 2 years after the date of  the FAA approval. The FAA will normally apply the same 2-year  requirement to agreements under subpart B of this part that affect Stage  3 aircraft operations. An aircraft operator may submit to the FAA  reasons why an agreement under subpart B of this part should be  reevaluated in less than 2 years, and the FAA will consider such  arguments on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An aircraft operator must demonstrate that it has made a good  faith attempt to resolve locally any dispute over a restriction with the  affected parties, including the airport operator, before requesting  reevaluation by the FAA. Such demonstration and certification shall  document all attempts of local dispute resolution.  [Doc. No. 26432, 56 FR 48698, Sept. 25, 1991; 56 FR 51258, Oct. 10,  1991]</p>
