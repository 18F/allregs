                            <p class="depth0">The Board has received numerous inquiries from member banks relating  to the repeal of the ban on ownership of gold by United States citizens.  Listed below are questions and answers which affect member banks and  relate to the responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> May gold in the form of coins or bullion be counted as vault  cash in order to satisfy reserve requirements? No. Section 19(c) of the  Federal Reserve Act requires that reserve balances be satisfied either  by a balance maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank or by vault cash,  consisting of United States currency and coin. Gold in bullion form is  not United States currency. Since the bullion value of United States  gold coins far exceeds their face value, member banks would not in  practice distribute them over the counter at face value to satisfy  customer demands.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Will the Federal Reserve Banks perform services for member banks  with respect to gold, such as safekeeping or assaying? No.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Will a Federal Reserve Bank accept gold as collateral for an  advance to a member bank under section 10(b) of the Federal Reserve Act?  No.  [39 FR 45254, Dec. 31, 1974]</p><p class="depth2">Interpretations of Section 32 of the Glass-Steagall Act</p>
