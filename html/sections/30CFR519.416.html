Except that, for the State of Louisiana, proxy coastline lengths for coastal political subdivisions without a coastline will be considered to be \1/3\ the average length of the coastline of all political subdivisions within Louisiana having a coastline.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fifty percent of the revenues will be allocated to a Gulf producing State's coastal political subdivisions in amounts that are inversely proportional to the respective distances between the geographic center of each applicable leased tract and the point in each coastal political subdivision that is closest to the geographic center of each applicable leased tract. Except that, an applicable leased tract will be excluded from this calculation if any portion of the tract is located in a geographic area that was subject to a leasing moratorium on January 1, 2005, unless that tract was in production on that date.</p>
