The record shall be kept in such manner as to permit  comparison with the records required to be kept by other persons for the  same lot of seed so that the origin, treatment, germination, and purity  (including variety) of agricultural seed and the treatment, germination  and variety of vegetable seed may be traced from the grower to the  ultimate consumer and so that the lot of seed may be correctly labeled.  The record shall be accessible for inspection by the authorized agents  of the Secretary for purposes of the effective administration of the act  at any time during customary business hours.
