Appendix A toSec. 1910.1029--Coke Oven Emissions Substance Information</p><p class="depth0">Sheet</p><p class="depth0">i. Substance Identification</p><p class="depth0">A. Substance: Coke Oven Emissions</p><p class="depth0">B. Definition: The benzene-soluble fraction of total particulate  matter present during the destructive distillation or carbonization of  coal for the production of coke.</p><p class="depth0">C. Permissible Exposure Limit: 150 micrograms per cubic meter of air  determined as an average over an 8-hour period.</p><p class="depth0">D. Regulated areas: Only employees authorized by your employer  should enter a regulated area. The employer is required to designate the  following areas as regulated areas: the coke oven battery, including  topside and its machinery, pushside and its machinery, cokeside and its  machinery, and the battery ends; the screening station; and the wharf;  and the beehive ovens and their machinery.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Health Hazard Data</p><p class="depth0">Exposure to coke oven emissions is a cause of lung cancer, and  kidney cancer, in humans. Although there have not been an excess number  of skin cancer cases in humans, repeated skin contact with coke oven  emissions should be avoided.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Protective Clothing and Equipment</p><p class="depth0">A. Respirators: Respirators will be provided by your employer for  routine use if your employer is in the process of implementing  engineering and work practice controls or where engineering and work  practice controls are not feasible or insufficient to reduce exposure to  or below the PEL. You must wear respirators for non-routine activities  or in emergency situations where you are likely to be exposed to levels  of coke oven emissions in excess of the permissible exposure limit.  Until January 20, 1978, the routine wearing of respirators is voluntary.  Until that date, if you choose not to wear a respirator you do not have  to do so. You must still have your respirator with you and you must  still wear it if you are near visible emissions. Since how well your  respirator fits your face is very important, your employer is required  to conduct fit tests to make sure the respirator seals properly when you  wear it. These tests are simple and rapid and will be explained to you  during your training sessions.</p><p class="depth0">B. Protective clothing: Your employer is required to provide, and  you must wear, appropriate, clean, protective clothing and equipment to  protect your body from repeated skin contact with coke oven emissions  and from the heat generated during the coking process. This clothing  should include such items as jacket and pants and flame resistant  gloves. Protective equipment should include face shield or vented  goggles, protective helmets and safety shoes, insulated from hot  surfaces where appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Hygiene Facilities and Practices</p><p class="depth0">You must not eat, drink, smoke, chew gum or tobacco, or apply  cosmetics in the regulated area, except that drinking water is  permitted. Your employer is required to provide lunchrooms and other  areas for these purposes.</p><p class="depth0">Your employer is required to provide showers, washing facilities,  and change rooms. If you work in a regulated area, you must wash your  face, and hands before eating. You must shower at the end of the work  shift. Do not take used protective clothing out of the change rooms  without your employer's permission. Your employer is required to provide  for laundering or cleaning of your protective clothing.</p><p class="depth0">v. Signs and Labels</p><p class="depth0">Your employer is required to post warning signs and labels for your  protection. Signs must be posted in regulated areas. The signs must warn  that a cancer hazard is present, that only authorized employees may  enter the area, and that no smoking or eating is allowed. In regulated  areas where coke oven emissions are above the permissible exposure  limit, the signs should also warn that respirators must be worn.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Medical Examinations</p><p class="depth0">If you work in a regulated area at least 30 days per year, your  employer is required to provide you with a medical examination every  year. The medical examination must   include a medical history, a chest x-ray, pulmonary function test,  weight comparison, skin examination, a urinalysis, and a urine cytology  exam for early detection of urinary cancer. The urine cytology exam is  only included in the initial exam until you are either 45 years or  older, or have 5 or more years employment in the regulated areas when  the medical exams including this test, but excepting the x-ray exam, are  to be given every six months; under these conditions, you are to be  given an x-ray exam at least once a year. The examining physician will  provide a written opinion to your employer containing the results of the  medical exams. You should also receive a copy of this opinion.</p><p class="depth0">vii. Observation of Monitoring</p><p class="depth0">Your employer is required to monitor your exposure to coke oven  emissions and you are entitled to observe the monitoring procedure. You  are entitled to receive an explanation of the measurement procedure,  observe the steps taken in the measurement procedure, and to record the  results obtained. When the monitoring procedure is taking place in an  area where respirators or personal protective clothing and equipment are  required to be worn, you must also be provided with and must wear the  protective clothing and equipment.</p><p class="depth0">viii. Access to Records</p><p class="depth0">You or your representative are entitled to records of your exposure  to coke oven emissions upon request to your employer. Your medical  examination records can be furnished to your physician upon request to  your employer.</p><p class="depth0">ix. Training and Education</p><p class="depth0">Additional information on all of these items plus training as to  hazards of coke oven emissions and the engineering and work practice  controls associated with your job will also be provided by your  employer.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix B toSec. 1910.1029--Industrial Hygiene and Medical</p><p class="depth0">Surveillance Guidelines</p><p class="depth0">i. industrial hygiene guidelines</p><p class="depth0">A. Sampling (Benzene-Soluble Fraction Total Particulate Matter).</p><p class="depth0">Samples collected should be full shift (at least 7-hour) samples.  Sampling should be done using a personal sampling pump with pulsation  damper at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. Samples should be  collected on 0.8 micrometer pore size silver membrane filters (37 mm  diameter) preceded by Gelman glass fiber type A-E filters encased in  three-piece plastic (polystyrene) field monitor cassettes. The cassette  face cap should be on and the plug removed. The rotameter should be  checked every hour to ensure that proper flow rates are maintained.</p><p class="depth0">A minimum of three full-shift samples should be collected for each  job classification on each battery, at least one from each shift. If  disparate results are obtained for particular job classification,  sampling should be repeated. It is advisable to sample each shift on  more than one day to account for environmental variables (wind,  precipitation, etc.) which may affect sampling. Differences in exposures  among different work shifts may indicate a need to improve work  practices on a particular shift. Sampling results from different shifts  for each job classification should not be averaged. Multiple samples  from same shift on each battery may be used to calculate an average  exposure for a particular job classification.</p><p class="depth0">B. Analysis.</p><p class="depth0">1. All extraction glassware is cleaned with dichromic acid cleaning  solution, rinsed with tap water, then dionized water, acetone, and  allowed to dry completely.

Pipet 0.5 ml into the Teflon cup and evaporate to dryness in a  vacuum oven at 40 [deg]C for 3 hours.</p><p class="depth0">10. Weigh the Teflon cup and the weight gain is due to the benzene  soluble residue in half the Sample.</p><p class="depth0">ii. medical surveillance guidelines</p><p class="depth0">A. General. The minimum requirements for the medical examination for  coke oven workers are given in paragraph (j) of the standard. The  initial examination is to be provided to all coke oven workers who work  at least 30 days in the regulated area. The examination includes a  14 x 17 posterior-anterior chest x-ray reading,  pulmonary function tests (FVC and FEV 1.0), weight, urinalysis, skin  examination, and a urinary cytologic examination. These tests are needed  to serve as the baseline for comparing the employee's future test  results. Periodic exams include all the elements of the initial   exam, except that the urine cytologic test is to be performed only on  those employees who are 45 years or older or who have worked for 5 or  more years in the regulated area; periodic exams, with the exception of  x-rays, are to be performed semiannually for this group instead of  annually; for this group, x-rays will continue to be given at least  annually. The examination contents are minimum requirements; additional  tests such as lateral and oblique x-rays or additional pulmonary  function tests may be performed if deemed necessary.</p><p class="depth0">B. Pulmonary function tests.</p><p class="depth0">Pulmonary function tests should be performed in a manner which  minimizes subject and operator bias. There has been shown to be learning  effects with regard to the results obtained from certain tests, such as  FEV 1.0. Best results can be obtained by multiple trials for each  subject. The best of three trials or the average of the last three of  five trials may be used in obtaining reliable results. The type of  equipment used (manufacturer, model, etc.) should be recorded with the  results as reliability and accuracy varies and such information may be  important in the evaluation of test results. Care should be exercised to  obtain the best possible testing equipment.
