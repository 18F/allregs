                                Sec. 1.871-12  Determination of tax on treaty income.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> or 882(b) upon which the tax is limited by an income tax  convention to which the United States is a party. Income for such  purposes does not include income of any kind which is exempt from tax  under the provisions of an income tax convention to which the United  States is a party. See Sec. Sec. 1.872-2(c) and 1.883-1(b). This  section shall not apply to a nonresident alien individual who is a bona  fide resident of Puerto Rico during the entire taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definition of treaty and nontreaty income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  For purposes of this section the term ``treaty income'' shall be  construed to mean the gross income of a nonresident alien individual or  foreign corporation, as the case may be, the tax on which is limited by  a tax convention. The term ``non-treaty income'' shall be construed, for  such purposes, to mean the gross income of the nonresident alien  individual or foreign corporation other than the treaty income. Neither  term includes income of any kind which is exempt from the tax imposed by  chapter 1 of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In determining either the treaty or nontreaty income the gross  income shall be determined in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.872-1 and  1.872-2, or with Sec. Sec. 1.882-3 and 1.883-1, except that in  determining the treaty income the exclusion granted by section 116(a)  for dividends shall not be taken into account. Thus, for example, treaty  income includes the total amount of dividends paid by a domestic  corporation not disqualified by section 116(b) and received from sources  within the United States if, in accordance with a tax convention, the  dividends are subject to the income tax at a rate not to exceed 15  percent but does not include interest which, in accordance with a tax  convention, is exempt from the income tax. In further illustration,  neither the treaty nor the nontreaty income includes interest on certain  governmental obligations which by reason of section 103 is excluded from  gross income, or interest which by reason of a tax convention is exempt  from the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of applying any income tax convention to which  the United States is a party, original issue discount which is subject  to tax under section 871(a)(1)(C) or 881(a)(3) is to be treated as  interest, and gains which are subject to tax under section 871(a)(1)(D)  or 881(a)(4) are to be treated as royalty income. This subdivision shall  not apply, however, where its application would be contrary to any  treaty obligation of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application of permanent establishment rule of treaties. In  applying this section with respect to income which is   not effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a  trade or business in the United States by a nonresident alien individual  or foreign corporation, see section 894(b), which provides that with  respect to such income the nonresident alien individual or foreign  corporation shall be deemed not to have a permanent establishment in the  United States at any time during the taxable year for purposes of  applying any exemption from, or reduction in rate of, tax provided by  any tax convention.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determination of tax--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If the gross income of a  nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation, as the case may be,  consists of both treaty and nontreaty income, the tax liability for the  taxable year shall be the sum of the amounts determined in accordance  with subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph. In no case, however,  may the tax liability so determined exceed the tax liability (tax  reduced by allowable credits) with respect to the taxpayer's entire  income, determined in accordance with Sec. 1.871-7 or Sec. 1.871-8, or  with Sec. 1.881-2 or Sec. 1.882-1, as though the tax convention had  not come into effect and without reference to the provisions of this  section. Determinations under this paragraph shall be made without  taking into account any credits allowed by sections 31, 32, 39, and  6402, but such credits shall be allowed against the tax liability  determined in accordance with this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Tax on nontreaty income. For purposes of subparagraph (1) of  this paragraph, compute a partial tax (determined without the allowance  of any credit) upon only the nontreaty income in accordance with Sec.  1.871-7 or Sec. 1.871-8, or with Sec. 1.881-2 or Sec. 1.882-1,  whichever applies, as though the tax convention had not come into  effect. To the extent allowed by paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.871-8, or  paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.882-1, the credits allowed by sections 33, 35,  38, and 40 shall then be allowed, without taking into account any item  included in the treaty income, against the tax determined under this  subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Tax on treaty income. For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph, compute a tax upon the gross amount, determined without the  allowance of any deduction, of each separate item of treaty income at  the reduced rate applicable to that item under the tax convention. No  credits shall be allowed against the tax determined under this  subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Illustration. The application of this section may be illustrated  by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A nonresident alien individual who is a resident of a  foreign country with which the United States has entered into a tax  convention receives during the taxable year 1967 from sources within the  United States total gross income of $22,000, consisting of the following  items:  Compensation for personal services the tax on which is not       $20,000</p><p class="depth0">limited by the tax convention (effectively connected income</p><p class="depth0">under Sec. 1.864-4(c)(6)(ii))..............................
