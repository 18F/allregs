                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The disclosure of records to other Federal government agencies  is generally governed by the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3510,  rather than the Freedom of Information Act. The acceptance of materials  in confidence under Sec. 0.457 or Sec. 0.459, or any other statute, rule  or Commission order, does not preclude their disclosure to other federal  agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Information submitted to the Commission in confidence pursuant  to Sec. 0.457(c)(2) and (3), (d) and (g) or Sec. 0.459, or any other  statute, rule or order, may be disclosed to other agencies of the  Federal government upon request or upon the Commission's own motion,  provided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specific Commission assurances against such disclosure have not  been given;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The other agency has established a legitimate need for the  information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclosure is made subject to the provisions of 44 U.S.C.  3510(b); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Disclosure is not prohibited by the Privacy Act or other  provisions of law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Commission's staff may give assurances against disclosure of  information to other Federal agencies only with the prior written  approval of the General Counsel. In no event will assurance against  disclosure to other agencies be given in advance of submission of the  information to the Commission if submission is required by statute or by  the provisions of this chapter; but the notice provisions of paragraph  (d) of this section will apply to such required submissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this  section, a party who furnished records to the Commission with a request  for confidential treatment, see Sec. 0.459, will be notified at the time  that the request for disclosure is submitted and will be afforded ten  calendar days in which to submit an opposition to disclosure. This  notification may be made either individually or by public notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the agency requesting the records provides in writing to the  satisfaction of the Commission that notice to the party who furnished  the records to the Commission will interfere unduly with its law  enforcement, national security or homeland defense activities and  further states that it will notify that party of the Commission's  disclosure once the potential for such interference is eliminated, the  Commission will not give notice of disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A party who furnished records to the Commission in confidence  will not be afforded prior notice when the disclosure is made to the  Comptroller General of the United States, in the Government  Accountability Office. Such a party will instead be notified of  disclosure of the records to the Comptroller General either individually  or by public notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If disclosure is opposed and the Commission decides to make the  records available to the other agency, the party who furnished the  records to the Commission will be afforded ten calendar days from the  date of the ruling to move for a judicial stay of the Commission's  action. If the party does not move for stay within this period, the  records will be disclosed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, nothing  in this section is intended to govern disclosure of information to  Congress or the Comptroller General.</p>
