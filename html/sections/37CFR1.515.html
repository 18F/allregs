                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Within three months following the filing date of a request for an ex parte reexamination, an examiner will consider the request and determine whether or not a substantial new question of patentability affecting any claim of the patent is raised by the request and the prior art cited therein, with or without consideration of other patents or printed publications. A statement and any accompanying information submitted pursuant to Sec.  1.501(a)(2) will not be considered by the examiner when making a determination on the request. The examiner's determination will be based on the claims in effect at the time of the determination, will become a part of the official file of the patent, and will be given or mailed to the patent owner at the address provided for in Sec.  1.33(c) and to the person requesting reexamination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where no substantial new question of patentability has been found, a refund of a portion of the fee for requesting ex parte reexamination will be made to the requester in accordance with Sec.  1.26(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The requester may seek review by a petition to the Director under Sec.  1.181 within one month of the mailing date of the examiner's determination refusing ex parte reexamination. Any such petition must comply with Sec.  1.181(b). If no petition is timely filed or if the decision on petition affirms that no substantial new question of patentability has been raised, the determination shall be final and nonappealable.
