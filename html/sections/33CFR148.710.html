                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> MARAD may issue a license to construct a deepwater port under the Act, with or without conditions, if certain specified conditions are met. The relevant environmental considerations include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Construction and operation of the deepwater port that will be in the national interest and consistent with national security and other national policy goals and objectives, including energy sufficiency, environmental quality, protection from the threat of terrorist attack and other subversive activity against persons and property on the deepwater port and the vessels and crews calling at the deepwater port; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under the environmental review criteria in Sec. 148.707 of this subpart, the applicant has demonstrated that the deepwater port will be constructed, operated, and decommissioned using the best available technology to prevent or minimize adverse impacts on the marine environment (33 U.S.C. 1503(c)(3), 1504(f) and 1505(a)(1)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under 33 U.S.C. 1504(f), these criteria in Sec. 148.707 of this part must be considered in the preparation of a single detailed environmental impact statement or environmental assessment for all timely applications covering a single application area. Additionally, 33 U.S.C. 1504(i)(3) specifies that if more than one application is submitted for an ``application area,'' as defined in 33 U.S.C. 1504(d)(2), the criteria must be used, among other factors, in determining whether any one proposed deepwater port for oil clearly best serves the national interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In accordance with 40 CFR 1502.9, the Commandant (CG-5P) will prepare a supplement to a final environmental impact statement if there is significant new information or circumstances relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the deepwater port and related activities affecting its location site, construction, operation or decommissioning.
