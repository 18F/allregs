                            <p class="depth0">The Director may, upon receipt of an application and in accordance with the issuance criteria of this section, issue a permit authorizing the importation into or shipment between the continental United States, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any possession of the United States of injurious wildlife (See subpart B of this part) for zoological, educational, medical, or scientific purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application requirements. Submit applications for permits to import, transport, or acquire injurious wildlife for such purposes to the attention of the Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, at the address listed for the Division of Management Authority at 50 CFR 2.1(b). Submit applications in writing on a Federal Fish and Wildlife License/Permit application (Form 3-200) and attach all of the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The number of specimens and the common and scientific names (genus and species) of each species of live wildlife proposed to be imported or otherwise acquired, transported and possessed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The purpose of such importation or other acquisition, transportation and possession;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The address of the premises where such live wildlife will be kept in captivity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement of the applicant's qualifications and previous experience

in caring for and handling captive wildlife.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set forth in part 13 of this subchapter B, permits to import or ship injurious wildlife for zoological, educational, medical, or scientific purposes shall be subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All live wildlife acquired under permit and all progeny thereof, must be confined in the approved facilities on the premises authorized in the permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No live wildlife, acquired under permit, or any eggs or progeny thereof, may be sold, donated, traded, loaned, or transferred to any other person unless such person has a permit issued by the Director under Sec.  16.22 authorizing him to acquire and possess such wildlife or the eggs or progeny thereof.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Permittees shall notify the nearest Special Agent-in-Charge (see Sec.  10.22 of this chapter) by telephone or other expedient means within 24 hours following the escape of any wildlife imported or transported under authority of a permit issued under this section, or the escape of any progeny of such wildlife, unless otherwise specifically exempted by terms of the permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Issuance criteria. The Director shall consider the following in determining whether to issue a permit to import or ship injurious wildlife for zoological, educational, medical, or scientific purposes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the wildlife is being imported or otherwise acquired for a bona fide scientific, medical, educational, or zoological exhibition purpose;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the facilities for holding the wildlife in captivity have been inspected and approved, and consist of a basic cage or structure of a design and material adequate to prevent escape which is maintained inside a building or other facility of such structure that the wildlife could not escape from the building or other facility after escaping from the cage or structure maintained therein;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the applicant is a responsible person who is aware of the potential dangers to public interests posed by such wildlife, and who by reason of his knowledge, experience, and facilities reasonably can be expected to provide adequate protection for such public interests; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If such wildlife is to be imported or otherwise acquired for zoological or aquarium exhibition purposes, whether such exhibition or display will be open to the public during regular appropriate hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Office of Management and Budget approved the information collection requirements contained in this part 16 under 44 U.S.C. 3507 and assigned OMB Control Number 1018-0093. The Service may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. We are collecting this information to provide information necessary to evaluate permit applications. We will use this information to review permit applications and make decisions, according to criteria established in various Federal wildlife conservation statutes and regulations, on the issuance, suspension, revocation, or denial of permits. You must respond to obtain or retain a permit. We estimate the public reporting burden for these reporting requirements to average 2 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining data, and completing and reviewing the forms. Direct comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of these reporting requirements to the Service's Information Collection Clearance Officer at the address provided at 50 CFR 2.1(b).
