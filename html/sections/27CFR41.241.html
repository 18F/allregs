A person operating as an importer of processed tobacco that holds a permit bearing an effective date that is prior to August 26, 2013 and that wishes to continue operations as an importer of processed tobacco must apply for and receive a new permit issued under Sec. 41.240. The person must file the application under Sec. 41.232 within 150 days after August 26, 2013, or within 30 days prior to the expiration date shown on the existing permit form, whichever is later. If a person timely files an application but that application is not complete (that is, the applicant has not submitted information or documentation sufficient for TTB to take action on the permit), and if the applicant has not provided the missing information within one year of a written request for it or within any shorter time period specified in the written request, the permit application will be deemed abandoned and the applicant will be notified in writing that no permit will be issued in response to the incomplete application. Provided that a timely application is filed, the person may continue operations under the existing permit until TTB takes

final action on the application for the new permit.
