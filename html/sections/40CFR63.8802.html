For example, if toluene (not an OSHA carcinogen) is measured to be 0.5  percent of the material by mass, you do not need to include it in the  HAP total. Express the mass fraction of each HAP you measure as a value  truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.1234).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Calculate the total HAP content in the test material by adding  up the individual HAP contents and truncating the result to three places  after the decimal point (for example, 0.123).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Alternative method. You may use an alternative test method for  determining mass fraction of HAP if you obtain prior approval by the  Administrator. You must follow the procedure in Sec. 63.7(f) to submit  an alternative test method for approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> and  (ii) of this section. This information may include, but is not limited  to, a material safety data sheet (MSDS), a certified product data sheet  (CPDS), or a manufacturer's hazardous air pollutant data sheet.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Include in the HAP total each HAP that is present at 0.1 percent  by mass or more for OSHA-defined carcinogens as specified in 29 CFR  1910.1200(d)(4) and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds.  For example, if toluene (not an OSHA carcinogen) is 0.5 percent of the  material by mass, you do not have to include it in the HAP total.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the HAP content is provided by the material supplier or  manufacturer as a range, then you must use the upper limit of the range  for determining compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Verification of supplier or manufacturer information. Although  you are not required to perform testing to verify the information  obtained according to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the  Administrator may require a separate measurement of the total HAP  content using the methods specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this  section. If this measurement exceeds the total HAP content provided by  the material supplier or manufacturer, then you must use the measured  HAP content to determine compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p>
