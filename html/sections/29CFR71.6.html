                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When charged. A component shall charge fees pursuant to 31  U.S.C. 9701 and 5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(5) for the copying of records unless  the component, in its discretion, waives or reduces the fees for good  cause shown. A component shall charge fees at the rate of $0.15 per  page. In accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information  Act, the first 100 pages of copying shall be furnished without charge.  For materials other than paper copies, the component may charge the  direct costs of reproduction, but only if the requester has been  notified of such costs before they are incurred. Fees shall not be  charged where they would amount, in the aggregate, for one request or  for a series of related requests, to less than $15.00. Notwithstanding  any other provision of this paragraph, the first copy of an individual's  Privacy Act record shall be provided to the individual at no cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of estimated fees amounting to between $25 to $250. When  a component determines or estimates that the fees to be charged under  this section may amount to between $25 to $250, the component shall  notify the requester as soon as practicable of the actual or estimated  amount of the fee, unless the requester has indicated in advance his  willingness to pay a fee as high as that anticipated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of estimated fees in excess of $250. When a component  determines or estimates that the fees to be charged under this section  may amount to more than $250, the component shall notify the requester  as soon as practicable of the actual or estimated amount of the fee,  unless the requester has indicated in advance his willingness to pay a  fee as high as that estimated. If the fee is estimated to be in excess  of $250, then the agency may require payment in advance. (If only a  portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the component shall advise  the requester that the estimated fee may be only a portion of the total  fee.) Where the estimated fee exceeds $250 and a component has so  notified the requester, the component will be deemed   not to have received the request for access to records until the  requester has paid the anticipated fee, in full or in part. A notice to  a requester pursuant to this paragraph shall offer him the opportunity  to confer with Department personnel with the object of reformulating his  request to meet his needs at a lower cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Form of payment. Requesters must pay fees by cash, check or  money order payable to either the Treasury of the United States, or the  U.S. Department of Labor. However, the Department shall not require  advance payment in any case where the fee is under $250, except that  where a requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged under this  part, the requester must pay the component or the Department the full  amount owed and make an advance deposit of the full amount of any  estimated fee before a component shall be required to process a new or  pending request for access from that requester.</p>
