                            <p class="depth0">No HHS awarding agency may place restrictions on the non-Federal  entity that limit public access to the records of the non-Federal entity  pertinent to a Federal award, except for protected personally  identifiable information (PII) or when the HHS awarding agency can  demonstrate that such records will be kept confidential and would have  been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act  (5 U.S.C. 552) or controlled unclassified information pursuant to  Executive Order 13556 if the records had belonged to the HHS awarding  agency. The Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) (FOIA) does not  apply to those records that remain under a non-Federal entity's control  except as required under Sec. 75.322. Unless required by Federal,  state, local, or tribal statute, non-Federal entities are not required  to permit public access to their records. The non-Federal entity's  records provided to a Federal agency generally will be subject to FOIA  and applicable exemptions.    Sec.
