The Contracting Officer shall terminate by delivering to the Contractor  a Notice of Termination specifying the extent of termination and the  effective date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After receipt of a Notice of Termination and except as directed  by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall immediately proceed  with the following obligations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Stop work as specified in the notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Place no further subcontracts or orders (referred to as  subcontracts in this clause), except as necessary to complete the  continued portion of the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Terminate all applicable subcontracts and cancel or divert  applicable commitments covering personal services that extend beyond the  effective date of termination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Assign to the Government, as directed by the Contracting  Officer, all right, title, and interest of the Contractor under the  subcontracts terminated, in which case the Government shall have the  right to settle or pay any termination settlement proposal arising out  of those terminations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> With approval or ratification to the extent required by the  Contracting Officer, settle all outstanding liabilities and termination  settlement proposals arising from the termination of subcontracts;  approval or ratification will be final for purposes of this clause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Transfer title (if not already transferred) and, as directed by  the Contracting Officer, deliver to the Government any information and  items that, if the contract had been completed, would have been required  to be furnished, including (i) materials or equipment produced, in  process, or acquired for the work terminated and (ii) completed or  partially completed plans, drawings, and information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Complete performance of the work not terminated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Take any action that may be necessary, or that the Contracting  Officer may direct, for the protection and preservation of the property  related to this contract that is in the possession of the Contractor and  in which the Government has or may acquire an interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Use its best efforts to sell, as directed or authorized by the  Contracting Officer, termination inventory other than that retained by  the Government under subparagraph (b)(6) of this clause; provided,  however, that the Contractor (i) is not required to extend credit to any  purchaser and (ii) may acquire the property under the conditions  prescribed by, and at prices approved by, the Contracting Officer. The  proceeds of any transfer or disposition will be applied to reduce any  payments to be made by the Government under this contract, credited to  the price or cost of the work, or paid in any other manner directed by  the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Contractor shall submit complete termination inventory  schedules no later than 120 days from the effective date of termination,  unless extended in writing by the Contracting Officer upon written  request of the Contractor within this 120-day period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> After termination, the Contractor shall submit a final  termination settlement proposal to the Contracting Officer in the form  and with the certification prescribed by the Contracting Officer.
