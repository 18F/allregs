                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The failure to make timely or proper payments of any monies due  pursuant to leases, permits, and contracts subject to these regulations  will result in the collection by the ONRR of the full amount past due  plus a late payment charge. Exceptions to this late payment charge may  be granted when estimated payments on minerals production have already  been made timely and otherwise in accordance with instructions provided  by ONRR to the payor. However, late payment charges assessed with  respect to any Indian lease, permit, or contract shall be collected and  paid to the Indian or tribe to which the amount overdue is owed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Late payment charges will be assessed on any late payment or  underpayment from the date that the payment was due until the date that  the payment was received at the ONRR addresses specified in Sec.  1218.51. Payments received at the specified ONRR addresses after 4 p.m.  mountain time are considered received the following business day.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Late payment charges apply to all underpayments and payments  received after the date due. The charges include production and minimum  royalties; assessments for liquidated damages; administrative fees and  payments by purchasers of royalty taken-in-kind; or any other payments,  fees, or assessments that a lessee/operator/permittee/payor/royalty  taken-in-kind purchaser is required to pay by a specified date. The  failure to pay past due amounts, including late-payment charges, will  result in the initiation of other enforcement proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An overpayment on a lease or leases may be offset against an  underpayment on a different lease or leases to determine a net  underpayment on which interest is due pursuant to conditions specified  in Sec. 1218.42.
