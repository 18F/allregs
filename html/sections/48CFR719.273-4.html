                            <p class="depth0">Eligible business entities approved as Mentors may enter into  agreements (hereafter referred to as ``Mentor-Protege Agreement'' or  ``Agreement'' and explained in section 719.273-6) with eligible  Proteges. Mentors provide appropriate developmental assistance to  enhance the capabilities of Proteges to perform as contractors and/or  subcontractors. Eligible small business entities capable of providing  developmental assistance may be approved as Mentors. Proteges may  participate in the Program in pursuit of a prime contract or as  subcontractors under the Mentor's prime contract with the USAID, but are  not required to be a subcontractor to a USAID prime contractor or be a  USAID prime contractor. Notwithstanding eligibility requirements in this  section, USAID reserves the right to limit the number of participants in  the Program in order to insure its effective management of the Mentor- Protege Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility. A Mentor:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> May be either a large or small business entity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Must be eligible for award of Government contracts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Must be able to provide developmental assistance that will  enhance the ability of Proteges to perform as prime contractors or  subcontractors; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Will be encouraged to enter into arrangements with entities with  which it has established business relationships.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligibility. A Protege:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Must be a small business, veteran-owned small business, service- disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone, small socially and  economically disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Must meet the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code that  the Mentor prime contractor believes best describes the product or  service being acquired by the subcontract; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Eligible for award of Government contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Proteges may have multiple Mentors. Proteges participating in  Mentor-Protege programs in addition to USAID's Program should maintain a  system for preparing separate reports of Mentoring activity so that  results of the USAID Program can be reported separately from any other  agency program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A Protege firm shall self-certify to a Mentor firm that it meets  the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section and possess  related certifications granted by the Small Business Administration  (e.g., HUBZone, 8(a), etc.). Mentors may rely in good faith on written  representations by potential Proteges that they meet the specified  eligibility requirements. HUBZone and small disadvantaged business  status eligibility and documentation requirements are determined  according to 13 CFR part 124.
