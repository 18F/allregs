Section 2 of the Act authorizes the Secretary of Labor to ``publish  information relating to existing and proposed labor standards of  apprenticeship,'' and to ``appoint national advisory committees * * *.''  (29 U.S.C. 50a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The purpose of this part is to set forth labor standards to  safeguard the welfare of apprentices, promote apprenticeship  opportunity, and to extend the application of such standards by  prescribing policies and procedures concerning the registration, for  certain Federal purposes, of acceptable apprenticeship programs with the  U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration, Office  of Apprenticeship. These labor standards, policies and procedures cover  the registration, cancellation and deregistration of apprenticeship  programs and of apprenticeship agreements; the recognition of a State  agency as an authorized agency for registering apprenticeship programs  for certain Federal purposes; and matters relating thereto.</p>
