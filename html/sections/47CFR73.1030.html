Protection for Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone, Boulder County, Colorado: Applicants for a station authorization to operate in the vicinity of Boulder County, Colorado under this Part are advised to give due consideration, prior to filing applications, to the need to protect the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone from harmful interference. These are the research laboratories of the Department of Commerce, Boulder County, Colorado. To prevent degradation of the present ambient radio signal level at the site, the Department of Commerce seeks to ensure that the field strengths of any radiated signals (excluding reflected signals) received on this 1800 acre site (within the area bounded by 40[deg]09[min]10[sec] N Latitude on the north, 105[deg]13[min]31[sec] W Longitude on the east, 40[deg]07[min]05[sec] N Latitude on the south, and 105[deg]15[min]13[sec] W Longitude on the west) resulting from new assignments (other than mobile stations) or from the modification of relocation of existing facilities do not exceed the following values:

However, applicants are advised that such consultation can avoid objectimns from the Department of Commerce or proceedings to modify any authorization which may be granted which, in fact, delivers a signal at the site in excess of the field strength specified herein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Protection for Federal Communications Commission monitoring stations. (1) Applicants in the vicinity of a FCC monitoring station for a radio station authorization to operate new transmitting facilities or changed transmitting facilities which would increase the field strength produced over the monitoring station in excess of that previously authorized are advised to give consideration, prior to filing applications, to the possible need to protect the FCC stations from harmful interference. Geographical coordinates of the facilities which require protection are listed in Sec.  0.121(c) of the FCC rules. Applications for stations (except mobile stations) which will produce on

any frequency a direct wave fundamental field strength of greater than 10 mV/m in the authorized bandwidth of service (-65.8 dBW/m\2\ power flux density assuming a free space characteristic impedance of 120 [pi] ohms) at the referenced coordinates, may be examined to determine extent of possible interference. Depending on the theoretical field strength value and existing root-sum-square or other ambient radio field signal levels at the indicated coordinates, a clause protecting the monitoring station may be added to the station authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicants in the vicinity of a FCC monitoring station for a radio station authorization to operate new transmitting facilities or changed transmitting facilities which would increase the field strength produced over the monitoring station in excess of that previously authorized are advised to give consideration, prior to filing applications, to the possible need to protect the FCC stations from harmful interference.
