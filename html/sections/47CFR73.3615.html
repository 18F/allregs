                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Ownership Report for Commercial Broadcast Stations (FCC Form  323) must be electronically filed every two years by each licensee of a  commercial AM, FM, or TV broadcast station (a ``Licensee''); and each  entity that holds an interest in the licensee   that is attributable for purposes of determining compliance with the  Commission's multiple ownership rules (see Notes 1-3 to 47 CFR 73.3555)  (a ``Respondent''). The initial filing deadline shall be set by Public  Notice issued by the Media Bureau. Thereafter, the Form shall be filed  biennially by November 1, 2011, and every two years thereafter. A  Licensee or Respondent with a current and unamended Report on file at  the Commission, which was filed on or by the initial filing date or  thereafter, using the Form revised pursuant to the Commission's Orders  in MB Docket Nos. 07-294, et al., 24 FCC Rcd 5896 (2009) (FCC 09-92,  rel. Oct. 16, 2009), and which is still accurate, may electronically  validate and resubmit its previously filed Form 323. Ownership Reports  shall provide the following information as of October 1 of the year in  which the Report is filed, except that the Form filed by the initial  filing date shall provide the following information as of November 1,  2009:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of an individual, the name, race or ethnicity, and  gender of such individual;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a partnership, the name, race or ethnicity, and  gender of each partner and the interest of each partner. Except as  specifically noted below, the names of limited partners shall be  reported. A limited partner need not be reported, regardless of the  extent of its ownership, if the limted partner is not materially  involved, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of the  licensee and the licensee so certifies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any change in partners or in their rights will require prior  consent of the FCC upon an application for consent to assignment of  license or permit. If such change involves less than a controlling  interest, the application for FCC consent to such changes may be made  upon FCC Form 316.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of a corporation, association, trust, estate or  receivership, the data applicable to each:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name, residence, citizenship, race or ethnicity, gender,  and stockholding of every officer, director, trustee, executor,  administrator, receiver and member of an association, and any  stockholder which holds stock accounting for 5 percent or more of the  votes of the corporation, except that an investment company, insurance  company, or bank trust department need be reported only if it holds  stock amounting to 10 percent or more of the votes, provided that the  licensee certifies that such entity has made no attempt to influence,  directly or indirectly, the management or operation of the licensee, and  that there is no representation on the licensee's board or among its  officers by any person professionally or otherwise associated with the  entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A licensee shall report any separate interests known to the  licensee to be held ultimately by the same individual or entity, whether  those interests are held in custodial accounts, by individual holding  corporations or otherwise, if, when aggregated:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The sum of all interests except those held by or through  ``passive investors'' is equal to or exceeds 5 percent; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The sum of all interests held by or through ``passive  investors'' is equal to or exceeds 10 percent; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(i)(B)(2)</em> of this section is equal to or exceeds  10 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the majority of the voting stock of a corporate licensee is  held by a single individual or entity, no other stockholding need be  reported for that licensee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Full information as to family relationship or business  association between two or more officials and/or stockholders, trustees,  executors, administrators, receivers, and members of any association;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Capitalization with a description of the classes and voting  power of stock authorized by the corporate charter or other appropriate  legal instrument and the number of shares of each class issued and  outstanding; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Full information with respect to the interest and identity of  any person having any direct, indirect, fiduciary, or beneficial  interest in the licensee or in its stock accounting for 5% or more of  its votes. For example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Where A is the trustee of stock held for beneficiary B, A shall  be reported if A votes the stock or has the sole or shared power to  dispose of the stock; B or any other party shall be reported if B or  such party votes the stock or has sole power to dispose of the stock or  has the power to revoke the trust or replace the trustee at will;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Where X is not a natural person and has attributable ownership  interest in the licensee under Sec.  73.3555 of the rules, regardless of  its position in the vertical ownership chain, an Ownership Report shall  be filed for X which, except as specifically noted below, must contain  the same information as required of a licensee. If X has a voting  stockholder interest in the licensee, only those voting interests of X  that are cognizable after application of the ``multiplier'' described in  note 2(c) of Sec.  73.3555 of the rules, if applicable, shall be  reported. If X is a corporation, whether or not its interest in the  licensee is by virtue of its ownership of voting stock, the officers and  directors shall be reported. With respect to those officers and  directors whose duties and responsibilities are wholly unrelated to the  licensee, and who wish to be relieved of attribution in the licensee,  the name, title and duties of these officers and directors, with  statements properly documenting that their duties do not involve the  licensee, shall be reported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In the case of all licensees:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A list of all contracts still in effect required to be filed  with the FCC by Sec.  73.3613 showing the date of execution and  expiration of each contract; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any interest which the licensee may have in any other broadcast  station.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Except as specifically noted below, each permittee of a  commercial AM, FM or TV broadcast station shall file an Ownership Report  on FCC Form 323 (1) within 30 days of the date of grant by the FCC of an  application for original construction permit and (2) on the date that it  applies for a station license.

A permittee with a current and unamended  Report on file at the Commission may certify that it has reviewed its  current Report and it is accurate, in lieu of filing a new Report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Before any change is made in the organization, capitalization,  officers, directors, or stockholders of a corporation other than  licensee or permittee, which results in a change in the control of the  licensee or permittee, prior FCC consent must be received under Sec.   73.3540. A transfer of control takes place when an individual or group  in privity, gains or loses affirmative or negative (50%) control. See  instructions on FCC Form 323 (Ownership Report). Each permittee or  licensee of a commercial AM, FM or TV Broadcast station shall file an  Ownership Report on FCC Form 323 within 30 days of consummating  authorized assignments or transfers of permits and licenses. The  Ownership Report of the permittee or licensee shall give the information  required by the applicable portions of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Each licensee of a noncommercial educational AM, FM or TV  broadcast station shall file an Ownership Report on FCC Form 323-E when  filing the station's license renewal application and every two years  thereafter on the anniversary of the date that its renewal application  is required to be filed. Licensees owning more than one noncommercial  educational AM, FM or TV broadcast station with different anniversary  dates need file only one Report every two years on the anniversary of  their choice, provided that their Reports are not more than two years  apart. A licensee with a current and unamended Report on file at the  Commission may certify that it has reviewed its current Report and that  it is accurate, in lieu of filing a new Report. Ownership reports shall  give the following information as of a date not more than 60 days prior  to the filing of the Ownership Report:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The following information as to all officers, members of  governing board, and holders of 1% or more ownership interest (if any):  Name, residence, office held, citizenship, principal profession or  occupation, and by whom appointed or elected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Full information with respect to the interest and identity of  any individual, organization, corporation, association, or any other  entity which has direct or indirect control over the licensee or  permittee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A list of all contracts still in effect required by Sec.   73.3613 to be filed with the FCC, showing the date of execution and  expiration of each contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any interest which the licensee or permittee or any of its  officers, members of the governing board, and holders of 1% or more  ownership interest (if any) held in any other broadcast station.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Each permittee of a noncommercial educational AM, FM or TV  broadcast station shall file an Ownership Report on FCC Form 323-E:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Within 30 days of the date of grant by the FCC of an application  for original construction permit and;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> On the date that it applies for a station license.
