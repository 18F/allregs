                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In closing out Bureau grants, the following shall be observed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon request, the Bureau shall make prompt payments to a grantee   for allowable reimbursable costs under the grant being closed out.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The grantee shall immediately refund to the Bureau any  unencumbered balance of cash advanced to the grantee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Bureau shall obtain from the grantee within 90 days after  the date of completion of the grant all financial, peformance, and other  reports required as a condition of the grant. The Bureau may grant  extensions when requested by the grantee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Bureau shall make a settlement for any upward or downward  adjustments to the Federal share of costs after these reports are  received.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The grantee shall account for any property acquired with grant  funds, or received from the Government in accordance with the provisions  of Sec. 276.11.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If a final audit has not been performed before the closeout of  the grant, the Bureau shall retain the right to recover an appropriate  amount after fully considering the recommendations on disallowed costs  resulting from the final audit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Suspension. When a grantee has materially failed to comply with  the terms and conditions of a grant, the Bureau may after reasonable  notice to the grantee, suspend the grant. The notice preceding  suspension shall include the effective date of the suspension, the  reasons for the suspension, the corrective measures necessary for  reinstatement of the grant, and, if there is no immediate threat to  safety, a reasonable time frame for corrective action prior to actual  suspension. No obligations incurred by the grantee during the period of  suspension shall be allowable under the suspended grant, except that the  Bureau may at its discretion allow necessary and proper costs which the  grantee could not reasonably avoid during the period of suspensions if  such costs would otherwise be allowable under the applicable cost  principles specified in appendix A of this part. Appropriate adjustments  to the payments under the suspended grant will be made, either by  withholding the payments or by not allowing the grantee credit for  disbursements which he may make in liquidation of unauthorized  obligations he incurs during the period of suspension. Suspensions shall  remain in effect until the grantee has taken corrective action to the  satisfaction of the Bureau or given assurances satisfactory to the  Bureau that corrective action will be taken, or until the Bureau cancels  the grant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cancellation for cause. The Bureau may cancel any grant in  whole, or in part, at any time before the date of completion, whenever  it is determined that the grantee has:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Materially failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the  grant;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Violated the rights or endangered the health, safety, or  welfare of any persons;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Been grossly negligent in or has mismanaged the handling or  use of funds provided under the grant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When it appears that cancellation of a grant shall become  necessary, the Bureau shall promptly notify the grantee in writing of  this possibility. This written notice shall advise the grantee of the  reason for the possible cancellation and the corrective action necessary  to avoid cancellation. The Bureau shall also offer, and provide if  requested by the grantee, any technical assistance which may be required  to effect the corrective action. The grantee shall have 60 days in which  to effect this corrective action before the Bureau provides notice of  intent to cancel the grant as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon deciding to cancel for cause, the Bureau shall promptly  notify the grantee in writing of that decision, the reasons for the  cancellation, and the effective date. The Bureau shall also provide a  hearing for the grantee before cancellation, as provided in Sec.  272.51. However, the Bureau may immediately cancel the grant, upon  notice to the grantee, if the Bureau determines that continuance of the  grant poses an immediate threat to safety. In this event, the Bureau  shall provide a hearing for the grantee within ten (10) days of  cancellation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Payments made to grantees or recoveries by the Bureau under  grants cancelled for cause shall be in accordance with the legal rights  and obligations of the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cancellation on other grounds. Except as provided in  paragraph (c) of   this section, grants may be cancelled in whole or in part only as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By the Bureau with the consent of the grantee, in which case the  two parties shall agree upon the cancellation conditions, including the  effective date, and in the case of partial cancellation, the portion to  be cancelled; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> By the grantee, upon written notice to the Bureau, setting  forth the reasons for the cancellation, the effective date, and, in the  case of partial cancellation, the portion to be cancelled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a grant is cancelled in accordance with paragraph (d) of  this section, the grantee shall not incur new obligations for the  cancelled portion after the effective date, and shall cancel as many  outstanding obligations as possible. The Bureau shall allow full credit  to the grantee for the Bureau share of the noncancellable obligations  properly incurred by the grantee before cancellation.
