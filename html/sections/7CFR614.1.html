These regulations reflect NRCS policy to resolve at the agency level, to  the greatest extent possible, disputes arising from adverse technical  determinations and program decisions made by NRCS. Once a decision is  rendered final by NRCS, participants may appeal to the National Appeals  Division (NAD) as provided for under 7 CFR part 11, or to the Farm  Service Agency (FSA) county committee pursuant to 7 CFR part 780 for  decisions rendered under Title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as  amended, 16 U.S.C. 3801 et seq. (Title XII).</p>
