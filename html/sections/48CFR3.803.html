For purposes of this paragraph, providing any  information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is permitted  at any time.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Participating with an agency in discussions that are not  related to a specific solicitation for any covered Federal action, but  that concern--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The qualities and characteristics (including individual  demonstrations) of the person's products or services, conditions or  terms of sale, and service capabilities; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The application or adaptation of the person's products or  services for an agency's use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Providing prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal  action any information not specifically requested but necessary for an  agency to make an informed decision about initiation of a covered  Federal action.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Participating in technical discussions regarding the  preparation of an unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Making capability presentations prior to formal solicitation of  any covered Federal action when seeking an award from an agency pursuant  to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended by Pub. L. 95- 507, and subsequent amendments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Professional and technical services. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Payment of reasonable  compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or  receiving a covered Federal action, if payment is for professional or  technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or  negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal action  or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition  for receiving that Federal action;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or  employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action,  if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered  directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid,  proposal, or application for that Federal action, or for meeting  requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving  that Federal action. Persons other than officers or employees of a  person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include  consultants and trade associations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> As used in paragraph (a)(2) of this section ``professional and  technical services'' are limited to advice and analysis directly  applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting  of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is  allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the  performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered  directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However,  communications with the intent to influence made by a professional or a  technical person are not allowable under this section unless they  provide advice and   analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and  unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the  preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.  Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a  lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely  related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but  generally advocate one proposal over another, are not allowable under  this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal  services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by  an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation  or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section  since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in  the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for  receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or  regulation and any other requirements in the actual award documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Only those communications and services expressly authorized by  paragraph (a) of this section are permitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The disclosure requirements of paragraph 3.802(b) do not apply  with respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly  employed officers or employees of a person.
