                            <p class="depth0">If the Administrator, for good cause, finds that notice is unnecessary, and incorporates that finding and a brief statement of the reasons for it in the rule, a direct final rule may be issued according to the following procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Rules that the Administrator judges to be non-controversial and unlikely to result in adverse public comment may be published as direct final rules. These may include rules that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Are non-substantive amendments, such as clarifications or corrections, to an existing rule;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Update existing forms or rules, such as incorporations by reference of the latest technical standards where the standards have not been changed in a complex or controversial way;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Affect NHTSA's internal procedures, such as filing requirements and rules governing inspection and copying of documents;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Are minor substantive rules or changes to existing rules on which the agency does not expect adverse comment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Federal Register document will state that any adverse comment or notice of intent to submit adverse comment must be received in writing by NHTSA within the specified time after the date of publication of the direct final rule and that, if no written adverse comment or written notice of intent to submit adverse comment is received in that period, the rule will become effective a specified number of days (no less than 45) after the date of publication of the direct final rule. NHTSA will provide a minimum comment period of 30 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If no written adverse comment or written notice of intent to submit adverse comment is received by NHTSA within the specified time after the date of publication in the Federal Register, NHTSA will publish a document in the Federal Register indicating that no adverse comment was received and confirming that the rule will become effective on the date that was indicated in the direct final rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If NHTSA receives any written adverse comment or written notice of intent to submit adverse comment within the specified time after publication of the direct final rule in the Federal Register, the agency will publish a document withdrawing the direct final rule, in whole or in part, in the

final rule section of the Federal Register. If NHTSA decides to proceed with a provision on which adverse comment was received, the agency will publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the proposed rule section of the Federal Register to provide another opportunity to comment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An ``adverse'' comment, for the purpose of this subpart, means any comment that NHTSA determines is critical of any provision of the rule, suggests that the rule should not be adopted, or suggests a change that should be made in the rule. A comment suggesting that the policy or requirements of the rule should or should not also be extended to other Departmental programs outside the scope of the rule is not adverse.
