                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Voluntary contributions to a separate segregated fund. (1) A separate segregated fund is prohibited from making a contribution or expenditure by utilizing money or anything of value secured by physical force, job discrimination, financial reprisals, or the threat of force, job discrimination, or financial reprisal; or by dues, fees, or other monies required as a condition of membership in a labor organization or as a condition of employment or by monies obtained in any commercial transaction. For purposes of this section, fees or monies paid as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership or employment are monies required as a condition of membership or employment even though they are refundable upon request of the payor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A separate segregated fund is prohibited from making a contribution or expenditure by utilizing money or anything of value secured by physical force, job discrimination, financial reprisals, or the threat of force, job discrimination, or financial reprisal; or by dues, fees, or other monies required as a condition of membership in a labor organization or as a condition of employment or by monies obtained in any commercial transaction. For purposes of this section, fees or monies paid as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership or employment are monies required as a condition of membership or employment even though they are refundable upon request of the payor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A guideline for contributions may be suggested by a corporation or a labor organization, or the separate segregated fund of either, provided that the person soliciting or the solicitation informs the persons being solicited--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the guidelines are merely suggestions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That an individual is free to contribute more or less than the guidelines suggest and the corporation or labor organization will not favor or disadvantage anyone by reason of the amount of their contribution or their decision not to contribute.
A corporation or labor organization or the separate segregated fund of either may not enforce any guideline for contributions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any person soliciting an employee or member for a contribution to a separate segregated fund must inform such employee or member of the political purposes of the fund at the time of the solicitation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any persons soliciting an employee or member for a contribution to a separate segregated fund must inform the employee or member at the time of such solicitation of his or her right to refuse to so contribute without any reprisal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any written solicitation for a contribution to a separate segregated fund which is addressed to an employee or member must contain statements which comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) (3) and (4) of this section, and if a guideline is suggested, statements which comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use of treasury monies. Corporations, labor organizations, membership organizations, cooperatives, or corporations without capital stock may use general treasury monies, including monies obtained in commercial transactions and dues monies or membership fees, for the establishment, administration, and solicitation of contributions to its separate segregated fund. A corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock may not use the establishment, administration, and solicitation process as a means of exchanging treasury monies for voluntary contributions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A contributor may not be paid for his or her contribution through a bonus, expense account, or other form of direct or indirect compensation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock may, subject to the provisions of 39 U.S.C. 3005 and chapter 61, title 18, United States Code, utilize a raffle or other fundraising device which involves a prize, so long as State law permits and the prize is not disproportionately valuable. Dances, parties, and other types of entertainment may also be used as fundraising devices. When using raffles or entertainment to raise funds, a reasonable practice to follow is

for the separate segregated fund to reimburse the corporation or labor organization for costs which exceed one-third of the money contributed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the separate segregated fund pays any solicitation or other administrative expense from its own account, which expense could be paid for as an administrative expense by the collecting agent, the collecting agent may reimburse the separate segregated fund no later than 30 calendar days after the expense was paid by the separate segregated fund.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Membership in separate segregated funds. (1) A separate segregated fund established by a corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock may provide that persons who contribute a certain amount to its separate segregated fund will become members of its separate segregated fund, so long as--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A separate segregated fund established by a corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock may provide that persons who contribute a certain amount to its separate segregated fund will become members of its separate segregated fund, so long as--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The fund accepts contributions of all amounts, subject to the limitations of part 110;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Subject to paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, nothing of value may be given in return for or in the course of membership;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The fund may use membership status for intangible privileges such as allowing members only to choose the candidates to whom the fund will contribute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The fact that the separate segregated fund of a corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock is a membership group does not provide the corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock with any greater right of communication or solicitation than the corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock is otherwise granted under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Control of funds. A corporation, membership organization, cooperative, corporation without capital stock, or labor organization may exercise control over its separate segregated fund.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Disclosure. Separate segregated funds are subject to the following disclosure requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A corporation or labor organization is not required to report any payment made or obligation incurred which is not a contribution or expenditure, as defined in Sec. 114.1(a), except those reporting requirements specifically set forth in this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A membership organization or corporation is not required to report the cost of any communication to its members or stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, if such membership organization or corporation is not organized primarily for the purpose of influencing the nomination for election, or election, of any person to Federal office, except that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The costs incurred by a membership organization, including a labor organization, or by a corporation, directly attributable to a communication expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate (other than a communication primarily devoted to subjects other than the express advocacy of the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate) shall, if those costs exceed $2,000 per election, be reported in accordance with 11 CFR 100.134(a); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amounts paid or incurred for legal or accounting services rendered to or on behalf of a candidate or political committee solely for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Act or chapter 95 or 96 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 paid by a corporation or labor organization which is the regular employer of the individual rendering such services, shall be reported in accordance with the provisions of part 104.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A separate segregated fund is subject to all other disclosure requirements of political committees as set forth in part 104.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Contribution limits. Separate segregated funds are subject to the contribution limitations for political committees set forth in part 110. (See particularly Sec. 110.3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Solicitations. Except as specifically provided in Sec. Sec. 114.6, 114.7, and 114.8, a corporation and/or its separate segregated fund or a labor organization and/or its separate segregated fund is subject to the following limitations on solicitations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A corporation or a separate segregated fund established by a corporation is prohibited from soliciting contributions to such fund from any person other than its stockholders and their families and its executive or administrative personnel and their families. A corporation may solicit the executive or administrative personnel of its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates and their families. For purposes of this section, the factors set forth at 11 CFR 100.5(g)(4) shall be used to determine whether an organization is an affiliate of a corporation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A labor organization, or a separate segregated fund established by a labor organization is prohibited from soliciting contributions to such a fund from any person other than its members and executive or administrative personnel, and their families.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Accidental or inadvertent solicitation. Accidental or inadvertent solicitation by a corporation or labor organization, or the separate segregated fund of either, of persons apart from and beyond those whom it is permitted to solicit will not be deemed a violation, provided that such corporation or labor organization or separate segregated fund has used its best efforts to comply with the limitations regarding the persons it may solicit and that the method of solicitation is corrected forthwith after the discovery of such erroneous solicitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Communications paid for with voluntary contributions. A separate segregated fund may, using voluntary contributions, communicate with the general public, except that such communications may not solicit contributions to a separate segregated fund established by a corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock, unless such solicitation is permitted under paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Acceptance of contributions. A separate segregated fund may accept contributions from persons otherwise permitted by law to make contributions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Availability of methods. Any corporation, including its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates, that uses a method of soliciting voluntary contributions or facilitating the making of voluntary contributions from its stockholders or executive or administrative personnel and their families, shall make that method available to a labor organization representing any members working for the corporation, its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates for soliciting voluntary contributions or facilitating the making of voluntary contributions from its members and their families. Such method shall be made available on the written request of the labor organization and at a cost sufficient only to reimburse the corporation for the expenses incurred thereby. For example--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a corporation, including its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates utilizes a payroll deduction plan, check-off system, or other plan which deducts contributions from the dividend or payroll checks of stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, the corporation shall, upon written request of the labor organization, make that method available to members of the labor organization working for the corporation, its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates, who wish to contribute to the separate segregated fund of the labor organization representing any members working for the corporation, or any of its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates. The corporation shall make the payroll deduction plan available to the labor organization at a cost sufficient only to reimburse the corporation for the actual expenses incurred thereby.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a corporation uses a computer for addressing envelopes or labels for a solicitation to its stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, the corporation shall, upon written request, program the computer to enable the labor organization to solicit its members. The corporation shall charge the labor organization a cost sufficient only to reimburse the corporation for the actual expenses incurred in programming the computers and the allocated cost of employee time relating to the work, and the materials used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a corporation uses corporate facilities, such as a company dining room or cafeteria, for meetings of stockholders or executive or administrative personnel at which solicitations are

made, the corporation shall upon written request of the labor organization allow that labor organization to use existing corporate facilities for meetings to solicit its members. The labor organization shall be required to reimburse the corporation for any actual expenses incurred thereby, such as any increase in the overhead to the corporation and any cost involved in setting up the facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a corporation uses no method to solicit voluntary contributions or to facilitate the making of voluntary contributions from stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, it is not required by law to make any method available to the labor organization for its members. The corporation and the labor organization may agree upon making any lawful method available even though such agreement is not required by the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The availability of methods of twice yearly solicitations is subject to the provisions of Sec. 114.6(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Methods permitted by law to labor organizations. Notwithstanding any other law, any method of soliciting voluntary contributions or of facilitating the making of voluntary contributions to a separate segregated fund established by a corporation, permitted by law to corporations with regard to stockholders and executive or administrative personnel, shall also be permitted to labor organizations with regard to their members and executive or administrative personnel.
