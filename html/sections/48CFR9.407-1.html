                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The suspending official may, in the public interest, suspend a  contractor for any of the causes in 9.407-2, using the procedures in  9.407-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Suspension is a serious action to be imposed on the basis of  adequate evidence, pending the completion of investigation or legal  proceedings, when it has been determined that immediate action is  necessary to protect the Government's interest. In assessing the  adequacy of the evidence, agencies should consider how much information  is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not  important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can  reasonably be drawn as a result. This assessment should include an  examination of basic documents such as contracts, inspection reports,  and correspondence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The existence of a cause for suspension does not necessarily  require that the contractor be suspended. The suspending official should  consider the seriousness of the contractor's acts or omissions and may,  but is not required to, consider remedial measures or mitigating  factors, such as those set forth in 9.406-1(a). A contractor has the  burden of promptly presenting to the suspending official evidence of  remedial measures or mitigating factors when it has reason to know that  a cause for suspension exists. The existence or nonexistence of any  remedial measures or mitigating factors is not necessarily determinative  of a contractor's present responsibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c))</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A contractor's suspension shall be effective throughout the  executive branch of the Government, unless the agency head or a designee  (except see 23.506(e)) states in writing the compelling reasons  justifying continued business dealings between that agency and the  contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When the suspending official has authority to suspend  contractors from both acquisition contracts pursuant to this regulation  and contracts for the purchase of Federal personal property pursuant to  FPMR 101-45.6, that official shall consider simultaneously suspending  the contractor from the award of acquisition contracts and from the  purchase of Federal personal property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When suspending a contractor from the award of acquisition  contracts and from the purchase of Federal personal property, the  suspension notice shall so indicate and the appropriate FAR and FPMR  citations shall be included.
