                                Sec. 2.706  Depositions upon oral examination and written
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Depositions upon oral examination and written interrogatories.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any party desiring to take the testimony of any party or other  person by deposition on oral examination or written interrogatories  shall, without leave of the Commission or the presiding officer, give  reasonable notice in writing to every other party, to the person to be  examined and to the presiding officer of the proposed time and place of  taking the deposition; the name and address of each person to be  examined, if known, or if the name is not known, a general description  sufficient to identify him or the class or group to which he belongs;  the matters upon which each person will be examined and the name or  descriptive title and address of the officer before whom the deposition  is to be taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Within the United States, a deposition may be taken before any  officer authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States  or of the place where the examination is held. Outside of the United  States, a deposition may be taken before a secretary of an embassy or  legation, a consul general, vice consul or consular agent of the United  States, or a person authorized to administer oaths designated by the  Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Before any questioning, the deponent shall either be sworn or  affirm the truthfulness of his or her answers. Examination and cross- examination must proceed as at a hearing. Each question propounded must  be recorded and the answer taken down in the words of the witness.  Objections on questions of evidence must be noted in short form without  the arguments. The officer may not decide on the competency,  materiality, or relevancy of evidence but must record the evidence  subject to objection. Objections on questions of evidence not made  before the officer will not be considered waived unless the ground of  the objection is one which might have been obviated or removed if  presented at that time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When the testimony is fully transcribed, the deposition must be  submitted to the deponent for examination and signature unless he or she  is ill, cannot be found, or refuses to sign. The officer shall certify  the deposition or, if the deposition is not signed by the deponent,  shall certify the reasons for the failure to sign, and shall promptly  forward the deposition by registered mail to the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Where the deposition is to be taken on written interrogatories,  the party taking the deposition shall serve a copy of the  interrogatories, showing each interrogatory separately and consecutively  numbered, on every other party with a notice stating the name and  address of the person who is to answer them, and the name, description,  title, and address of the officer before whom they are to be taken.  Within ten (10) days after service, any other party may serve cross- interrogatories. The interrogatories, cross-interrogatories, and answers  must be recorded and signed, and the deposition certified, returned, and  filed as in the case of a deposition on oral examination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A deposition will not become a part of the record in the hearing  unless received in evidence. If only part of a deposition is offered in  evidence by a party, any other party may introduce any other parts. A  party does not make   a person his or her own witness for any purpose by taking his  deposition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A deponent whose deposition is taken and the officer taking a  deposition are entitled to the same fees as are paid for like services  in the district courts of the United States. The fees must be paid by  the party at whose instance the deposition is taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The witness may be accompanied, represented, and advised by  legal counsel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(9) of this  section are not applicable to NRC personnel. Testimony of NRC personnel  by oral examination and written interrogatories addressed to NRC  personnel are subject to the provisions of Sec. 2.709.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interrogatories to parties. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any party may serve upon any  other party (other than the NRC staff) written interrogatories to be  answered in writing by the party served, or if the party served is a  public or private corporation or a partnership or association, by any  officer or agent, who shall furnish such information as is available to  the party. A copy of the interrogatories, answers, and all related  pleadings must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, and must  be served on the presiding officer and all parties to the proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each interrogatory must be answered separately and fully in  writing under oath or affirmation, unless it is objected to, in which  event the reasons for objection must be stated in lieu of an answer. The  answers must be signed by the person making them, and the objections by  the attorney making them. The party upon whom the interrogatories were  served shall serve a copy of the answers and objections upon all parties  to the proceeding within fourteen (14) days after service of the  interrogatories, or within such shorter or longer period as the  presiding officer may allow. Answers may be used in the same manner as  depositions (see Sec. 2.706(a)(7)).</p>
