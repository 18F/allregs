                            <p class="depth0">Executive Order 12114 provides the exclusive and complete  requirement for taking account of considerations with respect to actions  that do significant harm to the environment of places outside the United  States. This part provides policy and procedures to enable Department of  Defense (DoD) officials to be informed and take account of environmental  considerations when authorizing or approving certain major Federal  actions that do significant harm to the environment of places outside  the United States. Its sole objective is to establish internal  procedures to achieve this purpose, and nothing in it shall be construed  to create a cause of action. Guidance for taking account of  considerations with respect to the environment of places within the  United States is set out in 32 CFR part 188 (under rev.) That guidance  is grounded on legal and policy requirements different from those  applicable to this part.  [44 FR 21786, Apr. 14, 1979. Redesignated and amended at 56 FR 64481,  Dec. 10, 1991]</p>
