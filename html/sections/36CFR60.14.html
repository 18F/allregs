                                Sec. 60.14  Changes and revisions to properties listed in the National Register.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Boundary changes. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A boundary alteration shall be considered  as a new property nomination. All forms, criteria and procedures used in  nominating a property to the National Register must be used. In the case  of boundary enlargements only those owners in the newly nominated as yet  unlisted area need be notified and will be counted in determining  whether a majority of private owners object to listing. In the case of a  diminution of a boundary, owners shall be notified as specified in Sec.  60.15 concerning removing properties from the National Register. A  professionally justified recommendation by the State Historic  Preservation Officer, Federal Preservation Officer, or person or local  government where there is no approved State Historic Preservation  Program shall be presented to NPS. During this process, the property is  not taken off the National Register. If the Keeper or his or her  designee finds the recommendation in accordance with the National  Register criteria for evaluation, the change will be accepted. If the  boundary change is not accepted, the old boundaries will remain.  Boundary revisions may be appealed as provided for in Sec. Sec. 60.12  and 60.15.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Four justifications exist for altering a boundary: Professional  error in the initial nomination, loss of historic integrity, recognition  of additional significance, additional research documenting that a  larger or smaller area should be listed. No enlargement of a boundary  should be recommended unless the additional area possesses previously  unrecognized significance in American history, architecture, archeology,  engineering or culture. No diminution of a boundary should be  recommended unless the properties being removed do not meet the National  Register criteria for evaluation. Any proposal to alter a boundary has  to be documented in detail including photographing the historic  resources falling between the existing boundary and the other proposed  boundary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Relocating properties listed in the National Register. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Properties listed in the National Register should be moved only when  there is no feasible alternative for preservation. When a property is  moved, every effort should be made to reestablish its historic  orientation, immediate setting, and general environment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If it is proposed that a property listed in the National  Register be moved and the State Historic Preservation Officer, Federal  agency for a property under Federal ownership or control, or person or  local government where there is no approved State Historic Preservation  Program, wishes the property to remain in the National Register during  and after the move, the State Historic Preservation Officer or Federal  Preservation Officer having ownership or control or person or local  government where there is no approved State Historic Preservation  Program, shall submit documentation to NPS prior to the move. The  documentation shall discuss:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The reasons for the move;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The effect on the property's historical integrity;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The new setting and general environment of the proposed site,  including evidence that the proposed site does not possess historical or  archeological significance that would be adversely affected by the  intrusion of the property; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Photographs showing the proposed location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any such proposal with respect to the new location shall follow  the required notification procedures, shall be approved by the State  Review Board if it is a State nomination and shall continue to follow  normal review procedures. The Keeper shall also follow the required  notification procedures for nominations. The Keeper shall respond to a  properly documented request within 45 days of receipt from the State  Historic Preservation Officer or Federal Preservation Officer, or within  90 days of receipt from a person or local government where there is no  approved State Historic Preservation Program, concerning whether or not  the move is approved. Once the property is moved, the State Historic  Preservation Officer, Federal Preservation Officer, or person or local  government where there is no approved State Historic Preservation  Program shall submit to the Keeper for review:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A letter notifying him or her of the date the property was  moved;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Photographs of the property on its new site; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Revised maps, including a U.S.G.S. map,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Acreage, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Verbal boundary description.  The Keeper shall respond to a properly documented submittal within 45  days of receipt with the final decision on whether the property will  remain in the National Register. If the Keeper approves the move, the  property will remain in the National Register during and after the move  unless the integrity of the property is in some unforeseen manner  destroyed. If the Keeper does not approve the move, the property will be  automatically deleted from the National Register when moved. In cases of  properties removed from the National Register, if the State, Federal  agency, or person or local government where there is no approved State  Historic Preservation Program has neglected to obtain prior approval for  the move or has evidence that previously unrecognized significance  exists, or has accrued, the State, Federal agency, person or local  government may resubmit a nomination for the property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the event that a property is moved, deletion from the  National Register will be automatic unless the above procedures are  followed prior to the move. If the property has already been moved, it  is the responsibility of the State, Federal agency or person or local  government which nominated the property to notify the National Park  Service. Assuming that the State, Federal agency or person or local  government wishes to have the structure reentered in the National  Register, it must be nominated again on new forms which should discuss:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The reasons for the move;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The effect on the property's historical integrity, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The new setting and general environment, including evidence  that the new site does not possess historical or archeological  significance that would be adversely affected by intrusion of the  property.  In addition, new photographs, acreage, verbal boundary description and a  U.S.G.S. map showing the structure at its new location must be sent  along with the revised nomination. Any such nomination submitted by a  State must be approved by the State Review Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Properties moved in a manner consistent with the comments of the  Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, in accord with its procedures  (36 CFR part 800), are granted as exception to Sec. 60.12(b). Moving of  properties in accord with the Advisory Council's procedures should be  dealt with individually in each memorandum of agreement. In such cases,  the State Historic Preservation Officer or the Federal Preservation  Officer, for properties under Federal ownership or control, shall notify  the Keeper of the new location after the move including new  documentation as described above.</p>
