                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In the 1949 amendments to the Act, the term ``retail or service  establishment'', which was not previously defined in the law, was given  a special definition for purposes of the Act. The legislative history of  the 1961 and the 1966 amendments to the Act, which use the same term in  a number of provisions relating to coverage and exemptions, indicates  that no different meaning was intended by the term ``retail or service  establishment'' as used in the new provisions from that already  established by the Act's definition. On the contrary, the existing  definition was reenacted in section 13(a)(2) of the Act as amended in  1961 and 1966 as follows: ``A `retail or service establishment' shall  mean an establishment 75 per centum of whose annual dollar volume of  sales of goods or services (or of both) is not for resale and is  recognized as retail sales or services in the particular industry''. The  application of this definition, which has had much judicial construction  since its original enactment, is considered at length in subpart D of  this part. As is apparent from the quoted language, not every  establishment which engages in retail selling of goods or services will  constitute a ``retail or service establishment'' within the meaning of  the Act.</p>
