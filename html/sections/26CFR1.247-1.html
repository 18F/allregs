                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Amount of deduction. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A deduction is provided in section 247  for dividends paid during the taxable year by certain public utility  corporations (see paragraph (b) of this section) on certain preferred  stock (see paragraph (c) of this section). This deduction is an amount  equal to the product of a specified fraction times the lesser of (i) the  amount of the dividends paid during the taxable year by a public utility  on its preferred stock (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section), or  (ii) the taxable income of the public utility for such taxable year  (computed without regard to the deduction allowed by section 247). The  specified fraction for any taxable year is the fraction the numerator of  which is 14 and the denominator of which is the sum of the corporation  normal tax rate and the surtax rate for such taxable year specified in  section 11. Since section 11 provides that for the calendar year 1954  the corporation normal tax rate is 30 percent and the surtax rate is 22  percent, the sum of the two tax rates is 52 percent and the specified  fraction for the calendar year 1954 is 14/52. If, for example, section  11 should specify that the corporation's normal tax rate is 25 percent  and the surtax rate is 22 percent for the calendar year, the sum of the  two tax rates will be 47 percent and the specified fraction for the  calendar year will be 14/47. If Corporation A, a public utility which  files its income tax return on the calendar year basis, pays $100,000  dividends on its preferred stock in the calendar year 1954 and if its  taxable income for such year is greater than $100,000 the deduction  allowable to Corporation A under section 247 for 1954 is $100,000 times  14/52, or $26,923.08. If in 1954 Corporation A's taxable income,  computed without regard to the deduction provided in section 247, had  been $90,000 (that is, less than the amount of the dividends which it  paid on its preferred stock in that year), the deduction allowable under  section 247 for 1954 would have been $90,000 times 14/52, or $24,230.77.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the purpose of determining the amount of the deduction  provided in section 247(a) and in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph,  the amount of dividends paid in a given taxable year shall not include  any amount distributed in such year with respect to dividends unpaid and  accumulated in any taxable year ending before October 1, 1942. If any  distribution is made in the current taxable year with respect to  dividends unpaid and accumulated for a prior taxable year, such  distribution will be deemed to have been made with respect to the  earliest year or years for which there are dividends unpaid and  accumulated. Thus, if a public utility makes a distribution with respect  to a prior taxable year, it shall be considered that such distribution  was made with respect to the earliest year or years for which there are  dividends unpaid and accumulated, whether or not the public utility  states that the distribution was made with respect to such year or years  and even though the public utility stated that the distribution was made  with respect to a later year. Even though it has dividends unpaid and  accumulated with respect to a taxable year ending before October 1,  1942, a public utility may, however, include the dividends paid with  respect to the current taxable year in computing the deduction under  section 247. If there are no dividends unpaid and accumulated with  respect to a taxable year ending before October 1, 1942, a public  utility may include the dividends paid with respect to a prior taxable  year which ended after October 1, 1942, in computing the deduction under  section 247; such public utility in addition may include the dividends  paid with respect to the current taxable year in computing the deduction  under section 247. However, if local law or its own charter requires a  public utility to pay all unpaid and accumulated dividends before any  dividends can be paid with respect to the current taxable year, such  public utility may not include any distribution in the current year in  computing the deduction under section 247 to the extent that there are  dividends unpaid and accumulated with   respect to taxable years ending before October 1, 1942.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a corporation which is engaged in one or more of the four  types of business activities (called utility activities in this section)  enumerated in section 247(b)(1) (the furnishing of telephone service or  the sale of electrical energy, gas, or water) is also engaged in some  other business that does not fall within any of the enumerated  categories, the deduction under section 247 is allowable only for such  portion of the amount computed under section 247(a) as is allocable to  the income from utility activities. For this purpose, the allocation may  be made on the basis of the ratio which the total income from the  utility activities bears to total income from all sources (total income  being considered either gross income or gross receipts, whichever method  results in the higher deduction). However, if such an allocation reaches  an inequitable result and the books of the corporation are so kept that  the taxable income attributable to the utility activities can be readily  determined, particularly where the books of the corporation are required  by governmental bodies to be so kept for rate making or other purposes,  the allocation may be made upon the basis of taxable income. No such  apportionment will be required if the income from sources other than  utility activities is less than 20 percent of the total income of the  corporation, irrespective of the method used in determining such total  income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Public utility. As used in section 247 and this section, public  utility means a corporation engaged in the furnishing of telephone  service, or in the sale of electric energy, gas, or water if the rates  charged by such corporation for such furnishing or sale, as the case may  be, have been established or approved by a State or political  subdivision thereof or by an agency or instrumentality of the United  States or by a public utility or public service commission or other  similar body of the District of Columbia or of any State or political  subdivision thereof. If a schedule of rates has been filed with any of  the above bodies having the power to disapprove such rates, then such  rates shall be considered as established or approved rates even though  such body has taken no action on the filed schedule. Rates fixed by  contract between the corporation and the purchaser, except where the  purchaser is the United States, a State, the District of Columbia, or an  agency or political subdivision of the United States, a State, or the  District of Columbia, shall not be considered as established or approved  rates in those cases where they are not subject to direct control, or  where no maximum rate for such contract rates has been established by  the United States, a State, the District of Columbia, or by an agency or  political subdivision thereof. The deduction provided in section 247  will not be denied solely because part of the gross income of the  corporation consists of revenue derived from such furnishing or sale at  rates which are not so regulated, provided the corporation establishes  to the satisfaction of the Commissioner (1) that the revenue from  regulated rates and the revenue from unregulated rates are derived from  the operation of a single interconnected and coordinated system within a  single area or region in one or more States, or from the operation of  more than one such system and (2) that the regulation to which it is  subject in part of its operating territory in one such system is  effective to control rates within the unregulated territory of the same  system so that the rates within the unregulated territory have been and  are substantially as favorable to users and consumers as are the rates  within the regulated territory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Preferred stock. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the purposes of section 247 and this  section, preferred stock means stock (i) which was issued before October  1, 1942, (ii) the dividends in respect of which (during the whole of the  taxable year, or the part of the taxable year after the actual date of  the issue of such stock) were cumulative, nonparticipating as to current  distributions, and payable in preference to the payment of dividends on  other stock, and (iii) the rate of return on which is fixed and cannot  be changed by a vote of the board of directors or by some similar  method. However, if there are several classes of preferred stock, all of  which meet the   above requirements, the deduction provided in section 247 shall not be  denied in the case of a given class of preferred stock merely because  there is another class of preferred stock whose dividends are to be paid  before those of the given class of stock. Likewise, it is immaterial for  the purposes of section 247 and this section whether the stock be voting  or nonvoting stock.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> (or the corresponding  provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939), no stock issued to  refund or replace such stock can be considered preferred stock for  purposes of the deduction provided in section 247.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of any preferred stock issued on or after October 1,  1942, to refund or replace bonds or debentures issued before October 1,  1942, or to refund or replace other stock which was preferred stock  within the meaning of section 247(b)(2) (or the corresponding provision  of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939), only that portion of the stock  issued on or after October 1, 1942, will be considered as having been  issued before October 1, 1942, the par or stated value of which does not  exceed the par, stated, or face value of such bonds, debentures, or  other preferred stock which the new stock was issued to refund or  replace. In such case no shares of the new stock issued on or after  October 1, 1942, shall be earmarked in determining the deduction  allowable under section 247, but the appropriate allocable portion of  the total amount of dividends paid on such stock will be considered as  having been paid on stock which was issued before October 1, 1942.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The provisions of section 247(b)(2) may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth3">Example. A public utility has outstanding 1,000 bonds which were  issued before October 1, 1942, and each of which has a face value of  $100. On or after October 1, 1942, each of such bonds is retired in  exchange for 1\1/10\ shares of preferred stock issued on or after  October 1, 1942, and having a par value of $100 per share. Only \10/11\  of the dividends paid on the preferred stock thus issued in exchange for  the bonds will be considered as having been paid on stock which was  issued before October 1, 1942. Likewise, if preferred stock which is  issued on or after October 1, 1942, has no par value but a stated value  of $50 per share and such stock is issued in a ratio of three shares to  one share to refund or replace preferred stock having a par value of  $100 per share, only two-thirds of the dividends paid on the new shares  of stock will be considered as having been paid on stock which was  issued before October 1, 1942.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether or not preferred stock issued on or after October 1,  1942, was issued to refund or replace bonds or debentures issued before  October 1, 1942, or to refund or replace other preferred stock, is in  each case a question of fact. Among the factors to be considered is  whether such stock is new in an economic sense to the corporation or  whether it was issued merely to take the place, directly or indirectly,  of bonds, debentures, or other preferred stock of such corporation. It  is not necessary that the new preferred stock be issued in exchange for  such bonds, debentures, or other preferred stock. The mere fact that the  bonds, debentures, or other preferred stock remain in existence for a  short period of time after the issuance of the new stock (or were  retired before the issuance of the new stock) does not necessarily mean  that   such new stock was not issued to refund or replace such bonds,  debentures, or other preferred stock. It is necessary to consider the  entire transaction, including the issuance of the new preferred stock,  the date of such issuance, the retirement of the old bonds, debentures,  or preferred stock, and the date of such retirement, in order to  determine whether such new stock really was issued to take the place of  bonds, debentures, or other preferred stock of the corporation or  whether it represents something essentially new in an economic sense in  the corporation's financial structure. If, for example, a public  utility, which has outstanding bonds issued before October 1, 1942,  issues new preferred stock on October 1, 1954, in order to secure funds  with which to retire such bonds and with the money paid in for such  stock retires the bonds on November 1, 1954, such stock may be  considered as having been issued to refund or replace bonds issued  before October 1, 1942. Whether the money used to retire the bonds can  be traced back and identified as the money paid in for the stock will  have evidentiary value, but will not be conclusive, in determining  whether the stock was issued to refund or replace the bonds. Similarly,  whether the amount of money used to retire the bonds was smaller than,  equal to, or greater than that paid in for the stock, or whether the  entire issue of bonds is retired, will be important, but not decisive,  in making such determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Preferred stock issued on or after October 1, 1942, by a  corporation to refund or replace bonds or debentures of a second  corporation which were issued before October 1, 1942, or to refund or  replace other preferred stock of such second corporation, may be  considered as having been issued before October 1, 1942, if such new  stock was issued (i) in a transaction which is a reorganization within  the meaning of section 368(a) or the corresponding provisions of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1939; or (ii) in a transaction to which section  371 (relating to insolvency reorganizations), or the corresponding  provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, is applicable; or (iii)  in a transaction which is subject to the provisions of Part VI,  Subchapter O, Chapter 1 of the Code (relating to exchanges and  distributions in obedience to orders of the Securities and Exchange  Commission) or to the corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue  Code of 1939. Whether the stock actually was issued to refund or replace  bonds or debentures of the second corporation issued before October 1,  1942, or to refund or replace preferred stock of such second  corporation, shall be determined under the same principles as if only  one corporation were involved. A corporation may issue stock to refund  or replace its own bonds, debentures, or other preferred stock in a  transaction which is a reorganization within the meaning of section  368(a) or the corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of  1939, in a transaction to which section 371 or the corresponding  provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 is applicable, or in a  transaction which is subject to the provisions of Part VI, Subchapter O,  Chapter 1 of the Code, or to the corresponding provisions of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1939. The provisions of this paragraph, in  addition, are applicable in case a corporation issues stock on or after  October 1, 1942, to refund or replace its own bonds, debentures, or  other preferred stock even though the issuance of such stock may not  fall within one of the categories enumerated above.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Even though stock issued on or after October 1, 1942, is  considered as having been issued before October 1, 1942, by reason of  having been issued to refund or replace bonds or debentures issued  before October 1, 1942, or to refund or replace other preferred stock,  such stock will not be deemed to be preferred stock within the meaning  of section 247(b)(2), and no deduction will be allowable in respect of  dividends paid on such stock, unless the stock fulfills all the other  requirements of a preferred stock set forth in section 247(b)(2) and in  this paragraph.</p>
