such injury or death may be held to have been incurred in active service for Department of Veterans Affairs purposes. Determination shall be based on all available evidence, including service department reports, and consideration shall be given to the character and length of the veteran's former active service in the Armed Forces of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A prisoner-of-war status based upon arrest during general zonification will not be sufficient of itself to bring a case within the definition of return to military control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The active service of members of the irregular forces guerrilla will be the period certified by the service department.
