Such records or other evidentiary material must include information on how, when, where, and by whom the animals were taken, what processing has taken place since taking, and the date and location of such processing; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement from a government agency of the country of origin exercising jurisdiction over marine mammals that any and all such mammals from which the products sought to be imported were derived were taken prior to December 21, 1972.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Service agents, or Customs officers, may refuse to clear marine mammals or marine mammal products for importation into the United States, pursuant to Sec.  14.53 of this subchapter, until the importer can demonstrate, by production of the affidavit referred in above or otherwise, that section 102(e) of the Act applies to all affected items.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> This section has no application to any marine mammal or marine mammal product intended to be imported pursuant to Sec.  18.21, Sec.  18.31 or Sec.  18.32 of this part.
