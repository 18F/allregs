Exception: The three-foot (.91 m) clearance is not required on the covered portion of a partially open hatch, nor is it required when lower

decks have been filled to hatch beam height with cargo of such a nature as to provide a safe surface upon which employees may work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There shall be a three-foot (.91 m) working space between the stowed cargo and the coaming at both sides and at one end of the hatches with athwartship hatch beams, and at both ends of those hatches with fore and aft hatch beams, before intermediate deck hatch covers and hatch beams are removed or replaced.
