The distribution panel must be above the uppermost  continuous deck, in the zone served, and there must be no disconnect  switches for the branch circuits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A branch circuit must not supply emergency alarm signal on more  than one deck level, except for a single branch circuit supplying all  levels of a single space containing more than one deck level if all  other requirements of this section are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> On a vessel not divided into fire zones by main vertical fire  bulkheads, the general emergency alarm system must be arranged into  vertical service zones not more than 40 meters (131 feet) long, and  there must be a general alarm feeder for each of these zones that has  general emergency alarm signal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> General alarm feeders and branch circuit cables must be in  passageways and must not be in staterooms, lockers, galleys, machinery  spaces, or other enclosed spaces, unless it is necessary to supply  general emergency alarm signal in those spaces.
