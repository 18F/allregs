The finished copolymers contain at least 50 weight-percent of polymer units derived from vinyldene chloride.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Optional adjuvant substances employed in the production of the coatings or added thereto to impart desired properties may include sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate in addition to substances described in Sec.  174.5(d) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The coating in the finished form in which it is to contact food, when extracted with the solvent or solvents characterizing the type of food, and under the conditions of time and temperature characterizing the conditions of its intended use as determined from tables 1 and 2 of Sec.  176.170(c) of this chapter, shall yield net chloroform-soluble extractives in each extracting solvent not to exceed 0.5 milligram per square inch of coated surface as determined by the methods described in Sec.  176.170(d) of this chapter. In testing the finished food-contact articles, a separate test sample is to be used for each required extracting solvent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Acrylonitrile copolymers identified in this section shall comply with the provisons of Sec.  180.22 of this chapter.</p>
