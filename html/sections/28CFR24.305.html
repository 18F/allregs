Such further action shall occur only when  necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the  application and shall take place as promptly as possible. A motion for  further filings or other action shall specifically identify the  information sought on the disputed issues and shall explain why the  further filings or other action is necessary to resolve the issues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the event that an evidentiary hearing is required or  permitted by the adjudicative officer, such hearing and any related  filings or other action required or permitted shall be conducted  pursuant to the procedural rules governing adversary adjudications  conducted by the Department component in which the underlying adversary  adjudication was conducted.</p>
