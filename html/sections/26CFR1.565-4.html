                                Sec. 1.565-4  Consent dividends and other distributions.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Section 565(d) provides a rule applicable where a distribution is made in part in consent dividends and in part in money or other property. With respect to such a distribution the entire amount specified in the consents and the amount of such money or other property shall be considered together. Thus, if as a part of the same distribution consents are filed by some of the shareholders and cash is distributed to other shareholders, for example, those who may be unwilling to sign consents, the total amount of the cash and the amounts specified in the consents will be viewed as a single distribution to determine the tax effects of such distribution. For example, the total of such amounts must be considered to

determine whether the distribution (including the amounts specified in the consents) is preferential and whether any part of such distribution would not be dividends if the total amounts specified in the consents were distributed in cash. See paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.565-2 for examples illustrating the treatment of distributions which consist in part of consent dividends and in part of other property.</p>
