                                Sec. 1952.11  State and local government employee programs.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each approved State plan must contain satisfactory assurances  that the State will, to the extent permitted by its law, establish and  maintain an effective and comprehensive occupational safety and health  program applicable to all employees of public agencies of the State and  its political subdivisions which program is as effective as the  standards contained in an approved plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This criteria for approved State plans is interpreted to require  the following elements with regard to coverage, standards, and  enforcement:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Coverage. The program must cover all public employees over which  the State has legislative authority under its constitution. ``To the  extent permitted by its law,'' specifically recognizes the situation  where local governments exclusively control their own employees, such as  under certain ``home rule'' charters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Standards. The program must be as effective as the standards  contained in the approved plan applicable to private employers. Thus,  the same criteria and indices of standards effectiveness contained in  Secs. 1902.3(c) and 1902.4 (a) and (b) of this chapter would apply to  the public employee program. Where hazards are unique to public  employment, all appropriate indices of effectiveness, such as those  dealing with temporary emergency standards, development of standards,  employee information, variances, and protective equipment, would be  applicable to standards for such hazards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Enforcement. Although section 18(c)(6) of the Act requires State  public employee programs to be ``as effective as standards'' contained  in the State plan, minimum enforcement elements are required to ensure  an ``effective and comprehensive'' public employee program as follows:  (See notice of approval of the North Carolina Plan, 38 FR 3041).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Regular inspections of workplaces, including inspections in  response to valid employee complaints;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A means for employees to bring possible violations to the  attention of inspectors;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Notification to employees, or their representatives, of  decisions that no violations are found as a result of complaints by such  employees or their representatives, and informal review of such  decisions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A means of informing employees of their protections and  obligations under the Act;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Protection for employees against discharge of discrimination  because of the exercise of rights under the Act;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Employee access to information on their exposure to toxic  materials or harmful physical agents and prompt notification to  employees when they have been or are being exposed to such materials or  agents at concentrations or levels above those specified by the  applicable standards;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Procedures for the prompt restraint or elimination of imminent  danger situations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> A means of promptly notifying employers and employees when an  alleged violation has occurred, including the proposed abatement  requirements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> A means of establishing timetables for the correction of  violations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> A program for encouraging voluntary compliance; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Such other additional enforcement provisions under State law as  may have been included in the State plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In accordance with Sec. 1902.3(b)(3), the State agency or  agencies designated to administer the plan throughout the State must  retain overall responsibility for the entire plan. Political  subdivisions may have the responsibility and authority for the  development and enforcement of standards: Provided, That the designated  State agency or agencies have adequate authority by statute, regulation,  or agreement to insure that the commitments of the State under the plan  will be fulfilled.  These commitments supersede and control any delegation of authority to  State or local agencies. (See Notice of Approval of Colorado Plan, 38 FR  25172.)
