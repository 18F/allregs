These  requirements apply at all times.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must add the dry pigments and solids that contain compounds  of cadmium, chromium, lead, or nickel and operate a capture system that  minimizes fugitive particulate emissions during the addition of dry  pigments and solids that contain compounds of cadmium, chromium, lead,  or nickel to a process vessel or to the grinding and milling process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must capture particulate emissions and route them to a  particulate control device meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(6)  of this section during the addition of dry pigments and solids that  contain compounds of cadmium, chromium, lead, or nickel to a process  vessel. This requirement does not apply to pigments and other solids  that are in paste, slurry, or liquid form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Capture particulate emissions and route them to a particulate  control device meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(6) of this  section during the addition of dry pigments and solids that contain  compounds of cadmium, chromium, lead, or nickel to the grinding and  milling process; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Add pigments and other solids that contain compounds of  cadmium, chromium, lead, or nickel to the grinding and milling process  only in paste, slurry, or liquid form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Capture particulate emissions and route them to a particulate  control device meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this  section during the grinding and milling of materials containing  compounds of cadmium, chromium, lead, or nickel; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fully enclose the grinding and milling equipment during the  grinding and milling of materials containing compounds of cadmium,  chromium, lead, or nickel; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Ensure that the pigments and solids are in the solution during  the grinding and milling of materials containing compounds of cadmium,  chromium, lead, or nickel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The visible emissions from the particulate control device  exhaust must not exceed 10-percent opacity for particulate control  devices that vent to the atmosphere.

The 90-percent contact requirement is  calculated by subtracting the length of any visible gaps from the  circumference of the process vessel, and dividing this number by the  circumference of the process vessel. The resulting ratio must not exceed  90-percent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The covers or lids must be maintained in good condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mixing vessels that store or process materials containing  benzene or methylene chloride must be equipped with covers that  completely cover the vessel, except as necessary to allow for safe  clearance of the mixer shaft.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All vessels that store or process materials containing benzene  or methylene chloride must be kept covered at all times, except for  quality control testing and product sampling, addition of materials,  material removal, or when the vessel is empty. The vessel is empty if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All materials containing benzene or methylene chloride have been  removed that can be removed using the practices commonly employed to  remove materials from that type of vessel, e.g., pouring, pumping, and  aspirating; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No more than 2.5 centimeters (one inch) depth of residue  remains on the bottom of the vessel, or no more than 3 percent by weight  of the total capacity of the vessel remains in the vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Leaks and spills of materials containing benzene or methylene  chloride must be minimized and cleaned up as soon as practical, but no  longer than 1 hour from the time of detection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Rags or other materials that use a solvent containing benzene or  methylene chloride for cleaning must be kept in a closed container. The  closed container may contain a device that allows pressure relief, but  does not allow   liquid solvent to drain from the container.
