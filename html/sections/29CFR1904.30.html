Yes, however, you do not have to keep a  separate OSHA 300 Log for each such establishment. You may keep one OSHA  300 Log that covers all of your short-term establishments. You may also  include the short-term establishments' recordable injuries and illnesses  on an OSHA 300 Log that covers short-term establishments for individual  company divisions or geographic regions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> May I keep the records for all of my establishments at my  headquarters location or at some other central location? Yes, you may  keep the records for an establishment at your headquarters or other  central location if you can:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Transmit information about the injuries and illnesses from the  establishment to the central location within seven (7) calendar days of  receiving information that a recordable injury or illness has occurred;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Produce and send the records from the central location to the  establishment within the time frames required by  1904.35 and  1904.40 when you are required to provide records to a government  representative, employees, former employees or employee representatives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Some of my employees work at several different locations or do  not work at any of my establishments at all. How do I record cases for  these employees? You must link each of your employees with one of your  establishments, for recordkeeping purposes. You must record the injury  and illness on the OSHA 300 Log of the injured or ill employee's  establishment, or on an OSHA 300 Log that covers that employee's short- term establishment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> How do I record an injury or illness when an employee of one of  my establishments is injured or becomes ill while visiting or working at  another of my establishments, or while working away from any of my  establishments? If the injury or illness occurs at one of your  establishments, you must record the injury or illness on the OSHA 300  Log of the establishment at which the injury or illness occurred. If the  employee is injured or becomes ill and is not at one of your  establishments, you must record the case on the OSHA 300 Log at the  establishment at which the employee normally works.</p>
