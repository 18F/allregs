A suggested format is  available from the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following types of amendments to a license will be  considered: Addition of U.S. freight forwarder or U.S. consignor; change  due to an obvious typographical error; change in source of commodity;  and change of foreign intermediate consignee if that party is only  transporting the equipment and will not process (e.g., integrate,  modify) the equipment. For changes in U.S. dollar value see Sec.  123.23.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following types of amendments to a license will not be  approved: Additional quantity, changes in commodity, country of ultimate  destination, end-use or end-user, foreign consignee and/or extension of  duration. The foreign intermediate consignee may only be amended if that  party is acting as freight forwarder and the export does not involve  technical data. A new license is required for these changes. Any new  license submission must reflect only the unshipped balance of quantity  and dollar value.
