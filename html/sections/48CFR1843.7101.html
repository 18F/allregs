                            <p class="depth0">This subpart establishes and describes the methods for implementing  and administering a Shared Savings Program. This program provides an  incentive for contractors to propose and implement, with NASA approval,  significant cost reduction initiatives. NASA will benefit as the more  efficient business practices that are implemented lead to reduced costs  on current and follow-on contracts. In return, contractors are entitled  to share in cost savings subject to limits established in the contract.  The contracting officer may require the contractor to provide periodic  reporting, or other justification, or to require other steps (e.g., cost  segregation) to ensure projected cost savings are being realized.</p>
