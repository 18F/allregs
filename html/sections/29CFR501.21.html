In addition, WHD may take such action as appropriate, including initiating proceedings for the debarment of the employer from future certification for up to 3 years, seeking an injunction, and/or assessing civil money penalties against any person who has failed to cooperate with a WHD investigation. The taking of any one action shall not bar the taking of any additional action.</p>
