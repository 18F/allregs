Owing to the fact that it is impracticable to  formulate rules for each specific disease or conditions and to designate  at just what stage a disease process results in an adulterated article,  the decision as to the disposal of all carcasses, organs or other parts  not specifically covered by the regulations, or by instructions of the  Administrator issued pursuant thereto, shall be left to the inspector in  charge, and if the inspector in charge is in doubt concerning the  disposition to be made, specimens from such carcasses shall be forwarded  to the Inspection Service laboratory for diagnosis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All carcasses, organs, or other parts of carcasses of poultry  shall be condemned if it is determined on the basis of a sound  statistical sample that they are adulterated because of the presence of  any biological residues.</p>
