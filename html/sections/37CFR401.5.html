                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Agencies should complete the blank in paragraph (g)(2) of the clauses at Sec.  401.14 in accordance with their own or applicable government-wide regulations such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation. In grants and cooperative agreements (and in contracts, if not inconsistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation) agencies wishing to apply the same clause to all subcontractors as is applied to the contractor may delete paragraph (g)(2) of the clause and delete the words ``to be performed by a small business firm or domestic nonprofit organization'' from paragraph (g)(1). Also, if the funding agreement is a grant or cooperative agreement, paragraph (g)(3) may be deleted. When either paragraph (g)(2) or paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) are deleted, the remaining paragraph or paragraphs should be renumbered appropriately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Agencies should complete paragraph (l), ``Communications'', at the end of the clauses at Sec.  401.14 by designating a central point of contact for communications on matters relating to the clause. Additional instructions on communications may also be included in paragraph (l).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Agencies may replace the italicized words and phrases in the clauses at Sec.  401.14 with those appropriate to the particular funding agreement. For example, ``contracts'' could be replaced by ``grant,'' ``contractor'' by ``grantee,'' and ``contracting officer'' by ``grants officer.'' Depending on its use, ``Federal agency'' can be replaced either by the identification of the agency or by the specification of the particular office or official within the agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> When the agency head or duly authorized designee determines at the time of contracting with a small business firm or nonprofit organization that it would be in the national interest to acquire the right to sublicense foreign governments or international organizations pursuant to any existing treaty or international agreement, a sentence may be added at the end of paragraph (b) of the clause at Sec.  401.14 as follows:</p><p class="depth0">This license will include the right of the government to sublicense foreign governments, their nationals, and international organizations, pursuant to the following treaties or international agreements:
----------------.

The blank above should be completed with the names of applicable existing treaties or international agreements, agreements of cooperation, memoranda of understanding, or similar arrangements, including military agreements relating to weapons development and production. The above language is not intended to apply to treaties or other agreements that are in effect on the date of the award but which are not listed. Alternatively, agencies may use substantially similar language relating the government's rights to specific treaties or other agreements identified elsewhere in the funding agreement. The language may also be modified to make clear that the rights granted to the foreign government, and its nationals or an international organization may be for additional rights beyond a license or sublicense if so required by the applicable treaty or international agreement. For example, in some exclusive licenses or even the assignment of title in the foreign country involved might be required. Agencies may also modify the language above to provide for the direct licensing by the contractor of the foreign government or international organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> If the funding agreement involves performance over an extended period of time, such as the typical funding agreement for the operation of a government-owned facility, the following language may also be added:</p><p class="depth0">The agency reserves the right to unilaterally amend this funding agreement to identify specific treaties or international agreements entered into or to be entered into by the government after the effective date of this funding agreement and effectuate those license or other rights which are necessary for the government to meet its obligations to foreign governments, their nationals and international organizations under such treaties or international agreements with respect to subject inventions made after the date of the amendment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Agencies may add additional subparagraphs to paragraph (f) of the clauses at Sec.  401.14 to require the contractor to do one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Provide a report prior to the close-out of a funding agreement listing all subject inventions or stating that there were none.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provide, upon request, the filing date, patent application number and title; a copy of the patent application; and patent number and issue date for any subject invention in any country in which the contractor has applied for a patent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Provide periodic (but no more frequently than annual) listings of all subject inventions which were disclosed to the agency during the period covered by the report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> If the contract is with a nonprofit organization and is for the operation of a government-owned, contractor-operated facility, the following will be substituted for paragraph (k)(3) of the clause at Sec.  401.14(a):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> After payment of patenting costs, licensing costs, payments to inventors, and other expenses incidental to the administration of subject inventions, the balance of any royalties or income earned and retained by the contractor during any fiscal year on subject inventions under this or any successor contract containing the same requirement, up to any amount equal to five percent of the budget of the facility for that fiscal year, shall be used by the contractor for scientific research, development, and education consistent with the research and development mission and objectives of the facility, including activities that increase the licensing potential of other inventions of the facility. If the balance exceeds five percent, 75 percent of the excess above five percent shall be paid by the contractor to the Treasury of the United States and the remaining 25 percent shall be used by the contractor only for the same purposes as described above. To the extent it provides the most effective technology transfer, the licensing of subject inventions shall be administered by contractor employees on location at the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> If the contract is for the operation of a government-owned facility, agencies may add the following at the end of paragraph (f) of the clause at Sec.  401.14(a):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The contractor shall establish and maintain active and effective procedures to ensure that subject inventions are promptly identified and timely disclosed and shall submit a description of the procedures to the

contracting officer so that the contracting officer may evaluate and determine their effectiveness.
