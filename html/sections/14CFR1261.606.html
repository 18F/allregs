                                Sec. 1261.606  Salary offset request by a creditor agency other than NASA
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Format of the request. Upon completion of the procedures  established by the creditor agency under 5 U.S.C. 5514, the creditor  agency must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certify, in writing, that the employee owes the debt, the amount  and basis of the debt, the date on which payment(s) is/are due, the date  the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, and that the  creditor agency's regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 have been  approved by OPM;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the collection must be made in installments, the creditor  agency must also advise NASA of the number of installments to be  collected, the amount of each installment, and the commencing date of  the first installment, if a date other than the next officially  established pay period is required; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unless the employee has consented to the salary offset in  writing or signed a statement acknowledging receipt of the required  procedures and the writing or statement is attached to the debt claim  request, the creditor agency must also indicate the action(s) taken  under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(2) and give the date(s) the action(s) was/were  taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Employees who are separating or have separated--(1) Employees  who are in the process of separating. If the employee is in the process  of separating, the creditor agency must submit its debt claim to the  employee's paying   agency for collection as provided in 5 CFR 550.1104</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of the OPM  regulations (14 CFR 1261.603(f)) for ``liquidation from final check.''  NASA must then certify the total amount of its collection and notify the  creditor agency and the employee as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this  section. If NASA is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from  the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar  payments, it should notify the creditor agency and forward the copy of  the debt claim and certification to the agency responsible for making  such payments as notice that a debt is outstanding. However, the  creditor agency, not NASA, must submit a properly certified claim to the  agency responsible for making such payments before collection can be  made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Employees who have already separated. If the employee is already  separated and all payments due from NASA have been paid, NASA must  return the claim to the creditor agency for any further collection,  indicating the employee's date of separation and the current employment  and mailing address(es), if known.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Employee who transfers from NASA to another Federal agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Certification of amount collected. If, after the creditor agency  has submitted the debt claim to NASA, the employee transfers to another  Federal agency before the debt is collected in full, NASA must then  certify the total amount of the collection made on the debt. A copy of  the certification should be furnished the employee, and another copy  furnished to the creditor agency along with notice of the employee's  transfer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Official personnel folder insertion; new paying agency.  Information on the debt claim must be inserted in the employee's  official personnel folder along with a copy of the certification of the  amount which has been collected. Upon receiving the official personnel  folder, the new paying agency must resume the collection from the  employee's current pay account and notify the employee and the creditor  agency of the resumption. It will not be necessary for the creditor  agency to repeat the due process procedures described by 5 U.S.C. 5514  of this subpart in order to resume the collection. However, it will be  the responsibility of the creditor agency to review the debt upon  receiving NASA's notice of the employee's transfer to make sure the  collection is resumed by the new paying agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Processing the debt claim upon receipt--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Incomplete claim. If  NASA receives incomplete debt claim information, it must return the  request with a notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this  subpart must be provided and complete debt claim information received  before action will be taken to collect from the employee's current pay  account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Complete claim. If NASA receives a properly documented debt  claim, deductions should be scheduled to begin prospectively at the next  officially established pay interval. A copy of the debt claim request  must be given to the debtor, along with notice of the date deductions  will commence if different from that stated on the debt claim request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> NASA is not required or authorized to review the merits of the  creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity  of the debt as stated in the debt claim request.</p>
