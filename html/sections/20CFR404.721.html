                            <p class="depth0">If you cannot prove the person is dead but evidence of death is  needed, we will presume he or she died at a certain time if you give us  the following evidence:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A certified copy of, or extract from, an official report or  finding by an agency or department of the United States that a missing  person is presumed to be dead as set out in Federal law (5 U.S.C. 5565).  Unless we have other evidence showing an actual date of death, we will  use the date he or she   was reported missing as the date of death.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Signed statements by those in a position to know and other  records which show that the person has been absent from his or her  residence and has not been heard from for at least 7 years. If the  presumption of death is not rebutted pursuant to Sec. 404.722, we will  use as the person's date of death either the date he or she left home,  the date ending the 7 year period, or some other date depending upon  what the evidence shows is the most likely date of death.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you are applying for benefits as the insured person's  grandchild or stepgrandchild but the evidence does not identify a  parent, we will presume the parent died in the first month in which the  insured person became entitled to benefits.
