                                Sec. 20.6075-1  Returns; time for filing estate tax return.

                            <p class="depth0">The estate tax return required by section 6018 must be filed on or  before the due date. The due date is the date on or before which the  return is required to be filed in accordance with the provisions of  section 6075(a) or the   last day of the period covered by an extension of time as provided in  Sec. 20.6081-1. The due date, for a decedent dying after December 31,  1970, is, unless an extension of time for filing has been obtained, the  day of the ninth calendar month after the decedent's death numerically  corresponding to the day of the calendar month on which death occurred.  However, if there is no numerically corresponding day in the ninth  month, the last day of the ninth month is the due date. For example, if  the decedent dies on July 31, 2000, the estate tax return and tax  payment must be made on or before April 30, 2001. When the due date  falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, the due date for filing  the return is the next succeeding day that is not Saturday, Sunday, or a  legal holiday. For the definition of a legal holiday, see section 7503  and Sec. 301.7503-1 of this chapter. As to additions to the tax in the  case of failure to file the return or pay the tax within the prescribed  time, see section 6651 and Sec. 301.6651-1 of this chapter. For rules  with respect to the right to elect to have the property valued as of a  date or dates subsequent to the decedent's death, see section 2032 and  Sec. 20.2032-1, and section 7502 and Sec. 301.7502-1 of this chapter.  This section applies to estates of decedents dying after August 16,  1954.  [T.D. 8957, 66 FR 38546, July 25, 2001]</p>
