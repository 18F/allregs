                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The requirements of subpart G and Sec. 51.281 of this chapter are not met since the plan does not provide the degree of control necessary to attain and maintain the national standards for particulate matter in Gila, Maricopa, Pima, Pinal, and Santa Cruz Counties. Therefore, Regulation 7-1-3.6 (process industries) of the Arizona Rules and Regulations for Air Pollution Control is disapproved for Gila, Maricopa, Pima, Pinal, and Santa Cruz Counties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Replacement regulation for Regulation 7-1-3.6 of the Arizona Rules and Regulations for Air Pollution Control (Gila, Maricopa, Pima, Pinal, and Santa Cruz Counties). (1) No owner or operator of any stationary process source in Gila, Maricopa, Pima, Pinal, or Santa Cruz County shall discharge or cause the discharge of particulate matter into the atmosphere in excess of the hourly rate shown in the following table for the process weight rate identified for such source:</p><p class="depth0">[In pounds per hour]------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Process</p><p class="depth0">Process weight rate             Emission    weight    Emission</p><p class="depth0">rate       rate       rate------------------------------------------------------------------------50.....................................       0.36     60,000      29.60100....................................       0.55     80,000      31.19500....................................       1.53    120,000      33.281,000..................................       2.25    160,000      34.855,000..................................       6.34    200,000      36.1110,000.................................       9.73    400,000      40.3520,000.................................      14.99  1,000,000      46.72------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not apply to incinerators, fuel burning installations, or Portland cement plants having a process weight rate in excess of 250,000 lb/h.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> No owner or operator of a Portland cement plant in Gila, Maricopa, Pima, Pinal, or Santa Cruz County with a process weight rate in excess of 250,000 lb/hr shall discharge or cause the discharge of particulate matter into the atmosphere in excess of the amount specified in Sec. 60.62 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Compliance with this paragraph shall be in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 52.134(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The test methods and procedures used to determine compliance with this

paragraph are set forth below. The methods referenced are contained in the appendix to part 60 of this chapter. Equivalent methods and procedures may be used if approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For each sampling repetition, the average concentration of particulate matter shall be determined by using method 5. Traversing during sampling by method 5 shall be according to method 1. The minimum sampling time shall be 2 hours and the minimum sampling volume shall be 60 ft\3\ (1.70 m\3\), corrected to standard conditions on a dry basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The volumetric flow rate of the total effluent shall be determined by using method 2 and traversing according to method 1. Gas analysis shall be performed using the integrated sample technique of method 3, and moisture content shall be determined by the condenser technique of method 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All tests shall be conducted while the source is operating at the maximum production or combustion rate at which such source will be operated. During the tests, the source shall burn fuels or combinations of fuels, use raw materials, and maintain process conditions representative of normal operation, and shall operate under such other relevant conditions as the Administrator shall specify.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The requirements of Sec. 51.281 of this chapter are not met since the plan does not contain regulations for Mohave and Yuma Counties in the Mohave-Yuma Intrastate Region or Pinal-Gila Counties in the Central Arizona Intrastate Region which provide enforceable and reproducible test procedures for the determination of compliance with the emission standards. Therefore paragraph C of section 3, regulation 2 (Particulates: Other Sources) of the Mohave County Air Pollution Control Regulations, paragraph B of regulation 8-1-3.6 (Particulates--Process Industries) of the Yuma County Air Pollution Control Regulations, and paragraph C of regulation 7-3-1.4 (Particulate Emissions--Incineration) and paragraph F of regulation 7-3-1.7 (Particulate Emissions--Fuel Burning Equipment) of the Rules and Regulations for Pinal-Gila Counties Air Quality Control District are disapproved.
