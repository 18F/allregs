                                Sec. 75.829  Tramming continuous mining machines in and out of the mine
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Conditions of use. Tramming the continuous mining machine in and out of the mine and from section to section must be done in accordance with movement requirements of high-voltage power centers and portable transformers (Sec. 75.812) and as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The power source must not be located in areas where permissible equipment is required;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The continuous mining machine must not be used for mining or cutting purposes, unless a power center is used in accordance with Sec. Sec. 75.823 through 75.828 and Sec. Sec. 75.830 through 75.833;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Low-, medium-, and high-voltage cables must comply with Sec. Sec. 75.600-1, 75.907, and 75.826, as applicable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The energized high-voltage cable must be mechanically secured onboard the continuous mining machine. This provision applies only when using the power sources specified in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Testing prior to tramming. Prior to tramming the continuous mining machine,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A qualified person must activate the ground-fault and ground-wire monitor test circuits of the power sources specified in paragraph (c) of this section to assure that the corresponding circuit-interrupting device opens the circuit. Corrective actions and recordkeeping resulting from these tests must be in accordance with Sec. Sec. 75.832(f) and (g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where applicable, a person designated by the mine operator must activate the test circuit for the grounded-phase detection circuit on the continuous mining machine to assure that the detection circuit is functioning properly. Corrective actions resulting from this test must be in accordance with Sec. 75.832(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Power sources. In addition to the power center specified in Sec. 75.825, the following power sources may be used to tram the continuous mining machine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Medium-voltage power source. A medium-voltage power source is a source that supplies 995 volts through a trailing cable (See Figure 1 of this section) to the continuous mining machine. The medium-voltage power source must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Not be used to back-feed the high-voltage circuits of the continuous mining machine; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Meet all applicable requirements for medium-voltage circuits in 30 CFR 75.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06AP10.002</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Step-up transformer. A step-up transformer is a transformer that steps up the low or medium voltage to high voltage (See Figure 2 in this section) and must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The trailing cable supplying low or medium voltage to the step-up transformer must meet the applicable requirements of 30 CFR part 75;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The high-voltage circuit output of the step-up transformer supplying power to the continuous mining machine must meet the applicable provisions of Sec. 75.824;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The step-up transformer enclosure must be--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Securely mounted to minimize vibration on:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The continuous mining machine; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A sled/cart that must be connected to the continuous mining machine by a tow-bar and be in close proximity to the mining machine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Grounded as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Connected to the incoming ground conductor of the low- or medium-voltage trailing cable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Bonded by a No. 1/0 A.W.G. or larger external grounding conductor to the continuous mining machine frame; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Bonded by a No. 1/0 A.W.G. or larger external grounding conductor to the metallic shell of each cable coupler.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Equipped with:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> At least two interlock switches for each of the enclosure covers; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An external emergency stop switch to remove input power to the step-up transformer.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06AP10.003
