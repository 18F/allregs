                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The lender may grant the borrower a temporary forbearance, even  beyond any default cure periods specified in the loan documents, if  doing so   is likely to result in the borrower curing the default. However, BIA  must approve in writing any forbearance or other agreement that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Permanently modifies the terms of the loan in any manner  indicated by Sec. 103.34(a);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Would allow the borrower's default to extend beyond the deadline  established in Sec. 103.36(d) for the lender to elect a remedy; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is not likely to result in the borrower curing the default.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The lender may make precautionary advances on the borrower's  behalf during the default, if doing so is reasonably necessary to ensure  that loan recovery prospects do not significantly deteriorate. Items for  which the lender may make precautionary advances include, for example:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Hazard, liability, or key man life insurance premiums;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Security measures to safeguard abandoned business assets;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Real or personal property taxes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Corrective actions required by court or administrative orders;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Essential maintenance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> BIA will guaranty or insure the amount of precautionary advances  from the date of each advance to the same extent as other amounts due  under the loan, if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The borrower has demonstrated its inability or unwillingness to  make the payment or perform the duty that jeopardizes loan recovery,  including by undue delay in making the payment or performing the duty;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The total expense of all precautionary advances by the lender  does not at the time of the advance exceed 10 percent of the outstanding  principal balance of the loan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where loan document provisions do not require the borrower to  repay precautionary advances (however termed) when made by the lender,  or where the total expense of all precautionary advances by the lender  will exceed 10 percent of the outstanding principal balance of the loan  when made, the lender secures BIA's prior written approval; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The lender properly claims and documents all precautionary  advances, if and when it submits a claim for loss under Sec. 103.37.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the default remains uncured, the lender must send BIA a  written notice by certified mail (return receipt requested), or by a  nationally-recognized overnight delivery service (signature of recipient  required) within 90 calendar days of the default to select one of the  following remedies:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a guaranteed loan, the lender may submit a claim  to BIA for its loss;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of either a guaranteed or insured loan, the lender  may liquidate all collateral securing the loan, and upon completion, if  it has a residual loss on the loan, it may submit a claim to BIA for  that loss; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The lender may negotiate a loan modification agreement with the  borrower to permanently change the terms of the loan in a manner that  will cure the default. If the lender chooses this remedy, it may take no  longer than 45 calendar days from the date BIA receives the notice of  remedy selection to finalize a loan modification agreement and secure  BIA's written approval of it, unless BIA specifically extends this  deadline in writing. However, the lender may at any time before the  expiration of the 45-day period (or any extension thereof) change its  choice of remedy by sending BIA a notice otherwise complying with Sec.  103.36(d)(1) or (2). If the lender fails to send BIA a notice changing  its choice of remedy and does not finalize an approved loan modification  agreement within the 45-day period (or any extension thereof), the  lender's only permissible remedy under the Program will be to pursue the  procedure specified in Sec. 103.36(d)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Failure by the lender to provide BIA with notice of the lender's  election of remedy within 90 calendar days of the default, as indicated  in Sec. 103.36(d), will invalidate BIA's loan guaranty certificate or  insurance coverage for that particular loan, absent an express waiver of  this provision by BIA. BIA may preserve the validity of a loan guaranty  certificate or insurance coverage through waiver of this provision only  when BIA determines, in its discretion, that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The lender consistently has acted in good faith, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The lender's failure to provide timely notice either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has not caused any actual or potential prejudice to BIA; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Was the result of the lender relying upon specific written  advice from a BIA official.</p>
