Each agency is responsible for ensuring that  annual leave donated under the emergency leave transfer program is used  appropriately.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Annual leave transferred under this subpart may be--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Substituted retroactively for any period of leave without pay  used because of the adverse effects of the disaster or emergency; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Used to liquidate an indebtedness incurred by the emergency  leave recipient for advanced annual or sick leave used because of the  adverse effects of the disaster or emergency. The agency may advance  annual or sick leave, as appropriate (even if the employee has available  annual and sick leave), so that the emergency leave recipient is not  forced to use his or her accrued leave before donated annual leave  becomes available.</p>
