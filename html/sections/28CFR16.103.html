                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c) (3) and (4), (d), (e) (1), (2), and (3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (e)(5) and (8), (f) and (g):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The INTERPOL-United States National Central Bureau (INTERPOL-USNCB) (Department of Justice) INTERPOL-USNCB Records System (JUSTICE/INTERPOL-001).

This exemption applies only to the extent that information in this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2), (k)(2), and (k)(5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From subsection (c)(3) because the release of accounting disclosures would place the subject of an investigation on notice that he is under investigation and provide him with significant information concerning the nature of the investigation, thus resulting in a serious impediment to law enforcement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From subsections (c)(4), (d), (e)(4) (G), and (H), (f) and (g) because these provisions concern individual access to records and such access might compromise ongoing investigations reveal investigatory techniques and confidential informants, and invade the privacy of private citizens who provide information in connection with a particular investigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> From subsection (e)(1) because information received in the course of an international criminal investigation may involve a violation of state or

local law, and it is beneficial to maintain this information to provide investigative leads to state and local law enforcement agencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> From subsection (e)(2) because collecting information from the subject of criminal investigations would thwart the investigation by placing the subject on notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> From subsection (e)(3) because supplying an individual with a statement of the intended use of the requested information could compromise the existence of a confidential investigation, and may inhibit cooperation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> From subsection (e)(5) because the vast majority of these records come from local criminal justice agencies and it is administratively impossible to ensure that the records comply with this provision. Submitting agencies are, however, urged on a continuing basis to ensure that their records are accurate and include all dispositions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> From subsection (e)(8) because the notice requirements of this provision could present a serious impediment to law enforcement by revealing investigative techniques, procedures, and the existence of confidential investigations.
