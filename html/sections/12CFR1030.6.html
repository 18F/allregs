The dollar amount of interest earned during the statement period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fees imposed. Fees required to be disclosed under Sec. 1030.4(b)(4) of this part that were debited to the account during the statement period. The fees shall be itemized by type and dollar amounts. Except as provided in Sec. 1030.11(a)(1) of this part, when fees of the same type are imposed more than once in a statement period, a depository institution may itemize each fee separately or group the fees together and disclose a total dollar amount for all fees of that type.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Length of period. The total number of days in the statement period, or the beginning and ending dates of the period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Aggregate fee disclosure.

In making the disclosures described in paragraph (a) of this section, institutions that use the average

daily balance method and that calculate interest for a period other than the statement period shall calculate and disclose the annual percentage yield earned and amount of interest earned based on that period rather than the statement period. The information in paragraph (a)(4) of this section shall be stated for that period as well as for the statement period.</p>
