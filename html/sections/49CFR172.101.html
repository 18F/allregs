                                Sec. 172.101  Purpose and use of hazardous materials table.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Hazardous Materials Table (Table) in this section designates  the materials listed therein as hazardous materials for the purpose of  transportation of those materials. For each listed material, the Table  identifies the hazard class or specifies that the material is forbidden  in transportation, and gives the proper shipping name or directs the  user to the preferred proper   shipping name. In addition, the Table specifies or references  requirements in this subchapter pertaining to labeling, packaging,  quantity limits aboard aircraft and stowage of hazardous materials  aboard vessels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Column 1: Symbols. Column 1 of the Table contains six symbols  (`` + '', ``A'', ``D'', ``G'', ``I'' and ``W'') as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of the Sec. 172.101 Table, it means that the material  is known to pose a risk to humans. When a plus sign is assigned to  mixtures or solutions containing a material where the hazard to humans  is significantly different from that of the pure material or where no  hazard to humans is posed, the material may be described using an  alternative shipping name that represents the hazards posed by the  material. An appropriate alternate proper shipping name and hazard class  may be authorized by the Associate Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The letter ``A'' denotes a material that is subject to the  requirements of this subchapter only when offered or intended for  transportation by aircraft, unless the material is a hazardous substance  or a hazardous waste. A shipping description entry preceded by an ``A''  may be used to describe a material for other modes of transportation  provided all applicable requirements for the entry are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The letter ``D'' identifies proper shipping names which are  appropriate for describing materials for domestic transportation but may  be inappropriate for international transportation under the provisions  of international regulations (e.g., IMO, ICAO). An alternate proper  shipping name may be selected when either domestic or international  transportation is involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The letter ``G'' identifies proper shipping names for which one  or more technical names of the hazardous material must be entered in  parentheses, in association with the basic description. (See  Sec. 172.203(k).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The letter ``I'' identifies proper shipping names which are  appropriate for describing materials in international transportation. An  alternate proper shipping name may be selected when only domestic  transportation is involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The letter ``W'' denotes a material that is subject to the  requirements of this subchapter only when offered or intended for  transportation by vessel, unless the material is a hazardous substance  or a hazardous waste. A shipping description entry preceded by a ``W''  may be used to describe a material for other modes of transportation  provided all applicable requirements for the entry are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Column 2: Hazardous materials descriptions and proper shipping  names. Column 2 lists the hazardous materials descriptions and proper  shipping names of materials designated as hazardous materials.  Modification of a proper shipping name may otherwise be required or  authorized by this section. Proper shipping names are limited to those  shown in Roman type (not italics).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Proper shipping names may be used in the singular or plural and  in either capital or lower case letters. Words may be alternatively  spelled in the same manner as they appear in the ICAO Technical  Instructions or the IMDG Code. For example ``aluminum'' may be spelled  ``aluminium'' and ``sulfur'' may be spelled ``sulphur''. However, the  word ``inflammable'' may not be used in place of the word ``flammable''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Punctuation marks and words in italics are not part of the  proper shipping name, but may be used in addition to the proper shipping  name. The word ``or'' in italics indicates that there is a choice of  terms in the sequence that may alternately be used as the proper  shipping name or as part of the proper shipping name, as appropriate.  For example, for the hazardous materials description ``Carbon dioxide,  solid or Dry ice'' either ``Carbon dioxide, solid'' or ``Dry ice'' may  be used as the proper shipping name; and for the hazardous materials  description ``Articles, pressurized pneumatic or hydraulic,'' either  ``Articles, pressurized pneumatic'' or ``Articles, pressurized  hydraulic''   may be used as the proper shipping name.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The word ``poison'' or ``poisonous'' may be used interchangeably  with the word ``toxic'' when only domestic transportation is involved.  The abbreviation ``n.o.i.'' or ``n.o.i.b.n.'' may be used  interchangeably with ``n.o.s.''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Except for hazardous wastes, when qualifying words are used as  part of the proper shipping name, their sequence in the package markings  and shipping paper description is optional. However, the entry in the  Table reflects the preferred sequence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> When one entry references another entry by use of the word  ``see'', if both names are in Roman type, either name may be used as the  proper shipping name (e.g., Ethyl alcohol, see Ethanol).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> When a proper shipping name includes a concentration range as  part of the shipping description, the actual concentration, if it is  within the range stated, may be used in place of the concentration  range. For example, an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide containing  30 percent peroxide may be described as ``Hydrogen peroxide, aqueous  solution with not less than 20 percent but not more than 40 percent  hydrogen peroxide'' or ``Hydrogen peroxide, aqueous solution with 30  percent hydrogen peroxide.'' Also, the percent sign (%) may be used in  place of the word ``percent'' when words in italics containing the word  ``percent'' are used in addition to the proper shipping name.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Use of the prefix ``mono'' is optional in any shipping name,  when appropriate. Thus, Iodine monochloride may be used interchangeably  with Iodine chloride. In ``Glycerol alpha-monochlorohydrin'' the term  ``mono'' is considered a prefix to the term ``chlorohydrin'' and may be  deleted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Use of the word ``liquid'' or ``solid''. The word ``liquid'' or  ``solid'' may be added to a proper shipping name when a hazardous  material specifically listed by name may, due to differing physical  states, be a liquid or solid. When the packaging specified in Column 8  is inappropriate for the physical state of the material, the table  provided in paragraph (i)(4) of this section should be used to determine  the appropriate packaging section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Hazardous wastes. If the word ``waste'' is not included in the  hazardous material description in Column 2 of the Table, the proper  shipping name for a hazardous waste (as defined in Sec. 171.8 of this  subchapter), shall include the word ``Waste'' preceding the proper  shipping name of the material. For example: Waste acetone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Mixtures and solutions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A mixture or solution meeting the  definition of one or more hazard class that is not identified  specifically by name, comprised of a single predominant hazardous  material identified in the Table by technical name and one or more  hazardous and/or non-hazardous material, must be described using the  proper shipping name of the hazardous material and the qualifying word  ``mixture'' or ``solution'', as appropriate, unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 172.101(i)(4) the packaging specified  in Column 8 is inappropriate to the physical state of the material;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The shipping description indicates that the proper shipping name  applies only to the pure or technically pure hazardous material;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The hazard class, packing group, or subsidiary hazard of the  mixture or solution is different from that specified for the entry;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> There is a significant change in the measures to be taken in  emergencies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The material is identified by special provision in Column 7 of  the Sec. 172.101 Table as a material poisonous by inhalation; however,  it no longer meets the definition of poisonous by inhalation or it falls  within a different hazard zone than that specified in the special  provision; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The material can be appropriately described by a shipping name  that describes its intended application, such as ``Coating solution'',  ``Extracts, flavoring'' or ``Compound, cleaning liquid.''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> must be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A mixture or solution meeting the definition of one or more  hazard class that is not identified in the Table specifically by name,  comprised of two   or more hazardous materials in the same hazard class, must be described  using an appropriate shipping description (e.g., ``Flammable liquid,  n.o.s.''). The name that most appropriately describes the material shall  be used; e.g., an alcohol not listed by its technical name in the Table  shall be described as ``Alcohol, n.o.s.'' rather than ``Flammable  liquid, n.o.s.''. Some mixtures may be more appropriately described  according to their application, such as ``Coating solution'' or  ``Extracts, flavoring liquid'' rather than by an n.o.s. entry. Under the  provisions of subparts C and D of this part, the technical names of at  least two components most predominately contributing to the hazards of  the mixture or solution may be required in association with the proper  shipping name.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Except for a material subject to or prohibited by Sec. 173.21,  Sec. 173.54, Sec. 173.56(d), Sec. 173.56(e), Sec. 173.224(c) or  Sec. 173.225(b) of this subchapter, a material that is considered to be  a hazardous waste or a sample of a material for which the hazard class  is uncertain and must be determined by testing may be assigned a  tentative proper shipping name, hazard class, identification number and  packing group, if applicable, based on the shipper's tentative  determination according to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Defining criteria in this subchapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The hazard precedence prescribed in Sec. 173.2a of this  subchapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The shipper's knowledge of the material;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In addition to paragraphs (c)(11)(i) through (iii) of this  section, for a sample of a material other than a waste, the following  must be met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Except when the word ``Sample'' already appears in the proper  shipping name, the word ``Sample'' must appear as part of the proper  shipping name or in association with the basic description on the  shipping paper.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When the proper shipping description for a sample is assigned a  ``G'' in Column (1) of the Sec. 172.101 Table, and the primary  constituent(s) for which the tentative classification is based are not  known, the provisions requiring a technical name for the constituent(s)  do not apply; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A sample must be transported in a combination packaging that  conforms to the requirements of this subchapter that are applicable to  the tentative packing group assigned, and may not exceed a net mass of  2.5 kg (5.5 pounds) per package.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (c)(11):</p><p class="depth0">For the transportation of samples of self-reactive materials,  organic peroxides, explosives or lighters, see Sec. 173.224(c)(3),  Sec. 173.225(c)(2), Sec. 173.56(d) or Sec. 173.308(b)(2) of this  subchapter, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Except when the proper shipping name in the Table is preceded  by a plus ( + )--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If it is specifically determined that a material meets the  definition of a hazard class, packing group or hazard zone, other than  the class, packing group or hazard zone shown in association with the  proper shipping name, or does not meet the defining criteria for a  subsidiary hazard shown in Column 6 of the Table, the material shall be  described by an appropriate proper shipping name listed in association  with the correct hazard class, packing group, hazard zone, or subsidiary  hazard for the material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Generic or n.o.s. descriptions. If an appropriate technical  name is not shown in the Table, selection of a proper shipping name  shall be made from the generic or n.o.s. descriptions corresponding to  the specific hazard class, packing group, hazard zone, or subsidiary  hazard, if any, for the material. The name that most appropriately  describes the material shall be used; e.g., an alcohol not listed by its  technical name in the Table shall be described as ``Alcohol, n.o.s.''  rather than ``Flammable liquid, n.o.s.''. Some mixtures may be more  appropriately described according to their application, such as  ``Coating solution'' or ``Extracts, flavoring, liquid'', rather than by  an n.o.s. entry, such as ``Flammable liquid, n.o.s.'' It should be  noted, however, that an n.o.s. description as a proper shipping name may  not provide sufficient information for shipping papers and package  markings. Under the provisions of subparts C and D of this part, the  technical name of one or more constituents which makes the product a  hazardous material may be required in   association with the proper shipping name.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Multiple hazard materials. If a material meets the definition  of more than one hazard class, and is not identified in the Table  specifically by name (e.g., acetyl chloride), the hazard class of the  material shall be determined by using the precedence specified in  Sec. 173.2a of this subchapter, and an appropriate shipping description  (e.g., ``Flammable liquid, corrosive n.o.s.'') shall be selected as  described in paragraph (c)(12)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If it is specifically determined that a material is not a  forbidden material and does not meet the definition of any hazard class,  the material is not a hazardous material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Self-reactive materials and organic peroxides. A generic proper  shipping name for a self-reactive material or an organic peroxide, as  listed in Column 2 of the Table, must be selected based on the  material's technical name and concentration, in accordance with the  provisions of Sec. 173.224 or Sec. 173.225 of this subchapter,  respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> A proper shipping name that describes all isomers of a material  may be used to identify any isomer of that material if the isomer meets  criteria for the same hazard class or division, subsidiary risk(s) and  packing group, unless the isomer is specifically identified in the  Table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Unless a hydrate is specifically listed in the Table, a proper  shipping name for the equivalent anhydrous substance may be used, if the  hydrate meets the same hazard class or division, subsidiary risk(s) and  packing group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Unless it is already included in the proper shipping name in  the Sec. 172.101 Table, the qualifying words ``liquid'' or ``solid'' may  be added in association with the proper shipping name when a hazardous  material specifically listed by name in the Sec. 172.101 Table may, due  to the differing physical states of the various isomers of the material,  be either a liquid or a solid (for example ``Dinitrotoluenes, liquid''  and ``Dinitrotoluenes, solid''). Use of the words ``liquid'' or  ``solid'' is subject to the limitations specified for the use of the  words ``mixture'' or ``solution'' in paragraph (c)(10) of this section.  The qualifying word ``molten'' may be added in association with the  proper shipping name when a hazardous material, which is a solid in  accordance with the definition in Sec. 171.8 of this subchapter, is  offered for transportation in the molten state (for example,  ``Alkylphenols, solid, n.o.s., molten'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Column 3: Hazard class or Division. Column 3 contains a  designation of the hazard class or division corresponding to each proper  shipping name, or the word ``Forbidden''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A material for which the entry in this column is ``Forbidden''  may not be offered for transportation or transported. This prohibition  does not apply if the material is diluted, stabilized or incorporated in  a device and it is classed in accordance with the definitions of  hazardous materials contained in part 173 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When a reevaluation of test data or new data indicates a need to  modify the ``Forbidden'' designation or the hazard class or packing  group specified for a material specifically identified in the Table,  this data should be submitted to the Associate Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A basic description of each hazard class and the section  reference for class definitions appear in Sec. 173.2 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Each reference to a Class 3 material is modified to read  ``Combustible liquid'' when that material is reclassified in accordance  with Sec. 173.150(e) or (f) of this subchapter or has a flash point  above 60 C (140 F) but below 93 C (200 F).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Column 4: Identification number. Column 4 lists the  identification number assigned to each proper shipping name. Those  preceded by the letters ``UN'' are associated with proper shipping names  considered appropriate for international transportation as well as  domestic transportation. Those preceded by the letters ``NA'' are  associated with proper shipping names not recognized for international  transportation, except to and from Canada. Identification numbers in the  ``NA9000'' series are associated with proper shipping names not  appropriately covered by international hazardous materials (dangerous  goods) transportation   standards, or not appropriately addressed by international  transportation standards for emergency response information purposes,  except for transportation between the United States and Canada. Those  preceded by the letters ``ID'' are associated with proper shipping names  recognized by the ICAO Technical Instructions (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of  this subchapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Column 5: Packing group. Column 5 specifies one or more packing  groups assigned to a material corresponding to the proper shipping name  and hazard class for that material. Class 2, Class 7, Division 6.2  (other than regulated medical wastes), and ORM-D materials, do not have  packing groups. Articles in other than Class 1 are not assigned to  packing groups. For packing purposes, any requirement for a specific  packaging performance level is set out in the applicable packing  authorizations of part 173. Packing Groups I, II and III indicate the  degree of danger presented by the material is great, medium or minor,  respectively. If more than one packing group is indicated for an entry,  the packing group for the hazardous material is determined using the  criteria for assignment of packing groups specified in subpart D of part  173. When a reevaluation of test data or new data indicates a need to  modify the specified packing group(s), the data should be submitted to  the Associate Administrator. Each reference in this column to a material  which is a hazardous waste or a hazardous substance, and whose proper  shipping name is preceded in Column 1 of the Table by the letter ``A''  or ``W'', is modified to read ``III'' on those occasions when the  material is offered for transportation or transported by a mode in which  its transportation is not otherwise subject to requirements of this  subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Column 6: Labels. Column 6 specifies codes which represent the  hazard warning labels required for a package filled with a material  conforming to the associated hazard class and proper shipping name,  unless the package is otherwise excepted from labeling by a provision in  subpart E of this part, or part 173 of this subchapter. The first code  is indicative of the primary hazard of the material. Additional label  codes are indicative of subsidiary hazards. Provisions in Sec. 172.402  may require that a label other than that specified in Column 6 be  affixed to the package in addition to that specified in Column 6. No  label is required for a material classed as a combustible liquid or for  a Class 3 material that is reclassed as a combustible liquid. For  ``Empty'' label requirements, see Sec. 173.428 of this subchapter. The  codes contained in Column 6 are defined according to the following  table:</p><p class="depth0">Label Substitution Table ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Label code                           Label name ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.........................................

Column 7 specifies codes for  special provisions applicable to hazardous materials. When Column 7  refers to a special provision for a hazardous material, the meaning and  requirements of that special provision are as set forth in Sec. 172.102  of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Column 8: Packaging authorizations. Columns 8A, 8B and 8C  specify the applicable sections for exceptions, non-bulk packaging  requirements and bulk packaging requirements, respectively, in part 173  of this subchapter. Columns 8A, 8B and 8C are completed in a manner  which indicates that ``Sec. 173.'' precedes the designated numerical  entry. For example, the entry ``202'' in Column 8B associated with the  proper shipping name ``Gasoline'' indicates that for this material  conformance to   non-bulk packaging requirements prescribed in Sec. 173.202 of this  subchapter is required. When packaging requirements are specified, they  are in addition to the standard requirements for all packagings  prescribed in Sec. 173.24 of this subchapter and any other applicable  requirements in subparts A and B of part 173 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Exceptions. Column 8A contains exceptions from some of the  requirements of this subchapter. The referenced exceptions are in  addition to those specified in subpart A of part 173 and elsewhere in  this subchapter. A ``None'' in this column means no packaging exceptions  are authorized, except as may be provided by special provisions in  Column 7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Non-bulk packaging. Column 8B references the section in part 173  of this subchapter which prescribes packaging requirements for non-bulk  packagings. A ``None'' in this column means non-bulk packagings are not  authorized, except as may be provided by special provisions in Column 7.  Each reference in this column to a material which is a hazardous waste  or a hazardous substance, and whose proper shipping name is preceded in  Column 1 of the Table by the letter ``A'' or ``W'', is modified to  include ``Sec. 173.203'' or ``Sec. 173.213'', as appropriate for liquids  and solids, respectively, on those occasions when the material is  offered for transportation or transported by a mode in which its  transportation is not otherwise subject to the requirements of this  subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Bulk packaging. Column (8C) specifies the section in part 173 of  this subchapter that prescribes packaging requirements for bulk  packagings, subject to the limitations, requirements, and additional  authorizations of Columns (7) and (8B). A ``None'' in Column (8C) means  bulk packagings are not authorized, except as may be provided by special  provisions in Column (7) and in packaging authorizations Column (8B).  Additional authorizations and limitations for use of UN portable tanks  are set forth in Column 7. For each reference in this column to a  material that is a hazardous waste or a hazardous substance, and whose  proper shipping name is preceded in Column 1 of the Table by the letter  ``A'' or ``W'' and that is offered for transportation or transported by  a mode in which its transportation is not otherwise subject to the  requirements of this subchapter:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For a hazardous material which is specifically named in the  Table and whose packaging sections specify packagings not applicable to  the form of the material (e.g., packaging specified is for solid  material and the material is being offered for transportation in a  liquid form) the following table should be used to determine the  appropriate packaging section:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Corresponding packaging Packaging section reference for solid materials     section for liquid</p><p class="depth0">materials ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Sec. 173.187..................................

For cylinders, both non-bulk and bulk packaging  authorizations are set forth in Column (8B). Notwithstanding a  designation of ``None'' in Column (8C), a bulk cylinder may be used when  specified through the section reference in Column (8B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Column 9: Quantity limitations. Columns 9A and 9B specify the  maximum quantities that may be offered for transportation in one package  by passenger-carrying aircraft or passenger-carrying rail car (Column  9A) or by cargo aircraft only (Column 9B), subject to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> ``Forbidden'' means the material may not be offered for  transportation or transported in the applicable mode of transport.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The quantity limitation is ``net'' except where otherwise  specified, such as for ``Consumer commodity'' which specifies ``30 kg  gross.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When articles or devices are specifically listed by name, the  net quantity limitation applies to the entire article or device (less  packaging and packaging materials) rather than only to its hazardous  components.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A package offered or intended for transportation by aircraft and  which is filled with a material forbidden on passenger-carrying aircraft  but permitted   on cargo aircraft only, or which exceeds the maximum net quantity  authorized on passenger-carrying aircraft, shall be labelled with the  CARGO AIRCRAFT ONLY label specified in Sec. 172.448 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The total net quantity of hazardous material for an outer non- bulk packaging that contains more than one hazardous material may not  exceed the lowest permitted maximum net quantity per package as shown in  Column 9A or 9B, as appropriate. If one material is a liquid and one is  a solid, the maximum net quantity must be calculated in kilograms. See  Sec. 173.24a(c)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Column 10: Vessel stowage requirements. Column 10A [Vessel  stowage] specifies the authorized stowage locations on board cargo and  passenger vessels. Column 10B [Other provisions] specifies codes for  stowage and handling requirements for specific hazardous materials.  Hazardous materials offered for transportation as limited quantities are  allocated stowage category A and are not subject to the stowage codes  assigned by column 10B. The meaning of each code in Column 10B is set  forth in Sec. 176.84 of this subchapter. Section 176.63 of this  subchapter sets forth the physical requirements for each of the  authorized locations listed in Column 10A.

This appendix lists materials and their corresponding reportable  quantities (RQ's) that are listed or designated as ``hazardous  substances'' under section 101(14) of the Comprehensive Environmental  Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601(14) (CERCLA;  42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq). This listing fulfills the requirement of CERCLA,  42 U.S.C. 9656(a), that all ``hazardous substances,'' as defined in 42  U.S.C. 9601(14), be listed and regulated as hazardous materials under 49  U.S.C. 5101-5127. That definition includes substances listed under  sections 311(b)(2)(A) and 307(a) of the Federal Water Pollution Control  Act, 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(2)(A) and 1317(a), section 3001 of the Solid  Waste Disposal Act, 42 U.S.C. 6921, and section 112 of the Clean Air  Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412. In addition, this list contains materials that the  Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has determined to  be hazardous substances in accordance with section 102 of CERCLA, 42  U.S.C. 9602. It should be noted that 42 U.S.C. 9656(b) provides that  common and contract carriers may be held liable under laws other than  CERCLA for the release of a hazardous substance as defined in that Act,  during transportation that commenced before the effective date of the  listing and regulating of that substance as a hazardous material under  49 U.S.C. 5101-5127.</p><p class="depth0">2. This appendix is divided into two TABLES which are entitled  ``TABLE 1--HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES OTHER THAN RADIONUCLIDES'' and ``TABLE  2--RADIONUCLIDES.'' A material listed in this appendix is regulated as a  hazardous material and a hazardous substance under this subchapter if it  meets the definition of a hazardous substance in Sec. 171.8 of this  subchapter.</p><p class="depth0">3. The procedure for selecting a proper shipping name for a  hazardous substance is set forth in Sec. 172.101(c).</p><p class="depth0">4. Column 1 of TABLE 1, entitled ``Hazardous substance'', contains  the names of those elements and compounds that are hazardous substances.  Following the listing of elements and compounds is a listing of waste  streams. These waste streams appear on the list in numerical sequence  and are referenced by the appropriate ``D'', ``F'', or ``K'' numbers.  Column 2 of TABLE 1, entitled ``Reportable quantity (RQ)'', contains the  reportable quantity (RQ), in pounds and kilograms, for each hazardous  substance listed in Column 1 of TABLE 1.</p><p class="depth0">5. A series of notes is used throughout TABLE 1 and TABLE 2 to  provide additional information concerning certain hazardous substances.  These notes are explained at the end of each TABLE.</p><p class="depth0">6. TABLE 2 lists radionuclides that are hazardous substances and  their corresponding RQ's. The RQ's in table 2 for radionuclides are  expressed in units of curies and terabecquerels, whereas those in table  1 are expressed in units of pounds and kilograms. If a material is  listed in both table 1 and table 2, the lower RQ shall apply.  Radionuclides are listed in alphabetical order. The RQ's for  radionuclides are given in the radiological unit of measure of curie,  abbreviated ``Ci'', followed, in parentheses, by an equivalent unit  measured in terabecquerels, abbreviated ``TBq''.</p><p class="depth0">7. For mixtures of radionuclides, the following requirements shall  be used in determining if a package contains an RQ of a hazardous  substance: (i) if the identity and quantity (in curies or  terabecquerels) of each radionuclide in a mixture or solution is known,  the ratio between the quantity per package (in curies or terabecquerels)  and the RQ for the radionuclide must be determined for each  radionuclide. A package contains an RQ of a hazardous substance when the  sum of the ratios for the radionuclides in the mixture or solution is  equal to or greater than one; (ii) if the identity of each radionuclide  in a mixture or solution is known but the quantity per package (in  curies or terabecquerels) of one or more of the radionuclides is  unknown, an RQ of a hazardous substance is present in a package when the  total quantity (in curies or terabecquerels) of the mixture or solution  is equal to or greater than the lowest RQ of any individual radionuclide  in the mixture or solution; and (iii) if the identity of one or more  radionuclides in a mixture or solution is unknown (or if the identity of  a radionuclide by itself is unknown), an RQ of a hazardous substance is  present when the total quantity (in curies or terabecquerels) in a  package is equal to or greater than either one curie or the lowest RQ of  any known individual radionuclide in the mixture or solution, whichever  is lower.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1 to Appendix A--Hazardous Substances Other Than Radionuclides ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p

------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ The RQs for all radionuclides apply to chemical compounds containing</p><p class="depth0">the radionuclides and elemental forms regardless of the diameter of</p><p class="depth0">pieces of solid material. [dagger] The RQ of one curie applies to all radionuclides not otherwise</p><p class="depth0">listed. Whenever the RQs in TABLE 1--HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES OTHER THAN</p><p class="depth0">RADIONUCLIDES and this table conflict, the lowest RQ shall apply.

RQs for the following four common radionuclide</p><p class="depth0">mixtures are provided: radium-226 in secular equilibrium with its</p><p class="depth0">daughters (0.053 curie); natural uranium (0.1 curie); natural uranium</p><p class="depth0">in secular equilibrium with its daughters (0.052 curie); and natural</p><p class="depth0">thorium in secular equilibrium with its daughters (0.011 curie). *** Indicates that the name was added by PHMSA because it appears in the</p><p class="depth0">list of radionuclides in 49 CFR 173.435.

See Sec. 171.4 of this subchapter for applicability to marine  pollutants. This appendix lists potential marine pollutants as defined  in Sec. 171.8 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0">2. Marine pollutants listed in this appendix are not necessarily  listed by name in the Sec. 172.101 Table. If a marine pollutant not  listed by name or by synonym in the Sec. 172.101 Table meets the  definition of any hazard Class 1 through 8, then you must determine the  class and division of the material in accordance with Sec. 173.2a of  this subchapter. You must also select the most appropriate hazardous  material description and proper shipping name. If a marine pollutant not  listed by name or by synonym in the Sec. 172.101 Table does not meet the  definition of any Class 1 through 8, then you must offer it for  transportation under the most appropriate of the following two Class 9  entries: ``Environmentally hazardous substances, liquid, n.o.s.,''  UN3082, or ``Environmentally hazardous substances, solid, n.o.s.''  UN3077.</p><p class="depth0">3. This appendix contains two columns. The first column, entitled  ``S.M.P.'' (for severe marine pollutants), identifies whether a material  is a severe marine pollutant. If the letters ``PP'' appear in this  column for a material, the material is a severe marine pollutant,  otherwise it is not. The second column, entitled ``Marine Pollutant'' ,  lists the marine pollutants.</p><p class="depth0">4. If a material is not listed in this appendix and meets the  criteria for a marine pollutant as provided in Chapter 2.9 of the IMDG  Code, (incorporated by reference; see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter),  the material may be transported as a marine pollutant in accordance with  the applicable requirements of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0">5. If a material or a solution meeting the definition of a marine  pollutant in Sec. 171.8 of this subchapter does not meet the criteria  for a marine pollutant as provided in section 2.9.3.3 and 2.9.3.4 of the  IMDG Code, (incorporated by reference; see Sec. 171.7 of this  subchapter), it may be excepted from the requirements of this subchapter  as a marine pollutant if that exception is approved by
