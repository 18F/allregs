                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any manufacturer who participates in the in-use credit program is required to submit an end of the model year in-use testing report either within 90 days of the end of the model year in-use testing of a given model year's engine families, or at the same time as the final certification AB&T; report (required under Sec. 91.210), whichever is later. The end of the model year in-use testing report must contain the required information and show the calculated credits from all the in-use testing conducted by the manufacturer for a given model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reports shall be submitted to: Manager, Engine Compliance Programs Group 6403-J, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A manufacturer that fails to submit a timely report as required in paragraph (a) of this section will be considered to not have participated in the in-use credit program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error occurred on an end of model year report previously submitted to EPA under this subpart, or an engine family in-use testing report submitted to EPA under subpart I, the manufacturer's credits and credit calculations will be recalculated. Erroneous positive credits will be void. Erroneous negative credits may be adjusted by EPA. An update of previously submitted ``point of first retail sale'' information is not considered an error and no increase in the number of credits will be allowed unless an actual error occurred in the calculation of credits due to an error in the ``point of first retail sale'' information from the time of the original end of model year report.</p>
