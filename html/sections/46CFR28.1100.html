                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As set forth in 46 U.S.C. 8103, a citizenship requirement, other  than a requirement that applies to the master of a documented vessel, on  commercial fishing vessels may be waived for unlicensed seamen when  qualified seamen who are citizens of the United States are not  available. Under the provisions of this subpart, the Coast Guard  approves or denies requests for a waiver of the citizenship requirement  from owners, operators, or employers seeking to exceed the 25 percent  limit applicable to unlicensed seamen aboard fishing industry vessels  who are non-permanent resident aliens authorized for employment in the  United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C.  1101 et seq.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This subpart does not apply to a fishing vessel fishing  exclusively for highly migratory species (as that term is defined in  section 3 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management  Act (16 U.S.C. 1802)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The regulations in this subpart have preemptive effect over  State or local regulation within the same field.</p>
