No  operation by any licensee under this section shall be construed as a  finding by the Commission that the operation will serve the public  interest, convenience, or necessity, nor shall such operation in any way  affect or limit the action of the Commission with respect to any pending  application or proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A licensee operating by virtue of this paragraph shall, after  the date of expiration specified in the license, post, in addition to  the original license, any acknowledgment received from the Commission  that the renewal application has been accepted for filing or a signed  copy of the application for renewal of license which has been submitted  by the licensee, or in services other than broadcast and common carrier,  a statement certifying that the licensee has mailed or filed a renewal  application, specifying the date of mailing or filing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where there is pending before the Commission at the time of  expiration of license any proper and timely application for renewal or  extension of the term of a license with respect to any activity not of a  continuing nature, the Commission may in its discretion grant a  temporary extension of such license pending determination of such  application. No such temporary extension shall be construed as a finding  by the Commission that the operation of any radio station thereunder  will serve the public interest, convenience, or necessity beyond the  express terms of such temporary extension of license, nor shall such  temporary extension in any way affect or limit the action of the  Commission with respect to any pending application or proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except where an instrument of authorization clearly states on  its face that it relates to an activity not of a continuing nature, or  where the non-continuing nature is otherwise clearly apparent upon the  face of the authorization, all licenses issued by the Commission shall  be deemed to be related to an activity of a continuing nature.
