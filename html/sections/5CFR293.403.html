Agency implementing instructions, for both incumbents of the Senior Executive Service and other positions, shall provide specific written guidance of the description of what constitutes the agency's official performance-related forms and documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agency implementing instructions describing such records shall indicate where and for how long they are retained and how and when they are to be destroyed. Such instructions shall also describe what records are considered to be performance-related (as specifically as is feasible) and shall include all performance-related records maintained as a system of records within the meaning of the Privacy Act. Such records would generally include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any form or other document which records the performance appraisal, including appraisals leading to merit pay determinations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any form or other document used by rating officials to recommend a personnel action affecting an employee (including a request for personnel action document, but only when the action is not effected) when the basis for the action (e.g., removal, reassignment, demotion, promotion, or merit

pay or other performance award) is performance-related.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Recommendations for training that are performance-related.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any form or other document furnished in support of recommended actions such as those listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and the agency's final decision on the matter (e.g., a recommendation for merit pay or an agency decision to grant only one-half the comparability pay adjustment).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any form or other document which the rating official is required by the agency to keep during an appraisal period (e.g., quality control records, production records, or similar records used to track employee performance during the appraisal period.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any form or other document regarding Performance Review Board decisions, including supporting documentation and any transcript of hearings or testimony from witnesses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any form or other document regarding decisions or recommendations of agency Executive Resources Boards related to performance appraisal or actions resulting from performance appraisals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Appraisals of potential (e.g., in connection with an agency's merit promotion procedures) if agency implementing instructions specifically require or permit retention of a copy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Individual development plans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Copies of licenses, certificates of proficiency, or similar documents required of the position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General information about the employee, i.e., identification data, information concerning Federal and non-Federal employment experience, and information about any training programs the employee participated in may, if an agency deems it appropriate, be retained in this system.
