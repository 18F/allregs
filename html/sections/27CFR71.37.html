                            <p class="depth0">Where the appropriate TTB officer believes that the matter may be settled informally, i.e., without formal administrative proceedings, he shall, in accordance with section 5 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, prior to the issuance of a citation, inform the permittee of the contemplated issuance

of an order to show cause why his permit should not be suspended, revoked or annulled, and that he is being given an opportunity for the submission and consideration of facts, arguments, offers of settlement, or proposals of adjustment. The notice should inform the permittee of the charges on which the citation would be based, if issued, and afford him a period of 10 days from the date of the notice, or such longer period as the appropriate TTB officer deems necessary, in which to submit proposals of settlement to the appropriate TTB officer. Where informal settlement is not reached promptly because of inaction of the permittee or proposals are made for the purpose of delay, a citation shall be issued in accordance with Sec. Sec. 71.55 and 71.56.
