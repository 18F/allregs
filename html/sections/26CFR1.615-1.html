                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and the election to defer under section 615(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Expenditures to which section 615 is not applicable. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section  615 is not applicable to expenditures which would be allowed as a  deduction for the taxable year without regard to such section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Section 615 is not applicable to expenditures which are  reflected in improvements subject to allowances for depreciation under  sections 167 and 611. However, allowances for depreciation of such  improvements which are used in the exploration of ores or minerals are  considered exploration expenditures under section 615. If such  improvements are used only in part for exploration during a taxable  year, an allocable portion of the allowance for depreciation shall be  treated as an exploration expenditure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Section 615 is applicable to exploration expenditures paid or  incurred by a taxpayer in connection with the acquisition of a  fractional share of the working or operating interest to the extent of  the fractional interest so acquired by the taxpayer. The expenditures  attributable to the remaining fractional share shall be considered as  the cost of his acquired interest and shall be recovered through  depletion allowances. For example, taxpayer A owns mineral leases on  unexplored mineral lands and agrees to convey an undivided three-fourths  (\3/4\) interest in such leases to taxpayer B provided B will pay all of  the exploration expenditures for ascertaining the existence, location,  extent, or quality of any deposit of ore or other mineral which will be  incurred before the beginning of the development stage. B shall treat  three-fourths of such amount under section 615, and shall treat one- fourth of such amount as part of the cost of his interest, recoverable  through depletion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The provisions of section 615 do not apply to costs of  exploration which are reflected in the amount which the taxpayer paid or  incurred to acquire the property. Such provisions apply only to costs  paid or incurred by the taxpayer for exploration undertaken directly or  through a contract by the taxpayer. See, however, sections 381(a) and  381(c) (10) for special rules with respect to deferred exploration  expenditures in certain corporate acquisitions.
