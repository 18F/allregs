                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A fee of $.03 per barrel is levied on all oil produced on the OCS and is imposed upon the owner of the oil when such oil is produced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The owner of oil obtained from the OCS shall, for the purpose of computing the barrel fee levied in paragraph (a) of this section, measure OCS oil production by employing the methods and criteria of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement contained in 30 CFR 250.180.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The barrel fee levied in paragraph (a) of this section applies whenever the unobligated Fund balance is less than $200,000,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payment of the fee levied in paragraph (a) of this section is made in accordance with the fee collection regulations of the IRS at 26 CFR part 301, Sec. 301.9001. Federal government entitlement to royalty oil does not constitute ownership of oil at time of production. The Fund Administrator advises the IRS when the unobligated Fund balance requires starting or stopping the collection of the barrel fee levied in this section, so the IRS may provide appropriate notice to affected owners of OCS oil.
