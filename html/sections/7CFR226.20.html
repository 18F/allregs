Meals served to infants ages birth through 11 months must meet the requirements described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. Foods included in the infant meal must be of a texture and a consistency that are appropriate for the age of the infant being served. The foods must be served during a span of time consistent with the infant's eating habits. For those infants whose dietary needs are more individualized, exceptions to the meal pattern must be made in accordance with the requirements found in paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Feeding meals to infants. Meals served to infants ages birth through 11 months must meet the requirements described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. Foods included in the infant meal must be of a texture and a consistency that are appropriate for the age of the infant being served. The foods must be served during a span of time consistent with the infant's eating habits. For those infants whose dietary needs are more individualized, exceptions to the meal pattern must be made in accordance with the requirements found in paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Breastmilk and iron-fortified formula. Either breastmilk or iron-fortified infant formula, or portions of both, must be served for the entire first year. Meals containing breastmilk and meals containing iron-fortified infant formula supplied by the facility are eligible for reimbursement. However, infant formula provided by a parent (or guardian) and breastmilk fed directly by the infant's mother, during a visit to the facility, contribute to a reimbursable meal only when the facility supplies at least one component of the infant's meal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fruit juice. Juice should not be offered to infants until they are 6 months of age and ready to drink from a cup. Feeding fruit juice only from a cup will help develop behaviors that may prevent early childhood caries. Fruit juice served as part of the meal pattern for infants 8 through 11 months must be full-strength.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Solid foods. Solid foods of an appropriate texture and consistency are required only when the infant is developmentally ready to accept them. The facility should consult with the infant's parent (or guardian) in making the decision to introduce solid foods. Solid foods should be introduced one at a time on a gradual basis with the intent of ensuring the infant's health and nutritional well-being.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Infant meal pattern. Infant meals must have, at a minimum, each of the food components indicated, in the amount that is appropriate for the infant's age. For some breastfed infants who regularly consume less than the minimum amount of breastmilk per feeding, a serving of less than the minimum amount of breastmilk may be offered. In these situations, additional breastmilk must be offered if the infant is still hungry. Meals may include portions of breastmilk and iron-fortified infant formula as long as the total number of ounces meets, or exceeds, the minimum amount required of this food component. Similarly, to meet the component requirements for vegetables and fruit, portions of both may be served.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Birth through 3 months. Only breastmilk or iron-fortified formula is required to meet the infant's nutritional needs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Breakfast--4 to 6 fluid ounces of breastmilk or iron-fortified infant formula.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Lunch or supper--4 to 6 fluid ounces of breastmilk or iron-fortified infant formula.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Snack--4 to 6 fluid ounces of breastmilk or iron-fortified infant formula.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 4 through 7 months. Breastmilk or iron-fortified formula is required. Some infants may be developmentally ready for solid foods of an appropriate

texture and consistency. Meals are reimbursable when facilities provide all of the components in the meal pattern that the infant is developmentally ready to accept.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Breakfast--4 to 8 fluid ounces of breastmilk or iron-fortified infant formula; and 0 to 3 tablespoons of iron-fortified dry infant cereal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Lunch or supper--4 to 8 fluid ounces of breastmilk or iron-fortified infant formula; and 0 to 3 tablespoons of iron-fortified dry infant cereal; and 0 to 3 tablespoons of fruit or vegetable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Snack--4 to 6 fluid ounces of breastmilk or iron-fortified infant formula.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 8 through 11 months. Breastmilk or iron-fortified formula and solid foods of an appropriate texture and consistency are required. Meals are reimbursable when facilities provide all of the components in the meal pattern that the infant is developmentally ready to accept.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Breakfast--6 to 8 fluid ounces of breastmilk or iron-fortified infant formula; 2 to 4 tablespoons of iron-fortified dry infant cereal; and 1 to 4 tablespoons of fruit or vegetable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Lunch or supper--6 to 8 fluid ounces of breastmilk or iron-fortified infant formula; 2 to 4 tablespoons of iron-fortified dry infant cereal; and/or 1 to 4 tablespoons of meat, fish, poultry, egg yolk, or cooked dry beans or peas; or \1/2\ to 2 ounces (weight) of cheese; or 1 to 4 ounces (volume) of cottage cheese; or 1 to 4 ounces (weight) of cheese food or cheese spread; and 1 to 4 tablespoons of fruit or vegetable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Snack--2 to 4 fluid ounces of breastmilk, iron-fortified infant formula, or full strength fruit juice; and 0 to \1/2\ slice of crusty bread (if developmentally ready) or 0 to 2 cracker type products (if developmentally ready), which are made from whole-grain or enriched meal or flour, and suitable as a finger food for an infant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Infant meal pattern table.

To improve the nutrition of participating children over 1 year of age additional foods may be served with each meal as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Breakfast. Include as often as practical one-half egg; or a 1-ounce serving (edible portion as served) of meat, poultry or fish; or 1-ounce of cheese; or 2 tablespoons of peanut butter; or 4 oz. of yogurt; or an equivalent quantity of any combination of these foods. Additional foods may be served as desired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Lunch, supper or supplemental food. Additional foods may be served as desired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Temporary unavailability of milk. If emergency conditions prevent an institution normally having a supply of milk from temporarily obtaining milk deliveries, the State agency may approve the service of breakfasts, lunches, or suppers without milk during the emergency period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Continuing unavailability of milk. The inability of an institution to obtain a supply of milk on a continuing basis shall not bar it from participation in the Program. In such cases, the State agency may approve service of meals without milk, provided that an equivalent amount of canned, whole dry or nonfat dry milk is used in the preparation of the components of the meal set forth in paragraphs (a)(1), (2) and (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Statewide substitutions. In American Samoa, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands the following variations from the meal requirements are authorized: A serving of a starchy vegetable, such as yams, plantains, or sweet potatoes may be substituted for the bread requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Individual substitutions. Substitutions may be made in food listed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section if individual participants are unable, because of medical or other special dietary needs, to consume such foods. Substitutions because of medical needs shall be made only when supported by a statement from a recognized medical authority which includes recommended alternate foods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Special variations. FNS may approve variations in the food components of the meals on an experimental or a continuing basis in any institution where there is evidence that such variations are nutritionally sound and are necessary to meet ethnic, religious, economic, or physical needs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Meal planning. Institutions shall plan for and order meals on the basis of current participation trends, with the objective of providing only one meal per participant at each meal service. Records of participation and of ordering or preparing meals shall be maintained to demonstrate positive action toward this objective. In recognition of the fluctuation in participation levels which makes it difficult to estimate precisely the number of meals needed and to reduce the resultant waste, any excess meals that are ordered may be served to participants and may be claimed for reimbursement, unless the State agency determines that the institution has failed to plan and prepare or order meals with the objective of providing only one meal per participant at each meal service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Time of meal service. State agencies may require any institution or facility to allow a specific amount of time to elapse between meal services or require that meal services not exceed a specified duration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Sanitation. Institutions shall ensure that in storing, preparing, and serving food, proper sanitation and health standards are met which conform with all applicable State and local laws and regulations. Institutions shall ensure that adequate facilities are available to store food or hold meals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Donated commodities. Institutions shall efficiently use in the Program any foods donated by the Department and accepted by the institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Plentiful foods. Institutions shall, insofar as practical, purchase and efficiently use in the Program foods designated as plentiful by the Department.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Additional provision. The State agency may allow institutions which serve meals prepared in schools participating in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs to substitute the meal pattern requirements of the regulations governing those Programs (7 CFR part 210 and 7 CFR part 220, respectively) for the meal pattern requirements contained in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> Family-style meal service. Meals may be served in a family-style setting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> Offer versus serve. (1) Each adult day care center shall offer its adult participants all of the required food servings as set forth in paragraph (c)(1), (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section. However, at the discretion of the adult day care center, adult participants may be permitted to decline:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each adult day care center shall offer its adult participants all of the required food servings as set forth in paragraph (c)(1), (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section. However, at the discretion of the adult day care center, adult participants may be permitted to decline:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> One of the four food items (one serving of milk, one serving of vegetable and/or fruit, and two servings of bread or bread alternate) required at breakfast;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Two of the six food items (one serving of milk, two servings of vegetable and/or fruit, two servings of bread or bread alternate, and one serving of meat or meat alternate) required at lunch;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Two of the five food items (two servings of vegetables and/or fruit, two servings of bread or bread alternate, and one serving of meat or meat alternate) required at supper.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The price of a reimbursable meal shall not be affected if an adult participant declines a food item.
