After receiving NOAA's written notification, a RICE shall have up to 45 calendar days to request in writing that NOAA reconsider its intent to decertify the RICE. The RICE's request for reconsideration shall contain sufficient information for NOAA to determine whether to grant the request for reconsideration. Alternatively, the RICE may correct the deficiency(ies) identified by NOAA within 45 calendar days, notify NOAA in writing of the corrective action(s) taken, and provide sufficient evidence for NOAA to determine the correctness and effectiveness of the corrective action(s) taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a RICE submits to NOAA a written request for reconsideration or a written assertion that the identified deficiency(ies) has been corrected, NOAA shall have up to 60 calendar days after receipt of the request or assertion, to review the request for reconsideration or the assertion of corrective action. NOAA's decision, along with the reason for its decision, shall be delivered to the applicant via letter delivered by first class mail and by electronic means.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Upon decertification, a RICE shall no longer be incorporated into the System.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A RICE may act voluntarily to terminate its certification at any time by notifying NOAA in writing of its desire to do so.
