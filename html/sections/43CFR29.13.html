The terms of the trust arrangement shall be determined by the Secretary. During the next succeeding session of Congress, the Secretary shall request that Congress provide for final disposition of the Fund. If Congress at any time establishes a comprehensive oil pollution liability fund which supersedes or repeals the Fund, the Fund assets and any pending claims shall be disposed of as Congress or the Secretary shall direct.</p>
