                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Failed insured depository institution is an insured depository institution for which the FDIC has been appointed receiver pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1821(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Insured depository institution has the same meaning as provided by 12 U.S.C. 1813(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Records means any reasonably accessible document, book, paper, map, photograph, microfiche, microfilm, computer or electronically-created record generated or maintained by an insured depository institution in the course of and necessary to its transaction of business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Examples of records include, without limitation, board or committee meeting minutes, contracts to which the insured depository institution was a party, deposit account information, employee and employee benefits information, general ledger and financial reports or data, litigation files, and loan documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Records do not include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Multiple copies of records; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of the FDIC or any agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of insured depository institutions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determination of records. In determining whether particular documentary material obtained from a failed insured depository institution is a record for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(15)(D), the FDIC in its discretion will consider the following factors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Whether the documentary material related to the business of the insured depository institution,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Whether the documentary material was generated or maintained as records in the regular course of the business of the insured depository institution in accordance with its own recordkeeping practices and procedures or pursuant to standards established by its regulators,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whether the documentary material is needed by the FDIC to carry out its receivership function, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The expected evidentiary needs of the FDIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The FDIC's determination that documentary material from a failed insured depository institution constitutes records is solely for the purpose of identifying that documentary material that must be maintained pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(15)(D) and shall not bear on the discoverability or

admissibility of such documentary material in any court, tribunal or other adjudicative proceeding, nor on whether such documentary material is subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act or other law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Destruction of records. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, after the end of the six-year period beginning on the date the FDIC is appointed as receiver of a failed insured depository institution, the FDIC may destroy any records of an institution which the FDIC, in its discretion, determines to be unnecessary unless directed not to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction or governmental agency, prohibited by law, or subject to a legal hold imposed by the FDIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, after the end of the six-year period beginning on the date the FDIC is appointed as receiver of a failed insured depository institution, the FDIC may destroy any records of an institution which the FDIC, in its discretion, determines to be unnecessary unless directed not to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction or governmental agency, prohibited by law, or subject to a legal hold imposed by the FDIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the FDIC may destroy records of a failed insured depository institution which are at least 10 years old as of the date on which the FDIC is appointed as the receiver of such institution in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section at any time after such appointment is final, without regard to the six-year period of limitation contained in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Transfer of records. If the FDIC transfers records to a third party in connection with a transaction involving the purchase and assumption of assets and liabilities of an insured depository institution, the recordkeeping requirements of 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(15)(D), and paragraph (d) of this section shall be satisfied if the transferee agrees that it will not destroy such records for at least six years from the date the FDIC was appointed as receiver of such failed insured depository institution unless otherwise notified in writing by the FDIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Policies and procedures. The FDIC may establish policies and procedures with respect to the retention and destruction of records that are consistent with this section.

A joint account with two owners will be associated with two records in the deposit-customer join file, one for each owner. The deposit-customer join file will contain other records associated with a deposit account to designate, among other things, beneficiaries, custodians, trustees and agents.

Sec. Appendix H to Part 360--Possible File Combinations for Deposit Data</p><p class="depth0">A covered institution must provide deposit data using separate deposit, sweep/automated credit, hold, customer, and deposit-customer join files. The simplest file structure involves providing one of each file. This basic file format is shown in Figure 1.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JY08.000</p><p class="depth0">Multiple combinations of deposit, sweep/automated credit, hold, customer, and deposit-customer join files are permissible, but only in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0">1. Each separate deposit file must have companion sweep/automated credit and hold files covering the same deposit accounts.</p><p class="depth0">2. A single customer file may be submitted covering customers affiliated with deposit accounts in one or more deposit files as long as the customer file contains information on all of the customers affiliated with the deposit files.</p><p class="depth0">3. Several customer files may be submitted as long as each separate customer file contains information on all of the customers affiliated with the associated deposit files.</p><p class="depth0">Figure 2 shows a permissible file configuration using a single Customer File affiliated with Deposit File A and Deposit File B. As required, Deposit File A has a companion Sweep/Automated Credit File A and Hold File A. The same is true for Deposit File B.</p><p class="depth0">Another permissible combination of files is shown in Figure 3, which is a variation of the basic data file structure shown in Figure 1.
