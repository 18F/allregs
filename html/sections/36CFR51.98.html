The Director and any duly authorized representative of the Director must, for the purpose of audit and examination, have access to all pertinent records, books, documents, and papers of the concessioner, subconcessioner and any parent or affiliate of the concessioner (but with respect to parents and affiliates, only to the extent necessary to confirm the validity and performance of any representations or commitments made to the Director by a parent or affiliate of the concessioner).</p>
