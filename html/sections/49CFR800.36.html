                            <p class="depth0">A petition for extension of the time to submit comments must be  received not later than 10 days before the end of the comment period  stated in the notice. The petition must be submitted to: General  Counsel, National Transportation Safety Board, 490 L'Enfant Plaza SW.,  Washington, DC 20594-2003. The filing of the petition does not  automatically extend the time for petitioner's comments. Such a petition  is granted only if the petitioner shows good cause for the extension,  and if the extension is consistent with the public interest. If an  extension is granted, it is granted to all persons, and the NTSB will  publish a notice of the extension of the comment period in the Federal  Register.</p>
