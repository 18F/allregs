                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Multi-section homes with ductwork in more than one section  require crossover connections to complete the duct system of the home.  All ductwork connections, including duct collars, must be sealed to  prevent air leakage. Galvanized metal straps or tape and mastics listed  to UL 181A (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 3285.4), for closure  systems with rigid air ducts and connectors, or UL 181B (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 3285.4), for closure systems with flexible air  ducts and connectors, must be used around the duct collar and secured  tightly to make all connections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If metal straps are used, they must be secured with galvanized  sheet metal screws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Metal ducts must be fastened to the collar with a minimum of  three galvanized sheet metal screws equally spaced around the collar.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Air conditioning or heating ducts must be installed in  accordance with applicable requirements of the duct manufacturer  installation instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The duct must be suspended or supported above the ground by  straps or other means that are spaced at a maximum distance not to  exceed 4[foot]-0 or as otherwise permitted by the  installation instructions. When straps are used to support a flexible  type duct, the straps must be at least \1/2\ wider than the  spacing of the metal spirals encasing the duct. The ducts must be  installed such that the straps cannot slip between any two spirals and  arranged under the floor to prevent compression or kinking in any  location, as shown in Figures A and B to this section. In-floor  crossover ducts are permitted, in accordance with Sec. 3285.606(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Crossover ducts outside the thermal envelope must be insulated  with materials that conform to designs consistent with part 3280,  subpart F of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In-floor or ceiling crossover duct connections must be installed  and sealed to prevent air leakage. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC07.019</p><p class="depth2">Notes: 1. This system is typically used when a crossover duct has  not been built into the floor and the furnace is outside the I-Beam.  With this type of installation, it is necessary for two flexible ducts  to be installed.</p><p class="depth2">2. The crossover duct must be listed for exterior use.   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC07.020</p><p class="depth2">Notes: 1. This system is typically used when a crossover duct has  not been built into the floor and the furnace is situated directly over  the main duct in one section of the home. A single flexible duct is then  used to connect the two sections to each other.</p><p class="depth2">2. The crossover duct must be listed for exterior use.</p>
