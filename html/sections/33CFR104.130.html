                            <p class="depth0">Any vessel owner or operator may apply for a waiver of any  requirement of this part that the owner or operator considers  unnecessary in light of the nature or operating conditions of the  vessel. A request for a waiver must be submitted in writing with  justification to the Commandant (CG-5P), Attn: Assistant Commandant for  Prevention Policy, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7501, 2703 Martin Luther King  Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7501. The Commandant (CG-5P) may  require the vessel owner or operator to provide additional data for  determining the validity of the requested waiver. The Commandant (CG-5P)  may grant, in writing, a waiver with or without conditions only if the  waiver will not reduce the overall security of the vessel, its  passengers, its crew, or its cargo, or facilities or ports that the  vessel may visit.
