                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section applies to summary suspensions that are initially issued for more than 30 days and summary suspensions continued for more than 30 days except those identified in paragraph Sec. 1303.12(g) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After receiving concurrence from the Commissioner, ACYF, the responsible HHS official may suspend a grant for more than 30 days. A suspension may, among other bases, be imposed for the same reasons that justify termination of financial assistance or which justify a denial of refunding of a grant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A notice of a suspension under this section shall set forth:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The reasons for the action;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The duration of the suspension, which may be indefinite;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The fact that the action may be appealed to the Departmental Appeals Board and the time within which it must be appealed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> During the period of suspension a grantee may not incur any valid obligations against Federal Head Start grant funds, nor may any grantee expenditure or provision of in-kind services or items of value made during the period be counted as applying toward any required matching contribution required of a grantee, except as otherwise provided in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The responsible HHS official may appoint an agency to serve as an interim grantee to operate the program until either the grantee's suspension is lifted or a new grantee is selected in accordance with subparts B and C of 45 CFR part 1302.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any appeal to the Departmental Appeals Board must be made within five days of the grantee's receipt of notice of suspension or return of the notice as undeliverable, refused, or unclaimed. Such an appeal must be in writing and it must fully set forth the grounds for the appeal and be accompanied by all documentation that the grantee believes is relevant and supportive of its position.</p><p class="depth2">All such appeals shall be addressed to the Departmental Appeals Board, and the appellant will send a copy of the appeal to the Commissioner, ACYF, and the responsible HHS official. Appeals will be governed by the Departmental Appeals Board's regulations at 45 CFR part 16, except as otherwise provided in the Head Start appeals regulations. Any grantee requesting a hearing as part of its appeal shall be afforded one by the Departmental Appeals Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If a grantee is successful on its appeal any costs incurred during the period of suspension that are otherwise allowable may be paid with Federal grant funds. Moreover, any cash or in-kind contributions of the grantee during the suspension period that are otherwise allowable may be counted toward meeting the grantee's non-Federal share requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If a grantee's appeal is denied by the Departmental Appeals Board, but the grantee is subsequently restored to the program because it has corrected those conditions which warranted the suspension, its activities during the period of the suspension remain outside the scope of the program.</p><p class="depth2">Federal funds may not be used to offset any costs during the period, nor may any cash or in-kind contributions received during the period be used to meet non-Federal share requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the Federal agency institutes termination proceedings during a suspension, or denies refunding, the two actions shall merge and the grantee need not file a new appeal. Rather, the Departmental Appeals Board will be notified by the Federal agency and will automatically be vested with jurisdiction over the termination action or the denial of refunding and will, pursuant to its rules and procedures, permit the grantee to respond to the notice of termination. In a situation where a suspension action is merged into a termination action in accordance with this section, the suspension continues until there is an administrative decision by the Departmental Appeals Board on the grantee's appeal.</p>
