                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Changes in the scope of testing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Manufacturers or processors  subject to a consent agreement, other persons or EPA may seek  modifications in the scope of testing performed under the consent  agreement. If, upon receiving a request for modification, EPA determines  that new issues have been raised that warrant reconsideration of the  scope of testing, or if EPA determines on its own that such  reconsideration is appropriate, EPA will publish a Federal Register  notice describing the proposed modification and soliciting public  comment. If, based on the comments received, EPA concludes that  differences of opinion may exist about the proposed modification, EPA  will establish a schedule for conducting negotiations and invite parties  who wish to participate in or monitor these negotiations to contact the  Agency in writing. Any negotiations that EPA conducts will conform to  the procedures specified in Sec. 790.22(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The scope of testing required by a consent agreement will be  modified only where there is a consensus concerning the modified testing  requirements among EPA, affected manufacturers and/or processors, and  other persons who have asked to participate in or monitor negotiations  under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In determining whether a  consensus exists, EPA will employ the criteria specified in Sec.  790.22(b)(8). In the absence of consensus, EPA may initiate rulemaking  under section 4(a) of the Act if it concludes that any testing beyond  that required by the consent agreement is necessary and that the other  statutory findings required by section 4(a) can be made. While such  rulemaking proceedings are underway, the consent agreement will remain  in effect unless EPA finds that the testing required by the agreement is  or may be unnecessary in view of the testing requirements included in  EPA's proposed rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Changes in test standards or schedules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any test sponsor who  wishes to modify the test schedule for any test required under a consent  agreement must submit an application in accordance with this paragraph.  Application for modification must be made using the method specified in  Sec. 790.5(b). Applications must include an appropriate explanation and  rationale for the modification. EPA will consider only those  applications that request modifications to mandatory testing conditions  or requirements (``shall statements'' in the consent agreement). Where a  test sponsor requests EPA to provide guidance or to clarify a non- mandatory testing requirement (i.e., ``should statements''), the test  sponsor shall submit these requests to EPA using the method specified in  Sec. 790.5(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where EPA concludes that the requested modification of a test  standard or schedule for a test required under a consent agreement is  appropriate, EPA will proceed in accordance with this paragraph (b)(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> and describing the nature of  the modifications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> of this section, and provide a  brief rationale of why the modification was granted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), a requested modification  of a test standard of schedule for a test required under a consent  agreement would alter the scope of the test or significantly change the  schedule for completing the test if the modification would:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Change the test species.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Change the route of administration of the test chemical.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Change the period of time during which the test species is  exposed to the test chemical.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section,  extend the final reporting deadline more than 12 months from the date  specified in the consent order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where EPA concludes that the requested modification of a test  standard or schedule for a test requirement under a consent agreement is  not appropriate, EPA will so notify the test sponsor in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Timing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Test sponsors should submit all applications for  test schedule modifications at least 60 days before the reporting  deadline for the test in question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> EPA will not normally approve any test schedule extensions  submitted less than 30 days before the reporting deadline for the test  in question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, EPA  may grant extensions as shown necessary for up to 1 year but will  normally limit extensions to a period of time equal to the in-life  portion of the test plus 60 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> EPA will normally approve only one deadline extension for each  test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Test sponsors should submit requests for test standard  modifications as soon as they determine that the test cannot be  successfully completed according to the test standard specified in the  consent order.
