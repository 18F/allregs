                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All legal process in the nature of garnishment shall be date and  time stamped by the Authorized Agent when received for the purpose of  determining the order of receipt of process which is sufficient as to  legal form and contains sufficient information for identification of the  employee, the Authorized Agent's date and time stamp shall be conclusive  evidence. Child support and alimony garnishments will be accorded  priority over commercial garnishments under 5 U.S.C. 5520a as provided  in 5 U.S.C. 5520a(h)(2). Garnishments shall be executed provided that  the pay cycle is open for input or, if closed, will be held until the  next cycle. In no event shall the Postal Service be required to   vary its normal pay or disbursement cycles in order to comply with legal  process of any kind. Garnishments shall be recalculated, if required, to  fit within the normal postal pay cycles. The Postal Service shall not be  required to withhold pay and hold the funds in escrow. The Postal  Service, in its sole discretion, may process more than one garnishment  at a time within the restrictions on garnishments in Section 491.9 of  these regulations. The Postal Service may, in its sole discretion,  accept and hold for processing garnishments received after the  garnishment currently in force.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Postal Service will only accept and effectuate legal process  for a person who is currently employed. Upon cessation of employment,  process relating to that individual will be terminated and not retained.  The Postal Service shall not be required to establish an escrow account  to comply with legal process even if the applicable law of the  jurisdiction requires private employers to do so. Legal process must  state on its face that the Postal Service withhold up to a specific  total amount of money, the Postal Service will not calculate interest,  charges, or any variable in processing a garnishment. The Postal Service  may continue processing a garnishment if the garnishing attorney  provides the adjusted total including the additional money owed, as  determined from his calculation of the variable amounts. The attorney is  deemed to certify on his professional responsibility that the  calculations are correct and will indemnify the employee directly for  any errors. All garnishments of periodic pay may be effectuated in  accordance with the bi-weekly pay schedule. The Postal Service need not  vary its pay and disbursement cycles to accommodate withholding on any  other cycle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Neither the Postal Service, the Postal Rate Commission nor any  disbursing officer shall be liable for any payment made from moneys due  from, or payable by the Postal Service or the Postal Rate Commission to  any individual pursuant to legal process regular on its face.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Postal Service, the Postal Rate Commission, any disbursing  officer or any other employee shall not be liable to pay money damages  for failure to comply with legal process.</p>
