                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Amendments without consideration. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When an actual or  threatened loss under a defense contract, however caused, will impair  the productive ability of a contractor whose continued performance on  any defense contract or whose continued operation as a source of supply  is found to be essential to the national defense, the contract may be  amended without consideration, but only to the extent necessary to avoid  such impairment to the contractor's productive ability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a contractor suffers a loss (not merely a decrease in  anticipated profits) under a defense contract because of Government  action, the character of the action will generally determine whether any  adjustment in the contract will be made, and its extent. When the  Government directs its action primarily at the contractor and acts in  its capacity as the other contracting party, the contract may be  adjusted in the interest of fairness. Thus, when Government action,  while not creating any liability on the Government's part, increases  performance cost and results in a loss to the contractor, fairness may  make some adjustment appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Correcting mistakes. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A contract may be amended or modified  to correct or mitigate the effect of a mistake. The following are  examples of mistakes that may make such action appropriate:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A mistake or ambiguity consisting of the failure to express, or  express clearly, in a written contract, the agreement as both parties  understood it.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A contractor's mistake so obvious that it was or should have  been apparent to the contracting officer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A mutual mistake as to a material fact.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amending contracts to correct mistakes with the least possible  delay normally will facilitate the national defense by expediting the  contracting program and assuring contractors that mistakes will be  corrected expeditiously and fairly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Formalizing informal commitments. Under certain circumstances,  informal commitments may be formalized to permit payment to persons who  have taken action without a formal contract; for example, when a person,  responding to an agency official's written or oral instructions and  relying in good faith upon the official's apparent authority to issue  them, has furnished or arranged to furnish supplies or services to the  agency, or to a defense contractor or subcontractor, without formal  contractual coverage. Formalizing commitments under such circumstances  normally will facilitate the national defense by assuring such persons  that they will be treated fairly and paid expeditiously.</p>
