                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Submission of cost statement--1) Accepted applications. Within  60 days after the last date for filing mandatory terms and conditions  pursuant to Sec. 4.32(c)(4) for a new dam or diversion license  application seeking PURPA benefits, Sec. 4.93(b) for an application for  exemption of a small conduit hydroelectric facility, or Sec.  4.105(b)(1) for an application for case-specific exemption of a small  hydroelectric power project, a fish and wildlife agency must file with  the Commission a cost statement of the reasonable costs the agency  incurred in setting mandatory terms and conditions for the proposed  project. An agency may request, in writing, along with any supporting  documentation an extension of this 60-day period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rejected, withdrawn or dismissed applications. The Director of  the Office of Energy Projects (Director) will, by letter, notify each  fish and wildlife agency if a section 30(c) application is rejected,  withdrawn or dismissed. Within 60 days from the date of notification, a  fish and wildlife agency must file with the Commission a cost statement  of the reasonable costs the agency incurred prior to the date the  application was rejected, withdrawn, or dismissed. An agency may submit  a written request for an extension of this 60-day period along with any  supporting documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If an agency has not submitted a cost statement or extension  request within the time provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it  waives its right to receive fees for that project pursuant to this  subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> applicant. The bill will  show:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The cost statement submitted to the Commission by each fish and  wildlife agency;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any amounts already paid by the applicant pursuant to Sec.  4.302; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount due, if the amount already paid by the applicant  pursuant to Sec. 4.302 is less than the total of all the cost  statements; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount to be refunded to the applicant, if the amount  already paid by the applicant pursuant to Sec. 4.302 is more than the  total of all the cost statements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Within 45 days from the date of a bill issued under paragraph  (b) of this section, a section 30(c) applicant must pay in full to the  Commission any remaining amounts due on the cost statements regardless  of whether any of these amounts are in dispute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Dispute procedures--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When to dispute. Any dispute regarding  the reasonableness of any fish and wildlife agency cost statement must  be made within 45 days from the date of a bill issued under paragraph  (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Assessment of disputed cost statements The burden of showing  that an agency's cost statement is unreasonable is on the applicant.  However, a fish and wildlife agency must supply the disputing applicant  and the Commission with the documentation necessary to support its cost  statement. The Director of the Office of Energy Projects will determine  the reasonableness of a disputed fish and wildlife agency cost  statement. The Director's decision will be in writing. The Director will  notify the disputing applicant and the fish and wildlife agency of the  decision by letter. Any decision of the Director may be appealed by  either party pursuant to 18 CFR 385.1902. In deciding whether or not a  disputed cost statement is reasonable, the Director will review the  application, the disputed cost statement and any other   documentation relating to the particular environmental problems  associated with the disputing applicant's proposed project. The Director  will consider such factors as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The time the fish and wildlife agency spent reviewing the  application;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The proportion of the cost statement to the time the fish and  wildlife agency spent reviewing the application;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether the fish and wildlife agency's expenditures conform to  Federal expenditure guidelines for such items as travel, per diem,  personnel, and contracting; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the studies conducted by the agency, if any, are  duplicative, limited to the proposed project area, unnecessary to  determine the impacts to or mitigation measures for the particular fish  and wildlife resources affected by the proposed project, or otherwise  unnecessary to set terms and conditions for the proposed project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Unreasonable cost statements. If the Director determines that a  disputed fish and wildlife agency cost statement is unreasonable, the  disputing applicant and the fish and wildlife agency will be afforded 45  days from the date of notification to attempt to reach an agreement  regarding the reimbursable costs of the agency. If the disputing  applicant and the fish and wildlife agency fail to reach an agreement on  the disputed cost statement within 45 days from the date of  notification, the Director will determine the costs that the agency  should reasonably have incurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Refunds. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the amount paid by a section 30(c) applicant  under Sec. 4.302 exceeds the total amount of the cost statements  submitted by fish and wildlife agencies under paragraph (a) of this  section, the Commission will notify the Treasury to refund the  difference to the applicant within 45 days from the date of the bill  issued to the applicant under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this section, the Commission will notify the Treasury to  refund the difference to the applicant within 45 days of the resolution  of all dispute proceedings.
