                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A charging document may be issued against an alien granted  Temporary Protected Status on grounds of deportability or excludability  which would have rendered the alien statutorily ineligible for such  status pursuant to Sec. Sec. 1244.3(c) and 244.4. Aliens shall not be  deported for a particular offense for which the Service has expressly  granted a waiver. If the alien is deportable on a waivable ground, and  no such waiver for the charged offense has been previously granted, then  the alien may seek such a waiver in deportation or exclusion  proceedings. The charging document shall constitute notice to the alien  that his or her status in the United States is subject to withdrawal. A  final order of deportation or exclusion against an alien granted  Temporary Protected Status shall constitute a withdrawal of such status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The filing of the charging document by the Service with the  Immigration Court renders inapplicable any other administrative,  adjudication or review of eligibility for Temporary   Protected Status. The alien shall have the right to a de novo  determination of his or her eligibility for Temporary Protected Status  in the deportation or exclusion proceedings. Review by the Board of  Immigration Appeals shall be the exclusive administrative appellate  review procedure. If an appeal is already pending before the  Administrative Appeals Unit, the director shall notify the  Administrative Appeals Unit of the filing of the charging document, in  which case the pending appeal shall be dismissed and the record of  proceeding returned to the jurisdiction where the charging document was  filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon denial of Temporary Protected Status by the Administrative  Appeals Unit, the Administrative Appeals Unit shall immediately forward  the record of proceeding to the director having jurisdiction over the  alien's place of residence. The director shall, as soon as practicable,  file a charging document with the Immigration Court if the alien is then  deportable or excludable under section 241(a) or section 212(a) of the  Act, respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An alien who is determined by the Service to be deportable or  excludable upon grounds which would have rendered the alien ineligible  for such status as provided in Sec. Sec. 1240.3(c) and 1240.4 may be  detained under the provisions of this chapter pending deportation or  exclusion proceedings. Such alien may be removed from the United States  upon entry of a final order of deportation or exclusion.
