                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section provides rules for certain transactions in which a corporation or a partnership (the acquiring entity) acquires money or other property (as defined in Sec. 1.1032-1) in exchange, in whole or in part, for stock of a corporation (the issuing corporation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Nonrecognition of gain or loss--(1) General rule. In a transaction to which this section applies, no gain or loss is recognized on the disposition of the issuing corporation's stock by the acquiring entity. The transaction is treated as if, immediately before the acquiring entity disposes of the stock of the issuing corporation, the acquiring entity purchased the issuing corporation's stock from the issuing corporation for fair market value with cash contributed to the acquiring entity by the issuing corporation (or, if necessary, through intermediate corporations or partnerships). For rules that may apply in determining the issuing corporation's adjustment to basis in the acquiring entity (or, if necessary, in determining the adjustment to basis in intermediate entities), see sections 358, 722, and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. In a transaction to which this section applies, no gain or loss is recognized on the disposition of the issuing corporation's stock by the acquiring entity. The transaction is treated as if, immediately before the acquiring entity disposes of the stock of the issuing corporation, the acquiring entity purchased the issuing corporation's stock from the issuing corporation for fair market value with cash contributed to the acquiring entity by the issuing corporation (or, if necessary, through intermediate corporations or partnerships). For rules that may apply in determining the issuing corporation's adjustment to basis in the acquiring entity (or, if necessary, in determining the adjustment to basis in intermediate entities), see sections 358, 722, and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for actual payment for stock of the issuing corporation. If the issuing corporation receives money or other property in payment for its stock, the amount of cash deemed contributed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is the difference between the fair market value of the issuing corporation stock and the amount of money or the fair market value of other property that the issuing corporation receives as payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Applicability. The rules of this section apply only if, pursuant to a plan to acquire money or other property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The acquiring entity acquires stock of the issuing corporation directly or indirectly from the issuing corporation in a transaction in which, but for this section, the basis of the stock of the issuing corporation in the hands of the acquiring entity would be determined, in whole or in part, with respect to the issuing corporation's basis in the issuing corporation's stock under section 362(a) or 723 (provided that, in the case of an indirect acquisition by the acquiring entity, the transfers of issuing corporation stock through intermediate entities occur immediately after one another);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The acquiring entity immediately transfers the stock of the issuing corporation to acquire money or other property (from a person other than an entity from which the stock was directly or indirectly acquired);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The party receiving stock of the issuing corporation in the exchange specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section from the acquiring entity does not receive a substituted basis in the stock of the issuing corporation within the meaning of section 7701(a)(42); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The issuing corporation stock is not exchanged for stock of the issuing corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Stock options. The rules of this section shall apply to an option issued by a corporation to buy or sell its own stock in the same manner as the rules of this section apply to the stock of an issuing corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X, a corporation, owns all of the stock of Y corporation. Y reaches an agreement with C, an individual, to acquire a truck from C in exchange for 10 shares of X stock with a fair market value of $100. To effectuate Y's agreement with C,X transfers to Y the X stock in a transaction in which, but for this section, the basis of the X stock in the hands of Y would be determined with respect to X's basis in the X stock under section 362(a). Y immediately transfers the X stock to C to acquire the truck.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 1, no gain or loss is recognized on the disposition of the X stock by Y. Immediately before Y's disposition of the X stock, Y is treated as purchasing the X stock from X for $100 of cash contributed to Y by X. Under section 358, X's basis in its Y stock is increased by $100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assume the same facts as Example 1, except that, rather than X stock, X transfers an option with a fair market value of $100 to purchase X stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 2, no gain or loss is recognized on the disposition of the X stock option by Y. Immediately before Y's disposition of the X stock option, Y is treated as purchasing the X stock option from X for $100 of cash contributed to Y by X. Under section 358, X's basis in its Y stock is increased by $100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X, a corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of Y corporation. Y is a partner in partnership Z. Z reaches an agreement with C, an individual, to acquire a truck from C in exchange for 10 shares of X stock with a fair market value of $100. To effectuate Z's agreement with C, X transfers to Y the X stock in a transaction in which, but for this section, the basis of the X stock in the hands of Y would be determined with respect to X's basis in the X stock under section 362(a). Y immediately transfers the X stock to Z in a transaction in which, but for this section, the basis of the X stock in the hands of Z would be determined under section 723. Z immediately transfers the X stock to C to acquire the truck.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 3, no gain or loss is recognized on the disposition of the X stock by Z. Immediately before Z's disposition of the X stock, Z is treated as purchasing the X stock from X for $100 of cash indirectly contributed to Z by X through an intermediate corporation, Y. Under section 722, Y's basis in its Z partnership interest is increased by $100, and, under section 358, X's basis in its Y stock is increased by $100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X, a corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of Y corporation. B, an individual, is an employee of Y. Pursuant to an agreement between X and Y to compensate B for services provided to Y, X transfers to B 10 shares of X stock with a fair market value of $100. Under Sec. 1.83-6(d), but for this section, the transfer of X stock by X to B would be treated as a contribution of the X stock by X to the capital of Y, and immediately thereafter, a transfer of the X stock by Y to B. But for this section, the basis of the X stock in the hands of Y would be determined with respect to X's basis in the X stock under section 362(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 4, no gain or loss is recognized on the deemed disposition of the X stock by Y. Immediately before Y's deemed disposition of the X stock, Y is treated as purchasing the X stock from X for $100 of cash contributed to Y by X. Under section 358, X's basis in its Y stock is increased by $100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X, a corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of Y corporation. B, an

individual, is an employee of Y. To compensate B for services provided to Y, B is offered the opportunity to purchase 10 shares of X stock with a fair market value of $100 at a reduced price of $80. B transfers $80 and Y transfers $10 to X as partial payment for the X stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 5, no gain or loss is recognized on the deemed disposition of the X stock by Y. Immediately before Y's deemed disposition of the X stock, Y is treated as purchasing the X stock from X for $100, $80 of which Y is deemed to have received from B, $10 of which originated with Y, and $10 of which is deemed to have been contributed to Y by X. Under section 358, X's basis in its Y stock is increased by $10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X, a corporation, owns stock of Y. To compensate Y's employee, B, for services provided to Y, X issues 10 shares of X stock to B, subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. B does not have an election under section 83(b) in effect with respect to the X stock. X retains the only reversionary interest in the X stock in the event that B forfeits the right to the stock. Several years after X's transfer of the X shares, the stock vests. At the time the stock vests, the 10 shares of X stock have a fair market value of $100. Under Sec. 1.83-6(d), but for this section, the transfer of the X stock by X to B would be treated, at the time the stock vests, as a contribution of the X stock by X to the capital of Y, and immediately thereafter, a disposition of the X stock by Y to B. The basis of the X stock in the hands of Y, but for this section, would be determined with respect to X's basis in the X stock under section 362(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 6, no gain or loss is recognized on the deemed disposition of X stock by Y when the stock vests. Immediately before Y's deemed disposition of the X stock, Y is treated as purchasing X's stock from X for $100 of cash contributed to Y by X. Under section 358, X's basis in its Y stock is increased by $100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assume the same facts as in Example 6, except that Y (rather than X) retains a reversionary interest in the X stock in the event that B forfeits the right to the stock. Several years after X's transfer of the X shares, the stock vests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 7, this section does not apply to Y's deemed disposition of the X shares because Y is not deemed to have transferred the X stock to B immediately after receiving the stock from X. For the tax consequences to Y on the deemed disposition of the X stock, see Sec. 1.83-6(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X, a corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of Y corporation. In Year 1, X issues to Y's employee, B, a nonstatutory stock option to purchase 10 shares of X stock as compensation for services provided to Y. The option is exercisable against X and does not have a readily ascertainable fair market value (determined under Sec. 1.83-7(b)) at the time the option is granted. In Year 2, B exercises the option by paying X the strike price of $80 for the X stock, which then has a fair market value of $100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 8, because, under section 83(e)(3), section 83(a) does not apply to the grant of the option, paragraph (d) of this section also does not apply to the grant of the option. Section 83 and Sec. 1.1032-3 apply in Year 2 when the option is exercised; thus, no gain or loss is recognized on the deemed disposition of X stock by Y in Year 2. Immediately before Y's deemed disposition of the X stock in Year 2, Y is treated as purchasing the X stock from X for $100, $80 of which Y is deemed to have received from B and the remaining $20 of which is deemed to have been contributed to Y by X. Under section 358, X's basis in its Y stock is increased by $20.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, an individual, owns a majority of the stock of X. X owns stock of Y constituting control of Y within the meaning of section 368(c). A transfers 10 shares of its X stock to B, a key employee of Y. The fair market value of the 10 shares on the date of transfer was $100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 9, A is treated as making a nondeductible contribution of the 10 shares of X to the capital of X, and no gain or loss is recognized by A as a result of this transfer. See Commissioner v. Fink, 483 U.S. 89 (1987). A must allocate his basis in the transferred shares to his remaining shares of X stock. No gain or loss is recognized on the deemed disposition of the X stock by Y. Immediately before Y's disposition of the X stock, Y is treated as purchasing the X stock from X for $100 of cash contributed to Y by X. Under section 358, X's basis in its Y stock is increased by $100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In Year 1, X, a corporation, forms a trust which will be used to satisfy deferred compensation obligations owed by Y, X's wholly owned subsidiary, to Y's employees. X funds the trust with X stock, which would revert to X upon termination of the trust, subject to the employees' rights to be paid the deferred compensation due to them. The creditors of X can reach all the trust assets upon the insolvency of X. Similarly, Y's creditors can reach all the trust assets upon the insolvency of Y. In Year 5, the trust transfers X stock to the employees of Y in satisfaction of the deferred compensation obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 10, X is considered to be the grantor of the trust, and, under section 677, X is also the owner of the trust. Any income earned by the trust would be reflected on X's income tax return. Y is not considered a grantor or owner of the trust corpus at the time X transfers X stock to the trust. In Year 5, when employees of Y receive X stock in satisfaction of the deferred compensation obligation, no gain or loss is recognized on the deemed disposition of the X stock by Y.

Immediately before Y's deemed disposition of the X stock, Y is treated as purchasing the X stock from X for fair market value using cash contributed to Y by X. Under section 358, X's basis in its Y stock increases by the amount of cash deemed contributed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective date. This section applies to transfers of stock or stock options of the issuing corporation occurring on or after May 16, 2000.

Sec. 1.1033(a)-1  Involuntary conversions; nonrecognition of gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 1033 applies to cases where property is compulsorily or involuntarily converted. An involuntary conversion may be the result of the destruction of property in whole or in part, the theft of property, the seizure of property, the requisition or condemnation of property, or the threat or imminence of requisition or condemnation of property. An involuntary conversion may be a conversion into similar property or into money or into dissimilar property. Section 1033 provides that, under certain specified circumstances, any gain which is realized from an involuntary conversion shall not be recognized. In cases where property is converted into other property similar or related in service or use to the converted property, no gain shall be recognized regardless of when the disposition of the converted property occurred and regardless of whether or not the taxpayer elects to have the gain not recognized. In other types of involuntary conversion cases, however, the proceeds arising from the disposition of the converted property must (within the time limits specified) be reinvested in similar property in order to avoid recognition of any gain realized. Section 1033 applies only with respect to gains; losses from involuntary conversions are recognized or not recognized without regard to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Special rules. For rules relating to the application of section 1033 to involuntary conversions of a principal residence with respect to which an election has been made under section 121 (relating to gain from sale or exchange of residence of individual who has attained age 65), see paragraph (g) of Sec. 1.121-5. For rules applicable to involuntary conversions of a principal residence occurring before January 1, 1951, see Sec. 1.1033(a)-3. For rules applicable to involuntary conversions of a principal residence occurring after December 31, 1950, and before January 1, 1954, see paragraph (h)(1) of Sec. 1.1034-1. For rules applicable to involuntary conversions of a personal residence occurring after December 31, 1953, see Sec. 1.1033(a)-3. For special rules relating to the election to have section 1034 apply to certain involuntary conversions of a principal reisdence occurring after December 31, 1957, see paragraph (h)(2) of Sec. 1.1034-1. For special rules relating to certain involuntary conversions of real property held either for productive use in trade or business or for investment and occurring after December 31, 1957, see Sec. 1.1033(g)-1. See also special rules applicable to involuntary conversions of property sold pursuant to reclamation laws, livestock destroyed by disease, and livestock sold on account of drought provided in Sec. Sec. 1.1033(c)-1, 1.1033(d)-1, and 1.1033(e)-1, respectively. For rules relating to basis of property acquired through involuntary conversions, see Sec. 1.1033(b)-1. For determination of the period for which the taxpayer has held property acquired as a result of certain involuntary conversions, see section 1223 and regulations issued thereunder. For treatment of gains from involuntary conversions as capital gains in certain cases, see section 1231(a) and regulations issued thereunder. For portion of war loss recoveries treated as gain on involuntary conversion, see section 1332(b)(3) and regulations issued thereunder.

[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11910, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6856, 30 FR 13318, Oct. 20, 1965; T.D. 7625, 44 FR 31013, May 30, 1979; T.D. 7758, 46 FR 6925, Jan. 22, 1981]


Sec. 1.1033(a)-2  Involuntary conversion into similar property,into money or into dissimilar property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The term disposition of the converted property means the destruction, theft, seizure, requisition, or condemnation of the converted property, or the sale or exchange of such property under threat or imminence of requisition or condemnation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Conversion into similar property. If property (as a result of its destruction in whole or in part, theft, seizure, or requisition or condemnation or threat or imminence thereof) is compulsorily or involuntarily converted only into property similar or related in service or use to the property so converted, no gain shall be recognized. Such nonrecognition of gain is mandatory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Conversion into money or into dissimilar property. (1) If property (as a result of its destruction in whole or in part, theft, seizure, or requisition or condemnation or threat or imminence thereof) is compulsorily or involuntarily converted into money or into property not similar or related in service or use to the converted property, the gain, if any, shall be recognized, at the election of the taxpayer, only to the extent that the amount realized upon such conversion exceeds the cost of other property purchased by the taxpayer which is similar or related in service or use to the property so converted, or the cost of stock of a corporation owning such other property which is purchased by the taxpayer in the acquisition of control of such corporation, if the taxpayer purchased such other property, or such stock, for the purpose of replacing the property so converted and during the period specified in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. For the purposes of section 1033, the term control means the ownership of stock possessing at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of the corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If property (as a result of its destruction in whole or in part, theft, seizure, or requisition or condemnation or threat or imminence thereof) is compulsorily or involuntarily converted into money or into property not similar or related in service or use to the converted property, the gain, if any, shall be recognized, at the election of the taxpayer, only to the extent that the amount realized upon such conversion exceeds the cost of other property purchased by the taxpayer which is similar or related in service or use to the property so converted, or the cost of stock of a corporation owning such other property which is purchased by the taxpayer in the acquisition of control of such corporation, if the taxpayer purchased such other property, or such stock, for the purpose of replacing the property so converted and during the period specified in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. For the purposes of section 1033, the term control means the ownership of stock possessing at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of the corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All of the details in connection with an involuntary conversion of property at a gain (including those relating to the replacement of the converted property, or a decision not to replace, or the expiration of the period for replacement) shall be reported in the return for the taxable year or years in which any of such gain is realized. An election to have such gain recognized only to the extent provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be made by including such gain in gross income for such year or years only to such extent. If, at the time of filing such a return, the period within which the converted property must be replaced has expired, or if such an election is not desired, the gain should be included in gross income for such year or years in the regular manner. A failure to so include such gain in gross income in the regular manner shall be deemed to be an election by the taxpayer to have such gain recognized only to the extent provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph even though the details in connection with the conversion are not reported in such return. If, after having made an election under section 1033(a)(2), the converted property is not replaced within the required period of time, or replacement is made at a cost lower than was anticipated at the time of the election, or a decision is made not to replace, the tax liability for the year or years for which the election was made shall be recomputed. Such recomputation should be in the form of an amended return. If a decision is made to make an election under section 1033(a)(2) after the filing of the return and the payment of the tax for the year or years in which any of the gain on an involuntary conversion is realized and before the expiration of the period within which the converted property must be replaced, a claim for credit or refund for such year or years should be filed. If the replacement of the converted property occurs in a year or years in which none of the gain on the conversion is realized, all of the details in connection with such replacement shall be reported in the return for such year or years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The period referred to in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph is the period of time commencing with the date of the disposition of the converted property, or the date of the beginning of the threat or imminence of requisition or condemnation of the converted property, whichever is earlier, and ending 2 years (or, in the case of a disposition occurring before December 31, 1969, 1 year) after the close of the first taxable year in which any part of the gain upon the conversion is realized, or at the close of such later date as may be designated pursuant to an application of the taxpayer. Such application shall be made prior to the expiration of 2 years (or, in the case of

a disposition occurring before December 31, 1969, 1 year) after the close of the first taxable year in which any part of the gain from the conversion is realized, unless the taxpayer can show to the satisfaction of the district director--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reasonable cause for not having filed the application within the required period of time, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The filing of such application was made within a reasonable time after the expiration of the required period of time. The application shall contain all of the details in connection with the involuntary conversion. Such application shall be made to the district director for the internal revenue district in which the return is filed for the first taxable year in which any of the gain from the involuntary conversion is realized. No extension of time shall be granted pursuant to such application unless the taxpayer can show reasonable cause for not being able to replace the converted property within the required period of time.
See section 1033(g)(4) and Sec. 1.1033(g)-1 for the circumstances under which, in the case of the conversion of real property held either for productive use in trade or business or for investment, the 2-year period referred to in this paragraph (c)(3) shall be extended to 3 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Property or stock purchased before the disposition of the converted property shall be considered to have been purchased for the purpose of replacing the converted property only if such property or stock is held by the taxpayer on the date of the disposition of the converted property. Property or stock shall be considered to have been purchased only if, but for the provisions of section 1033(b), the unadjusted basis of such property or stock would be its cost to the taxpayer within the meaning of section 1012. If the taxpayers unadjusted basis of the replacement property would be determined, in the absence of section 1033(b), under any of the exceptions referred to in section 1012, the unadjusted basis of the property would not be its cost within the meaning of section 1012. For example, if property similar or related in service or use to the converted property is acquired by gift and its basis is determined under section 1015, such property will not qualify as a replacement for the converted property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If a taxpayer makes an election under section 1033(a)(2), any deficiency, for any taxable year in which any part of the gain upon the conversion is realized, which is attributable to such gain may be assessed at any time before the expiration of three years from the date the district director with whom the return for such year has been filed is notified by the taxpayer of the replacement of the converted property or of an intention not to replace, or of a failure to replace, within the required period, notwithstanding the provisions of section 6212(c) or the provisions of any other law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment. If replacement has been made, such notification shall contain all of the details in connection with such replacement. Such notification should be made in the return for the taxable year or years in which the replacement occurs, or the intention not to replace is formed, or the period for replacement expires, if this return is filed with such district director. If this return is not filed with such district director, then such notification shall be made to such district director at the time of filing this return. If the taxpayer so desires, he may, in either event, also notify such district director before the filing of such return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If a taxpayer makes an election under section 1033(a)(2) and the replacement property or stock was purchased before the beginning of the last taxable year in which any part of the gain upon the conversion is realized, any deficiency, for any taxable year ending before such last taxable year, which is attributable to such election may be assessed at any time before the expiration of the period within which a deficiency for such last taxable year may be assessed, notwithstanding the provisions of section 6212(c) or 6501 or the provisions of any law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> If the taxpayer makes an election under section 1033(a)(2), the gain upon the conversion shall be recognized to the extent that the amount realized upon such conversion exceeds the cost

If, in a condemnation proceeding, the Government makes an award to a mortgagee to satisfy a mortgage on the condemned property, the amount of such award shall be considered as a part of the amount realized upon the conversion regardless of whether or not the taxpayer was personally liable for the mortgage debt. Thus, if a taxpayer has acquired property worth $100,000 subject to a $50,000 mortgage (regardless of whether or not he was personally liable for the mortgage debt) and, in a condemnation proceeding, the Government awards the taxpayer $60,000 and awards the mortgagee $50,000 in satisfaction of the mortgage, the entire $110,000 is considered to be the amount realized by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> An amount expended for replacement of an asset, in excess of the recovery for loss, represents a capital expenditure and is not a deductible loss for income tax purposes.

If A invests $150,000 in a new vessel, taxable gain to the extent of $50,000 would be recognized. The basis of the new vessel is $100,000; that is, the adjusted basis of the old vessel ($100,000) minus the money received by the taxpayer which was not expended in the acquisition of the new vessel ($50,000) plus the amount of gain recognized upon the conversion ($50,000).

The basis of the new barn to the taxpayer would be $10,000--the cost of the new barn ($20,000) less the amount of the gain not recognized on the conversion ($10,000). The basis of the new barn would not be a substituted basis in the hands of the taxpayer within the meaning of section 1016(b)(2). If the replacement of the converted barn had been made by the purchase of two smaller barns which, together, were similar or related in service or use to the converted barn and which cost $8,000 and $12,000, respectively, then the basis of the two barns would be $4,000 and $6,000, respectively, the total basis of the purchased property ($10,000) allocated in proportion to their respective costs (8,000/ 20,000 of $10,000 or $4,000; and 12,000/20,000 of $10,000, or $6,000).

For example, if in the past it has been a taxpayer's practice to sell or exchange annually one-half of his herd of dairy cows, only the number sold or exchanged solely on account of drought conditions which is in excess of one-half of his herd, may qualify as an involuntary conversion under section 1033(e) and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The replacement requirements of section 1033 will be satisfied only if the livestock sold or exchanged is replaced within the prescribed period with livestock which is similar or related in service or use to the livestock sold or exchanged because of drought, that is, the new livestock must be functionally the same as the livestock involuntarily converted.

In such cases, for purposes of applying section 1033, the replacement of such property with property of like kind to be held either for productive use in trade or business or for investment shall be treated as property similar or related in service or use to the property so converted.

The Commissioner may require such other information as may be necessary in order to determine whether the requested revocation will be permitted.

The term includes highway billboards affixed to the ground with wood or metal poles, pipes, or beams, with or without concrete footings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Character of replacement property. For purposes of section 1033(g), an interest in real property purchased as replacement property for a compulsorily or involuntarily converted outdoor advertising display (with respect to which an election under this section is in effect) shall be considered property of a like kind as the property converted even though a taxpayer's interest in the replacement property is different from the interest held in the property converted. Thus, for example, a fee simple interest in real estate acquired to replace a converted billboard and a 5-year leasehold interest in the real property on which the billboard was located qualifies as property of a like kind under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special rule for period within which property must be replaced. In the case of a disposition described in paragraph (a) of this section, section 1033(a)(2)(B) and Sec. 1.1033(a)-2(c)(3) (relating to the period within which the property must be replaced) shall be applied by substituting 3 years for 2 years. This paragraph shall apply to any disposition described in section 1033(f)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section occurring after December

31, 1974, unless a condemnation proceeding with respect to the property was begun before October 4, 1976. Thus, regardless of when the property is disposed of, the taxpayer will not be eligible for the 3-year replacement period if a condemnation proceeding was begun before October 4, 1976. However, if the property is disposed of after December 31, 1974, and the condemnation proceeding was begun (if at all) after October 4, 1976, then the taxpayer is eligible for the 3-year replacement period. For the purposes of this paragraph, whether a condemnation proceeding is considered as having begun is determined under the applicable State or Federal procedural law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Limitation on application of special rule. This section shall not apply to the purchase of stock in the acquisition of control of a corporation described in section 1033(a)(2)(A).
