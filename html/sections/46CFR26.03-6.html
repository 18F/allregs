Each special permit is valid for only one voyage of a donated vessel, which is used for a charitable purpose. Applications are considered and approved on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The criteria of Sec. 176.204 of this chapter will apply to the issuance of a special permit. In addition, the owner, operator, or agent must meet each of these conditions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any charity using a donated vessel must be a bona fide charity or a non-profit organization qualified under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All donations received from the fundraising must go to the named charity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner, operator, or agent may obtain a special permit for an individual vessel not more than four times in a 12-month period; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The owner, operator, or agent must apply to the local OCMI for a special permit prior to the intended voyage, allowing adequate time for processing and approval of the permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nothing in this part may be construed as limiting the OCMI from making such tests and inspections, both afloat and in dry-dock, that are reasonable and practicable to be assured of the vessel's seaworthiness and safety.
