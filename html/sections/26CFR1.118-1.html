                                Sec. 1.118-1  Contributions to the capital of a corporation.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In the case of a corporation, section 118 provides an exclusion from  gross income with respect to any contribution of money or property to  the capital of the taxpayer. Thus, if a corporation requires additional  funds for conducting its business and obtains such funds through  voluntary pro rata payments by its shareholders, the amounts so received  being credited to its surplus account or to a special account, such  amounts do not constitute income, although there is no increase in the  outstanding shares of stock of the corporation. In such a case the  payments are in the nature of assessments upon, and represent an  additional price paid for, the shares of stock held by the individual  shareholders, and will be treated as an addition to and as a part of the  operating capital of the company. Section 118 also applies to  contributions to capital made by persons other than shareholders. For  example, the exclusion applies to the value of land or other property  contributed to a corporation by a governmental unit or by a civic group  for the purpose of inducing the corporation to locate its business in a  particular community, or for the purpose of enabling the corporation to  expand its operating facilities. However, the exclusion does not apply  to any money or property transferred to the corporation in consideration  for goods or services rendered, or to subsidies paid for the purpose of  inducing the taxpayer to limit production. See section 362 for the basis  of property acquired by a corporation through a contribution to its  capital by its stockholders or by nonstockholders.</p>
