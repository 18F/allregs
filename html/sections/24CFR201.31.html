                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Insurance charge. For each eligible property improvement loan and manufactured home loan reported and acknowledged for insurance, the lender shall pay to the Secretary an insurance charge equal to 1.00 percent of the loan amount, multiplied by the number of years of the loan term. The insurance charge shall be paid in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section; however, no charge shall be made for a period of 14 days or less, and a charge for a full month shall be made for a period of more than 14 days. There shall be no abatement or refund of an insurance charge except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payment of insurance charge. (1) For any loan having a maturity of 25 months or less, payment of the entire insurance charge prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section is due on the 25th calendar day after the date the Secretary acknowledges the loan report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For any loan having a maturity of 25 months or less, payment of the entire insurance charge prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section is due on the 25th calendar day after the date the Secretary acknowledges the loan report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> For any loan having a maturity in excess of 25 months, payment of the insurance charge shall be made in annual installments, with the first installment due on the 25th calendar day after the date the Secretary acknowledges the loan report, and the second and successive installments due on the 25th calendar day after the date of billing by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For any loan having a maturity in excess of 25 months, payment of the insurance charge shall be made in annual installments, with the first installment due on the 25th calendar day after the date the Secretary acknowledges the loan report, and the second and successive installments due on the 25th calendar day after the date of billing by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For any loan having a maturity in excess of 25 months, payment shall be made in annual installments of 1.00 percent of the loan amount until the insurance charge is paid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All insurance charges are considered earned when paid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Secretary may require that loan insurance charges be remitted electronically. Instructions implementing this requirement shall be communicated to all affected lenders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Penalty charge and interest. Insurance charges not received from the lender by the due date specified in

paragraph (b) of this section shall be assessed a penalty charge of four percent of the amount of the payment. Insurance charges received from the lender more than 30 days after the due date specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall also be assessed daily interest at the current United States Treasury value of funds rate, as published periodically in the Federal Register. However, no penalty charge or daily interest shall be assessed if the Secretary fails to acknowledge receipt of the loan report or fails to issue a proper billing to the lender for the insurance charges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Adjustment on notes transferred. Where there is a transfer of loan obligations between lenders and the insurance charges on such obligations have already been paid, any adjustment of such charges shall be made by the lenders involved. Any unpaid installments of the insurance charge shall be paid by the purchasing lender.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Refund or abatement of insurance charges. A lender shall be entitled to a refund or abatement of insurance charges only in the following instances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where the loan obligation has been refinanced, the unearned portion of the charge on the original obligation shall be credited to the charge on the refinanced loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where the loan obligation is prepaid in full or an insurance claim is filed, charges falling due after such prepayment or claim shall be abated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a loan (or portion thereof) is found to be ineligible for insurance, charges paid on the ineligible portion shall be refunded, except where the Secretary determines that there was fraud or misrepresentation by the lender in the loan transaction. Such refund shall be made only if a claim is denied by the Secretary or the ineligibility is reported by the lender promptly upon discovery and confirmed by the Secretary. In no event shall a charge be refunded on the basis of loan ineligibility where the application for refund is made after the loan is paid in full. If a loan or claim has been denied and is subsequently resubmitted, the refunded amount of the insurance charge plus any accrued insurance charge shall be repaid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Lender passing insurance charge on to borrower. The insurance charge may be passed on to the borrower, provided that such charge is fully disclosed to the borrower.
