The full text of a cross-referenced rule is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section of the California Federal program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This part applies to all coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations in California conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. To the extent required by 30 CFR part 740, this part also applies to operations on Federal lands in California.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The information collection requirements contained in this part have already been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 in its approval of the information collection requirements contained in the permanent regulatory program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The following provisions of California law generally provide for more stringent land use and environmental control and regulation of some aspects of surface coal mining operations than do the provisions of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, and the regulations in this chapter. Therefore, pursuant to section 505(b) of SMCRA, these provisions shall not generally be considered to be inconsistent with SMCRA unless, in a particular instance, the Federal program regulations establish more stringent environmental or land use controls:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The California Environmental Quality Act, Cal.

Other California laws may in an individual situation interfere with the purposes and achievements of SMCRA and may be preempted and superseded with respect to the performance standards of Sec. Sec. 905.815 through 905.828 as they affect a particular coal exploration or surface mining operation by publication of a notice to that effect in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975, Cal.
