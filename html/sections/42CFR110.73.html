The Secretary will make payments in accordance with Sec.  110.83. Once  all benefits have been paid, the Request Package can no longer be  amended (except for survivor benefits). The payment determination will  constitute final agency action with regard to the particular  countermeasure injury that is the subject of the Request for Benefits  and payment (i.e., the Request for Benefits is closed with regard to the  injury that is the basis of the payment of benefits).</p>
