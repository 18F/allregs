                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Written procedures. The Owner shall adopt written tenant selection procedures that ensure nondiscrimination in the selection of tenants and that are consistent with the purpose of improving housing opportunities for very low-income elderly or handicapped persons; and reasonably related to program eligibility and an applicant's ability to perform the obligations of the lease. Owners shall promptly notify in writing any rejected applicant of the grounds for any rejection. Additionally, owners shall maintain a written, chronological waiting list showing the name, race, gender, ethnicity and date of each person applying for the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application for admission. The Borrower must accept applications for admission to the project in the form prescribed by HUD and is obligated to confirm all information provided by the applicant families on the application. Applicant families must be requested to complete a release of information consent for verification of information. Applicants applying for assisted units must complete a certification of eligibility as part of the application for admission. Applicant families must meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, and sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B. Both the Borrower and the applicant must complete and sign the application for admission. On request, the Borrower must furnish copies of all applications for admission to HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination of eligibility and selection of tenants. The Borrower is responsible for determining whether applicants are eligible for admission and for selection of families. To be eligible for admission, an applicant must be an elderly or handicapped family as defined in Sec. 891.505; meet any project occupancy requirements approved by HUD; meet the disclosure and verification requirement for Social Security Numbers and sign and submit consent forms for obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B; and, if applying for an assisted unit, be eligible for admission under subpart F of 24 CFR part 5, which governs selection of tenants and occupancy requirements. For cases involving, or allegedly involving, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, or criminal activity directly relating to such violence, the provisions of 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unit assignment. If the Borrower determines that the family is eligible and is otherwise acceptable and units are available, the Borrower will assign the family a unit. The Borrower will assign the family a unit of the appropriate size in accordance with HUD's general occupancy guidelines. If no suitable unit is available, the Borrower will place the family on a waiting list for the project and notify the family of when a suitable unit may become available. If the waiting list is so long that the applicant would not be likely to be admitted within the next 12 months, the Borrower may advise the applicant that no additional applications for admission are being considered for that reason, except that the Borrower may not refuse to place an applicant on the waiting list if the applicant is otherwise eligible for assistance and claims that he or she qualifies for a Federal preference as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart D.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Ineligibility determination. If the Borrower determines that an applicant is ineligible for admission or the Borrower is not selecting the applicant for other reasons, the Borrower will promptly notify the applicant in writing of the determination, the reasons for the determination, and that the applicant has a right to request a meeting with the Borrower or managing agent to review the rejection, in accordance with HUD requirements. The review, if requested, may not be conducted by a member of the Borrower's staff who made the initial decision to reject the applicant. The applicant may also exercise other rights (e.g., rights granted under Federal, State, or local civil rights laws) if the applicant believes he or she is being discriminated against on a prohibited basis. The informal review provisions for the

denial of a Federal preference are provided in Sec. 5.410(g) of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Records. Records on applicants and approved eligible families, which provide racial, ethnic, gender, handicap status, and place of previous residency data required by HUD, must be retained for three years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reexamination of family income and composition--(1) Regular reexaminations. The Borrower must reexamine the income and composition of the family at least every 12 months. Upon verification of the information, the Borrower shall make appropriate adjustments in the total tenant payment in accordance with part 813 of this chapter and determine whether the family's unit size is still appropriate. The Borrower must adjust tenant rent and the housing assistance payment and must carry out any unit transfer in accordance with the administrative instructions issued by HUD. At the time of reexamination under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the Borrower must require the family to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Regular reexaminations. The Borrower must reexamine the income and composition of the family at least every 12 months. Upon verification of the information, the Borrower shall make appropriate adjustments in the total tenant payment in accordance with part 813 of this chapter and determine whether the family's unit size is still appropriate. The Borrower must adjust tenant rent and the housing assistance payment and must carry out any unit transfer in accordance with the administrative instructions issued by HUD. At the time of reexamination under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the Borrower must require the family to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interim reexaminations. The family must comply with the provisions in its lease regarding interim reporting of changes in income. If the Borrower receives information concerning a change in the family's income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexaminations, the Borrower must consult with the family and make any adjustments determined to be appropriate. Any change in the family's income or other circumstances that results in an adjustment in the total tenant payment, tenant rent and housing assistance payment must be verified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Continuation of housing assistance payments. (i) A family shall remain eligible for housing assistance payments until the total tenant payment equals or exceeds the gross rent. The termination of subsidy eligibility will not affect the family's other rights under its lease. Housing assistance payments may be resumed if, as a result of changes in income, rent or other relevant circumstances during the term of the HAP contract, the family meets the income eligibility requirements of part 813 of this chapter and housing assistance is available for the unit under the terms of the HAP contract. The family will not be required to establish its eligibility for admission to the project under the remaining requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A family shall remain eligible for housing assistance payments until the total tenant payment equals or exceeds the gross rent.
