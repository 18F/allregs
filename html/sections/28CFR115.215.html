Facilities shall not restrict female residents' access to regularly available programming or other outside opportunities in order to comply with this provision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The facility shall document all cross-gender strip searches and cross-gender visual body cavity searches, and shall document all cross-gender pat-down searches of female residents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The facility shall implement policies and procedures that enable residents to shower, perform bodily functions, and change clothing without nonmedical staff of the opposite gender viewing their breasts, buttocks, or genitalia, except in exigent circumstances or when such viewing is incidental to routine cell checks. Such policies and procedures shall require staff of the opposite gender to announce their presence when entering an area where residents are likely to be showering, performing bodily functions, or changing clothing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The facility shall not search or physically examine a transgender or intersex resident for the sole purpose of determining the resident's genital status.
