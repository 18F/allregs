                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General policy. The Department strongly encourages the  disclosure of information to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls  by persons (see Sec. 120.14 of this subchapter) that believe they may  have violated any export control provision of the Arms Export Control  Act, or any regulation, order, license, or other authorization issued  under the authority of the Arms Export Control Act. The Department may  consider a voluntary disclosure as a mitigating factor in determining  the administrative penalties, if any, that should be imposed. Failure to  report a violation may result in circumstances detrimental to U.S.  national security and foreign policy interests, and will be an adverse  factor in determining the appropriate disposition of such violations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limitations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provisions of this section apply only when  information is provided to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls for  its review in determining whether to take administrative action under  part 128 of this subchapter concerning a violation of the export control  provisions of the Arms Export Control Act and these regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The provisions of this section apply only when information is  received by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls for review prior  to such time that either the Department of State or any other agency,  bureau, or department of the United States Government obtains knowledge  of either the same or substantially similar information from another  source and commences an investigation or inquiry that involves that  information, and that is intended to determine whether the Arms Export  Control Act or these regulations, or any other license, order, or other  authorization issued under the Arms Export Control Act has been  violated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The violation(s) in question, despite the voluntary nature of  the disclosure, may merit penalties, administrative actions, sanctions,  or referrals to the Department of Justice to consider criminal  prosecution. In the latter case, the Directorate of Defense Trade  Controls will notify the Department of Justice of the voluntary nature  of the disclosure, although the Department of Justice is not required to  give that fact any weight. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls has  the sole discretion to consider whether ``voluntary disclosure,'' in  context with other relevant information in a particular case, should be  a mitigating factor in determining what, if any, administrative action  will be imposed. Some of the mitigating factors the Directorate of  Defense Trade Controls may consider are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the transaction would have been authorized, and under  what conditions, had a proper license request been made;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Why the violation occurred;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The degree of cooperation with the ensuing investigation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the person has instituted or improved an internal  compliance program to reduce the likelihood of future violation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Whether the person making the disclosure did so with the full  knowledge and authorization of the person's senior management. (If not,  then the Directorate will not deem the disclosure voluntary as covered  in this section.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The provisions of this section do not, nor should they be relied  on to, create, confer, or grant any rights, benefits, privileges, or  protection enforceable at law or in equity by any person in any civil,  criminal, administrative, or other matter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> of this subchapter upon persons to inform the Directorate  of Defense Trade Controls of the actual or final sale, export, transfer,  reexport, or retransfer of a defense article, technical data, or defense  service to any country referred to in Sec. 126.1 of this subchapter,  any citizen of such country, or any person acting on its behalf.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notification. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any person wanting to disclose information  that constitutes a voluntary disclosure should, in the manner outlined  below, initially notify the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls  immediately after a violation is discovered and then conduct a thorough  review of all defense trade transactions where a violation is suspected.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the notification does not contain all the information  required by 127.12(c)(2) of this section, a full disclosure must be  submitted within 60 calendar days of the notification, or the  Directorate of Defense Trade Controls will not deem the notification to  qualify as a voluntary disclosure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the person is unable to provide a full disclosure within the  60 calendar day deadline, an empowered official (see Sec. 120.25 of  this subchapter) or a senior officer may request an extension of time in  writing. A request for an extension must specify what information  required by Sec. 127.12(c)(2) of this section could not be immediately  provided and the reasons why.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Before approving an extension of time to provide the full  disclosure, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may require the  requester to certify in writing that they will provide the full  disclosure within a specific time period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Failure to provide a full disclosure within a reasonable time  may result in a decision by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls  not to consider the notification as a mitigating factor in determining  the appropriate disposition of the violation. In addition, the  Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may direct the requester to  furnish all relevant information surrounding the violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notification of a violation must be in writing and should  include the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A precise description of the nature and extent of the violation  (e.g., an unauthorized shipment, doing business with a party denied U.S.  export privileges, etc.);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The exact circumstances surrounding the violation (a thorough  explanation of why, when, where, and how the violation occurred);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The complete identities and addresses of all persons known or  suspected to be involved in the activities giving rise to the violation  (including mailing, shipping, and e-mail addresses; telephone and fax/ facsimile numbers; and any other known identifying information);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Department of State license numbers, exemption citation, or  description of any other authorization, if applicable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> U.S. Munitions List category and subcategory, product  description, quantity, and characteristics or technological capability  of the hardware, technical data or defense service involved;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A description of corrective actions already undertaken that  clearly identifies the new compliance initiatives implemented to address  the causes of the violations set forth in the voluntary disclosure and  any internal disciplinary action taken; and how these corrective actions  are designed to deter those particular violations from occurring again;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The name and address of the person making the disclosure and a  point of contact, if different, should further information be needed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Factors to be addressed in the voluntary disclosure include, for  example,   whether the violation was intentional or inadvertent; the degree to  which the person responsible for the violation was familiar with the  laws and regulations, and whether the person was the subject of prior  administrative or criminal action under the AECA; whether the violations  are systemic; and the details of compliance measures, processes and  programs, including training, that were in place to prevent such  violations, if any. In addition to immediately providing written  notification, persons are strongly urged to conduct a thorough review of  all export-related transactions where a possible violation is suspected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Documentation. The written disclosure should be accompanied by  copies of substantiating documents. Where appropriate, the documentation  should include, but not be limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Licensing documents (e.g., license applications, export  licenses, and end-user statements), exemption citation, or other  authorization description, if any;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shipping documents (e.g., Electronic Export Information filing,  including the Internal Transaction Number, air waybills, and bills of  laden, invoices, and any other associated documents); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any other relevant documents must be retained by the person  making the disclosure until the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls  requests them or until a final decision on the disclosed information has  been made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Certification. A certification must be submitted stating that  all of the representations made in connection with the voluntary  disclosure are true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge  and belief. Certifications should be executed by an empowered official  (See Sec. 120.25 of this subchapter), or by a senior officer (e.g.  chief executive officer, president, vice-president, comptroller,  treasurer, general counsel, or member of the board of directors). If the  violation is a major violation, reveals a systemic pattern of  violations, or reflects the absence of an effective compliance program,  the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may require that such  certification be made by a senior officer of the company.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Oral presentations. Oral presentation is generally not necessary  to augment the written presentation. However, if the person making the  disclosure believes a meeting is desirable, a request should be included  with the written presentation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Send voluntary disclosures to the Office of Defense Trade  Controls Compliance, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. Consult the  Directorate of Defense Trade Controls Web site at http:// www.pmddtc.state.gov for the appropriate street address.
