The disclosures required by Secs. 226.5a, 226.5b, and 226.16 may be  provided to the consumer in electronic form without regard to the  consumer consent or other provisions of the E-Sign Act in the  circumstances set forth in those sections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Terminology. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Terminology used in providing the disclosures  required by this subpart shall be consistent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For home-equity plans subject to Sec. 226.5b, the terms finance  charge and annual percentage rate, when required to be disclosed with a  corresponding amount or percentage rate, shall be more conspicuous than  any other required disclosure.\9\ The terms need not be more conspicuous  when used for periodic statement disclosures under Sec. 226.7(a)(4) and  for advertisements under Sec. 226.16. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\9\ [Reserved] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this section, the term fixed, or a similar term, may not  be used to describe such rate unless the creditor also specifies a time  period that the rate will be fixed and the rate will not increase during  that period, or if no such time period is provided, the rate will not  increase while the plan is open.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specific formats. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Certain disclosures for credit and charge  card applications and solicitations must be provided in a tabular format  in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 226.5a(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain disclosures for home-equity plans must precede other  disclosures and must be given in accordance with the requirements of  Sec. 226.5b(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Certain account-opening disclosures must be provided in a  tabular format in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 226.6(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Certain disclosures provided on periodic statements must be  grouped together in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 226.7(b)(6)  and (b)(13).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Certain disclosures provided on periodic statements must be  given in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 226.7(b)(12).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Certain disclosures accompanying checks that access a credit  card account must be provided in a tabular format in accordance with the  requirements of Sec. 226.9(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Certain disclosures provided in a change-in-terms notice must  be provided in a tabular format in accordance with the requirements of  Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv)(D).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Certain disclosures provided when a rate is increased due to  delinquency, default or as a penalty must be provided in a tabular  format in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 226.9(g)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Time of disclosures--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Account-opening disclosures--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  General rule. The creditor shall furnish account-opening disclosures  required by Sec. 226.6 before the first transaction is made under the  plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Charges imposed as part of an open-end (not home-secured) plan.  Charges that are imposed as part of an open-end (not home-secured) plan  and are not required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(b)(2) may be  disclosed after account opening but before the consumer agrees to pay or  becomes obligated to pay for the charge, provided they are disclosed at  a time and in a manner that a consumer would be likely to notice them.  This provision does not apply to charges imposed as part of a home- equity plan subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Telephone purchases. Disclosures required by Sec. 226.6 may be  provided as soon as reasonably practicable after the first transaction  if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The first transaction occurs when a consumer contacts a merchant  by telephone to purchase goods and at the same time the consumer accepts  an offer to finance the purchase by establishing an open-end plan with  the merchant or third-party creditor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The merchant or third-party creditor permits consumers to return  any goods financed under the plan and provides consumers with a  sufficient time to reject the plan and return the goods free of cost  after the merchant or third-party creditor has provided the written  disclosures required by Sec. 226.6; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The consumer's right to reject the plan and return the goods is  disclosed to the consumer as a part of the offer to finance the  purchase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Membership fees--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General. In general, a creditor may not  collect any fee before account-opening disclosures are provided. A  creditor may collect, or obtain the consumer's agreement to pay,  membership fees, including application fees excludable from the finance  charge under Sec. 226.4(c)(1), before providing account-opening  disclosures if, after receiving the disclosures, the consumer may reject  the plan and have no obligation to pay these fees (including application  fees) or any other fee or charge. A membership fee for purposes of this  paragraph has the same meaning as a fee for the issuance or availability  of credit described in Sec. 226.5a(b)(2). If the consumer rejects the  plan, the creditor must promptly refund the membership fee if it has  been paid, or take other action necessary to ensure the consumer is not  obligated to pay that fee or any other fee or charge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Home-equity plans. Creditors offering home-equity plans subject  to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b are not subject to the requirements  of paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Application fees. A creditor may collect an application fee  excludable from the finance charge under Sec. 226.4(c)(1) before  providing account-opening disclosures. However, if a consumer rejects  the plan after receiving account-opening disclosures, the consumer must  have no obligation to pay such an application fee, or if the fee was  paid, it must be refunded. See Sec. 226.5(b)(1)(iv)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Periodic statements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Statement required. The creditor shall  mail or deliver a periodic statement as required by Sec. 226.7 for each  billing cycle at the end of which an account has a debit or credit  balance of more than $1 or on   which a finance charge has been imposed. A periodic statement need not  be sent for an account if the creditor deems it uncollectible, if  delinquency collection proceedings have been instituted, if the creditor  has charged off the account in accordance with loan-loss provisions and  will not charge any additional fees or interest on the account, or if  furnishing the statement would violate federal law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured)  consumer credit plan. For credit card accounts under an open-end (not  home-secured) consumer credit plan, a card issuer must adopt reasonable  procedures designed to ensure that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Periodic statements are mailed or delivered at least 21 days  prior to the payment due date disclosed on the statement pursuant to  Sec. 226.7(b)(11)(i)(A); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The card issuer does not treat as late for any purpose a  required minimum periodic payment received by the card issuer within 21  days after mailing or delivery of the periodic statement disclosing the  due date for that payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Open-end consumer credit plans. For accounts under an open-end  consumer credit plan, a creditor must adopt reasonable procedures  designed to ensure that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a grace period applies to the account:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Periodic statements are mailed or delivered at least 21 days  prior to the date on which the grace period expires; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The creditor does not impose finance charges as a result of the  loss of the grace period if a payment that satisfies the terms of the  grace period is received by the creditor within 21 days after mailing or  delivery of the periodic statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Regardless of whether a grace period applies to the account:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Periodic statements are mailed or delivered at least 14 days  prior to the date on which the required minimum periodic payment must be  received in order to avoid being treated as late for any purpose; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The creditor does not treat as late for any purpose a required  minimum periodic payment received by the creditor within 14 days after  mailing or delivery of the periodic statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, ``grace  period'' means a period within which any credit extended may be repaid  without incurring a finance charge due to a periodic interest rate.\10\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\10\ [Reserved] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Credit and charge card application and solicitation disclosures.  The card issuer shall furnish the disclosures for credit and charge card  applications and solicitations in accordance with the timing  requirements of Sec. 226.5a.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Home-equity plans. Disclosures for home-equity plans shall be  made in accordance with the timing requirements of Sec. 226.5b(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Basis of disclosures and use of estimates. Disclosures shall  reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the parties. If any  information necessary for accurate disclosure is unknown to the  creditor, it shall make the disclosure based on the best information  reasonably available and shall state clearly that the disclosure is an  estimate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Multiple creditors; multiple consumers. If the credit plan  involves more than one creditor, only one set of disclosures shall be  given, and the creditors shall agree among themselves which creditor  must comply with the requirements that this regulation imposes on any or  all of them. If there is more than one consumer, the disclosures may be  made to any consumer who is primarily liable on the account. If the  right of rescission under Sec. 226.15 is applicable, however, the  disclosures required by Secs. 226.6 and 226.15(b) shall be made to each  consumer having the right to rescind.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effect of subsequent events. If a disclosure becomes inaccurate  because of an event that occurs after the creditor mails or delivers the  disclosures, the resulting inaccuracy is not a violation of this  regulation, although new disclosures may be required under  Sec. 226.9(c).  [75 FR 7796, Feb. 22, 2010, as amended at 76 FR 22998, Apr. 25, 2011]     Sec. 226.5a  Credit and charge card applications and solicitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rules. The card issuer shall provide the disclosures  required under this section on or with a solicitation or an application  to open a credit or charge card account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definition of solicitation. For purposes of this section, the  term solicitation means an offer by the card issuer to open a credit or  charge card account that does not require the consumer to complete an  application. A ``firm offer of credit'' as defined in section 603(l) of  the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a(l)) for a credit or  charge card is a solicitation for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Form of disclosures; tabular format. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The disclosures in  paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) (except for (b)(1)(iv)(B)) and (b)(7)  through (15) of this section made pursuant to paragraph (c), (d)(2),  (e)(1) or (f) of this section generally shall be in the form of a table  with headings, content, and format substantially similar to any of the  applicable tables found in G-10 in appendix G to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The table described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section  shall contain only the information required or permitted by this  section. Other information may be presented on or with an application or  solicitation, provided such information appears outside the required  table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Disclosures required by paragraphs (b)(1)(iv)(B),  (b)(1)(iv)(C) and (b)(6) of this section must be placed directly beneath  the table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> When a tabular format is required, any annual percentage rate  required to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section,  any introductory rate required to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph  (b)(1)(ii) of this section, any rate that will apply after a premium  initial rate expires required to be disclosed under paragraph  (b)(1)(iii) of this section, and any fee or percentage amounts or  maximum limits on fee amounts disclosed pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2),  (b)(4), (b)(8) through (b)(13) of this section must be disclosed in bold  text. However, bold text shall not be used for: The amount of any  periodic fee disclosed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section that  is not an annualized amount; and other annual percentage rates or fee  amounts disclosed in the table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For an application or a solicitation that is accessed by the  consumer in electronic form, the disclosures required under this section  may be provided to the consumer in electronic form on or with the  application or solicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(vi)(B) of this  section, the table described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section must  be provided in a prominent location on or with an application or a  solicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the table described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is  provided electronically, it must be provided in close proximity to the  application or solicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fees based on a percentage. If the amount of any fee required to  be disclosed under this section is determined on the basis of a  percentage of another amount, the percentage used and the identification  of the amount against which the percentage is applied may be disclosed  instead of the amount of the fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fees that vary by state. Card issuers that impose fees referred  to in paragraphs (b)(8) through (12) of this section that vary by state  may, at the issuer's option, disclose in the table required by paragraph  (a)(2)(i) of this section: the specific fee applicable to the consumer's  account; or the range of the fees, if the disclosure includes a  statement that the amount of the fee varies by state and refers the  consumer to a disclosure provided with the table where the amount of the  fee applicable to the consumer's account is disclosed. A card issuer may  not list fees for multiple states in the table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Exceptions. This section does not apply to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Home-equity plans accessible by a credit or charge card that are  subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Overdraft lines of credit tied to asset accounts accessed by  check-guarantee cards or by debit cards;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Lines of credit accessed by check-guarantee cards or by debit  cards that can be used only at automated teller machines;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Lines of credit accessed solely by account numbers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Additions of a credit or charge card to an existing open-end  plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> General purpose applications unless the application, or  material accompanying it, indicates that it can be used to open a credit  or charge card account; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Consumer-initiated requests for applications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(2)</em>, (4), (7) through (12), and (15) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Annual percentage rate. Each periodic rate that may be used to  compute the finance charge on an outstanding balance for purchases, a  cash advance, or a balance transfer, expressed as an annual percentage  rate (as determined by Sec. 226.14(b)). When more than one rate applies  for a category of transactions, the range of balances to which each rate  is applicable shall also be disclosed. The annual percentage rate for  purchases disclosed pursuant to this paragraph shall be in at least 16- point type, except for the following: Oral disclosures of the annual  percentage rate for purchases; or a penalty rate that may apply upon the  occurrence of one or more specific events.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Variable rate information. If a rate disclosed under paragraph  (b)(1) of this section is a variable rate, the card issuer shall also  disclose the fact that the rate may vary and how the rate is determined.  In describing how the applicable rate will be determined, the card  issuer must identify the type of index or formula that is used in  setting the rate. The value of the index and the amount of the margin  that are used to calculate the variable rate shall not be disclosed in  the table. A disclosure of any applicable limitations on rate increases  shall not be included in the table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, the card issuer  must disclose in the table the introductory rate, the time period during  which the introductory rate will remain in effect, and must use the term  ``introductory'' or ``intro'' in immediate proximity to the introductory  rate. The card issuer also must disclose the rate that would otherwise  apply to the account pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Where  the rate is not tied to an index or formula, the card issuer must  disclose the rate that will apply after the introductory rate expires.  In a variable-rate account, the card issuer must disclose a rate based  on the applicable index or formula in accordance with the accuracy  requirements set forth in paragraphs (c)(2), (d)(3), or (e)(4) of this  section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Premium initial rate. If the initial rate is temporary and is  higher than the rate that will apply after the temporary rate expires,  the card issuer must disclose the premium initial rate pursuant to  paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the time period during which the  premium initial rate will remain in effect. Consistent with paragraph  (b)(1) of this section, the premium initial rate for purchases must be  in at least 16-point type. The issuer must also disclose in the table  the rate that will apply after the premium initial rate expires, in at  least 16-point type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Penalty rates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph  (b)(1)(iv)(B) and (C) of this section, if a rate may increase as a  penalty for one or more events specified in the account agreement, such  as a late payment or an extension of credit that exceeds the credit  limit, the card issuer must disclose pursuant to this paragraph (b)(1)  the increased rate that may apply, a brief description of the event or  events that may result in the increased rate, and a brief description of  how long the increased rate will remain in effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Introductory rates. If the issuer discloses an introductory  rate, as that term is defined in Sec. 226.16(g)(2)(ii), in the table or  in any written or electronic promotional materials accompanying  applications or solicitations subject to paragraph (c) or (e) of this  section, the issuer must briefly disclose   directly beneath the table the circumstances, if any, under which the  introductory rate may be revoked, and the type of rate that will apply  after the introductory rate is revoked.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Employee preferential rates. If a card issuer discloses in the  table a preferential annual percentage rate for which only employees of  the card issuer, employees of a third party, or other individuals with  similar affiliations with the card issuer or third party, such as  executive officers, directors, or principal shareholders are eligible,  the card issuer must briefly disclose directly beneath the table the  circumstances under which such preferential rate may be revoked, and the  rate that will apply after such preferential rate is revoked.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Rates that depend on consumer's creditworthiness. If a rate  cannot be determined at the time disclosures are given because the rate  depends, at least in part, on a later determination of the consumer's  creditworthiness, the card issuer must disclose the specific rates or  the range of rates that could apply and a statement that the rate for  which the consumer may qualify at account opening will depend on the  consumer's creditworthiness, and other factors if applicable. If the  rate that depends, at least in part, on a later determination of the  consumer's creditworthiness is a penalty rate, as described in paragraph  (b)(1)(iv) of this section, the card issuer at its option may disclose  the highest rate that could apply, instead of disclosing the specific  rates or the range of rates that could apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> APRs that vary by state. Issuers imposing annual percentage  rates that vary by state may, at the issuer's option, disclose in the  table: the specific annual percentage rate applicable to the consumer's  account; or the range of the annual percentage rates, if the disclosure  includes a statement that the annual percentage rate varies by state and  refers the consumer to a disclosure provided with the table where the  annual percentage rate applicable to the consumer's account is  disclosed. A card issuer may not list annual percentage rates for  multiple states in the table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fees for issuance or availability. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any annual or other  periodic fee that may be imposed for the issuance or availability of a  credit or charge card, including any fee based on account activity or  inactivity; how frequently it will be imposed; and the annualized amount  of the fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any non-periodic fee that relates to opening an account. A card  issuer must disclose that the fee is a one-time fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fixed finance charge; minimum interest charge. Any fixed finance  charge and a brief description of the charge. Any minimum interest  charge if it exceeds $1.00 that could be imposed during a billing cycle,  and a brief description of the charge. The $1.00 threshold amount shall  be adjusted periodically by the Board to reflect changes in the Consumer  Price Index. The Board shall calculate each year a price level adjusted  minimum interest charge using the Consumer Price Index in effect on June  1 of that year. When the cumulative change in the adjusted minimum value  derived from applying the annual Consumer Price level to the current  minimum interest charge threshold has risen by a whole dollar, the  minimum interest charge will be increased by $1.00. The issuer may, at  its option, disclose in the table minimum interest charges below this  threshold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transaction charges. Any transaction charge imposed by the card  issuer for the use of the card for purchases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Grace period. The date by which or the period within which any  credit extended for purchases may be repaid without incurring a finance  charge due to a periodic interest rate and any conditions on the  availability of the grace period. If no grace period is provided, that  fact must be disclosed. If the length of the grace period varies, the  card issuer may disclose the range of days, the minimum number of days,  or the average number of days in the grace period, if the disclosure is  identified as a range, minimum, or average. In disclosing in the tabular  format a grace period that applies to all types of purchases, the phrase  ``How to Avoid Paying Interest on Purchases'' shall be used as the  heading for the row describing the grace period. If a grace period is  not offered on all types of purchases, in disclosing this fact in the  tabular   format, the phrase ``Paying Interest'' shall be used as the heading for  the row describing this fact.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Balance computation method. The name of the balance computation  method listed in paragraph (g) of this section that is used to determine  the balance for purchases on which the finance charge is computed, or an  explanation of the method used if it is not listed. In determining which  balance computation method to disclose, the card issuer shall assume  that credit extended for purchases will not be repaid within the grace  period, if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Statement on charge card payments. A statement that charges  incurred by use of the charge card are due when the periodic statement  is received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Cash advance fee. Any fee imposed for an extension of credit in  the form of cash or its equivalent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Late payment fee. Any fee imposed for a late payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Over-the-limit fee. Any fee imposed for exceeding a credit  limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Balance transfer fee. Any fee imposed to transfer an  outstanding balance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Returned-payment fee. Any fee imposed by the card issuer for a  returned payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Required insurance, debt cancellation or debt suspension  coverage. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A fee for insurance described in Sec. 226.4(b)(7) or debt  cancellation or suspension coverage described in Sec. 226.4(b)(10), if  the insurance or debt cancellation or suspension coverage is required as  part of the plan; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A cross reference to any additional information provided about  the insurance or coverage accompanying the application or solicitation,  as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Available credit. If a card issuer requires fees for the  issuance or availability of credit described in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section, or requires a security deposit for such credit, and the total  amount of those required fees and/or security deposit that will be  imposed and charged to the account when the account is opened is 15  percent or more of the minimum credit limit for the card, a card issuer  must disclose the available credit remaining after these fees or  security deposit are debited to the account, assuming that the consumer  receives the minimum credit limit. In determining whether the 15 percent  threshold test is met, the issuer must only consider fees for issuance  or availability of credit, or a security deposit, that are required. If  fees for issuance or availability are optional, these fees should not be  considered in determining whether the disclosure must be given.  Nonetheless, if the 15 percent threshold test is met, the issuer in  providing the disclosure must disclose the amount of available credit  calculated by excluding those optional fees, and the available credit  including those optional fees.
