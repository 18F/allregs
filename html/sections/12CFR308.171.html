                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> By FDIC. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within 20 days after service of an application,  counsel for the FDIC may file with the Executive Secretary and serve on  all parties an answer to the application. Unless counsel for the FDIC  requests and is granted an extension of time for filing or files a  statement of intent to negotiate under Sec. 308.179 of this subpart,  failure to file an answer within the 20-day period will be treated as a  consent to the award requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award  requested and identify the facts relied on in support of the FDIC's  position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the  record of the proceeding, the answer shall include either supporting  affidavits or a request for further proceedings under Sec. 308.180.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reply to answer. The applicant may file a reply with regard to  an application filed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 504 (a)(1), if the FDIC has  addressed in its answer any of the following issues: that the position  of the FDIC was substantially justified, that the applicant unduly  protracted the proceedings, or that special circumstances make an award  unjust. The applicant may file a reply with regard to an application  filed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 504 (a)(4), if the FDIC has addressed in its  answer any of the following issues: that the applicant has committed a  willful violation of law or otherwise acted in bad faith, that the  FDIC's demand is reasonable when compared to the decision of the  administrative law judge or that special circumstances make an award  unjust. The reply shall be filed within 15 days after service of the  answer. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the  record of the proceeding, the reply shall include either supporting  affidavits or a request for further proceedings under Sec. 308.180.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> By other parties. Any party to the adversary adjudication, other  than the applicant and the FDIC, may file comments on an application  within 20 days after service of the application. If the applicant is  entitled to file a reply to the FDIC's answer under paragraph (b) of  this section, another party may file comments on the answer within 15  days after service of the answer. A commenting party may not participate  in any further proceedings on the application unless the administrative  law judge determines that the public interest requires such  participation in order to permit additional exploration of matters  raised in the comments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional response. Additional filings in the nature of  pleadings may be submitted only by leave of the administrative law  judge.  [56 FR 37975, Aug. 9, 1991, as amended at 64 FR 62102, Nov. 16, 1999]</p>
