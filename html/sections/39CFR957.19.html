                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Hearings shall be stenographically reported by a contract reporter of the Postal Service under the supervision of the Judicial Officer. Argument upon any matter may be excluded from the transcript by order of the Judicial Officer. A copy of the transcript shall be a part of the record and the sole official transcript of the proceeding. Copies of the transcript may be obtained by the Respondent from the reporter upon the payment of a reasonable price therefor. Copies of parts of the official record other than the transcript may be obtained from the librarian of the Postal Service or the Recorder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Changes in the official transcript may be made only when they involve errors affecting substance and then only in the manner herein provided. No physical changes shall be made in or upon the official transcript, or copies thereof, which have been filed with the record. Within 10 days after the receipt by any party of a copy of the official transcript, or any part thereof, the party may file a motion requesting correction of the transcript. Opposing counsel shall, within such time as may be specified by the Judicial Officer, notify the Judicial Officer in writing of his or her concurrence or disagreement with the requested corrections. Failure to interpose timely objection to a proposed correction shall be considered to be concurrence. Thereafter, the Judicial Officer shall by order specify the corrections to be made in the transcript. The Judicial Officer on his or her own initiative may order corrections to be made in the transcript with prompt notice to the parties of the proceeding. Any changes ordered by the Judicial Officer other than the agreement of the parties shall be subject to objection and exception.
