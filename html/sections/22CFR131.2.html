It is therefore the duty of the Authentication Officer to examine not only the document which the Department is asked to authenticate, but also the fundamental document to which previous seals or other certifications may have been affixed by other authorities. The Authentication Officer shall request such additional information as may be necessary to establish that the requested authentication will serve the interests of justice and is not contrary to public policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In accordance with section 3, paragraph 5 of the Export Administration Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 841, Pub.
