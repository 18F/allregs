The Secretary shall accept the recommendations of the Governor if he/she determines that they provide for a reasonable balance between the national interest and the State's interest. The Secretary shall communicate to the Governor in writing and publish in the Federal Register the reasons for his/her determination to accept or reject such Governor's recommendations.</p>
