                            <p class="depth0">The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business  Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs were established and issued under  the authority of the Small Business Act codified at 15 U.S.C. 631, as  amended,   and the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97- 219), codified with amendments at 15 U.S.C. 638, as amended. The Small  Business Act requires that the Small Business Administration (SBA) issue  SBIR and STTR Program Policy Directives for the general conduct of the  SBIR/STTR Programs within the Federal Government. The statutory purpose  of the SBIR Program is to strengthen the role of innovative small  business concerns (SBCs) in federally-funded research or research and  development (R/R&D;). Specific program purposes are to: Stimulate  technological innovation; use small business to meet Federal R/R&D;  needs; foster and encourage participation by socially and economically  disadvantaged SBCs, and by SBCs that are 51-percent owned and controlled  by women, in technological innovation; and increase private sector  commercialization of innovations derived from Federal R/R&D;, thereby  increasing competition, productivity and economic growth. Federal  agencies participating in the SBIR/STTR Programs (SBIR/STTR agencies)  are obligated to follow the guidance provided by the SBA Policy  Directive. NASA is required to ensure its policies, regulations, and  guidance on the SBIR/STTR Programs are consistent with SBA's Policy  Directive. Contracting officers are required to insert the applicable  clauses identified in 1819.7302 in all SBIR and STTR contracts.  [71 FR 61688, Oct. 19, 2006, as amended at 80 FR 12939, Mar. 12, 2015]</p>
