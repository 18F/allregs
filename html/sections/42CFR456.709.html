                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The State plan must provide for a retrospective DUR  program for ongoing periodic examination (no less frequently than  quarterly) of claims data and other records in order to identify  patterns of fraud, abuse, gross overuse, or inappropriate or medically  unnecessary care among physicians, pharmacists, and Medicaid  beneficiaries, or associated with specific drugs or groups of drugs.  This examination must involve pattern analysis, using predetermined  standards, of physician prescribing practices, drug use by individual  patients and, where appropriate, dispensing practices of pharmacies.  This program must be provided through the State's mechanized drug claims  processing and information retrieval systems approved by CMS (that is,  the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS)) or an electronic drug  claims processing system that is integrated with MMIS. States that do  not have MMIS systems may use existing systems provided that the results  of the examination of drug claims as described in this section are  integrated within their existing system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use of predetermined standards. Retrospective DUR includes, but  is not limited to, using predetermined standards to monitor for the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Therapeutic appropriateness, that is, drug prescribing and  dispensing that is in conformity with the predetermined standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Overutilization and underutilization, as defined in Sec.   456.702.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Appropriate use of generic products, that is, use of such  products in conformity with State product selection laws.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Therapeutic duplication as described in Sec.  456.705(b)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Drug-disease contraindication as described in Sec.   456.705(b)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Drug-drug interaction as described in Sec.  456.705(b)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Incorrect drug dosage as described in Sec.  456.705(b)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Incorrect duration of drug treatment as described in Sec.   456.705(b)(5).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Clinical abuse or misuse as described in Sec.  456.705(b)(7).</p>
