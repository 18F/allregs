So long as a proposed action or project is not categorically excluded under Sec. 1010.7, the Trust shall require the preparation of an EA to determine if the proposed action or project requires an EIS. Nevertheless, if it is readily apparent to the NEPA Compliance Coordinator that the proposed action or project will have a significant impact on the environment, an EA is not required, and the Trust will prepare or direct the preparation of an EIS without preparing or completing the preparation of an EA. To assist the NEPA Compliance Coordinator in determining if a proposal or action normally requires the preparation of an EIS, the following criteria and categories of action are provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Criteria. Criteria used to determine whether proposals or actions may significantly affect the environment and therefore require an EIS are described in 40 CFR 1508.27.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Categories of action. The following categories of action normally require an EIS:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Legislative proposals made by the Trust to the United States Congress, other than those described in Sec. 1010.7(b)(9);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Approval, funding, construction, and/or demolition in preparation for construction of any new building, if that activity has a significant effect on the human environment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Proposals that would significantly alter the kind and amount of natural, recreational, historical, scenic, or cultural resources of the Presidio Trust Area or the integrity of the setting; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Approval or amendment of a general land use or resource management plan for the entire Presidio Trust Area.</p>
