                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Because of the limitations under guaranteed loans, some  contractors seek to supplement the loan by other borrowing (outside the  guarantee) from the financing institution or other sources. It has been  recognized in practice that, while prohibition of borrowings outside the  guaranteed loan is preferable when practicable in a given V-loan case,  such other borrowings should be permitted when necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the agency consents to the contractor obtaining other  borrowing during the guaranteed loan period, the agency shall apply the  following restrictions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A reasonable limit on the amount of other borrowing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If guaranteed and unguaranteed loans are made by the same  financing institution, a requirement that any collateral security  requested by the institution under the unguaranteed loan is also to be  secondary collateral for the guaranteed loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A requirement that the contractor provide appropriate  documentation to the guaranteeing agency, at intervals not longer than  30 days, to disclose outstanding unguaranteed borrowings.
