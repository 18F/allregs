DC1, a domestic corporation, has owned all the stock of CFC, a foreign corporation, since CFC's formation on January 1, year 3. On December 31, year 5, DC2, a domestic corporation unrelated to DC1, contributes property it has held since January 1, year 1, to CFC in exchange for voting stock of CFC in a restructuring transaction that is an exchange under section 351. The property that DC2 contributes is not stock in a foreign corporation with respect to which DC2 was either a section 1248 shareholder or a foreign corporate shareholder. DC2 receives 80% of the voting stock of CFC in the restructuring transaction and its holding period in that CFC stock, determined pursuant to section 1223(1), began on January 1, year 1. CFC has $100 of accumulated earnings and profits on December 31, year 5. On December 31, year 7, when the accumulated earnings and profits of CFC are $200, DC2, a section 1248 shareholder with respect to CFC, sells its CFC stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the earnings and profits attributable to the CFC stock sold by DC2 are $80. This amount consists of none of the $100 of earnings and profits accumulated by CFC before the restructuring transaction, and 80% of the $100 of earnings and profits of CFC accumulated after the restructuring transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except as follows. The property that DC2 contributes is 100% of the stock in CFC2, a foreign corporation. DC2 has owned all the stock of CFC2 since CFC2's formation on January 1, year 2, and CFC2 has $200 of earnings and profits as of December 31, year 5. CFC2 does not accumulate any additional earnings and profits from December 31, year 5, to December 31, year 7. On December 31, year 7, when the accumulated earnings and profits of CFC are $200, DC2, a section 1248 shareholder with respect to CFC, sells its CFC stock. Also on that date, DC1 sells its CFC stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. (A) DC2 sale. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the earnings and profits attributable to the CFC stock sold by DC2 are $280. This amount consists of all of the $200 of earnings and profits of CFC2 accumulated before the restructuring transaction (see also section 1248(c)(2)), none of the $100 of earnings and profits accumulated by CFC before the restructuring transaction, and 80% of the $100 of earnings and profits of CFC accumulated after the restructuring transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> DC2 sale. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the earnings and profits attributable to the CFC stock sold by DC2 are $280.

Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the earnings and profits attributable to the CFC stock sold by DC1, a non-exchanging shareholder in the restructuring transaction, are $120. This amount consists of all of the $100 of earnings and profits of CFC accumulated before the restructuring transaction, none of the $200 of earnings and profits of CFC2 accumulated before the restructuring transaction, and 20% of the $100 of earnings and profits of CFC accumulated after the restructuring transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DC1, a domestic corporation, has owned all of the stock of CFC, a foreign corporation, since CFC's formation on January 1, year 1. DC1 has also owned all the stock of DC2, a domestic corporation, since DC2's formation on

January 1, year 1. On December 31, year 2, DC1 contributes the stock of CFC to DC2 in exchange for stock in DC2 in a restructuring transaction that is an exchange described in section 351. On December 31, year 2, CFC has $100 of accumulated earnings and profits. DC2 has a basis in the CFC stock determined under section 362, and is considered to have held the CFC stock since January 1, year 1, pursuant to section 1223(2). On December 31, year 4, when the accumulated earnings and profits of CFC are still $100, DC2 sells its CFC stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, $100 of accumulated earnings and profits of CFC is attributable to the stock of CFC sold by DC2, even though DC2 did not hold the stock of CFC during the time CFC accumulated the earnings and profits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DC1, a domestic corporation, has owned all the stock of CFC1, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. DC2, a domestic corporation unrelated to DC1, has owned all of the stock of CFC2, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 2. On December 31, year 3, pursuant to a restructuring transaction that is a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), CFC1 transfers all of its assets to CFC2 in exchange for 25% of the voting stock of CFC2. CFC1 distributes the CFC2 stock to DC1 and the CFC1 stock is cancelled. DC1's holding period in the CFC2 stock, determined under section 1223(1), begins on January 1, year 1. On December 31, year 3, CFC1 has $100 of accumulated earnings and profits and CFC2 has $200 of accumulated earnings and profits. CFC2 succeeds to the $100 of CFC1 accumulated earnings and profits in the reorganization under section 381. From January 1, year 4 to December 31, year 5, CFC2 incurred a deficit in earnings and profits in the amount of ($200). On December 31, year 5, both DC1 and DC2 sell their stock in CFC2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. (A) DC1. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, $50 of earnings and profits is attributable to the CFC2 stock sold by DC1. This amount consists of $100 of CFC1's earnings and profits accumulated before the restructuring transaction, reduced by 25% of CFC2's ($200) post-restructuring transaction deficit in earnings and profits. None of the $200 of CFC2's earnings and profits accumulated by CFC2 prior to the reorganization is attributed to the CFC2 stock sold by DC1. Also, none of the earnings and profits CFC2 succeeded to under section 381 is attributed to the CFC2 stock sold by DC1, pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> DC1.

None of the $200 of CFC2's earnings and profits accumulated by CFC2 prior to the reorganization is attributed to the CFC2 stock sold by DC1. Also, none of the earnings and profits CFC2 succeeded to under section 381 is attributed to the CFC2 stock sold by DC1, pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> DC2. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, there is $50 of accumulated earnings and profits attributable to the CFC2 stock sold by DC2. This amount consists of all of the $200 of CFC2's earnings and profits accumulated by CFC2 prior to the reorganization, reduced by 75% of CFC2's deficit in earnings and profits in the amount of ($200) incurred after the restructuring transaction. None of the $100 of CFC1 accumulated earnings and profits succeeded to under section 381 is attributable to the CFC2 stock sold by DC2, pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Section 368(a)(1)(B) reorganization. If, instead of DC1 acquiring its 25% interest in CFC2 pursuant to a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), DC1 had transferred the stock of CFC1 to CFC2 in exchange for 25% of the voting stock of CFC2 in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B), the results would be the same as described in paragraphs (ii) (A) and (B) of this Example 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DC1, a domestic corporation, has owned all the stock of CFC1, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. CFC1 has owned all the stock of CFC2, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. FC, a foreign corporation that is not a controlled foreign corporation, has owned all of the stock of DC2, a domestic corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 2. On December 31, year 3, pursuant to a restructuring transaction that was a triangular reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), CFC1 transfers all of its assets, including the CFC2 stock, to DC2 in exchange for 60% of the voting stock of FC. CFC1 transfers the voting stock of FC to DC1 and the CFC1 stock is cancelled. Pursuant to section 1223(1), DC1 is considered to have held the stock of FC since January 1, year 1. Under section 1223(2), DC2 is considered to have held the stock of CFC2 since January 1, year 1. On December 31, year 3, CFC1 has $100 of earnings and profits, CFC2 has $300 of earnings and profits, and FC has $200 of earnings and profits. DC1 includes the $100 all earnings and profits amount attributable to its CFC1 stock in income as a deemed dividend under Sec. 1.367(b)-3 upon the exchange of CFC1 stock for FC stock.

The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples. See also Sec. 1.367(a)-3T(e)(8), Example 3. For purposes of the examples, unless otherwise indicated: DP and DC are domestic corporations; X is a United States citizen; FP is a foreign corporation; CFC1, CFC2, and FA are controlled foreign corporations; each corporation has a single class of stock outstanding and uses the calendar year as its taxable year; each shareholder of a corporation owns a single block of stock in the corporation; DC owns Business A, which consists solely of

property whose fair market value exceeds its basis and could satisfy the requirements of the active foreign trade or business exception under section 367(a)(3) and Sec. 1.367(a)-2T; DC owns no other assets and has no liabilities; the requirements in Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(5) are satisfied; no earnings and profits of a foreign corporation are described in section 1248(d); and none of the foreign corporations in the examples is a surrogate foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 7874) as a result of the transactions described in the examples because one or more of the conditions of section 7874(a)(2)(B) is not satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DP, FP, and X own 80%, 10%, and 10%, respectively, of the outstanding stock of DC. DP's DC stock has a $140x basis, $160x fair market value, and a 2-year holding period. DC wholly owns CFC1. DC's CFC1 stock has a $50x basis, $100x fair market value (therefore a gain of $50x), $25x of earnings and profits attributable to it for purposes of section 1248, and a $25x section 1248 amount (computed as the lesser of $50x gain in the CFC1 stock and $25x of section 1248 earnings and profits), and a 3-year holding period. On December 31, year 3, DC distributes all of the CFC1 stock to DP, FP, and X on a pro-rata basis in a distribution to which section 355 applies. The fair market value of the CFC1 stock received by DP, FP, and X is $80x, $10x, and $10x, respectively. After the distribution, DP's stock in DC has a fair market value of $80x and DP's section 358 basis in the CFC1 stock is $70x (a pro rata portion, or 50%, of DP's $140x basis in the DC stock immediately before the distribution). See Sec. 1.358-2(a)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. (A) Under Sec. 1.367(e)-1(b)(1), DC must recognize $5x gain on the distribution of CFC1 stock to FP (10% of the $50x gain in the CFC1 stock). Under Sec. 1.367(b)-5(b)(1)(ii), DC must also recognize $5x gain on the distribution of CFC1 stock to X (10% of the $50x gain in the CFC1 stock). Of the aggregate $10x gain recognized by DC, $5x is recharacterized as a dividend under section 1248(a), computed as 20% of the $25x section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC1 stock. See Sec. 1.1248-1 for additional consequences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Under Sec. 1.367(e)-1(b)(1), DC must recognize $5x gain on the distribution of CFC1 stock to FP (10% of the $50x gain in the CFC1 stock). Under Sec. 1.367(b)-5(b)(1)(ii), DC must also recognize $5x gain on the distribution of CFC1 stock to X (10% of the $50x gain in the CFC1 stock). Of the aggregate $10x gain recognized by DC, $5x is recharacterized as a dividend under section 1248(a), computed as 20% of the $25x section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC1 stock. See Sec. 1.1248-1 for additional consequences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> DC's distribution of CFC1 stock to DP is described in section 1248(f)(1) and Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(b)(2) because the distribution is pursuant to section 355(c)(1) (an existing stock distribution). As a result, the general rule is that DC must include in gross income as a dividend the section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC1 stock distributed to DP, or $20x (computed as 80% of the $25x section 1248 amount). However, if DP and DC make the election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(b)(2) will not apply to DC's distribution of CFC1 stock to DP. If DP and DC make the election, then:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, for purposes of section 1248, immediately after the distribution DP will have a 3-year holding period in the CFC1 stock, the same holding period DC had in the CFC1 stock at the time of the distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, DP's section 358 basis in the CFC1 stock ($70x) is reduced by $10x, the amount by which DC's section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC1 stock ($20x) distributed to DP exceeds DP's postdistribution amount with respect to the CFC1 stock ($10x). Under Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(c)(6), DP's postdistribution amount equals the amount that DP would include in gross income as a dividend under section 1248(a) if DP sold the CFC1 stock immediately after the distribution, or $10x, which is computed as the lesser of the $10x gain in the CFC1 stock ($80x fair market value, less $70x basis) and $20x of section 1248 earnings and profits attributable to the CFC1 stock, taking into account DP's 3-year holding period in the stock as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section. As adjusted under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, DP's basis in the CFC1 stock is $60x ($70x basis, less $10x required basis reduction).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DP wholly owns DC. DP's DC stock has a $180x basis and $200x fair market value. DC wholly owns CFC1 and CFC2. DC's CFC1 stock has a $70x basis, $100x fair market value (therefore a gain of $30x), $40x of earnings and profits attributable to it for purposes of section 1248, and a section 1248 amount of $30x (computed as the lesser of the $30x gain in CFC1 stock and $40x section 1248 earnings and profits). DC's CFC2 stock has a $130x basis, $100x fair market value (therefore a loss of $30x), $80x of earnings and profits attributable to it for purposes of section 1248, and a section 1248 amount of $0x (computed as the lesser of the $0x gain and $80x section 1248 earnings and profits). On December 31, Year 1, in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(F), DC transfers the CFC1 stock and the CFC2 stock to FA, a newly formed corporation, in exchange for 100 shares of FA stock. DC distributes the 100 shares of FA stock to DP. DC's transfer of the CFC1 stock and CFC2 stock to FA in exchange for FA stock qualifies as a section 361 exchange, and DC's distribution of the 100 shares of FA stock to DP is pursuant to section 361(c)(1). DP exchanges its DC stock for the 100 shares of FA stock pursuant to section 354. Immediately after the transaction, DP wholly owns FA. DP and DC elect to apply the provisions of Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c) in accordance with Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(5). Pursuant to

Sec. 1.367(a)-3T(e)(3)(iii)(A), DP properly files a gain recognition agreement with respect to the CFC1 stock that satisfies the conditions of Sec.

Second, the requirements under Sec. 1.367(a)-3T(e)(3)(ii) related to transfers of domestic stock are not applicable because CFC1 is a foreign corporation. Third, because DC owns all the stock of FA immediately after DC's receipt of the FA stock in the section 361 exchange but prior to, and without taking into account, DC's distribution of the FA stock to DP, for purposes of satisfying the requirements of Sec. 1.367(a)-3T(e)(3)(iii), DP properly files a gain recognition agreement with respect to the CFC1 stock that satisfies the conditions of Sec. Sec. 1.367(a)-3T(e)(6) and 1.367(a)-8.

In addition, DC is not required to include in income as a deemed dividend the $30x section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC1 stock under Sec. 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(i) because immediately after DC's receipt of the FA stock in the section 361 exchange but prior to, and without taking into account, DC's distribution of the FA stock to DP, CFC1 and FA are controlled foreign corporations as to which DC is a section 1248 shareholder. See Sec. 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(ii)(A). With respect to the transfer of the CFC2 stock to FA, DC's section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC2 stock is $0x; therefore, Sec. 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(i) has no application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> DC does not recognize gain under Sec. 1.367(a)-3T(e)(2) with respect to the transfer of the CFC1 stock to FA because the three conditions in Sec. 1.367(a)-3T(e)(3)(i), (e)(3)(ii), and (e)(3)(iii) are satisfied. First, Sec. 1.367(a)-3T(e)(3)(i) is satisfied because the requirements of Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c) are satisfied, including that an election is made to apply Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c). Second, the requirements under Sec. 1.367(a)-3T(e)(3)(ii) related to transfers of domestic stock are not applicable because CFC1 is a foreign corporation.

In addition, DC is not required to include in income as a deemed dividend the $30x section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC1 stock under Sec. 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(i) because immediately after DC's receipt of the FA stock in the section 361 exchange but prior to, and without taking into account, DC's distribution of the FA stock to DP, CFC1 and FA are controlled foreign corporations as to which DC is a section 1248 shareholder. See Sec. 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(ii)(A). With respect to the transfer of the CFC2 stock to FA, DC's section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC2 stock is $0x; therefore, Sec. 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(i) has no application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Under Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(b)(3), as a result of the section 361(c)(1) distribution of the FA stock to DP (a new stock distribution), the general rule is that DC must include in gross income as a dividend the total section 1248(f) amount (defined in Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(c)(14)). The total section 1248(f) amount is $30x, the sum of the section 1248(f) amount (defined in Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(c)(10)) with respect to the CFC1 stock ($30x) and CFC2 stock ($0x). The section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC1 stock is the amount that DC would have included in income as a deemed dividend under Sec. 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(i) with respect to the CFC1 stock if the requirements under Sec. 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(ii)(A) had not been satisfied ($30x), less the amount of gain recognized by DC under Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(2) that is allocable to the CFC1 stock under Sec. 1.367(a)-7(e)(1) and treated as a dividend under section 1248(a) ($0x). Similarly, the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC2 stock is the amount that DC would have included in income as a deemed dividend under Sec. 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(i) with respect to the CFC2 stock if the requirements under Sec. 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(ii)(A) had not been satisfied ($0x), less the amount of gain recognized by DC under Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(2) that is allocable to the CFC2 stock under Sec. 1.367(a)-7(e)(1) and treated as a dividend under section 1248(a) ($0x).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If, however, DP and DC make the election provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the amount that DC is required to include in gross income as a dividend under Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(b)(3) (the total section 1248(f) amount of $30x) is reduced to the extent the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC1 stock ($30x) and CFC2 stock ($0x) is attributable under paragraph (d) of this section to the shares of FA stock distributed to one or more distributees that are section 1248 shareholders of FA. The only distributee is DP, and DP is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to FA. If DP and DC elect to apply paragraph (c) of this section, then:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the portion of the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC1 stock that is attributed to the shares of FA stock distributed to DP is equal to DP's hypothetical section 1248 amount (as defined in Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(c)(4)) with respect to the CFC1 stock. Because DP is the only shareholder of DC, DP's hypothetical section 1248 amount equals the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC1 stock ($30x). The $30x hypothetical section 1248 amount is attributed pro rata (based on relative values) among the 100 shares of FA stock distributed to DP, and the attributable share amount (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) is $.30x. Paragraph (d)(1) of this section has no application with respect to the CFC2 stock because there is no section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC2 stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the shares of FA stock are divided into portions, the rules of paragraph (d)(2) of this section apply to attribute the attributable share amount ($.30x) to portions of shares of FA stock distributed to DP. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the 100 shares of FA stock are divided into two portions, one portion related to the single block of CFC1 stock and one portion related to the single block of CFC2 stock. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the attributable share amount of $.30x is attributed to the portion of the 100 shares of FA stock that relates to the single block of CFC1 stock. Thus, all of the $30x section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC1 stock is attributable to the 100 shares of FA stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Because the election under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is made, the total section 1248(f) amount ($30x) that DC is otherwise required to include in gross income as a dividend under Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(b)(3) is reduced by $30x, the portion of the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC1 stock that is attributable under paragraph (d) of this section to the shares of FA stock distributed to DP. Thus, the amount DC is required to include in gross income as a dividend under Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(b)(3) is $0x ($30x less $30x).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the basis of each portion is the product of DP's section 358 basis in the share of FA stock multiplied by the ratio of the section 362 basis of the property (CFC1 stock or CFC2 stock, as applicable) to which the portion relates, to the aggregate section 362 basis of all property (CFC1 stock and CFC2 stock) received by FA in the section 361 exchange. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the fair market value of each portion is the product of the fair market value of the share of FA stock multiplied by the ratio of the fair market value of the property (CFC1 stock or CFC2 stock, as applicable) to which the portion relates, to the aggregate fair market value of all property (CFC1 stock and CFC2 stock) received by FA in the section 361 exchange. The section 362 basis of the CFC1 stock and CFC2 stock is $70x and $130x, respectively, for a total section 362 basis of $200x. The CFC1 stock and CFC2 stock each has a fair market value of $100x, for a total fair market value of $200x. Therefore, the portions attributable to the CFC1 stock have an aggregate basis of $63x ($180x multiplied by $70x/$200x) and fair market value of $100x ($200x multiplied by $100x/$200x), resulting in aggregate gain in such portions of $37x (or $.37x per portion in each of the 100 shares). The portions attributable to the CFC2 stock have an aggregate basis of $117x ($180x multiplied by $130x/$200x) and fair market value of $100x ($200x multiplied by $100x/$200x), resulting in aggregate losses in such portions of $17x (or $.17x per portion in each of the 100 shares).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Under Sec. 1.1248-8(b)(2)(iv), the $40x earnings and profits attributable to the single block of CFC1 stock are attributed to the portions of the 100 shares of FA stock that relate to the CFC1 stock. Similarly, the $80x of earnings and profits attributable to the single block of CFC2 stock are attributed to the portions of the 100 shares of the FA stock that relate to the CFC2 stock. Thus, DP's postdistribution amount (defined in Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(c)(6)) with respect to the portions of the shares of FA attributable to the CFC1 stock is $37x, the lesser of the aggregate gain in the portions attributable to the CFC1 stock of $37x (computed in paragraph (ii)(C)(4) of this Example 2) and the $40x earnings and profits attributable to such portions. Furthermore, DP's postdistribution amount with respect to the portions of the shares of FA attributable to the CFC2 stock is $0x, the lesser of the aggregate gain in the portions attributable to the CFC2 stock of $0x (computed in paragraph (ii)(C)(4) of this Example 2 to be an aggregate loss of $17x) and the $80x earnings and profits attributable to such portions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, DP's section 358 basis in the portions of the 100 shares of FA stock attributable to the CFC1 stock ($63x, computed in paragraph (ii)(C)(4) of this Example 2) is reduced by the amount (if any) by which the section 1248(f) amount attributable to such portions under paragraph (d) of this section ($30x, as computed in paragraph (ii)(C)(2) of this Example 2) exceeds DP's postdistribution amount with respect to such portions ($37x, computed in paragraph (ii)(C)(5) of this Example 2). Thus, there is no basis reduction in the portions of the 100 shares of FA stock attributable to the CFC1 stock. DP's section 358 basis in the portions of the 100 shares of FA stock attributable to the CFC2 stock is not reduced because the section 1248(f) amount attributable to such portions under paragraph (d) of this section is $0x (computed in paragraph (ii)(C)(2) of this Example 2), which equals DP's postdistribution amount with respect to such portions of $0x (as computed in paragraph (ii)(C)(5) of this Example 2).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3.

DC owns all 60 shares of the outstanding stock of CFC1; all such shares constitute a single block of stock. DC's CFC1 stock has a $50x basis, $60x fair market value, $30x of earnings and profits attributable to it for purposes of section 1248, a $10x section 1248 amount (computed as the lesser of $10x gain and $30x of section 1248 earnings and profits), and a 3-year holding period. DC also owns all 40 shares of the outstanding stock of CFC2; all such shares constitute a single block of stock.

As stated in the facts, the election is made to apply Sec. 1.1248(f)-2(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the portion of the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC2 stock that is attributed to the 40 shares of CFC1 stock distributed to DP is equal to DP's hypothetical section 1248 amount (as defined in Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(c)(4)) with respect to the CFC2 stock. Because DP is the only shareholder of DC, DP's hypothetical section 1248 amount equals the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC2 stock ($10x). The $10x hypothetical section 1248 amount is attributed pro rata (based on relative values) among the 40 shares of CFC1 stock distributed to DP, and the attributable share amount (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) is $.25x.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The 40 shares of CFC1 stock are not divided into portions under paragraph (c)(2) of this section because the only property transferred by DC to CFC1 is a single block of stock of CFC2. If the 40 shares of CFC1 stock were required to be divided into portions, however, the rules of paragraph (d)(2) of this section apply to attribute the attributable share amount ($.25x) to portions of shares of CFC1 stock distributed to DP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Because the election under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is made, the total section 1248(f) amount ($10x) that DC is otherwise required to include in gross income as a dividend under Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(b)(3) is reduced by $10x, the portion of the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC2 stock that is attributable under paragraph (d) of this section to the 40 shares of CFC1 stock distributed to DP. Thus, the amount DC is required to include in gross income as a dividend under Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(b)(3) is $0x ($30x less $30x).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Under Sec. 1.1248-8(b)(2)(iv), the $20x earnings and profits attributable to the single block of CFC2 stock are attributed pro rata to the 40 shares of CFC1 stock. Thus, DP's postdistribution amount (defined in Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(c)(6)) with respect to the 40 shares of CFC1 stock attributable to the CFC2 stock is $10x, the lesser of the aggregate gain in the 40 shares of CFC1 stock of $10x ($40x fair market value, less $30x section 358 basis, as described in paragraph (ii)(D) of this Example 3) and the $20x earnings and profits attributable to such shares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, DP's section 358 basis in the 40 shares of CFC1 stock ($30x) is reduced by the amount (if any) by which the section 1248(f) amount attributable to such shares under paragraph (d) of this section ($10x, as computed in paragraph (ii)(E) of this Example 3) exceeds DP's postdistribution amount with respect to such shares ($10x). Thus, there is no basis reduction in the 40 shares of CFC1 stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Pursuant Sec. 1.367(a)-3T(e)(6), the amount of gain subject to the gain recognition agreement entered into by DP with respect to the CFC2 stock is $10x, which is the product of DP's ownership interest percentage (100%) multiplied by the gain realized by DC in the 361 exchange prior to taking into account the application of any other provision of section 367 ($10x), reduced by the sum of the amounts described in Sec. 1.367(a)-3T(e)(6)(i)(A), (e)(6)(i)(B), (e)(6)(i)(C), and (e)(6)(i)(D) ($0x).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> DC's distribution of the 60 shares of CFC1 stock it held before the section 361 exchange is subject to Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(b)(2) (an existing stock distribution); however, because DC and DP make the election provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(b)(2) does not apply to the distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, for purposes of section 1248, DP will have a 3-year holding period in the 60 shares of CFC1 stock received, the same holding period that DC had in the 60 shares of CFC1 stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, DP's section 358 basis in the 60 shares of CFC1 stock received ($54x, as computed in paragraph (ii)(C) of this Example 3) is reduced by $4x, the amount by which DC's section 1248 amount ($10x) with respect to the 60 shares of CFC1 stock exceeds DP's postdistribution amount ($6x) with respect to the 60 shares of CFC1 stock. Under Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(c)(6), DP's postdistribution amount with respect to the 60 shares of CFC1 stock equals the amount that DP would include in gross income as a dividend under section 1248(a) if DP sold the 60 shares of CFC1 stock immediately after the distribution, or $6x, which is computed as the lesser of the $6x gain in the such shares of CFC1 stock ($60x fair market value, less $54x basis) and $30x of section 1248 earnings and profits attributable to the CFC1 stock, taking into account DP's 3-year holding period in the

stock as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section. As adjusted under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, DP's basis in the 60 shares of CFC1 stock is $50x ($54x basis, less $4x basis reduction).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Applicable cross-references. For rules relating to the attribution of earnings and profits to the stock of a foreign corporation following certain nonrecognition transactions, see Sec. 1.1248-8.
