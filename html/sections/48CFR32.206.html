                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The contract shall contain the paragraph entitled ``Payment'' of the clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items. If the contract will provide for contract financing, the contracting officer shall construct a solicitation provision and contract clause. This solicitation provision shall be constructed in accordance with 32.204 or 32.205. If the procedure at 32.205 is used, the solicitation provision at 52.232-31, Invitation to Propose Financing Terms, shall be included. The contract clause shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of this subpart and any agency regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each contract financing clause shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Computation of the financing payment amounts (see paragraph (c) of this section);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Specific conditions of contractor entitlement to those financing payments (see paragraph (c) of this section);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Liquidation of those financing payments by delivery payments (see paragraph (e) of this section);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Security the contractor will provide for financing payments and any terms or conditions specifically applicable thereto (see 32.202-4); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Frequency, form, and any additional content of the contractor's request for financing payment (in addition to the requirements of the clause at 52.232-29, Terms for Financing of Purchases of Commercial Items; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless agency regulations authorize alterations, the unaltered text of the clause at 52.232-29, Terms for Financing of Purchases of Commercial Items.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Computation of amounts, and contractor entitlement provisions. (1) Contracts shall provide that delivery payments shall be made only for completed supplies and services accepted by the Government in accordance with the terms of the contract. Contracts may provide for commercial advance and commercial interim payments based upon a wide variety of bases, including (but not limited to) achievement or occurrence of specified events, the passage of time, or specified times prior to the delivery date(s). The basis for payment must be objectively determinable. The clause written by the contracting officer shall specify, to the extent access is necessary, the information and/or facilities to which the Government shall have access for the purpose of verifying the contractor's entitlement to payment of contract financing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contracts shall provide that delivery payments shall be made only for completed supplies and services accepted by the Government in accordance with the terms of the contract. Contracts may provide for commercial advance and commercial interim payments based upon a wide variety of bases, including (but not limited to) achievement or occurrence of specified events, the passage of time, or specified times prior to the delivery date(s).

The clause written by the contracting officer shall specify, to the extent access is necessary, the information and/or facilities to which the Government shall have access for the purpose of verifying the contractor's entitlement to payment of contract financing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the contract is awarded using the offeror-proposed procedure at 32.205, the clause constructed by the contracting officer under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall contain the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement that the offeror's proposed listing of earliest times and greatest amounts of projected financing payments submitted in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of the provision at 52.232-31, Invitation to Propose Financing Terms, is incorporated into the contract, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement that financing payments shall be made in the lesser amount and on the later of the date due in accordance with the financing

terms of the contract, or in the amount and on the date projected in the listing of earliest times and greatest amounts incorporated in the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the security accepted by the contracting officer is the contractor's financial condition, the contracting officer shall incorporate in the clause constructed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section the following--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement that the contractor's financial condition has been accepted as adequate security for commercial financing payments; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement that the contracting officer may exercise the Government's rights to require other security under paragraph (c), Security for Government Financing, of the clause at 52.232-29, Terms for Financing of Purchases of Commercial Items, in the event the contractor's financial condition changes and is found not to be adequate security.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Instructions for multiple appropriations. If contract financing is to be computed for the contract as a whole, and if there is more than one appropriation account (or subaccount) funding payments under the contract, the contracting officer shall include, in the contract, instructions for distribution of financing payments to the respective funds accounts. Distribution instructions and contract liquidation instructions must be mutually consistent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Liquidation. Liquidation of contract financing payments shall be on the same basis as the computation of contract financing payments; that is, financing payments computed on a whole contract basis shall be liquidated on a whole contract basis; and a payment computed on a line item basis shall be liquidated against that line item. If liquidation is on a whole contract basis, the contracting officer shall use a uniform liquidation percentage as the liquidation method, unless the contracting officer obtains the concurrence of the cognizant payment office that the proposed liquidation provisions can be executed by that office, or unless agency regulations provide alternative liquidation methods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Prompt payment for commercial purchase payments. The provisions of subpart 32.9, Prompt Payment, apply to contract financing and invoice payments for commercial purchases in the same manner they apply to non-commercial purchases. The contracting officer is responsible for including in the contract all the information necessary to implement prompt payment. In particular, contracting officers must be careful to clearly differentiate in the contract between contract financing and invoice payments and between items having different prompt payment times.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Installment payment financing for commercial items. Contracting officers may insert the clause at 52.232-30, Installment Payments for Commercial Items, in solicitations and contracts in lieu of constructing a specific clause in accordance with paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, if the contract action qualifies under the criteria at 32.202-1(b) and installment payments for the item are either customary or are authorized in accordance with agency procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Description. Installment payment financing is payment by the Government to a contractor of a fixed number of equal interim financing payments prior to delivery and acceptance of a contract item. The installment payment arrangement is designed to reduce administrative costs. However, if a contract will have a large number of deliveries, the administrative costs may increase to the point where installment payments are not in the best interests of the Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Authorized types of installment payment financing and rates. Installment payments may be made using the clause at 52.232-30, Installment Payments for Commercial Items, either at the 70 percent financing rate cited in the clause or at a lower rate in accordance with agency procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Calculating the amount of installment financing payments. The contracting officer shall identify in the contract schedule those items for which installment payment financing is authorized. Monthly installment payment amounts are to be calculated by the contractor pursuant to the instructions in the contract clause only for items authorized to receive installment payment financing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Liquidating installment payments. If installment payments have been made

for an item, the amount paid to the contractor upon acceptance of the item by the Government shall be reduced by the amount of installment payments made for the item. The contractor's request for final payment for each item is required to show this calculation.</p>
