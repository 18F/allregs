[48 FR 37209, Aug. 17, 1983, as amended at 60 FR 34168, June 30, 1995]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix B to Part 202--``Best Edition'' of Published Copyrighted</p><p class="depth0">Works for the Collections of the Library of Congress</p><p class="depth0">The copyright law (title 17, United States Code) requires that copies or phonorecords deposited in the Copyright Office be of the ``best edition'' of the work. The law states that ``The `best edition' of a work is the edition, published in the United States at any time before the date of deposit, that the Library of Congress determines to be most suitable for its purposes.'' (For works first published only in a country other than the United States, the law requires the deposit of the best edition as first published.)</p><p class="depth0">When two or more editions of the same version of a work have been published, the one of the highest quality is generally considered to be the best edition. In judging quality, the Library of Congress will adhere to the criteria set forth below in all but exceptional circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">Where differences between editions represent variations in copyrightable content, each edition is a separate version and ``best edition'' standards based on such differences do not apply. Each such version is a separate work for the purpose of the copyright law.</p><p class="depth0">The criteria to be applied in determining the best edition of each of several types of material are listed below in descending order of importance. In deciding between two editions, a criterion-by-criterion comparison should be made. The edition which first fails to satisfy a criterion is to be considered of inferior quality and will not be an acceptable deposit. Example: If a comparison is made between two hardbound editions of a book, one a trade edition printed on acid-free paper, and the other a specially bound edition printed on average paper, the former will be the best edition because the type of paper is a more important criterion than the binding.</p><p class="depth0">Under regulations of the Copyright Office, potential depositors may request authorization to deposit copies or phonorecords of other than the best edition of a specific work (e.g., a microform rather than a printed edition of a serial), by requesting ``special relief'' from the deposit requirements. All requests for special relief should be in writing and should state the reason(s) why the applicant cannot send the required deposit and what the applicant wishes to submit instead of the required deposit.</p><p class="depth0">I. Printed Textual Matter</p><p class="depth0">A. Paper, Binding, and Packaging:</p><p class="depth0">1. Archival-quality rather than less-permanent paper.</p><p class="depth0">2.

Stapled rather than spiral-bound or plastic-bound.</p><p class="depth0">8. Bound rather than looseleaf, except when future looseleaf insertions are to be issued. In the case of looseleaf materials, this includes the submission of all binders and indexes when they are part of the unit as published and offered for sale or distribution. Additionally, the regular and timely receipt of all appropriate looseleaf updates, supplements, and releases including supplemental binders issued to handle these expanded versions, is part of the requirement to properly maintain these publications.</p><p class="depth0">9.
