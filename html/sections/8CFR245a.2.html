Affidavits accompanied by a photograph which has been identified by the affiant as the individual known to affiant under the assumed name in question will carry greater weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Proof of residence.

Letters from employers should be on employer letterhead stationery, if the employer has such stationery, and must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Alien's address at the time of employment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exact period of employment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Periods of layoff;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Duties with the company;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Whether or not the information was taken from official company records; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Where records are located and whether the Service may have access to the records.
If the records are unavailable, an affidavit form-letter stating that the alien's employment records are unavailable and why such records are unavailable may be accepted in lieu of (3)(i)(E) and (3)(i)(F) of this paragraph.

An applicant for adjustment of status under this part is subject to the provisions of section 212(a)(15) of the Act relating to excludability of aliens likely to become public charges. Generally, the evidence of employment submitted under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section will serve to demonstrate the alien's financial responsibility during the documented period(s) of employment. If the alien's period(s) of residence in the United States include significant gaps in employment or if there is reason to believe that the alien may have received public assistance while employed, the alien may be required to provide proof that he or she has not received public cash assistance. An applicant for residence who is determined likely to become a public charge and is unable to overcome this determination after application of the special rule will be denied adjustment. The burden of proof to demonstrate the inapplicability of this provision of law lies with the applicant who may provide:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Evidence of a history of employment (i.e., employment letter, W-2 Forms, income tax returns, etc.);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Evidence that he/she is self-supporting (i.e., bank statements, stocks, other assets, etc.); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Form I-134, Affidavit of Support, completed by a spouse in behalf of the applicant and/or children of the applicant or a parent in behalf of children which guarantees complete or partial financial support. Acceptance of the affidavit of support shall be extended to other family members where family circumstances warrant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Burden of proof. An alien applying for adjustment of status under this part has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she has resided in the United States for the requisite periods, is admissible to the United States under the provisions of section 245a of the Act, and is otherwise eligible for adjustment of status under this section. The inference to be drawn from the documentation provided shall depend on the extent of the documentation, its credibility and amenability to verification as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Evidence. The sufficiency of all evidence produced by the applicant will be judged according to its probative value and credibility. To meet his or her burden of proof, an applicant must provide evidence of eligibility apart from his or her own testimony. In judging the probative value and credibility of the evidence submitted, greater weight will be given to the submission of original documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Filing of application. (1) The application must be filed on Form I-687 at an office of a designated entity or at a Service Legalization Office within the jurisdiction of the District wherein the applicant resides.

Copies of records maintained by parties other than the applicant which are submitted in evidence must be certified as true and correct by such parties and must bear their seal or signature or the signature and title of persons authorized to act in their behalf. If at the time of the interview the return of original documents is desired by the applicant, they must be accompanied by notarized copies or copies certified true and correct by a qualified designated entity or by the alien's representative in the format prescribed in Sec. 204.2(j)(1) or (2) of this chapter.

No personal checks or currency will be accepted. Fees will not be waived or refunded under any circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Filing date of application. The date the alien submits a completed application to a Service Legalization Office or designated entity shall be considered the filing date of the application, provided that in the case of an application filed at a designated entity the alien has consented to having the designated entity forward the application to the Service Legalization Office having jurisdiction over the location of the alien's residence. The designated entities are required to forward completed applications to the appropriate Service Legalization Office within sixty days of receipt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Selective Service registration.

An alien who has a consistent employment history which shows the ability to support himself or herself even though his or her income may be below the poverty level, may be admissible. The alien's employment history need not be continuous in that it is uninterrupted. It should be continuous in the sense that the alien shall be regularly attached to the workforce, has an income over a substantial period of the applicable time, and has demonstrated the capacity to exist on his or her income without recourse to public cash assistance. This regulation is prospective in that the Service shall determine, based on the alien's history, whether he or she is likely to become a public charge. Past acceptance of public cash assistance within a history of consistent employment will enter into this decision. The weight given in considering applicability of the public charge provisions will depend on many factors, but the length of time an applicant has received public cash assistance will constitute a significant factor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Public assistance and criminal history verification. Declarations by an applicant that he or she has not been the recipient of public cash assistance and/or has not had a criminal record are subject to a verification of facts by the Service. The applicant must agree to fully cooperate in the verification process.
