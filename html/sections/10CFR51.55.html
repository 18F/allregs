The environmental report must address the costs and benefits of severe accident mitigation design alternatives, and the bases for not incorporating severe accident mitigation design alternatives in the design to be certified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each applicant for an amendment to a design certification shall submit with its application a separate document entitled, ``Applicant's Supplemental Environmental Report--

Amendment to Standard Design Certification.'' The environmental report must address whether the design change which is the subject of the proposed amendment either renders a severe accident mitigation design alternative previously rejected in an environmental assessment to become cost beneficial, or results in the identification of new severe accident mitigation design alternatives that may be reasonably incorporated into the design certification.
