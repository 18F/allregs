No person shall be given  access to classified information unless a favorable determination has  been made as to the person's trustworthiness. The determination of  eligibility, referred to as a security clearance, shall be based on such  investigations as the Commission may require in accordance with the  applicable Office of Personnel Management standards and criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination of need-to-know. A person is not entitled to  receive classified information solely by virtue of having been granted a  security clearance. A person must also have a need for access to the  particular classified information sought in connection with the  performance of official government duties or contractual obligations.  The determination of that need shall be made by officials having  responsibility for the classified information.  [48 FR 15464, Apr. 11, 1983]</p>
