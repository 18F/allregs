                                Sec. 20.2031-6  Valuation of household and personal effects.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. The fair market value of the decedent's household  and personal effects is the price which a willing buyer would pay to a  willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and  both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. A room by room  itemization of household and personal effects is desirable. All the  articles should be named specifically, except that a number of articles  contained in the same room, none of which has a value in excess of $100,  may be grouped. A separate value should be given for each article named.  In lieu of an itemized list, the executor may furnish a written  statement, containing a declaration that it is made under penalties of  perjury, setting forth the aggregate value as appraised by a competent  appraiser or appraisers of recognized standing and ability, or by a  dealer or dealers in the class of personalty involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special rule in cases involving a substantial amount of valuable  articles. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this  section, if there are included among the household and personal effects  articles having marked artistic or intrinsic value of a total value in  excess of $3,000 (e.g., jewelry, furs, silverware, paintings, etchings,  engravings, antiques, books, statuary,   vases, oriental rugs, coin or stamp collections), the appraisal of an  expert or experts, under oath, shall be filed with the return. The  appraisal shall be accompanied by a written statement of the executor  containing a declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury  as to the completeness of the itemized list of such property and as to  the disinterested character and the qualifications of the appraiser or  appraisers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disposition of household effects prior to investigation. If it  is desired to effect distribution or sale of any portion of the  household or personal effects of the decedent in advance of an  investigation by an officer of the Internal Revenue Service, information  to that effect shall be given to the district director. The statement to  the district director shall be accompanied by an appraisal of such  property, under oath, and by a written statement of the executor,  containing a declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury,  regarding the completeness of the list of such property and the  qualifications of the appraiser, as heretofore described. If a personal  inspection by an officer of the Internal Revenue Service is not deemed  necessary, the executor will be so advised. This procedure is designed  to facilitate disposition of such property and to obviate future expense  and inconvenience to the estate by affording the district director an  opportunity to make an investigation should one be deemed necessary  prior to sale or distribution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional rules if an appraisal involved. If, pursuant to  paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, expert appraisers are  employed, care should be taken to see that they are reputable and of  recognized competency to appraise the particular class of property  involved. In the appraisal, books in sets by standard authors should be  listed in separate groups. In listing paintings having artistic value,  the size, subject, and artist's name should be stated. In the case of  oriental rugs, the size, make, and general condition should be given.  Sets of silverware should be listed in separate groups. Groups or  individuals pieces of silverware should be weighed and the weights given  in troy ounces. In arriving at the value of silverware, the appraisers  should take into consideration its antiquity, utility, desirability,  condition, and obsolescence.</p>
