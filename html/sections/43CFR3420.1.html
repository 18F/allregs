Sec. 3420.1-2  Call for coal resource and other resource information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Prior to or as part of the initiation or update of a land use plan or land use analysis, a Call for Coal and Other Resource Information shall be made to formally solicit indications of interest and information on coal resource development potential and on other resources which may be affected by coal development for lands in the planning unit. Industry, State and local governments and the general public may submit information on lands that should be considered for coal leasing, including statements describing why the lands should be considered for leasing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Proprietary data marked as confidential may be submitted in response to the Call for Coal and Other Resource Information, however, all such proprietary data shall be submitted to the authorized officer only. Data marked as confidential shall be treated in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the confidentiality of such information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The Call for Coal and Other Resource Information may be combined with the notice of intent to conduct land use planning published in accordance with Sec. 1601.3(g) of this title or with the issue identification process in accordance with part 1600 of this title. If the agency conducting land use planning is other than the Bureau of Land Management, that agency may combine the Call for Coal and Other Resource Information with its land use planning process at the appropriate step.

Sec. 3420.1-3  Special leasing opportunities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Secretary shall, under the procedures established in this subpart, including Sec. 3420.3 of this title, reserve and offer a reasonable number of lease tracts through competitive lease sales open only to a restricted class of potential bidders. Except for the limitation on bidding contained in paragraph (b) of this section, all requirements in this subpart apply equally to special leasing opportunities, including the requirement that coal be leased at its fair market value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Special leasing opportunities shall be provided for two classes of potential lessees:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Public bodies. (i) Only public bodies with a definite plan for producing energy for their own use or for their members or customers shall bid for leases designated as special leasing opportunities for public bodies. To qualify as a definite plan, a plan must

clearly state the intended use of the coal and have been approved by the governing board of the public body submitting the plan. In the event an electric generating station which will produce energy for the public body is either jointly owned with or participated in by others, or both, the definite plan shall assure that the public body's proportionate part of the energy produced is utilized pursuant to this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each public body shall submit the information specified in Sec. 3472.2-5(a) (1) and (2) of this title as part of its expression of leasing interest or upon submission of a bid if no expression of leasing interest is made. The information specified in Sec. 3472.2-5(a) (3) and (4) of this title shall be submitted within 60 days after submission of an expression of leasing interest or lease bid if no expression of leasing interest is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Secretary may designate, during the process of preparing a regional lease sale schedule, certain coal lease tracts for special leasing opportunities for public bodies only if a public body has submitted an expression of leasing interest under Sec. 3420.3-2, requesting that the procedures of this section apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Leases issued under this section to public bodies may be assigned only to other public bodies, or to a person who will mine the coal on behalf of and for the use of the public body, or to a person for the limited purpose of creating a security interest in favor of a lender who agrees to be obligated to mine the coal on behalf of the public body.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Small businesses. (i) When necessary to comply with the requirements of the Small Business Act, the Secretary shall designate a reasonable number of tracts for special leasing opportunities for businesses qualifying under 13 CFR part 121.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Leases issued under this section may be assigned only to other small businesses qualifying under 13 CFR part 121.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Potential lessees qualifying for special leasing opportunities may participate in competitive lease sales not designated as special leasing opportunities and shall not be required to submit the evidence and information required specifically for a special leasing opportunity to participate.

Sec. 3420.1-4  General requirements for land use planning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Secretary may not hold a lease sale under this part unless the lands containing the coal deposits are included in a comprehensive land use plan or land use analysis. The land use plan or land use analysis will be conducted with public notice and opportunity for participation at the points specified in Sec. 1610.2(f) of this title. The sale must be compatible with, and subject to, any relevant stipulations, guidelines, and standards set out in that plan or analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> The Bureau of Land Management shall prepare comprehensive land use plans and land use analyses for lands it administers in conformance with 43 CFR part 1600.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Bureau of Land Management shall prepare comprehensive land use plans and land use analyses for lands it administers in conformance with 43 CFR part 1600.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Department of Agriculture or any other Federal agency with surface management authority over lands subject to leasing shall prepare comprehensive land use plans or land use analyses for lands it administers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Secretary may lease in any area where it is found either that there is no Federal interest in the surface or that the coal deposits in an area are insufficient to justify the costs of a Federal land use plan upon completion of a land use analysis in accordance with this section and 43 CFR part 1600.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In an area of Federal lands not covered by a completed comprehensive land use plan or scheduled for comprehensive land use planning, a member of the public may request the appropriate Bureau of Land Management State Office to prepare a land use analysis for coal related uses of the land as provided for in this group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A comprehensive land use plan or land use analysis shall contain an estimate of the amount of coal recoverable by either surface or underground mining operations or both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The major land use planning decision concerning the coal resource shall

be the identification of areas acceptable for further consideration for leasing which shall be identified by the screening procedures listed below:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Only those areas that have development potential may be identified as acceptable for further consideration for leasing. The Bureau of Land Management shall estimate coal development potential for the surface management agency. Coal companies, State and local governments and the general public are encouraged to submit information to the Bureau of Land Management at any time in connection with such development potential determinations. Coal companies, State and local governments and members of the general public may also submit nonconfidential coal geology and economic data during the inventory phase of planning to the surface management agency conducting the land use planning. Where such information is determined to indicate development potential for an area, the area may be included in the land use planning for evaluation for coal leasing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Bureau of Land Management or the surface managing agency conducting the land use planning shall, using the unsuitability criteria and procedures set out in subpart 3461 of this title, review Federal lands to assess where there are areas unsuitable for all or certain stipulated methods of mining. The unsuitability assessment shall be consistent with any decision of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement to designate lands unsuitable or to terminate a designation in response to a petition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Multiple land use decisions shall be made which may eliminate additional coal deposits from further consideration for leasing to protect other resource values and land uses that are locally, regionally or nationally important or unique and that are not included in the unsuitability criteria discussed in paragraph (e) of this section. Such values and uses include, but are not limited to, those identified in section 522(a)(3) of the Surface Mining Reclamation and Control Act of 1977 and as defined in 30 CFR 762.5. In making these multiple use decisions, the Bureau of Land Management or the surface management agency conducting the land use planning shall place particular emphasis on protecting the following: Air and water quality; wetlands, riparian areas and sole-source aquifers; the Federal lands which, if leased, would adversely impact units of the National Park System, the National Wildlife Refuge System, the National System of Trails, and the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(i)</em> While preparing a comprehensive land use plan or land use analysis, the Bureau of Land Management shall consult with all surface owners who meet the criteria in paragraphs (gg) (1) and (2) of Sec. 3400.0-5 of this title, and whose lands overlie coal deposits, to determine preference for or against mining by other than underground mining techniques.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> While preparing a comprehensive land use plan or land use analysis, the Bureau of Land Management shall consult with all surface owners who meet the criteria in paragraphs (gg) (1) and (2) of Sec. 3400.0-5 of this title, and whose lands overlie coal deposits, to determine preference for or against mining by other than underground mining techniques.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For the purposes of this paragraph, any surface owner who has previously granted written consent to any party to mine by other than underground mining techniques shall be deemed to have expressed a preference in favor of mining. Where a significant number of surface owners in an area have expressed a preference against mining those deposits by other than underground mining techniques, that area shall be considered acceptable for further consideration only for development by underground mining techniques. In addition, the area may be considered acceptable for further consideration for leasing for development by other than underground techniques if there are no acceptable alternative areas available to meet the regional leasing level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An area eliminated from further consideration by this subsection may be considered acceptable for further consideration for leasing for mining by other than underground mining techniques if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The number of surface owners who have expressed their preference against mining by other than underground techniques is reduced below a significant number because such surface owners have given written consent for such mining or have transferred ownership to unqualified surface owners; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The land use plan is amended accordingly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> In its review of cumulative impacts of coal development, the regional coal team shall consider any threshold analysis performed during land-use planning as required by Sec. 1610.4-4 of this title and shall apply this analysis, where appropriate, to the region as a whole.

Sec. 3420.1-5  Hearing requirements.</p><p class="depth0">After public notice, the Bureau of Land Management or other surface management agency shall conduct a public hearing on the proposed comprehensive land use plan or land use analysis if it involves the potential for coal leasing before it is adopted if such a hearing is requested by any person who is or may be adversely affected by the adoption of the plan. A hearing conducted under part 1600 of this title of this chapter shall fulfill this requirement.
[47 FR 33137, July 30, 1982]


Sec. 3420.1-6  Consultation with Federal surface management agencies.</p><p class="depth0">Where a Federal surface management agency other than the Bureau of Land Management administers limited areas overlying Federal coal within the boundaries of a comprehensive land use plan or land use analysis being prepared by the Bureau of Land Management, or where the Bureau of Land Management manages lands on which coal development may impact land units of other Federal agencies, the Bureau of Land Management shall consult with the other agency to jointly determine the acceptability for further consideration for leasing of the potentially impacted lands the other agency administers or lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management that may impact lands of another agency.
[52 FR 46473, Dec. 8, 1987]


Sec. 3420.1-7  Consultation with states and Indian tribes.</p><p class="depth0">Before adopting a comprehensive land use plan or land use analysis that makes an assessment of lands acceptable for further consideration for leasing, the Bureau of Land Management or other surface management agency shall consult with the state Governor and the state agency charged with the responsibility for maintaining the state's unsuitability program (43 CFR 3461.4-1). Where a tribal government administers areas within or near the boundaries of a comprehensive land use plan or land use analysis being prepared by the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau shall consult with the tribal government.

Sec. 3420.1-8  Identification of lands as acceptable for further consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Identification of lands as acceptable for further consideration for leasing will be made in the adoption of a comprehensive land use plan or land use analysis. Any lands identified as acceptable may be further considered for leasing under Sec. 3420.3 of this title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Activity planning shall begin with a regional coal team meeting to review market analyses and land-use planning summaries. The market analyses and land-use planning summaries shall be avaiable at least 45 days prior to such meeting.
