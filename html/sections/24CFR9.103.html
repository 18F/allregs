                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of this part:</p><p class="depth0">Accessible: (1) When used with respect to the design, construction, or alteration of a facility or a portion of a facility other than an individual dwelling unit, means that the facility or portion of the facility when designed, constructed or altered, complies with applicable accessibility standards and can be approached, entered, and used by individuals with physical disabilities. The phrase ``accessible to and usable by'' is synonymous with accessible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When used with respect to the design, construction, or alteration of an individual dwelling unit, means that the unit is located on an accessible route and, when designed, constructed, altered or adapted, complies with applicable accessibility standards, and can be approached, entered, and used by individuals with physical disabilities. A unit that is on an accessible route and is adaptable and otherwise in compliance with the standards set forth in Sec. 9.151 is ``accessible'' within the meaning of this definition. When a unit in an existing facility which is

being made accessible as a result of alterations is intended for use by a specific qualified individual with disabilities (e.g., a current occupant of such unit or of another unit under the control of the same agency, or an applicant on a waiting list), the unit will be deemed accessible if it meets the requirements of applicable standards that address the particular disability or impairment of such person.</p><p class="depth0">Accessible route means a continuous unobstructed path connecting accessible elements and spaces of a building or facility.
