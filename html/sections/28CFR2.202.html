If the supervision officer believes that any

special condition of supervised release should be imposed prior to the release of the prisoner, the officer shall forward a request for such condition to the Commission. The Commission may, upon such request or of its own accord, impose any special condition in addition to the standard conditions specified in Sec.  2.204, which shall take effect on the day the prisoner is released.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon the release of the prisoner, the responsible prison officials shall instruct the prisoner, in writing, to report to the assigned supervision office within 72 hours, and shall inform the prisoner that failure to report on time shall constitute a violation of supervised release. If the prisoner is released to the custody of other authorities, the prisoner shall be instructed to report to the supervision office within 72 hours after his release from the physical custody of such authorities. If the prisoner is unable to report to the supervision office within 72 hours of release because of an emergency, the prisoner shall be instructed to report to the nearest U.S. Probation Office and obey the instructions given by the duty officer.</p>
