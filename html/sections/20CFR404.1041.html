                                Sec. 404.1041  Wages.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The term wages means remuneration paid to you as an employee for  employment unless specifically excluded. Wages are counted in  determining your entitlement to retirement, survivors', and disability  insurance benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you are paid wages, it is not important what they are called.  Salaries, fees, bonuses and commissions on sales or on insurance  premiums are wages if they are remuneration paid for employment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The way in which you are paid is unimportant. Wages may be paid  on the basis of piecework or a percentage of the profits. Wages may be  paid on an hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis. (See  Sec. 404.1056 for special rules for agricultural labor.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Your wages can be in any form. You can be paid in cash or  something other than cash, for example, in goods or clothing. (See  paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section for kinds of employment where  cash payments alone are considered wages and Sec. 404.1043(b) concerning  the value of meals and lodging as wages.) If your employer pays you cash  for your meals and lodging on a regular basis as part of your  employment, these payments may be considered wages. Payments other than  cash may be counted as wages on the basis of the fair value of the items  when paid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In certain kinds of employment, cash payments alone count as  wages. These types of employment are agricultural labor, domestic  services, and services not in the course of the employer's trade or  business.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> To count as wages, payments for services performed by home  workers who are employees as described in Sec. 404.1008(d) must be in  cash and must amount to $100 or more in a calendar year. Once this cash  pay test is met, all remuneration paid, whether in cash or kind, is also  wages.  [45 FR 20075, Mar. 27, 1980, as amended at 55 FR 7309, Mar. 1, 1990]</p>
