The authorized officer may, pursuant to Sec. 251.56 of  this subpart, impose in that authorization such terms and conditions as  are deemed necessary or appropriate and   may require changes to the temporary occupancy to conform to those terms  and conditions. Those temporarily occupying National Forest System lands  without a special use authorization assume liability, and must indemnify  the United States, for all injury, loss, or damage arising in connection  with the temporary occupancy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A special use authorization is not required for noncommercial  recreational activities, such as camping, picnicking, hiking, fishing,  boating, hunting, and horseback riding, or for noncommercial activities  involving the expression of views, such as assemblies, meetings,  demonstrations, and parades, unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The proposed use is a noncommercial group use as defined in  Sec. 251.51 of this subpart;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The proposed use is still photography as defined in Sec. 251.51  of this subpart; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Authorization of that use is required by an order issued under  Sec. 261.50 or by a regulation issued under Sec. 261.70 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Travel on any National Forest System road shall comply with all  Federal and State laws governing the road to be used and does not  require a special use authorization, unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The travel is for the purpose of engaging in a noncommercial  group use, outfitting or guiding, a recreation event, commercial  filming, or still photography, as defined in Sec. 251.51 of this  subpart, or for a landowner's ingress or egress across National Forest  System lands that requires travel on a National Forest System road that  is not authorized for general public use under Sec. 251.110(d) of this  part; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Authorization of that use is required by an order issued under  Sec. 261.50 or by a regulation issued under Sec. 261.70 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For proposed uses other than a noncommercial group use, a  special use authorization is not required if, based upon review of a  proposal, the authorized officer determines that the proposed use has  one or more of the following characteristics:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The proposed use will have such nominal effects on National  Forest System lands, resources, or programs that it is not necessary to  establish terms and conditions in a special use authorization to protect  National Forest System lands and resources or to avoid conflict with  National Forest System programs or operations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The proposed use is regulated by a State agency or another  Federal agency in a manner that is adequate to protect National Forest  System lands and resources and to avoid conflict with National Forest  System programs or operations; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The proposed use is not situated in a congressionally designated  wilderness area, and is a routine operation or maintenance activity  within the scope of a statutory right-of-way for a highway pursuant to  R.S. 2477 (43 U.S.C. 932, repealed Oct. 21, 1976) or for a ditch or  canal pursuant to R.S. 2339 (43 U.S.C. 661, as amended), or the proposed  use is a routine operation or maintenance activity within the express  scope of a documented linear right-of-way.
