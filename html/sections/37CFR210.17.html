Each Annual Statement of Account shall be served on the  copyright owner or the agent to whom or which it is directed by mail, by  reputable courier service, or by electronic delivery as set forth in  paragraph (g)(2) of this section on or before the 20th day of the sixth  month following the end of the fiscal year covered by the Annual  Statement. It shall not be necessary to file a copy of the Annual  Statement in the Copyright Office.

The Annual Statement and payment  may be sent together or separately, but if sent separately, the payment  must include information reasonably sufficient to allow the payee to  match the Annual Statement and the payment. The delivery of such sum  does not require the copyright owner to accept such sum, or to forego  any right, relief, or remedy which may be available under law. In any  case where the amount required to be stated in the Annual Statement of  Account under   paragraph (c)(6) of this section is less than the amount stated in that  Annual Statement under paragraph (c)(7) of this section, the difference  between such amounts shall be available to the compulsory licensee as a  credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In any case where an Annual Statement of Account is sent by  mail or by reputable courier service and is returned to the sender  because the copyright owner or agent is no longer located at that  address or has refused to accept delivery, or the Annual Statement of  Account is sent by electronic mail and is undeliverable, or in any case  where an address for the copyright owner is not known, the Annual  Statement of Account, together with any evidence of mailing or attempted  delivery by courier service or electronic mail, may be filed in the  Licensing Division of the Copyright Office. Any Annual Statement of  Account submitted for filing shall be accompanied by a brief statement  of the reason why it was not served on the copyright owner. A written  acknowledgment of receipt and filing will be provided to the sender.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Copyright Office will not accept any royalty fees submitted  with Annual Statements of Account under paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Neither the filing of an Annual Statement of Account in the  Copyright Office, nor the failure to file such Annual Statement, shall  have any effect other than that which may be attributed to it by a court  of competent jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> No filing fee will be required in the case of Annual Statements  of Account submitted to the Copyright Office under paragraph (g)(5)(i)  of this section. Upon request and payment of the fee specified in Sec.   201.3(e) of this chapter, a Certificate of Filing will be provided to  the sender.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If an Annual Statement of Account is sent by certified mail or  registered mail, a mailing receipt shall be sufficient to prove that  service was timely. If an Annual Statement of Account is sent by a  reputable courier, documentation from the courier showing the first date  of attempted delivery shall be sufficient to prove that service was  timely. If an Annual Statement of Account or a link thereto is sent by  electronic mail, a return receipt shall be sufficient to prove that  service was timely. In the absence of the foregoing, the compulsory  licensee shall bear the burden of proving that the Annual Statement of  Account was served in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Annual Statements for periods before the effective date of this  regulation. If a copyright owner did not receive an Annual Statement of  Account from a compulsory licensee for any fiscal year ending after  March 1, 2009 and before November 17, 2014, the copyright owner may, at  any time before May 17, 2015, make a request in writing to that  compulsory licensee requesting an Annual Statement of Account for the  relevant fiscal year conforming to the requirements of this section. If  such a request is made, the compulsory licensee shall provide the Annual  Statement of Account within 6 months after receiving the request. If  such a circumstance and request applies to more than one of the  compulsory licensee's fiscal years, such years may be combined on a  single statement.
