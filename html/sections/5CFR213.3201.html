Appointments under this authority are subject to the basic qualification standards established by the Office of Personnel Management for the occupation and grade level. Positions filled under this authority are excepted from the competitive service and constitute Schedule B. For each authorization under this section, OPM shall assign a number from 213.3202 through 213.3299 to be used by the appointing agency in recording appointments made under that authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]
