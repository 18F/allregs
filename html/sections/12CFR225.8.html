                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This section establishes capital planning and prior  notice and approval requirements for capital distributions by certain  bank holding companies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Scope and reservation of authority--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicability. Except as  provided in paragraph (c) of this section, this section applies to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any top-tier bank holding company domiciled in the United States  with average total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more ($50  billion asset threshold);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any other bank holding company domiciled in the United States  that is made subject to this section, in whole or in part, by order of  the Board;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any U.S. intermediate holding company subject to this section  pursuant to 12 CFR 252.153; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any nonbank financial company supervised by the Board that is  made subject to this section pursuant to a rule or order of the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Average total consolidated assets. For purposes of this section,  average total consolidated assets means the average of the total  consolidated assets as reported by a bank holding company on its  Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (FR Y-9C)  for the four most recent consecutive quarters. If the bank holding  company has not filed the FR Y-9C for each of the four most recent  consecutive quarters, average total consolidated assets means the  average of the company's total consolidated assets, as reported on the  company's FR Y-9C, for the most recent quarter or consecutive quarters,  as applicable. Average total consolidated assets are measured on the as- of date of the most recent FR Y-9C used in the calculation of the  average.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ongoing applicability. A bank holding company (including any  successor bank holding company) that is subject to any requirement in  this section shall remain subject to any such requirement unless and  until its total consolidated assets fall below $50 billion for each of  four consecutive quarters, as reported on the FR Y-9C and effective on  the as-of date of the fourth consecutive FR Y-9C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reservation of authority. Nothing in this section shall limit  the authority of the Federal Reserve to issue a capital directive or  take any other supervisory or enforcement action, including an action to  address unsafe or unsound practices or conditions or violations of law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Rule of construction. Unless the context otherwise requires, any  reference to bank holding company in this section shall include a U.S.  intermediate holding company and shall include a nonbank financial  company supervised by the Board to the extent this section is made  applicable pursuant to a rule or order of the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Transitional arrangements--</p><p

paragraph  (c)(1)(i) of this section to comply with any or all of the requirements  in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(3), (f), or (g) of this section if the Board  or appropriate Reserve Bank with concurrence
