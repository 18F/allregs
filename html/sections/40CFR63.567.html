The owner or operator of an affected source shall fulfill all notification requirements in Sec. 63.9 of subpart A of this part in accordance with the provisions for applicability of that section to this subpart in Table 1 of Sec. 63.560 and the notification requirements in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicability. If a source that otherwise would not be subject to the emissions standards subsequently increases its HAP emissions calculated on a 24-month annual average basis after September 19, 1997 or increases its annual HAP emissions after September 20, 1999 or subsequently increases its gasoline or crude loading throughput calculated on a 24-month annual average basis after September 19, 1996 or increases its gasoline or crude loading annual throughput after September 21, 1998 such that the source becomes subject to the emissions standards, such source shall be subject to the notification requirements of Sec. 63.9 of subpart A of this part and the notification requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Initial notification for sources with startup before the effective date. The owner or operator of a source with initial startup before the effective date shall notify the Administrator in writing that the source is subject to the relevant standard.

An owner or operator who is required to submit excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance and summary reports on a semi-annual basis may reduce the frequency of reporting to annual if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For 1 full year the sources's excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance reports continually demonstrate that the source is in compliance; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator continues to comply with all recordkeeping and monitoring requirements specified in this subpart and subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The frequency of reporting of excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance and summary reports required may be reduced

only after the owner or operator notifies the Administrator in writing of his or her intention to make such a change and the Administrator does not object to the intended change. In deciding whether to approve a reduced frequency of reporting, the Administrator may review information concerning the source's entire previous performance history during the 5-year recordkeeping prior to the intended change, including performance test results, monitoring data, and evaluations of an owner or operator's conformance with operation maintenance requirements. Such information may be used by the Administrator to make a judgement about the source's potential for noncompliance in the future. If the Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing within 45 days after receiving notice of the owner or operator's intention. The notification from the Administrator to the owner or operator will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is based. In the absence of a notice of disapproval within 45 days, approval is automatically granted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Content and submittal dates for excess emissions and monitoring system performance reports. All excess emissions and monitoring system performance reports and all summary reports, if required per paragraph (e)(5) and (6) of this section, shall be delivered or postmarked within 30 days following the end of each calendar year, or within 30 days following the end of each six month period, if appropriate.
