                                Sec. 404.451  Penalty deductions for failure to report within prescribed or not having  care of a child.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Penalty for failure to report. If an individual (or the person  receiving benefits on his behalf) fails to comply with the reporting  obligations of Sec. 404.450 within the time specified in Sec. 404.450  and it is found that good cause for such failure does not exist (see  Sec. 404.454), a penalty deduction is made from the individual's  benefits in addition to the deduction described in Sec. 404.417  (relating to noncovered remunerative activity outside the United States)  or Sec. 404.421 (relating to failure to have care of a child).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determining amount of penalty deduction. The amount of the  penalty deduction for failure to report noncovered remunerative activity  outside the United States or not having care of a child within the  prescribed time is determined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> First failure to make timely report. The penalty deduction for  the first failure to make a timely report is an amount equal to the  individual's benefit or benefits for the first month for   which the deduction event was not reported timely.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Second failure to make timely report. The penalty deduction for  the second failure to make a timely report is an amount equal to twice  the amount of the individual's benefit or benefits for the first month  for which the deduction event in the second failure period was not  reported timely.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subsequent failures to make timely reports. The penalty  deduction for the third or subsequent failure to file a timely report is  an amount equal to three times the amount of the individual's benefit or  benefits for the first month for which the deduction event in the third  failure period was not reported timely.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determining whether a failure to file a timely report is first,  second, third, or subsequent failure--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Failure period. A failure  period runs from the date of one delinquent report (but initially  starting with the date of entitlement to monthly benefits) to the date  of the next succeeding delinquent report, excluding the date of the  earlier report and including the date of the later report. The failure  period includes each month for which succeeding delinquent report,  excluding a report becomes overdue during a failure period, but it does  not include any month for which a report is not yet overdue on the  ending date of such period. If good cause (see Sec. 404.454) is found  for the entire period, the period is not regarded as a failure period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> First failure. When no penalty deduction under paragraph (b) of  this section has previously been imposed against the beneficiary for  failure to report noncovered remunerative activity outside the United  States or for failure to report not having care of a child, the earliest  month in the first failure period for which a report is delinquent and  for which good cause (see Sec. 404.454) for failure to make the required  report is not found is considered to be the first failure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Second failure. After one penalty deduction under paragraph (b)  of this section has been imposed against the beneficiary, the first  month for which a report is delinquent in the second failure period is  considered to be the second failure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Third and subsequent failures. After a second penalty deduction  under paragraph (b) of this section has been imposed against the  beneficiary, the first month for which a report is delinquent in the  third failure period is considered to be the third failure. Subsequent  failures will be determined in the same manner.</p><p class="depth3">Example: M became entitled in January 1966 to mother's benefits;  these benefits are not payable for any month in which the mother does  not have a child in her care. M accepted benefits for each month from  January 1966 through June 1967. In July 1967 she reported that she had  not had a child in her care in January 1967. As she was not eligible for  a benefit for any month in which she did not have a child in her care,  M's July 1967 benefit was withheld to recover the overpayment she had  received for January 1967, and the next payment she received was for  August 1967. No penalty was imposed for her failure to make a timely  report of the deduction event that occurred in January 1967 because it  was determined that good cause existed.</p><p class="depth3">In March 1968 M reported that she had not had a child in her care in  September or October 1967; however, she had accepted benefit payments  for each month from August 1967 through February 1968. Her benefits for  March and April 1968 were withheld to recover the overpayment for  September and October 1967. Also, it was determined that good cause was  not present for M's failure to make a timely report of the deduction  event that had occurred in September 1967. A penalty equal to her  benefit for September 1967 was deducted from M's May 1968 payment since  this was her first failure to report not having a child in her care.  Payments to her then were continued.</p><p class="depth3">On November 4, 1968, it was learned that M had not had a child in  her care in November 1967 or in June, July, or August 1968 although she  had accepted benefits for June through October 1968. Consequently, M's  benefits for November 1968 through February 1969 were withheld to  recover the 4 months' overpayment she received for months in which she  did not have a child in her care. In addition, it was determined that  good cause was not present for M's failure to report the deduction  events, and a penalty was imposed equal to twice the amount of M's  benefit for the month of June 1968. This was M's second failure to  report not having a child in her care. No further penalty applied for  November 1967 because that month was included in M's first-failure  period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Penalty deductions imposed under Sec. 404.453 not considered. A  failure to   make a timely report of earnings as required by Sec. 404.452 for which a  penalty deduction is imposed under Sec. 404.453 is not counted as a  failure to report in determining the first or subsequent failure to  report noncovered remunerative activity outside the United States or not  having care of a child.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limitation on amount of penalty deduction. Notwithstanding the  provisions described in paragraph (b) of this section, the amount of the  penalty deduction imposed for failure to make a timely report of  noncovered remunerative activity outside the United States or for  failure to report not having care of a child may not exceed the number  of months in that failure period for which the individual received and  accepted a benefit and for which a deduction is imposed by reason of his  noncovered remunerative activity outside the United States or failure to  have care of a child. (See Sec. 404.458 for other limitations on the  amount of the penalty deduction.)  [38 FR 3596, Feb. 8, 1973, as amended at 38 FR 9430, Apr. 16, 1973]</p>
