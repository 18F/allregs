                                Sec. 63.3151  How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">You must separately calculate the mass average organic HAP content  of the materials used during the initial compliance period for each  group of materials for which an emission limit is established in Sec.  63.3090(c) and (d) or Sec. 63.3091(c) and (d). If every individual  material used within a group of materials meets the emission limit for  that group of materials, you may demonstrate compliance with that  emission limit by documenting the name and the organic HAP content of  each material used during the initial compliance period. If any  individual material used within a group of materials exceeds the  emission limit for that group of materials, you must determine the mass  average organic HAP content according to the procedures of paragraph (d)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> and (ii) of this section when  performing a Method 311 test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Count each organic HAP that is measured to be present at 0.1  percent by mass or more for OSHA-defined carcinogens, as specified in 29  CFR 1910.1200(d)(4), and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other  compounds. For example, if toluene (not an OSHA carcinogen) is measured  to be 0.5 percent of the material by mass, you do not have to count it.  Express the mass fraction of each organic HAP you count as a value  truncated to four places after the decimal point (e.g., 0.3791).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Calculate the total mass fraction of organic HAP in the test  material by adding up the individual organic HAP mass fractions and  truncating the result to three places after the decimal point (e.g.,  0.7638 truncates to 0.763).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Method 24 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 60). For coatings, you may  use Method 24 to determine the mass fraction of nonaqueous volatile  matter and use that value as a substitute for mass fraction of organic  HAP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Alternative method. You may use an alternative test method for  determining the mass fraction of organic HAP once the Administrator has  approved it. You must follow the procedure in Sec. 63.7(f) to submit an  alternative test method for approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em>, and at 1.0 percent  by mass or more for other compounds. For example, if toluene (not an  OSHA carcinogen) is 0.5 percent of the material by mass, you do not have  to count it. If there is a disagreement between such information and  results of a test conducted according to paragraphs (a)(1) through (3)  of this section, then the test method results will take precedence,  unless after consultation, the facility demonstrates to the satisfaction  of the enforcement authority that the facility's data are correct.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Solvent blends. Solvent blends may be listed as single  components for some materials in data provided by manufacturers or  suppliers. Solvent blends may contain organic HAP which must be counted  toward the total organic HAP mass fraction of the materials. When  neither test data nor manufacturer's data for solvent blends are  available, you may use the default values for the mass fraction of  organic HAP in the solvent blends listed in Table 3 or 4 to this  subpart. If you use the tables, you must use the values in Table 3 for  all solvent blends that match Table 3 entries, and you may only use  Table 4 if the solvent blends in the materials you use do not match any  of the solvent blends in Table 3 and you only know whether the blend is  aliphatic or aromatic. However, if the results of a Method 311 test  indicate higher values   than those listed on Table 3 or 4 to this subpart, the Method 311  results will take precedence, unless after consultation, the facility  demonstrates to the satisfaction of the enforcement authority that the  data from Table 3 or 4 are correct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determine the density of each material used. Determine the  density of each material used during the compliance period from test  results using ASTM Method D1475-98 (Reapproved 2003), ``Standard Test  Method for Density of Liquid Coatings, Inks, and Related Products''  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14), or for powder coatings,  test method A or test method B of ASTM Method D5965-02, ``Standard Test  Methods for Specific Gravity of Coating Powders,'' (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 63.14), or information from the supplier or  manufacturer of the material. If there is disagreement between ASTM  Method D1475-98 (Reapproved 2003) test results or ASTM Method D5965-02,  test method A or test method B test results and the supplier's or  manufacturer's information, the test results will take precedence unless  after consultation, the facility demonstrates to the satisfaction of the  enforcement authority that the facility's data are correct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determine the volume of each material used. Determine the volume  (liters) of each material used during each month by measurement or usage  records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>, using Equations 1 and 2 of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Calculate the mass average organic HAP content of adhesive and  sealer materials other than components of the glass bonding system used  in the initial compliance period using Equation 1 of this section: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26AP04.034  Where:  Cavg, as = Mass average organic HAP content of adhesives and</p><p class="depth3">sealer materials used, kg/kg. Vol as, j = Volume of adhesive or sealer material, j, used,</p><p class="depth3">liters. D as, j = Density of adhesive or sealer material, j, used, kg</p><p class="depth3">per liter. W as, j = Mass fraction of organic HAP in adhesive or sealer</p><p class="depth3">material, j, kg/kg. r = Number of adhesive and sealer materials used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Calculate the mass average organic HAP content of deadener  materials used in the initial compliance period using Equation 2 of this  section: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26AP04.035  Where:  C avg, d = Mass average organic HAP content of deadener</p><p class="depth3">material used, kg/kg.   Vol d, m = Volume of deadener material, m, used, liters. D d, m = Density of deadener material, m, used, kg per liter. W d, m = Mass fraction of organic HAP in deadener material,</p><p class="depth3">m, kg/kg. s = Number of deadener materials used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Compliance demonstration. The mass average organic HAP content  for the compliance period must be less than or equal to the applicable  emission limit in Sec. 63.3090(c) and (d) or Sec. 63.3091(c) and (d).  You must keep all records as required by Sec. Sec. 63.3130 and 63.3131.  As part of the Notification of Compliance Status required by Sec.  63.3110, you must submit a statement that the coating operations were in  compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance  period because the mass average organic HAP content was less than or  equal to the applicable emission limits in Sec. 63.3090(c) and (d) or  Sec. 63.3091(c) and (d), determined according to this section.</p>
