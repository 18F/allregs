                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. An SOW describes the work or services a contractor is to perform in reaching an end result without describing the method that the contractor shall use, unless the method of performance is critical or required in order to obtain successful performance. An SOW shall be clear and concise; completely define the responsibilities of both the contractor and the Government; and be worded to make misinterpretation virtually impossible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Term (level of effort)form and completion form SOWs. Term-form (level of effort) SOWs essentially require the furnishing of technical effort, which may include a report thereof, while completion-form SOWs require development of tangible items designed to meet specific performance and/or design characteristics--see FAR 16.306(d) for this distinction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Term (or level of effort). A term or level of effort-form SOW is appropriate for research where the objective is to discover the feasibility of later development or to gather general information. A term or level of effort-form SOW specifies that some number of labor hours be expended on a particular course of research or that a certain number of tests be run, without reference to any intended conclusion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Completion. A completion-form SOW is appropriate for development work where the feasibility of producing an end item is already known. A completion-form SOW may describe what is to be achieved through the contracted effort, such as development of new methods, new end items, or other tangible results.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Phasing. Individual research, development, or demonstration projects frequently lie well beyond the present state of the art and entail procedures and techniques of great complexity and difficulty. Under these circumstances, a contractor, no matter how carefully selected, may be unable to deliver the desired result. Moreover, the job of evaluating the contractor's progress is often difficult. Such a contract is frequently phased and often divided into stages of accomplishment, each of which the contractor must complete and the Contracting Officer approve before the contractor may proceed to the next phase or stage. Phasing makes it necessary to develop methods and controls, including reporting requirements for each phase of the contract and criteria for evaluation of the report submitted, that will provide, at the earliest possible time, appropriate data for making decisions relative to future phases. A phased contract, such as one for an R & D or demonstration project,

may include stages of accomplishment. Within each phase, there may be a number of tasks that the SOW should include. When phases of work can be identified, the SOW shall provide for phasing and the solicitation shall require offerors to submit proposed costs by phases. The resultant contract shall reflect costs by phases, require the contractor to identify incurred costs by phases, establish delivery schedules by phase, and require the written acceptance of each phase. The Contracting Officer shall not allow contractors to incur costs for phases that are dependent upon successful completion of earlier phases until the Contracting Officer provides written acceptance of the prior work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Elements of the SOW. The elements of the SOW may vary with the objective, complexity, size, and nature of the acquisition. In general, the SOW shall include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Purpose of the project. This includes a general description of the objectives of the project and the desired results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Background information. This includes a brief history of the project and the importance of the project to the overall program objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A detailed description of the technical requirements. The SOW shall provide sufficient detail to accurately reflect the Government's requirement. It shall state what is to be accomplished without prescribing the method the contractor is to use and shall include performance standards, if applicable. See 307.104(b)(2) and FAR 37.602 for guidance on preparation of a PWS. An SOW may include tasks and subtasks. The degree of breakout depends on the size and complexity of the project. An SOW shall indicate whether the tasks are sequential or concurrent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reference material. This includes an explanation of all reference material a contractor needs to carry out the project; the applicability of the reference material; and a statement as to where potential offerors can obtain the material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Level of effort. When a level of effort is necessary, the SOW shall specify the number and type of personnel required, if known, and the type and degree of expertise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Special requirements (as applicable). This includes providing, in a separate section, any unusual or special contractual requirements that may affect performance. For example, the SOW shall specify separately the work requirements to implement information security management requirements--see 339.71 for additional information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Deliverables and reporting requirements. This includes clearly and completely describing all deliverables and reports, including the time frame for completion, the format, and the required number of copies.</p>
