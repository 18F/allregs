If such manufacturer promptly files the required documentation with the appropriate TTB officer, an administrator, executor, receiver, trustee, assignee, or other fiduciary successor may liquidate the business without qualifying as a manufacturer. The manufacturer must promptly file with

the appropriate TTB officer a statement of the intent to liquidate and furnish a certified copy of the order of the court, or other pertinent documents. These documents must show the appointment and qualification of any administrator, executor, receiver, trustee, assignee, or other fiduciary, together with an extension of coverage of the predecessor's bond executed by the administrator, executor, receiver, trustee, assignee, or other fiduciary and the surety, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 40.407. The predecessor shall make a closing inventory and closing report in accordance with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 40.434 and 40.426, respectively, and the successor shall make an opening inventory and opening report, in accordance with the provision of Sec. Sec. 40.432 and 40.423, respectively.
