                                Sec.  146.66  Logging, sampling, and testing prior to new well
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> During the drilling and construction of a new Class I hazardous  waste injection well, appropriate logs and tests shall be run to  determine or verify the depth, thickness, porosity, permeability, and  rock type of, and the salinity of any entrained fluids in, all relevant  geologic units to assure conformance with performance standards in Sec.   146.65, and to establish accurate baseline data against which future  measurements may be compared. A descriptive report interpreting results  of such logs and tests shall be prepared by a knowledgeable log analyst  and submitted to the Director. At a minimum, such logs and tests shall  include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Deviation checks during drilling on all holes constructed by  drilling a pilot hole which are enlarged by reaming or another method.  Such checks shall be at sufficiently frequent intervals to determine the  location of the borehole and to assure that vertical avenues for fluid  movement in the form of diverging holes are not created during drilling;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such other logs and tests as may be needed after taking into  account the availability of similar data in the area of the drilling  site, the construction plan, and the need for additional information  that may arise from time to time as the construction of the well  progresses. At a minimum, the following logs shall be required in the  following situations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Upon installation of the surface casing:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Resistivity, spontaneous potential, and caliper logs before the  casing is installed; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A cement bond and variable density log, and a temperature log  after the casing is set and cemented.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Upon installation of the long string casing:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Resistivity, spontaneous potential, porosity, caliper, gamma  ray, and fracture finder logs before the casing is installed; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A cement bond and variable density log, and a temperature log  after the casing is set and cemented.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Director may allow the use of an alternative to the above  logs when an alternative will provide equivalent or better information;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A mechanical integrity test consisting of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A pressure test with liquid or gas;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A radioactive tracer survey;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A temperature or noise log;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A casing inspection log, if required by the Director; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any other test required by the Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whole cores or sidewall cores of the confining and injection  zones and formation fluid samples from the injection zone shall be  taken. The Director may accept cores from nearby wells if the owner or  operator can demonstrate that core retrieval is not possible and that  such cores are representative of conditions at the well. The Director  may require the owner or operator to core other formations in the  borehole.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The fluid temperature, pH, conductivity, pressure and the static  fluid level of the injection zone must be recorded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> At a minimum, the following information concerning the injection  and confining zones shall be determined or calculated for Class I  hazardous waste injection wells:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fracture pressure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other physical and chemical characteristics of the injection and  confining zones; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Physical and chemical characteristics of the formation fluids in  the injection zone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Upon completion, but prior to operation, the owner or operator  shall conduct the following tests to verify hydrogeologic  characteristics of the injection zone:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A pump test; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Injectivity tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Director shall have the opportunity to witness all logging  and testing by this subpart. The owner or operator shall submit a  schedule of such activities to the Director 30 days prior to conducting  the first test.</p>
