                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Within the United States the period of completing an administrative settlement under the AMCSA is subject to the same time limitation as that for beginning suit under the SIAA or PVA; that is, a two-year period from the date the cause of the action accrued. The claimant must have agreed to accept the settlement and it must be approved for payment by the Secretary of the Army or other approval authority prior to the end of such period. The presentation of a claim, or its consideration by the DA, neither waives nor extends the two-year limitation period and the

claimant should be so informed, in writing, when the claim is acknowledged. See Sec. 536.28.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For causes of action under the AEA, filing an administrative claim is mandatory. However, suit is required under the two-year time limit applicable to the SIAA and PVA, even though the AEA provides that no suit shall be filed under six months after filing a claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For causes of action arising outside the United States, there is no time limitation for completing an administrative settlement.</p>
