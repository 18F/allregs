For the purposes of this section, a visa application ``remains pending'' if the applicant has applied for an immigrant visa in accordance with the definition in part 40, Sec. 40.1(l)(2) and the visa has neither been issued, nor refused for any reason under applicable law and regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Entitlement to classification. A consular officer may classify an alien as a nonimmigrant under INA 101(a)(15)(V) if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The consular officer has received notification from the Department of State or the Department of Justice that a petition to accord status to the alien as a spouse or child pursuant to INA 203(a)(2)(A) was filed on or before December 21, 2000; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The alien is eligible to derive benefits pursuant to INA 203(d) as a child of an alien described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and such alien has qualified for V classification; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It has been three years or more since the filing date of the petition described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and applicable to paragraph (b)(2) of this section and either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The petition has not been approved; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If it has been approved, either no immigrant visa number is immediately available or the alien's application for adjustment of status or the alien's application for a visa remains pending.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Eligibility as an immigrant required. The consular officer, insofar as practicable, must determine the eligibility of an alien described in paragraph (b) of this section to receive a nonimmigrant visa under INA 101(a)(15)(V), other than an alien who previously has been granted V status in the United States by DHS, as if the alien were an applicant for an immigrant visa, except that the alien is exempt from the vaccination requirement of INA 212(a)(1), the labor certification requirement of INA 212(a)(5) and the unlawful presence ineligibility of INA 212(a)(9)(B).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Place of application.
