                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When withheld. Payment of funds to States or yearend certification of State laws, or both, are withheld when the Secretary finds, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That any provision required by section 303(a) of the Social Security Act is no longer included in the State unemployment compensation law; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the State unemployment compensation law has been so changed as no longer to meet the conditions required by section 3303(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (section 3303(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That the State unemployment compensation law has been so amended as no longer to contain the provisions specified in section 3304(a) or has failed to comply substantially with any such provision and such finding has become effective (section 3304(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That in the administration of the State unemployment compensation law there has been a failure to comply substantially with required provisions of such law (section 303(b)(2) of the Social Security Act and section 3303(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> That in the administration of the State unemployment compensation law there has been a denial, in a substantial number of cases, of benefits due under such law, except that there may be no such finding until the question of entitlement has been decided by the highest judicial authority given jurisdiction under such State law (section 303(b)(1) of the Social Security Act); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> That a State fails to make its unemployment compensation records available to the Railroad Retirement Board or fails to cooperate with Federal agencies charged with the administration of unemployment compensation laws (section 303(c) of the Social Security Act); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> That a State no longer has a plan of operation for public employment offices complying with the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> That a State agency has not properly expended, in accordance with an approved plan of operation, the Federal monies paid it for administration of its public employment service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Informal discussion. Such hearings are generally not called, however, until after every reasonable effort has been made by ETA representatives to resolve the question involved by conference and discussion with State officials. Formal notification of the date and place of a hearing does not foreclose further negotiations with State officials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of noncertification. If, at any time during the taxable year, the Secretary of Labor has reason to believe that a State whose unemployment compensation law he/she has previously approved may not be certified, the Secretary promptly notifies the Governor of the State to that effect (section 3304(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice of hearing. Notice of hearing is sent by the Secretary of Labor to the State unemployment compensation agency. The notice sets forth the purpose of the hearing, the time, date, and place at which the hearing will be held, and the rules of procedure which will be followed. At a hearing the State is given an opportunity to present arguments and all relevant evidence, written or oral. The Secretary makes the necessary determination or findings, on the basis of the record of such hearings. A notice of the Secretary's determination or finding is sent to the State unemployment compensation agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Civil Rights Act issues. To the extent that any proposed withholding of funds involves circumstances within the scope of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the procedure set forth in 29 CFR part 31 shall be applicable.
[30 FR 6942, May 22, 1965, as amended at 43 FR 13828, Mar. 31, 1978; 71 FR 35513, June 21, 2006]</p>
