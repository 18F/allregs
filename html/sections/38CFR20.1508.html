                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. When requested by VA, a participant will waive, in writing, identified procedural processing issues and actions relating to covered claims. VA will provide the participant with a clear explanation, in writing, as to what rights he or she may be waiving. If a hearing on appeal is conducted, the waiver may be formally and clearly entered on the record at the time of hearing. A response to a written waiver request from VA must be filed within the 30-day period prescribed in Sec. 20.1504(a)(3) of this part. Such waiver is not required for matters that have already been waived by virtue of electing participation in the Initiative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evidence obtained or submitted after the Statement of the Case--(1) Evidence obtained by VA. If new evidence is obtained by VA following issuance of a Statement of the Case under Sec. Sec. 19.29 and 19.30 of this chapter, and the claim(s) is not otherwise granted in full based on this new evidence, VA will provide a copy of such evidence to the participant and representative, and request a waiver of review by the agency of original jurisdiction of such evidence and issuance of a Supplemental Statement of the Case pursuant to the provisions set forth in Sec. 20.1304(c) of this part. A response to a written waiver request from VA must be filed within the 30-day period prescribed in Sec. 20.1504(a)(3) of this part. The failure of the participant to agree to a waiver of initial consideration by the agency of original jurisdiction of any evidence obtained by VA will constitute an implied revocation of participation in the Initiative, as provided by Sec. 20.1509(c)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Evidence obtained by VA.
