                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must use good engineering judgment for decisions related to  any requirements under this chapter. This includes your applications for  certification, any testing you do to show that your certification,  production-line, and in-use engines/equipment comply with requirements  that apply to them, and how you select, categorize, determine, and apply  these requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If we send you a written request, you must give us a written  description of the engineering judgment in question. Respond within 15  working days of receiving our request unless we allow more time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We may reject your decision if it is not based on good  engineering judgment or is otherwise inconsistent with the requirements  that apply, based on the following provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We may suspend, revoke, or void a certificate of conformity if  we determine you deliberately used incorrect information or overlooked  important information, that you did not decide in good faith, or that  your decision was not rational.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If we believe a different decision would better reflect good  engineering judgment, but none of the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of  this section apply, we will tell you of our concern (and its basis). You  will have 30 days to respond to our concerns, or more time if we agree  that you need it to generate more information. After considering your  information, we will give you a final ruling. If we conclude that you  did not use good engineering judgment, we may reject your decision and  apply the new ruling to similar situations as soon as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We will tell you in writing of the conclusions we reach under  paragraph (c) of this section and explain our reasons for them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If you disagree with our conclusions, you may file a request for  a hearing with the Designated Compliance Officer as described in subpart  G of this part. In your request, specify your objections, include data  or supporting analysis, and get your authorized representative's  signature. If we agree that your request raises a substantial factual  issue, we will hold the hearing according to subpart F of this part.</p>
