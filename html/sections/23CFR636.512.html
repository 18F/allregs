While you may use reports and analyses prepared by others, the source selection decision shall represent your independent judgment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The source selection decision shall be documented, and the documentation shall include the rationale for any business judgments and tradeoffs made or relied on, including benefits associated with additional costs. Although the rationale for the selection decision must be documented, that documentation need not quantify the tradeoffs that led to the decision.</p>
