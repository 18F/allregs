                            <p class="depth0">Except as provided below, all terms used in this subpart have the same meaning given in the Clean Air Act and subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Active monitoring area is the area that will be monitored over a specific time interval from the first year of the period (n) to the last year in the period (t). The boundary of the active monitoring area is established by superimposing two areas:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The area projected to contain the free phase CO2 plume at the end of year t, plus an all around buffer zone of one-half mile or greater if known leakage pathways extend laterally more than one-half mile.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The area projected to contain the free phase CO2 plume at the end of year t+5.</p><p class="depth2">CO2 received means the CO2 stream that you receive to be injected for the first time into a well on your facility that is covered by this subpart. CO2 received includes, but is not limited to, a CO2 stream from a production process

unit inside your facility and a CO2 stream that was injected into a well on another facility, removed from a discontinued enhanced oil or natural gas or other production well, and transferred to your facility.</p><p class="depth2">Equipment leak means those emissions that could not reasonably pass through a stack, chimney, vent, or other functionally-equivalent opening.</p><p class="depth2">Expected baseline is the anticipated value of a monitored parameter that is compared to the measured monitored parameter.</p><p class="depth2">Maximum monitoring area means the area that must be monitored under this regulation and is defined as equal to or greater than the area expected to contain the free phase CO2 plume until the CO2 plume has stabilized plus an all-around buffer zone of at least one-half mile.</p><p class="depth2">Research and development project means a project for the purpose of investigating practices, monitoring techniques, or injection verification, or engaging in other applied research, that will enable safe and effective long-term containment of a CO2 stream in subsurface geologic formations, including research and short duration CO2 injection tests conducted as a precursor to long-term storage.</p><p class="depth2">Separator means a vessel in which streams of multiple phases are gravity separated into individual streams of single phase.</p><p class="depth2">Surface leakage means the movement of the injected CO2 stream from the injection zone to the surface, and into the atmosphere, indoor air, oceans, or surface water.</p><p class="depth2">Underground Injection Control permit means a permit issued under the authority of Part C of the Safe Drinking Water Act at 42 U.S.C. 300h et seq.</p><p class="depth2">Underground Injection Control program means the program responsible for regulating the construction, operation, permitting, and closure of injection wells that place fluids underground for storage or disposal for purposes of protecting underground sources of drinking water from endangerment pursuant to Part C of the Safe Drinking Water Act at 42 U.S.C. 300h et seq.</p><p class="depth2">Vented emissions means intentional or designed releases of CH4 or CO2 containing natural gas or hydrocarbon gas (not including stationary combustion flue gas), including process designed flow to the atmosphere through seals or vent pipes, equipment blowdown for maintenance, and direct venting of gas used to power equipment (such as pneumatic devices).
