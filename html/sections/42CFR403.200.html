                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Provisions of the legislation. This subpart implements, in part,  section 1882 of the Social Security Act. The intent of that section is  to enable Medicare beneficiaries to identify Medicare supplemental  policies that do not duplicate Medicare, and that provide adequate,  fairly priced protection against expenses not covered by Medicare. The  legislation establishes certain standards for Medicare supplemental  policies and provides two methods for informing Medicare beneficiaries  which policies meet those standards:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Through a State approved program, that is, a program that a  Supplemental Health Insurance Panel determines to meet certain minimum  requirements for the regulation of Medicare supplemental policies; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In a State without an approved program, through certification by  the Secretary of policies voluntarily submitted by insuring  organizations for review against the standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope of subpart. This subpart sets forth the standards and  procedures CMS will use to implement the voluntary certification  program.</p><p class="depth2">General Provisions</p>
