                            <p class="depth0">Various Federal, State, and local legislation requires the payment  of wages in cash; prohibits or regulates the issuance of scrip, tokens,  credit cards, ``dope checks'' or coupons; prevents or restricts payment  of wages in services or facilities; controls company stores and  commissaries; outlaws ``kickbacks''; restrains assignment and  garnishment of wages; and generally governs the calculation of wages and  the frequency and manner of paying them. Where such legislation is  applicable and does not contravene the requirements of the Act, nothing  in the Act, the regulations, or the interpretations announced by the  Administrator should be taken to override or nullify the provisions of  these laws.</p><p class="depth0">How Payments May Be Made</p>
