Copies of the petition shall be served on all parties and on the ALJ. If the ARB does not issue a notice accepting a petition for review of the decision concerning civil money penalties and/or back wages within 30 days after receipt of a timely filing of the petition, or within 30 days of the date of the decision if no petition has been received, the decision of the ALJ shall be deemed the final agency action. If the ARB does not issue a notice accepting a petition for review of the decision concerning the debarment recommendation within 30 days after the receipt of a timely filing of the petition, or if no petition has been received by the ARB within 30 days of the date of the decision, the decision of the ALJ shall be deemed the final agency action. If a petition for review is accepted, the decision of the ALJ shall be inoperative unless and until the ARB issues an order affirming the decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whenever the ARB, either on the ARB's own motion or by acceptance of a party's petition, determines to review the decision of an ALJ, a notice of the same shall be served upon the ALJ and upon all parties to the proceeding in person or by certified mail.</p>
