EAS Participants must install and operate during their hours of  operation, equipment that is capable of receiving and decoding, either  automatically or manually, the EAS header codes, emergency messages and  EOM code, and which complies with the requirements in Sec. 11.56.</p><p class="depth2">Note to paragraph (a):</p><p class="depth2">The two-tone Attention Signal will not be used to actuate two-tone  decoders but will be used as an aural alert signal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If manual interrupt is used as authorized in Sec. 11.51(m)(2),  decoders must be located so that operators at their normal duty stations  can be alerted immediately when EAS messages are received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> EAS Participants that are co-owned and co-located with a  combined studio or control facility (such as an AM and FM licensed to  the same entity and at the same location or a cable headend serving more  than one system) may comply with the EAS monitoring requirements  contained in this section for the combined station or system with one  EAS Decoder. The requirements of Sec. 11.33 must be met by the combined  facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> EAS Participants must comply with the following monitoring  requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With respect to monitoring for EAS messages that are formatted  in accordance with the EAS Protocol, EAS Participants must monitor two  EAS sources. The monitoring assignments of each broadcast station and  cable system and wireless cable system are specified in the State EAS  Plan and FCC Mapbook. They are developed in accordance with FCC  monitoring priorities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, EAS Participants'  EAS equipment must interface with the Federal Emergency Management  Agency's Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) to enable  (whether through ``pull'' interface technologies, such as Really Simple  Syndication (RSS) and Atom Syndication Format (ATOM), or ``push''  interface technologies, such as instant messaging and email) the  distribution of Common Alert Protocol (CAP)-formatted alert messages  from the IPAWS system to EAS Participants' EAS equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Monitoring specifications associated with the distribution of  CAP-formatted alert messages by state alert message systems are  described in the State EAS Plan, as set forth in Sec. 11.21(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the required EAS message sources cannot be received,  alternate arrangements or a waiver may be obtained by written request to  the Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau. In an emergency,  a waiver may be issued over the telephone with a follow up letter to  confirm temporary or permanent reassignment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The management of EAS Participants shall determine which header  codes will automatically interrupt their programming for State and Local  Area emergency situations affecting their audiences.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> EAS Participants are required to interrupt normal programming  either automatically or manually when they receive an EAS message in  which the header code contains the Event codes for Emergency Action  Notification (EAN), the National Periodic Test (NPT), or the Required  Monthly Test (RMT) for their State or State/county location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Automatic interrupt of programming is required when facilities  are unattended. Automatic operation must provide a permanent record of  the EAS message that contains at a minimum the following information:  Originator, Event, Location and valid time period of the message.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Manual interrupt of programming and transmission of EAS messages  may be used. EAS messages with the EAN Event code, or the NPT Event code  in the case of a nationwide test of the EAS, must be transmitted  immediately; Monthly EAS test messages must be transmitted within 60  minutes. All actions must be logged and recorded as specified in  Secs. 11.35(a) and 11.54(a)(3). Decoders must be programmed for the EAN  Event header code and the RMT and RWT Event header codes (for required  monthly and   weekly tests), with the appropriate accompanying State and State/county  location codes.
