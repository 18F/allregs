                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 1415.207-70, insert the following provision:</p><p class="depth0">Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information--Department of the Interior</p><p class="depth0">(APR 1984)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For the purposes of this provision and the Freedom  of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the following terms shall have the  meaning set forth below:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``Trade Secret'' means an unpatented, secret, commercially  valuable plan, appliance, formula, or process, which is used for making,  preparing, compounding, treating or processing articles or materials  which are trade commodities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``Confidential commercial or financial information'' means any  business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the  mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5  U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable  to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4),  which covers ``commercial and financial information obtained from a  person and privileged or confidential,'' and exemption (9), which covers  ``geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning  wells.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the  proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial  information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act,  (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be  marked with the following legend:</p><p class="depth2">``The information specifically identified on pages ------------ of  this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and  financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from  disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests  that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be  required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be  used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to  evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the  offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the  proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to  the extent provided in the contract.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret  information and confidential commercial and financial information on the  pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page  with the following legend:</p><p class="depth2">``This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and  financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from  disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to  the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade  secret information or confidential commercial and financial information  shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the  proposal, except that (i) if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a  result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the  Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in  the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another  source without restriction it may be used without restriction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access  to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or  confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration  will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes  trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The  offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an  opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of  its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so. If it is  determined that information claimed by the offeror to be trade secret  information or confidential commercial or financial information is not  exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, the offeror  will be notified of this determination prior to disclosure of the  information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Government assumes no liability for the disclosure or use of  information contained in a proposal if not marked in accordance with  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this provision. If a request under the Freedom  of Information Act is made for information in a proposal not marked in  accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this provision, the offeror  concerned shall be promptly notified of the request and given an  opportunity to provide its position to the Government. However, failure  of an offeror to mark information contained in a proposal as trade  secret information or confidential commercial or financial information  will be treated by the Government as evidence that the information is  not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, absent  a showing that the failure to mark was due to unusual or extenuating  circumstances, such as a showing that the offeror had intended to mark,  but that markings were omitted from the offeror's proposal due to  clerical error.</p><p class="depth2">(End of provision)</p>
