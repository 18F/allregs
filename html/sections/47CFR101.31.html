See Sec. 101.125.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applications for authorizations to operate stations at temporary locations under the provisions of this section shall be made upon FCC Form 601. Blanket applications may be submitted for the required number of transmitters. An application for authority to operate a fixed station at temporary locations must specify the precise geographic area within which the operation will be confined. The area specified must be defined as a radius of operation about a specific coordinate (latitude/longitude), or as a county, or as a State. Exception to this specific requirement may be made for exceptionally large areas, such as the continental United States. Sufficient data must be submitted to show the need for the proposed area of operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Operations in the 17.8-19.7 GHz band for any services and in the 17.7-17.8 GHz band for MVPD operations are prohibited in the areas defined in Sec. 1.924 of this chapter.
