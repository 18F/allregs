Similarly, if either the first or third condition set forth in Sec. 210.1-02(w), substituting 20 percent for 10 percent, is

met by a 50 percent or less owned person accounted for by the equity method either by the registrant or a subsidiary of the registrant, separate financial statements of such 50 percent or less owned person shall be filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Insofar as practicable, the separate financial statements required by this section shall be as of the same dates and for the same periods as the audited consolidated financial statements required by Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 3-02. However, these separate financial statements are required to be audited only for those fiscal years in which either the first or third condition set forth in Sec. 210.1-02(w), substituting 20 percent for 10 percent, is met.
