                            <p class="depth0">Any member of the public may inspect or copy records described in Sec. 1602.5(b) in the public reading room during regular business hours. Because it will sometimes be impossible to produce records or copies of records on short notice, a person who wishes to inspect or copy records is advised to arrange a time in advance, by telephone or letter request made to the Office of Legal Affairs. Persons submitting requests by telephone will be notified whether a written request would be advisable to aid in the identification and expeditious processing of the records sought. Written requests should identify the records sought in the manner provided in Sec. 1602.8(b) and should request a specific date for inspecting the records. The requester will be advised as promptly as possible if, for any reason, it may not be possible to make the records sought available on the date requested.
