In deciding whether a solid waste  rail transfer facility that is or proposed to be constructed or operated  by or on behalf of a rail carrier poses an unreasonable risk to public  health, safety, or the environment, the Board shall weigh the particular  facility's potential benefits to and the adverse impacts on public  health, public safety, the environment, interstate commerce, and  transportation of solid waste by rail.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Board will not grant a land-use-exemption permit for a solid  waste rail transfer facility proposed to be located on land within any  unit of or land affiliated with the National Park System, the National  Wildlife Refuge System, the National Wilderness Preservation System, the  National Trails System, the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, a  National Reserve, or a National Monument.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Board will not grant a land-use-exemption permit for a solid  waste rail transfer facility proposed to be located on land within any  unit of or land affiliated with lands referenced in The Highlands  Conservation Act, Public Law No. 108-421, for which a state has  implemented a conservation management plan, if operation of the facility  would be inconsistent with restrictions placed on such land.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Board will reject an application from a person who is not a  rail carrier, but is instead operating on behalf of a rail carrier  unless;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The applicant has sought permission from the applicable state,  local, or municipal authority with respect to some or all of the  property in the application and received an unsatisfactory result  affecting the siting of the facility, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Governor of the state has petitioned the Board to require  the facility to apply under subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Board will issue a land-use-exemption permit to an applicant  that has received an unsatisfactory result from a state, local or  municipal authority affecting the siting of the facility only if it  finds that the laws, regulations, or other requirements affect the  siting of the facility, on their face or as applied, either;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Unreasonably burden the interstate transportation of solid waste  by railroad, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Discriminate against the railroad transportation of solid waste  and a solid waste rail transfer facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A land-use-exemption permit will only exempt state, local, or  municipal laws, regulations, orders, other requirements, or portions  thereof, affecting the siting of the solid waste rail transfer facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Considerations. As required by 49 U.S.C. 10909(d), the Board  will consider and give due weight to the following, as applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The land-use, zoning, and siting regulations or solid waste  planning requirements of the state or state subdivision in which the  facility is or will be located that are applicable to solid waste  transfer facilities, including those that are not owned or operated by  or on behalf of a rail carrier;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The land-use, zoning, and siting regulations or solid waste  planning requirements applicable to the property where the solid waste  rail transfer facility is proposed to be located;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Regional transportation planning requirements developed pursuant  to federal and state law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Regional solid waste disposal plans developed pursuant to  federal or state law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any federal and state environmental protection laws or  regulations applicable to the site;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any unreasonable burdens imposed on the interstate  transportation of solid waste by railroad, or the potential for  discrimination against the railroad transportation of solid waste, a  solid waste rail transfer facility, or a rail carrier that owns or  operates such a facility; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any other relevant factors, as determined by the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Permits. If the Board grants a land-use-exemption permit for a  solid waste rail transfer facility, such permit will only exempt a  facility from complying with state laws, regulations, orders, or other  requirements affecting   the siting of the facility that are specified therein. The permit will  require compliance with all other state laws, regulations, orders, or  other requirements not otherwise expressly exempted in the permit.</p>
