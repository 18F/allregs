                            <p class="depth0">For heating oil and NRLM diesel fuel subject to the fuel marker requirement in Sec. 80.510(d), (e), or (f), the identification of the presence and concentration of the fuel marker in diesel fuel may be determined using the test procedures qualified in accordance with the requirements in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sampling and testing for methods for the fuel marker. The sampling, sample preparation, and testing methods qualified for use in accordance with the requirements of this section may involve the use of hazardous materials, operations and equipment. This section does not address the associated safety

problems which may exist. It is the responsibility of the user of the procedures specified in this section to establish appropriate safety and health practices prior to their use. It is also the responsibility of the user to dispose of any byproducts which might result from conducting these procedures in a manner consistent with applicable safety and health requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What are the precision and accuracy criteria for qualification of fuel marker test methods?--(1) Precision. A standard deviation of less than 0.10 milligrams per liter is required, computed from the results of a minimum of 20 repeat tests made over 20 days on samples taken from a homogeneous commercially available diesel fuel which meets the applicable industry consensus and federal regulatory specifications and which contains the fuel marker at a concentration in the range of 0.10 to 8 milligrams per liter. In order to qualify, the 20 results must be a series of tests on the same material and there must be a sequential record of the analysis with no omissions. A laboratory facility may exclude a given sample or test result only if the exclusion is for a valid reason under good laboratory practices and it maintains records regarding the sample and test results and the reason for excluding them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Precision.

(i) The arithmetic average of a continuous series of at least 10 tests performed on a commercially available marker solvent yellow 124 standard in the range of 0.10 to 1 milligrams per liter shall not differ from the ARV of that standard by more than 0.05 milligrams per liter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The arithmetic average of a continuous series of at least 10 tests performed on a commercially available marker solvent yellow 124 standard in the range of 0.10 to 1 milligrams per liter shall not differ from the ARV of that standard by more than 0.05 milligrams per liter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The arithmetic average of a continuous series of at least 10 tests performed on a commercially available marker solvent yellow 124 standard in the range of 4 to 10 milligrams per liter shall not differ from the ARV of that standard by more than 0.05 milligrams per liter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In applying the tests of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, individual test results shall be compensated for any known chemical interferences.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> What process must a test facility follow in order to qualify a test method for determining the fuel marker content of distillate fuels and how will EPA qualify or decline to qualify a test method?--(1) Qualification of test methods approved by voluntary consensus-based standards bodies. Any standard test method developed by a Voluntary Consensus-Based Standards Body, such as the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) or International Standards Organization (ISO), shall be considered a qualified test method for determining the fuel marker content of distillate fuel provided that it meets the precision and accuracy criteria under paragraph (b) of this section. The qualification of a test method is limited to the single test facility that performed the testing for accuracy and precision. The individual facility must submit the accuracy and precision results for each method, including information on the date and time of each test measurement used to demonstrate precision, following procedures established by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Qualification of test methods approved by voluntary consensus-based standards bodies. Any standard test method developed by a Voluntary Consensus-Based Standards Body, such as the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) or International Standards Organization (ISO), shall be considered a qualified test method for determining the fuel marker content of distillate fuel provided that it meets the precision and accuracy criteria under paragraph (b) of this section. The qualification of a test method is limited to the single test facility that performed the testing for accuracy and precision. The individual facility must submit the accuracy and precision results for each method, including information on the date and time of each test measurement used to demonstrate precision, following procedures established by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Qualification of test methods that have not been approved by a voluntary consensus-based standards body. A test method that has not been approved by a voluntary consensus-based standards body may be qualified upon approval by the Administrator. The following information must be submitted in the application for approval by each test facility, for each test method that it wishes to have approved:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Full test method documentation, including a description of the technology and/or instrumentation that makes the method functional.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Information demonstrating that the test method meets the accuracy and precision criteria under paragraph (b) of this section, including information on the date and time of each test measurement used to demonstrate precision.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Samples used for precision and accuracy determination must be retained for 90 days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If requested by the Administrator, test results utilizing the method and performed on a sample of commercially available distillate fuel which meets the applicable industry consensus and federal regulatory specifications and which contains the fuel marker.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any additional information requested by the Administrator and necessary to render a decision as to qualification of the test method.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The qualification of a test method is limited to the single test facility that performed the testing for accuracy and precision and any other required testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> Within 90 days of receipt of all materials required to be submitted under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, the Administrator shall determine whether to qualify the test method under this section. The Administrator shall qualify the test method if all materials required under this section are received and the test method meets the accuracy and precision criteria of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Within 90 days of receipt of all materials required to be submitted under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, the Administrator shall determine whether to qualify the test method under this section.
