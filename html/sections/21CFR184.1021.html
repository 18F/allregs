                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Benzoic acid is the chemical benzenecarboxylic acid  (C7H6O2), occurring in nature in free  and combined forms. Among the foods in which benzoic acid occurs  naturally are cranberries, prunes, plums, cinnamon, ripe cloves, and  most berries. Benzoic acid is manufactured by treating molten phthalic  anhydride with steam in the presence of a zinc oxide catalyst, by the  hydrolysis of benzotrichloride, or by the oxidation of toluene with  nitric acid or sodium bichromate or with air in the presence of a  transition metal salt catalyst.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ingredient meets the specifications of the ``Food Chemicals  Codex,'' 3d Ed. (1981), p. 35, which is incorporated by reference.  Copies may be obtained from the National Academy Press, 2101  Constitution Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20418, or may be examined at the  National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on  the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:  http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ ibr_locations.html.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The ingredient is used as an antimicrobial agent as defined in  Sec. 170.3(o)(2) of this chapter, and as a flavoring agent and adjuvant  as defined in Sec. 170.3(o)(12) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The ingredient is used in food at levels not to exceed good  manufacturing practice. Current usage results in a maximum level of 0.1  percent in food. (The Food and Drug Administration has not determined  whether significantly different conditions of use would be GRAS).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Prior sanctions for this ingredient different from those uses  established in this section, or different from that set forth in part  181 of this chapter, do not exist or have been waived.
