                                Sec. 1952.350  Description of the plan as initially approved.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> The plan identifies the Arizona Industrial Commission,  Division of Occupational Safety and Health, as the State agency  designated to administer the plan throughout the State. It adopts the  definition of occupational safety and health issues expressed in  Sec. 1902.2(c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this chapter. The State intends to adopt all  Federal standards except those found in 29 CFR parts 1915, 1916, 1917  and 1918 (ship repairing, shipbuilding, shipbreaking, and longshoring)  and those subparts of parts 1910 and 1926 pertaining to industries which  are not applicable to Arizona. In addition, the State intends to enforce  elevator (ANSI) and boiler pressure vessel (ASME) standards for which  there are no Federal counterparts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The plan provides a description of personnel employed under a  merit system; the coverage of employees of political subdivisions;  procedures for the development and promulgation of standards, including  standards for the protection of employees against new and unforeseen  hazards; and procedures for the prompt restraint or elimination of  imminent danger situations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The plan includes legislation enacted by the Arizona  Legislature during its 1974 legislative session   amending title 23, article 10 of the Arizona Revised Statutes to bring  them into conformity with the requirements of part 1902 of this chapter.  Under the legislation the Industrial Commission will have full authority  to enforce and administer laws respecting the safety and health of  employees in all workplaces of the State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The legislation is intended, among other things, to assure  inspections in response to employee complaints; give employer and  employee representatives an opportunity to accompany inspectors in order  to aid inspections; notification of employees or their representatives  when no compliance action is taken as a result of alleged violations;  notification of employees of their protections and obligations;  protection of employees against discharge or discrimination in terms and  conditions of employment; adequate safeguards to protect trade secrets;  sanctions against employers for violations of standards and orders;  employer right of review to an Occupational Safety and Health Review  Board and then the courts, and employee participation in review  proceedings. The plan also proposes a program of voluntary compliance by  employers and employees, including a provision for on-site consultation.  The State's consultation program should not detract from its enforcement  program and the State has given assurances that it will meet the  conditions set forth in the Washington Decision (38 FR 2421, January 26,  1973).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Arizona Plan includes the following documents as of the date  of approval:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The plan description documents, in two volumes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A copy of the enabling legislation as amended and enacted by the  State Legislature in its 1974 Session.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Letters from Donald G. Wiseman, Director of the Division of  Occupational Safety and Health of the Arizona Industrial Commission to  Barry J. White, Associate Assistant Secretary for Regional Programs on  October 15, 18, and 24, 1974 submitting information, clarifications, and  revisions on several issues raised during the review process, including  proposals to be submitted to the Arizona Legislature during its 1975  Session.  [39 FR 39038, Nov. 5, 1974, as amended at 50 FR 25571, June 20, 1985]</p>
