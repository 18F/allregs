                            <p class="depth0">The specific practices named in section 3(f) must, like any others, be performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations, for this condition applies to ``any'' practices brought within the secondary meaning of agriculture as defined in that section of the Act. Thus the preparation for market, by a farmer's employees on a farm of animals to be sold at a livestock auction is not within section 3(f) if animals from other farmers and other farms are also handled. The practice is not performed as an incident to or in conjunction with ``such'' farming operations, that is, the operations of the farmer by whom, or of the farm on which, the livestock is raised (Mitchell v. Hunt, 263 F. 2d 913).</p><p class="depth0">Preparation for Market</p>
