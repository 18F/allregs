A determination shall be made at any time to the extent  necessary to establish or protect an individual's entitlement to TRA or  other TAA, but no payment of TRA or other TAA may be made by a State  agency until a certification is made and the State agency determines  that the individual is covered thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, a reasonable period of time  means such period of time as the individual had good cause for not  filing earlier, which shall include, but not be limited to, the  individual's lack of knowledge of the certification or misinformation  supplied the individual by the State agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applicable procedures. Applications shall be filed in accordance  with this subpart B and on forms which shall be furnished to individuals  by the State agency. The procedures for reporting and filing  applications for TRA shall be consistent with this part 617 and the  Secretary's ``Standard for Claim Filing, Claimant Reporting, Job Finding  and Employment Services'', Employment Security Manual, part V, sections  5000 et seq. (Appendix A of this part).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Advising workers to apply for training. State agencies shall  advise each worker of the qualifying requirements for entitlement to TRA  and other TAA benefits at the time the worker files an initial claim for  State UI, and shall advise each adversely affected worker to apply for  training under subpart C of this part before, or at the same time, the  worker applies for TRA, as required by Sec. 617.4(e)(1) and (3).
