In order to test procedures for use  in making such determinations and, in particular, for determining  whether and, if so, to what extent the intensity of inspection coverage  exceeds that which should be deemed necessary pursuant to section 6 of  the Act, the Administrator is initiating experimentation of a new system  of inspection for reviewing the performance of establishments and for  designing the supervision and other conditions and methods of inspection  coverage. For the period of such experimentation, the Administrator  shall identify establishments for review, and the frequency and the  manner of inspection by Inspection Service employees shall be determined  on the basis of the results of those reviews and be otherwise in  accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The determinations referred to in paragraph (c) of this section  shall be made by the Inspection Service and shall reflect evaluations of  the performance and the characteristics of such establishments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In assessing the performance of an establishment, the following  factors are appropriate for consideration:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The history of compliance with applicable regulatory  requirements by the person operating such establishment or by anyone  responsibly connected with the business operating such establishment, as  ``responsibly connected'' is defined in section 18(a) of the Act,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The competence of the person operating such establishment, as  indicated by:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Knowledge of appropriate manufacturing practices and applicable  regulatory requirements,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Demonstrated ability to apply such knowledge in a timely and  consistent manner, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Commitment to correcting deficiencies noted by Inspection  Service employees and otherwise assuring compliance with applicable  regulatory requirements, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The procedures used in such establishment to control the  production process, environment, and resulting product in order to  assure and monitor compliance with the requirements of the Act and the  rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In assessing the characteristics of an establishment, the  following factors are appropriate for consideration:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The complexity of the processing operation(s) conducted at such  establishment,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The frequency with which each such operation is conducted at  such establishment,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The volume of product resulting from each such operation at  such establishment,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether and to what extent slaughter and evisceration  operations also are conducted at such establishment,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> What, if any, food products not regulated under this Act or the  Federal Meat Inspection Act also are processed at such establishment,  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The size of such establishment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> For the period of experimentation described in paragraph (c)  of this section, the frequency of inspection by Inspection Service  employees of operations other than slaughter and evisceration may be  reduced in an establishment in which the procedures referred to therein  are being tested if and only if the evaluation of the performance of  such establishment described in paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> indicates that there  are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No instances, documented in records compiled no earlier than 10  years before, of substantial and recent noncompliance with applicable  regulatory requirements (taking into account both the nature and  frequency of any such noncompliance), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The competence and control procedures needed to assure and  monitor compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The frequency of Federal inspection and other conditions and  methods of inspection coverage in any establishment in which the  frequency of Federal inspection is reduced shall be based on:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The evaluation of the characteristics of such establishment  described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth5">\1\ These evaluations will be based upon guidelines developed by  FSIS and the complexity categorization in FSIS Directive 1030.2  (Documentation of Processing and Combination Assignments, 4/22/85).
