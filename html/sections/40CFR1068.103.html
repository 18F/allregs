                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, ``specifications'' includes any  conditions or limitations identified by the manufacturer or EPA. For  example, if the application for certification specifies certain engine  configurations, the certificate does not cover any configurations that  are not specified. We may ignore any information provided in the  application that we determine is not relevant to a demonstration of  compliance with applicable regulations, such as your projected  production volumes in many cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>. In general, the production period is  the manufacturer's annual production period identified as a model year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For engines/equipment subject to emission standards based on  model years, the first day of the annual production period can be no  earlier than January 2 of the calendar year preceding the year for which  the model year is named, or the earliest date of manufacture for any  engine/equipment in the engine family, whichever is later. The last day  of the annual production period can be no later than December 31 of the  calendar year for which the model year is named or the latest date of  manufacture for any engine/equipment in the engine family, whichever is  sooner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For fuel-system components certified to evaporative emission  standards based on production periods rather than model years, the  production period is either the calendar year or a longer period we  specify consistent with the manufacturer's normal production practices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A certificate of conformity will not cover engines/equipment you  produce with a date of manufacture earlier than the date you submit the  application for certification for the family. You may start to produce  engines/equipment after you submit an application for certification and  before the effective date of a certificate of conformity, subject to the  following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The engines/equipment must conform in all material respects to  the engines/equipment described in your application. Note that if we  require you to modify your application, you must ensure that all  engines/equipment conform to the specifications of the modified  application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The engines/equipment may not be sold, offered for sale,  introduced into commerce, or delivered for introduction into U.S.  commerce before the effective date of the certificate of conformity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must notify us in your application for certification that  you plan to use the provisions of this paragraph (c) and when you intend  to start production. If the standard-setting part specifies mandatory  testing for production-line engines, you must start testing as directed  in the standard-setting part based on your actual start of production,  even if that occurs before we approve your certification. You must also  agree to give us full opportunity to inspect and/or test the engines/ equipment during and after production. For example, we must have the  opportunity to specify selective enforcement   audits as allowed by the standard-setting part and the Clean Air Act as  if the engines/equipment were produced after the effective date of the  certificate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> See Sec.  1068.262 for special provisions that apply for  secondary engine manufacturers receiving shipment of partially complete  engines before the effective date of a certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Engines/equipment with a date of manufacture after December 31  of the calendar year for which a model year is named are not covered by  the certificate of conformity for that model year. You must submit an  application for a new certificate of conformity demonstrating compliance  with applicable standards even if the engines/equipment are identical to  those built before December 31.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The flexible approach to naming the annual production period  described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is intended to allow you  to introduce new products at any point during the year. This is based on  the expectation that production periods generally run on consistent  schedules from year to year. You may not use this flexibility to arrange  your production periods such that you can avoid annual certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> apply based on the  date on which initial assembly is complete.
