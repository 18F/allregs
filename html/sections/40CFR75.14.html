                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Coal-fired units and oil-fired units. The owner or operator  shall meet the general operating provisions in Sec. 75.10 of this part  for a continuous opacity monitoring system for each affected coal-fired  or oil-fired unit, except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of  this section and in Sec. 75.18. Each continuous opacity monitoring  system shall meet the design, installation, equipment, and performance  specifications in Performance Specification 1 in appendix B to part 60  of this chapter. Any continuous opacity monitoring system previously  certified to meet Performance Specification 1 shall be deemed certified  for the purposes of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unit with wet flue gas pollution control system. If the owner or  operator can demonstrate that condensed water is present in the exhaust  flue gas stream and would impede the accuracy of opacity measurements,  then the owner or operator of an affected unit equipped with a wet flue  gas pollution control system for SO2 emissions or  particulates is exempt from the opacity monitoring requirements of this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Gas-fired units. The owner or operator of an affected unit that  qualifies as gas-fired, as defined in Sec. 72.2 of this   chapter, based on information submitted by the designated representative  in the monitoring plan is exempt from the opacity monitoring  requirements of this part. Whenever a unit previously categorized as a  gas-fired unit is recategorized as another type of unit by changing its  fuel mix, the owner or operator shall install, operate, and certify a  continuous opacity monitoring system as required by paragraph (a) of  this section by December 31 of the following calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Diesel-fired units and dual-fuel reciprocating engine units. The  owner or operator of an affected diesel-fired unit or a dual-fuel  reciprocating engine unit is exempt from the opacity monitoring  requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Unit with a certified particulate matter (PM) monitoring system.  If, for a particular affected unit, the owner or operator installs,  certifies, operates, maintains, and quality-assures a continuous  particulate matter (PM) monitoring system in accordance with Procedure 2  in appendix F to part 60 of this chapter, the unit shall be exempt from  the opacity monitoring requirement of this part.
