                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Background. Section 6(f)(8) of the L&WCF; Act prohibits  discrimination on the basis of residence, including preferential  reservation or membership systems, except to the extent that reasonable  differences in admission and other fees may be maintained on such basis.  This prohibition applies to both regularly scheduled and special events.  The general provisions regarding non-discrimination at sites assisted  under Interior programs and, thereby, all other recreation facilities  managed by a project sponsor, are covered in 43 CFR part 17 which  implements the provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  for the Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Policy. There shall be no discrimination for L&WCF; assisted  programs   and services on the basis of residence, except in reasonable fee  differentials. Post-completion compliance responsibilities of the  recipient should continue to ensure that discrimination on the basis of  residency is not occurring.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fees. Fees charged to nonresidents cannot exceed twice that  charged to residents. Where there is no charge for residents but a fee  is charged to nonresidents, nonresident fees cannot exceed fees charged  for residents at comparable State or local public facilities.  Reservation, membership, or annual permit systems available to residents  must also be available to nonresidents and the period of availability  must be the same for both residents and nonresidents. Recipients are  prohibited from providing residents the option of purchasing annual or  daily permits while at the same time restricting nonresidents to the  purchase of annual permits only. These provisions apply only to the  approved 6(f)(3) areas applicable to the recipient. Nonresident fishing  and hunting license fees are excluded from these requirements.    Sec. Sec. 59.5-59.6  [Reserved]</p>
