                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each applicant, except a qualified tax-exempt organization or  cooperative association, must provide with its application a detailed  exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as  defined in Sec. 201.34(f) of this part) when the proceeding was  initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant  that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates'  assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the  applicant qualifies under the standards in this subpart. The  administrative law judge or the Commission may require an applicant to  file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public  record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public  disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes  there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit  that exhibit in accordance with 17 CFR 201.190.  [47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 60 FR 32795, June 23, 1995]</p>
