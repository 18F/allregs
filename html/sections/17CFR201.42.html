                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each applicant, except a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative association, must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in Sec.  201.34(f) of this part) when the proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any form

convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this subpart. The administrative law judge or the Commission may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit that exhibit in accordance with 17 CFR 201.190.
