                            <p class="depth0">Commercial use means a request from or on behalf of a person seeking  information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or  profit interests of the requester or person on whose behalf the request  is made. In determining the applicability of this term, the use to which  a requester will put the document is considered first; where reasonable  doubt exists as to the use, the Commission may seek clarification before  assigning the request to a category.</p><p class="depth0">Direct costs means the expenditures the Commission incurs in  searching for, duplicating, and, where applicable, reviewing documents  to respond to a request. They include (without limitation) the salary of  the employee(s) performing work (the basic pay rate of such employee(s)  plus 16 percent to cover benefits).</p><p class="depth0">Duplication means copying the documents necessary to respond to a  request. Such copies may be paper, microform, audiovisual, or machine- readable.</p><p class="depth0">Educational institution means a preschool, a public or private  elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate or  undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional  education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a  program or programs of scholarly research.</p><p class="depth0">Noncommercial scientific institution means an institution, not  operated on a commercial basis (as referenced above), which is operated  solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research whose results  are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</p><p class="depth0">Representative of the news media means any person or entity that  gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public,  uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct  work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term ``news'' means  information that is about current events or that would be of current  interest to the public. Examples of news media entities are television  or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of  periodicals (but only if such entities qualify as disseminators of  ``news'') who make their products available for purchase or by  subscription or by free distribution to the general public. These  examples are not all inclusive and may include alternate media to  disseminate news. A freelance journalist shall be regarded as working  for a news media entity if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis  for expecting publication through that entity (e.g., by a publication  contract or prior publication record), whether or not the journalist is  actually employed by the entity.</p><p class="depth0">Review means examining documents located in response to a request to  determine whether any portion is exempt from disclosure, and processing  or preparing documents for release, but not determination of general  legal or policy issues regarding application of exemptions.</p><p class="depth0">Search includes all time spent looking for material responsive to a  request, including identification of pages or lines within documents.  The term covers both manual and computerized searching.</p>
