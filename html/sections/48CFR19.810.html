                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The SBA Administrator may submit the following matters for  determination to the agency head if the SBA and the contracting officer  fail to agree on them:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The decision not to make a particular acquisition available for  award under the 8(a) Program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A contracting officer's decision to reject a specific 8(a) firm  for award of an 8(a) contract after SBA's acceptance of the requirement  for the 8(a) Program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The terms and conditions of a proposed 8(a) contract, including  the contracting activity's NAICS code designation and estimate of the  fair market price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notification of a proposed appeal to the agency head by the SBA  must be received by the contracting officer within 5 working days after  the SBA is formally notified of the contracting officer's decision. The  SBA will provide the agency Director for Small and Disadvantaged  Business Utilization a copy of this notification of the intent to  appeal. The SBA must send the written appeal to the head of the  contracting activity within 15 working days of SBA's notification of  intent to appeal or the contracting activity may consider the appeal  withdrawn. Pending issuance of a decision by the agency head, the  contracting officer must suspend action on the acquisition. The  contracting officer need not suspend action on the acquisition if the  contracting officer makes a written determination that urgent and  compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the  United States will not permit waiting for a decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the SBA appeal is denied, the decision of the agency head  shall specify the reasons for the denial, including the reasons why the  selected firm was determined incapable of performance, if appropriate.  The decision shall be made a part of the contract file.  [54 FR 46005, Oct. 31, 1989, as amended at 64 FR 32745, June 17, 1999;  65 FR 46057, July 26, 2000]</p>
