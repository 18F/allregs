                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For the purposes of this proceeding the ``study carriers'' shall  consist of those Class I motor common carriers of passengers which are  members of NBTA and which, during the latest calendar year available  preceding the filing date of the proposed increase in fares and/or  charges, derived $500,000 or more in annual operating revenues from the  issue traffic, or 1 percent or more of the total annual operating  revenues received by all Class I carriers from the issue traffic. Issue  traffic is defined as that traffic (services) directly affected by the  proposed increases in fares and/or charges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To corroborate the selection of the above study carriers, and to  provide a data base for a continuing evaluation of the validity and  usefulness of those carriers as a study group, respondents shall submit,  as a part of their verified statement (justification), a list of all  Class I motor common carriers of passengers participating in the issue  traffic (services). For the above specified calendar year, the dollar  amounts of total system operating revenues for each such carrier shall  be arrayed in descending order; and, there shall be shown the amount of  annual operating revenues received by each carrier from the total  traffic at issue. Also, to be shown is the percent that each such  carrier's total issue traffic revenue is to its total system revenues,  and the percent that each carrier's total issue traffic revenue is to  the total issue traffic revenues for all Class I carriers indicated in  the above list. This list of carriers and the carrier's applicable  revenues shall be referred to as Schedule A, Class I Participating  Carriers' Revenue Data.  [42 FR 40860, Aug. 12, 1977.
