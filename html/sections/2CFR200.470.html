                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For states, local governments and Indian tribes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Taxes that a governmental unit is legally required to pay are  allowable, except for self-assessed taxes that disproportionately affect  Federal programs or changes in tax policies that disproportionately  affect Federal programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Gasoline taxes, motor vehicle fees, and other taxes that are in  effect user fees for benefits provided to the Federal Government are  allowable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This provision does not restrict the authority of the Federal  awarding agency to identify taxes where Federal participation is  inappropriate. Where the identification of the amount of unallowable  taxes would require an inordinate amount of effort, the cognizant agency  for indirect costs may accept a reasonable approximation thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For nonprofit organizations and IHEs:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general, taxes which the non-Federal entity is required to  pay and which are paid or accrued in accordance with GAAP, and payments  made to local governments in lieu of taxes which are commensurate with  the local government services received are allowable, except for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Taxes from which exemptions are available to the non-Federal  entity directly or which are available to the non-Federal entity based  on an exemption afforded the Federal Government and, in the latter case,  when the Federal awarding agency makes available the necessary exemption  certificates,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Special assessments on land which represent capital  improvements, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Federal income taxes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any refund of taxes, and any payment to the non-Federal entity  of interest thereon, which were allowed as Federal award costs, will be  credited either as a cost reduction or cash refund, as appropriate, to  the Federal Government. However, any interest actually paid or credited  to an non-Federal entity incident to a refund of tax, interest, and  penalty will be paid or credited to the Federal Government only to the  extent that such interest accrued over the period during which the non- Federal entity has been reimbursed by the Federal Government for the  taxes, interest, and penalties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Value Added Tax (VAT) Foreign taxes charged for the purchase of  goods or services that a non-Federal entity is legally required to pay  in country is an allowable expense under Federal awards. Foreign tax  refunds or applicable credits under Federal awards refer to receipts, or  reduction of expenditures, which operate to offset or reduce expense  items that are allocable to Federal awards as direct or indirect costs.  To the extent that such credits accrued or received by the non-Federal  entity relate to allowable cost, these costs must be credited to the  Federal awarding agency either as costs or cash refunds. If the costs  are credited back to the Federal award, the non-Federal entity may  reduce the Federal share of costs by the amount of the foreign tax  reimbursement, or where Federal award has not expired, use the foreign  government tax refund for approved activities under the Federal award  with prior approval of the Federal awarding agency.</p>
