                            <p class="depth0">If you are subject to the requirements of this part, we may require  you to give us information to evaluate your compliance with any  regulations that apply, as authorized by the Clean Air Act. This  includes the following things:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must provide the information we require in this chapter. We  may require an authorized representative of your company to approve and  sign any submission of information to us, and to certify that the  information is accurate and complete.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must establish and maintain records, perform tests, make  reports and provide additional information that we may reasonably  require under section 208 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7542). This  also applies to engines/equipment we exempt from emission standards or  prohibited acts. Unless we specify otherwise, you must keep required  records for eight years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You are responsible for statements and information in your  applications for certification or any other requests or reports. If you  provide statements or information to someone for submission to EPA, you  are responsible for these statements and information as if you had  submitted them to EPA yourself. For example, knowingly submitting false  information to someone else for inclusion in an application for  certification would be deemed to be a submission of false information to  the U.S. government in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001.
