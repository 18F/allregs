In cases where the Agency has denied or reduced the amount of final loss  payment to the lender, the adverse decision may be appealed only by the  lender. A decision by a lender adverse to the interest of the borrower  is not a decision by the Agency, whether or not concurred in by the  Agency. Appeals will be handled in accordance with the regulations of  the National Appeals Division, U.S. Department of Agriculture, published  at 7 CFR part 11.    Sec. Sec. 3575.14-3575.16  [Reserved]</p>
