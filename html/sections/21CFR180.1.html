                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Substances having a history of use in food for human consumption  or in food contact surfaces may at any time have their safety or  functionality brought into question by new information that in itself is  not conclusive. An interim food additive regulation for the use of any  such substance may be promulgated in this subpart when new information  raises a substantial question about the safety or functionality of the  substance but there is a reasonable certainty that the substance is not  harmful and that no harm to the   public health will result from the continued use of the substance for a  limited period of time while the question raised is being resolved by  further study.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No interim food additive regulation may be promulgated if the  new information is conclusive with respect to the question raised or if  there is a reasonable likelihood that the substance is harmful or that  continued use of the substance will result in harm to the public health.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Commissioner, on his own initiative or on the petition of  any interested person, pursuant to part 10 of this chapter, may propose  an interim food additive regulation. A final order promulgating an  interim food additive regulation shall provide that continued use of the  substance in food is subject to each of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use of the substance in food or food contact surfaces must  comply with whatever limitations the Commissioner deems to be  appropriate under the circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within 60 days following the effective date of the regulation,  an interested person shall satisfy the Commissioner in writing that  studies adequate and appropriate to resolve the questions raised about  the substance have been undertaken, or the Food and Drug Administration  may undertake the studies. The Commissioner may extend this 60-day  period if necessary to review and act on proposed protocols. If no such  commitment is made, or adequate and appropriate studies are not  undertaken, an order shall immediately be published in the Federal  Register revoking the interim food additive regulation effective upon  publication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A progress report shall be filed on the studies every January 1  and July 1 until completion. If the progress report is inadequate or if  the Commissioner concludes that the studies are not being pursued  promptly and diligently or if interim results indicate a reasonable  likelihood that a health hazard exists, an order will promptly be  published in the Federal Register revoking the interim food additive  regulation effective upon publication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If nonclinical laboratory studies are involved, studies filed  with the Commissioner shall include, with respect to each study, either  a statement that the study has been or will be conducted in compliance  with the good laboratory practice regulations as set forth in part 58 of  this chapter, or, if any such study was not conducted in compliance with  such regulations, a brief statement of the reason for the noncompliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If clinical investigations involving human subjects are  involved, such investigations filed with the Commissioner shall include,  with respect to each investigation, a statement that the investigation  either was conducted in compliance with the requirements for  institutional review set forth in part 56 of this chapter, or was not  subject to such requirements in accordance with Secs. 56.104 or 56.105,  and that it has been or will be conducted in compliance with the  requirements for informed consent set forth in part 50 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Promptly upon completion of the studies undertaken on the  substance, the Commissioner will review all available data, will  terminate the interim food additive regulation, and will either issue a  food additive regulation or will require elimination of the substance  from the food supply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Commissioner may consult with advisory committees,  professional organizations, or other experts in the field, in  evaluating:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether an interim food additive regulation is justified,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The type of studies necessary and appropriate to resolve  questions raised about a substance,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether interim results indicate the reasonable likelihood that  a health hazard exists, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether the data available at the conclusion of those studies  justify a food additive regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where appropriate, an emergency action level may be issued for a  substance subject to paragraph (a) of this section that is not an  approved food additive, pending the issuance of a final interim food  additive regulation. Such an action level shall be issued pursuant to  sections 306 and 402(a) of the act to identify, based upon available  data, a safe level of use for the substance.   Such an action level shall be issued in a notice published in the  Federal Register and shall be followed as soon as practicable by a  proposed interim food additive regulation. Where the available data do  not permit establishing an action level for the safe use of a substance,  use of the substance may be prohibited. The identification of a  prohibited substance may be made in part 189 of this chapter when  appropriate.
