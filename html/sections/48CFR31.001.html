                            <p class="depth0">As used in this part--</p><p class="depth0">Accrued benefit cost method means an actuarial cost method under which units of benefits are assigned to each cost accounting period and are valued as they accrue; i.e., based on the services performed by each employee in the period involved. The measure of normal cost under this method for each cost accounting period is the present value of the units of benefit deemed to be credited to employees for service in that period. The measure of the actuarial accrued liability at a plan's inception date is the present value of the units of benefit credited to employees for service prior to that date. (This method is also known as the unit credit cost method without salary projection.)</p><p class="depth0">Accumulating costs means collecting cost data in an organized manner, such as through a system of accounts.</p><p class="depth0">Actual cash value means the cost of replacing damaged property with other property of like kind and quality in the physical condition of the property immediately before the damage.</p><p class="depth0">Actual costs means (except for subpart 31.6) amounts determined on the basis of costs incurred, as distinguished from forecasted costs. Actual costs include standard costs properly adjusted for applicable variances.</p><p class="depth0">Actuarial accrued liability means pension cost attributable, under the actuarial cost method in use, to years prior to the current period considered by a particular actuarial valuation. As of such date, the actuarial accrued liability represents the excess of the present value of future benefits and administrative expenses over the present value of future normal costs for all plan participants and beneficiaries. The excess of the actuarial accrued liability over the actuarial value of the assets of a pension plan is the unfunded actuarial liability. The excess of the actuarial value of the assets of a pension plan over the actuarial accrued liability is an actuarial surplus and is treated as a negative unfunded actuarial liability.</p><p class="depth0">Actuarial assumption means an estimate of future conditions affecting pension cost; e.g., mortality rate, employee turnover, compensation levels, earnings on pension plan assets, and

changes in values of pension plan assets.</p><p class="depth0">Actuarial cost method means a technique which uses actuarial assumptions to measure the present value of future pension benefits and pension plan administrative expenses, and that assigns the cost of such benefits and expenses to cost accounting periods. The actuarial cost method includes the asset valuation method used to determine the actuarial value of the assets of a pension plan.</p><p class="depth0">Actuarial gain and loss means the effect on pension cost resulting from differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience.</p><p class="depth0">Actuarial valuation means the determination, as of a specified date, of the normal cost, actuarial accrued liability, actuarial value of the assets of a pension plan, and other relevant values for the pension plan.</p><p class="depth0">Allocate means to assign an item of cost, or a group of items of cost, to one or more cost objectives. This term includes both direct assignment of cost and the reassignment of a share from an indirect cost pool.</p><p class="depth0">Compensated personal absence means any absence from work for reasons such as illness, vacation, holidays, jury duty, military training, or personal activities for which an employer pays compensation directly to an employee in accordance with a plan or custom of the employer.</p><p class="depth0">Compensation for personal services means all remuneration paid currently or accrued, in whatever form and whether paid immediately or deferred, for services rendered by employees to the contractor.</p><p class="depth0">Cost input means the cost, except general and administrative (G&A;) expenses, which for contract costing purposes is allocable to the production of goods and services during a cost accounting period.</p><p class="depth0">Cost objective means (except for subpart 31.6) a function, organizational subdivision, contract, or other work unit for which cost data are desired and for which provision is made to accumulate and measure the cost of processes, products, jobs, capitalized projects, etc.</p><p class="depth0">Deferred compensation means an award made by an employer to compensate an employee in a future cost accounting period or periods for services rendered in one or more cost accounting periods before the date of the receipt of compensation by the employee. This definition shall not include the amount of year end accruals for salaries, wages, or bonuses that are to be paid within a reasonable period of time after the end of a cost accounting period.</p><p class="depth0">Defined-benefit pension plan means a pension plan in which the benefits to be paid, or the basis for determining such benefits, are established in advance and the contributions are intended to provide the stated benefits.</p><p class="depth0">Defined-contribution pension plan means a pension plan in which the contributions to be made are established in advance and the benefits are determined thereby.</p><p class="depth0">Directly associated cost means any cost which is generated solely as a result of the incurrence of another cost, and which would not have been incurred had the other cost not been incurred.</p><p class="depth0">Estimating costs means the process of forecasting a future result in terms of cost, based upon information available at the time.</p><p class="depth0">Expressly unallowable cost means a particular item or type of cost which, under the express provisions of an applicable law, regulation, or contract, is specifically named and stated to be unallowable.</p><p class="depth0">Final cost objective means (except for subparts 31.3 and 31.6) a cost objective that has allocated to it both direct and indirect costs and, in the contractors accumulation system, is one of the final accumulation points.</p><p class="depth0">Fiscal year means the accounting period for which annual financial statements are regularly prepared, generally a period of 12 months, 52 weeks, or 53 weeks.</p><p class="depth0">Funded pension cost means the portion of pension cost for a current or prior cost accounting period that has been paid to a funding agency.</p><p class="depth0">Home office means an office responsible for directing or managing two or more, but not necessarily all, segments of an organization.

usually performs management, supervisory, or administrative functions, and may also perform service functions in support of the operations of the various segments. An organization which has intermediate levels, such as groups, may have several home offices which report to a common home office. An intermediate organization may be both a segment and a home office.</p><p class="depth0">Immediate-gain actuarial cost method means any of the several actuarial cost methods under which actuarial gains and losses are included as part of the unfunded actuarial liability of the pension plan, rather than as part of the normal cost of the plan.</p><p class="depth0">Independent research and development (IR&D;) cost means the cost of effort which is neither sponsored by a grant, nor required in performing a contract, and which falls within any of the following four areas: (a) basic research, (b) applied research, (c) development, and (d) systems and other concept formulation studies.</p><p class="depth0">Indirect cost pools means (except for subparts 31.3 and 31.6) groupings of incurred costs identified with two or more cost objectives but not identified specifically with any final cost objective.</p><p class="depth0">Insurance administration expenses means the contractor's costs of administering an insurance program; e.g., the costs of operating an insurance or risk-management department, processing claims, actuarial fees, and service fees paid to insurance companies, trustees, or technical consultants.</p><p class="depth0">Intangible capital asset means an asset that has no physical substance, has more than minimal value, and is expected to be held by an enterprise for continued use or possession beyond the current accounting period for the benefits it yields.</p><p class="depth0">Job means a homogeneous cluster of work tasks, the completion of which serves an enduring purpose for the organization. Taken as a whole, the collection of tasks, duties, and responsibilities constitutes the assignment for one or more individuals whose work is of the same nature and is performed at the same skill/ responsibility level--as opposed to a position, which is a collection of tasks assigned to a specific individual. Within a job, there may be pay categories which are dependent on the degree of supervision required by the employee while performing assigned tasks which are performed by all persons with the same job.</p><p class="depth0">Job class of employees means employees performing in positions within the same job.</p><p class="depth0">Labor cost at standard means a preestablished measure of the labor element of cost, computed by multiplying labor-rate standard by labor-time standard.</p><p class="depth0">Labor market means a place where individuals exchange their labor for compensation.
