                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 46.308, insert the following clause in  solicitations and contracts for research and development when (a) the  primary objective is the delivery of end items other than designs,  drawings, or reports, and (b) a cost-reimbursement contract is  contemplated; unless use of the clause is impractical and the clause  prescribed in 46.309 is considered to be more appropriate:</p><p class="depth0">Inspection of Research and Development--Cost-Reimbursement (MAY 2001)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. As used in this clause--</p><p class="depth0">Contractor's managerial personnel means the Contractor's directors,  officers, managers, superintendents, or equivalent representatives who  have supervision or direction of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All or substantially all of the Contractor's business;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All or substantially all of the Contractor's operation at any  one plant or separate location where the contract is being performed; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A separate and complete major industrial operation connected  with performing this contract.</p><p class="depth0">Work includes data when the contract does not include the Warranty  of Data clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system  acceptable to the Government covering the work under this contract.  Complete records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor  shall be maintained and made available to the Government during contract  performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The Government has the right to inspect and test all work called  for by the contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times,  including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance.  The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or  its subcontractors engaged in the contract performance. The Government  shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly  delay the work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If the Government performs any inspection or test on the  premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall  furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable  facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of  these duties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Unless otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall  accept work as promptly as practicable after delivery, and work shall be  deemed accepted 90 days after delivery, unless accepted earlier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> At any time during contract performance, but no later than 6  months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after  acceptance of all of the end items (other than designs, drawings, or  reports) to be delivered under the contract, the Government may require  the Contractor to replace or correct work not meeting contract  requirements. Time devoted to the replacement or correction of such work  shall not be included in the computation of the above time period.  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (h) below, the cost of  replacement or correction shall be determined as specified in the  Allowable Cost and Payment clause, but no additional fee shall be paid.  The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance work required to be  replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for  replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the  corrective action taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness  to perform required replacement or correction, the Government may--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction,  charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or make an equitable  reduction in any fixed fee paid or payable under the contract;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Require delivery of any undelivered articles and shall have the  right to make an equitable reduction in any fixed fee paid or payable  under the contract; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Terminate the contract for default.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Failure to agree on the amount of increased cost to be charged  the Contractor or to the reduction in fixed fee shall be a dispute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Notwithstanding paragraphs (f) and (g) above, the Government may  at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or  replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the  Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the  failure is due to (1) fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct  on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel or (2) the conduct  of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the  Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has  reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless  or unqualified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> This clause shall apply in the same manner to a corrected or  replacement end item or components as to work originally delivered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> The Contractor has no obligation or liability under the contract  to correct or replace articles not meeting contract requirements at time  of delivery, except as provided in this clause or as may otherwise be  specified in the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Unless otherwise provided in the contract, the Contractor's  obligations to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be  governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.</p><p class="depth0">(End of clause)</p><p class="depth0">Alterate I (APR 1984). If it is contemplated that the contract will  be on a no-fee basis, substitute paragraphs (f) and (g) below for  paragraphs (f) and (g) of the basic clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6  months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after  acceptance of all of the end items (other than designs, drawings, or  reports) to be delivered under the contract, the Government may require  the Contractor to correct or replace work not meeting contract  requirements. Time devoted to the correction or replacement of such work  shall not be included in the computation of the above time period.  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g) below, the allowability of  the cost of any such replacement or correction shall be determined as  specified in the Allowable Cost and Payment clause. The Contractor shall  not tender for acceptance corrected work without disclosing the former  requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the  corrective action taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to  perform required replacement or correction, the Government may (1) by  contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction and charge  to the Contractor any increased cost, (2) require delivery of any  undelivered articles, or (3) terminate the contract for default. Failure  to agree on the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor  shall be a dispute.  [48 FR 42478, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 66 FR 2135, Jan. 10, 2001]</p>
