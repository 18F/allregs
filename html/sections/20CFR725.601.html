                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Act, together with certain incorporated provisions from the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, contains a number of provisions which subject an operator or other employer, claimants and others to penalties for failure to comply with certain provisions of the Act, or failure to commence and continue prompt periodic payments to a beneficiary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is the policy and intent of the Department to vigorously enforce the provisions of this part through the use of the remedies provided by the Act. Accordingly, if an operator refuses to pay benefits with respect to a claim for which the operator has been adjudicated liable, the Director shall invoke and execute the lien on the property of the operator as described in Sec. 725.603. Enforcement of this lien shall be pursued in an appropriate U.S. district court. If the Director determines that the remedy provided by Sec. 725.603 may not be sufficient to guarantee the continued compliance with the terms of an award or awards against the operator, the Director shall in addition seek an injunction in the U.S. district court to prohibit future noncompliance by the operator and such other relief as the court considers appropriate (see Sec. 725.604). If an operator unlawfully suspends or terminates the payment of benefits to a claimant, the district director shall declare the award in default and proceed in accordance with Sec. 725.605. In all cases payments in addition to compensation (see Sec. 725.607) and interest (see Sec. 725.608) shall be sought by the Director or awarded by the district director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In certain instances the remedies provided by the Act are concurrent; that is, more than one remedy might be appropriate in any given case. In such a case, the Director shall select the remedy or remedies appropriate for the enforcement action. In making this selection, the Director shall consider the best interests of the claimant as well as those of the fund.</p>
