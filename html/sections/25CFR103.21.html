                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An eligible lender must request interest subsidy payments on  behalf of an eligible borrower, after determining that the borrower  qualifies. Typically, the lender should include a request for interest  subsidy at the time it applies for a guaranty or insurance coverage  under the Program. A request for interest subsidy must be supported by  the information required in Sec. Sec. 103.12 and   103.13 (relating to loan guaranty and insurance coverage applications).  BIA approves, returns, or rejects interest subsidy requests in the same  manner indicated in Sec. 103.16, based on the factors in Sec. 103.20  and BIA's available resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> BIA's approval of interest subsidy for an insured loan may  provide for specific limitations on the manner in which the lender and  borrower can modify the loan.</p>
