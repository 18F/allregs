The circumstances are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the proposed action is, or is closely similar to, one which normally requires the preparation of an EIS pursuant to Sec. 50.42(b) but it is determined, as a result of an EA or in the course of preparation of a draft EIS, that the proposed action will not have a significant impact on the human environment; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the nature of the proposed action is without precedent and does not appear to require more than an assessment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In such cases, the FONSI must be concurred in by the AS/CPD and the Program Environmental Clearance Officer. Notice of the availability of the FONSI shall be given to the public in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (d) of Sec. 50.23.</p>
