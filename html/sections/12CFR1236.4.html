If a regulated entity currently is operating under a cease-and-desist order entered into pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 4631 or 4632, or a formal or informal agreement, or must file a response to a report of examination or report of inspection, it may, with the permission of FHFA, submit the corrective plan required under this section as part of the regulated entity's compliance with that order, agreement or response, subject to the deadline in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, but the corrective plan would not become a part of the order, agreement, or response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Amendment of corrective plan.

Within thirty (30) calendar days of receiving a corrective plan or proposed amendment to a plan, FHFA will notify the regulated entity in writing of its decision on the plan, will direct the regulated entity to submit additional information, or will notify the regulated entity in writing that FHFA has established a different deadline.</p>
