The court's determination on any appeal heard  under this paragraph shall be based solely on the factual record made  before the FAA. The court may modify the determination of fees and other  expenses only if the court finds that the failure to make an award of  fees and other expenses, or the calculation of the amount of the award,  was unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>
