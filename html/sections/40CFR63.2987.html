                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must prescribe the monitoring that will be performed to ensure compliance with these emission limitations. Minimum monitoring requirements are listed in table 1 of this subpart. Your plan must specify the items listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each process and control device to be monitored, the type of monitoring device that will be used, and the operating parameters that will be monitored.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A monitoring schedule that specifies the frequency that the parameter values will be determined and recorded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The operating limits or ranges for each parameter that represent continuous compliance with the emission limits in Sec. 63.2983. Operating limits and ranges must be based on values of the monitored parameters recorded during performance tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must establish routine and long-term maintenance and inspection schedules for each control device. You must incorporate in the schedules the control device manufacturer's recommendations for maintenance and inspections or equivalent procedures. If you use a thermal oxidizer, the maintenance schedule must include procedures for annual or more frequent inspection of the thermal oxidizer to ensure that the structural and design integrity of the combustion chamber is

maintained. At a minimum, you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (10) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inspect all burners, pilot assemblies, and pilot sensing devices for proper operation. Clean pilot sensor if necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ensure proper adjustment of combustion air and adjust if necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inspect, when possible, all internal structures (such as baffles) to ensure structural integrity per the design specifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Inspect dampers, fans, and blowers for proper operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Inspect motors for proper operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Inspect, when possible, combustion chamber refractory lining. Clean and repair or replace lining if necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Inspect the thermal oxidizer shell for proper sealing, corrosion, and hot spots.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> For the burn cycle that follows the inspection, document that the thermal oxidizer is operating properly and make any necessary adjustments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Generally observe whether the equipment is maintained in good operating condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Complete all necessary repairs as soon as practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must establish procedures for responding to operating parameter deviations. At a minimum, the procedures must include the information in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Procedures for determining the cause of the operating parameter deviation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Actions for correcting the deviation and returning the operating parameters to the allowable ranges or limits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Procedures for recording the date and time that the deviation began and ended, and the times corrective actions were initiated and completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Your plan must specify the recordkeeping procedures to document compliance with the emissions and operating limits. Table 1 of this subpart establishes the minimum recordkeeping requirements.
