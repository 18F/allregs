Calibration and Quality Assurance</p><p class="depth0">5.1 FIA calibration and linearity check. Make necessary adjustments  to the air and fuel supplies for the FIA and ignite the burner. Allow  the FIA to warm up for the period recommended by the manufacturer.  Inject a calibration gas into the measurement system and adjust the  back-pressure regulator to the value required to achieve the flow rates  specified by the manufacturer. Inject the zero- and the high-range  calibration gases and adjust the analyzer calibration to provide the  proper responses. Inject the low- and mid-range gases and record the  responses of the measurement system. The calibration and linearity of  the system are acceptable if the responses for all four gases are within  5 percent of the respective gas values. If the performance of the system  is not acceptable, repair or adjust the system and repeat the linearity  check. Conduct a   calibration and linearity check after assembling the analysis system and  after a major change is made to the system.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Systems drift checks. Select the calibration gas that most  closely approximates the concentration of the captured emissions for  conducting the drift checks. Introduce the zero and calibration gas at  the calibration valve assembly and verify that the appropriate gas flow  rate and pressure are present at the FIA. Record the measurement system  responses to the zero and calibration gases. The performance of the  system is acceptable if the difference between the drift check  measurement and the value obtained in section 5.1 is less than 3 percent  of the span value. Conduct the system drift checks at the end of each  run.</p><p class="depth0">5.3 System check.

Criteria of a Temporary Total Enclosure</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Any NDO shall be at least 4 equivalent opening diameters from  each VOC emitting point.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Any exhaust point from the enclosure shall be at least 4  equivalent duct or hood diameters from each NDO.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 The total area of all NDO's shall not exceed 5 percent of the  surface area of the enclosure's four walls, floor, and ceiling.</p><p class="depth0">3.4 The average facial velocity (FV) of air through all NDO's shall  be at least 3,600 m/hr (200 fpm). The direction of air through all NDO's  shall be into the enclosure.</p><p class="depth0">3.5 All access doors and windows whose areas are not included in  section 3.3 and are not included in the calculation in section 3.4 shall  be closed during routine operation of the process.</p><p class="depth0">4. Criteria of a Permanent Total Enclosure</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Same as sections 3.1 and 3.3-3.5.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 All VOC emissions must be captured and contained for discharge  through a control device.</p><p class="depth0">5. Procedure</p><p class="depth0">5.1 Determine the equivalent diameters of the NDO's and determine  the distances from each VOC emitting point to all NDO's. Determine the  equivalent diameter of each exhaust duct or hood and its distance to all  NDO's. Calculate the distances in terms of equivalent diameters. The  number of equivalent diameters shall be at least 4.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Measure the total area (At) of the enclosure and the  total area (AN) of all NDO's of the enclosure. Calculate the  NDO to enclosure area ratio (NEAR) as follows:  NEAR=AN/At</p><p class="depth0">The NEAR must be <=0.05.</p><p class="depth0">5.3 Measure the volumetric flow rate, corrected to standard  conditions, of each gas stream exiting the enclosure through an exhaust  duct or hood using EPA Method 2. In some cases (e.g., when the building  is the enclosure), it may be necessary to measure the volumetric flow  rate, corrected to standard conditions, of each gas stream entering the  enclosure through a forced makeup air duct using Method 2. Calculate FV  using the following equation:  FV=[QO-QI]/AN  Where:  QO=the sum of the volumetric flow from all gas streams  exiting the enclosure through an exhaust duct or hood. QI=the sum of the volumetric flow from all gas streams into  the enclosure through a forced makeup air duct; zero, if there is no  forced makeup air into the enclosure. AN=total area of all NDO's in enclosure.</p><p class="depth0">The FV shall be at least 3,600 m/hr (200 fpm).</p><p class="depth0">5.4 Verify that the direction of air flow through all NDO's is  inward. Use streamers, smoke tubes, tracer gases, etc. Strips of plastic  wrapping film have been found to be effective. Monitor the direction of  air flow at intervals of at least 10 minutes for at least 1 hour.</p><p class="depth0">6. Quality Assurance</p><p class="depth0">6.1 The success of this protocol lies in designing the TTE to  simulate the conditions that exist without the TTE, i.e., the effect of  the TTE on the normal flow patterns around the affected facility or the  amount of fugitive VOC emissions should be minimal. The TTE must enclose  the application stations, coating reservoirs, and all areas from the  application station to the oven. The oven does not have to be enclosed  if it is under negative pressure. The NDO's of the temporary enclosure  and a fugitive exhaust fan must be properly sized and placed.</p><p class="depth0">6.2 Estimate the ventilation rate of the TTE that best simulates the  conditions that exist without the TTE, i.e., the effect of the TTE on  the normal flow patterns around the affected facility or the amount of  fugitive   VOC emissions should be minimal. Figure 1 may be used as an aid. Measure  the concentration (CG) and flow rate (QG) of the  captured gas stream, specify a safe concentration (CF) for  the fugitive gas stream, estimate the CE, and then use the plot in  Figure 1 to determine the volumetric flowrate of the fugitive gas stream  (QF). A fugitive VOC emission exhaust fan that has a variable  flow control is desirable.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.1 Monitor the concentration of VOC into the capture device  without the TTE. To minimize the effect of temporal variation on the  captured emissions, the baseline measurement should be made over as long  a time period as practical. However, the process conditions must be the  same for the measurement in section 6.2.3 as they are for this baseline  measurement. This may require short measuring times for this quality  control check before and after the construction of the TTE.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.2 After the TTE is constructed, monitor the VOC concentration  inside the TTE. This concentration shall continue to increase and must  not exceed the safe level according to OSHA requirements for permissible  exposure limits. An increase in VOC concentration indicates poor TTE  design or poor capture efficiency.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.3 Monitor the concentration of VOC into the capture device with  the TTE. To limit the effect of the TTE on the process, the VOC  concentration with and without the TTE must be within 10 percent. If the measurements do not agree, adjust the  ventilation rate from the TTE until they agree within 10 percent.
