                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, effective April 1,  1986, slots may be bought, sold or leased for any consideration and any  time period and they may be traded in any combination for slots at the  same airport or any other high density traffic airport. Transfers,  including leases, shall comply with the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests for confirmation must be submitted in writing to Slot  Administration Office, AGC-230, Office of the Chief Counsel, Federal  Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC  20591, in a format to be prescribed by the Administrator. Requests will  provide the names of the transferor and recipient; business address and  telephone number of the persons representing the transferor and  recipient; whether the slot is to be used for an arrival or departure;  the date the slot was acquired by the transferor; the section of this  subpart under which the slot was allocated to the transferor; whether  the slot has been used by the transferor for international or essential  air service operations; and whether the slot will be used by the  recipient for international or essential air service operations. After  withdrawal priorities have been established under Sec. 93.223 of this  part, the requests must include the slot designations of the transferred  slots as described in Sec. 93.223(b)(5).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The slot transferred must come from the transferor's then- current FAA-approved base.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Written evidence of each transferor's consent to the transfer  must be provided to the FAA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The recipient of a transferred slot may not use the slot until  written confirmation has been received from the FAA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Until a slot obtained by a new entrant or limited incumbent  carrier in a lottery held under Sec. 93.225 after June 1, 1991, has been  used by the carrier that obtained it for a continuous 24-month period  after the lottery in accordance with Sec. 93.227(a), that slot may be  transferred only by trade for one or more slots at the same airport or  to other new entrant or limited incumbent carriers under  Sec. 93.221(a)(5)(iii). This transfer restriction shall apply to the  same extent to any slot or slots acquired by trading the slot obtained  in a   lottery. To remove the transfer restriction, documentation of 24 months'  continuous use must be submitted to the FAA Office of the Chief Counsel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Failure to use a slot acquired by trading a slot obtained in a  lottery for a continuous 24-month period after the lottery, shall void  all trades involving the lottery slot, which shall be returned to the  FAA. All use of the lottery slot shall be counted toward fulfilling the  minimum use requirements under Sec. 93.227(a) applicable to the slot or  slots for which the lottery slot was traded, including subsequent  trades.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Slots obtained by new entrant or limited incumbent carriers in  a lottery may be sold, leased, or otherwise transferred to another  entrant or limited incumbent carrier after a minimum of 60 days of use  by the obtaining carrier. The transfer restrictions of  Sec. 93.221(a)(5)(i) shall continue to apply to the slot until  documentation of 24 months' continuous use has been submitted and the  transfer restriction removed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The Office of the Secretary of Transportation must determine  that the transfer will not be injurious to the essential air service  program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A record of each slot transfer shall be kept on file by the  office specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and will be made  available to the public upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Air carriers and commuter operators considered to be a single  operator under the provisions of Sec. 93.213(c) of this subpart but  operating under separate names shall report transfers of slots between  them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notwithstanding Sec. 93.123(c)(2) of this part, a commuter slot  at O'Hare International Airport may be used with an aircraft described  in Sec. 93.123(c)(1) of this part on the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Air carrier aircraft that may be operated under this paragraph  are limited to aircraft:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Having an actual seating configuration of 110 or fewer  passengers; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Having a maximum certificated takeoff weight of less than  126,000 pounds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No more than 50 percent of the total number of commuter slots  held by a slot holder at O'Hare International Airport may be used with  aircraft described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An air carrier or commuter operator planning to operate an  aircraft described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section in a commuter  slot shall notify ATC at least 75 days in advance of the planned start  date of such operation. The notice shall include the slot number,  proposed time of operation, aircraft type, aircraft series, actual  aircraft seating configuration, and planned start date. ATC will approve  or disapprove the proposed operation no later than 45 days prior to the  planned start date. If an operator does not initiate operation of a  commuter slot under this section within 30 days of the planned start  date first submitted to the FAA, the ATC approval for that operation  will expire. That operator may file a new or revised notice for the same  half-hour slot time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An operation may not be conducted under paragraph (e)(1) of this  section unless a gate is available for that operation without planned  waiting time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For the purposes of this paragraph (e), notice to ATC shall be  submitted in writing to: Director, Air Traffic System Management, ATM-1,  Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW.,  Washington, DC 20591.
