                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determination of voting stock. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On or before April 10 of each  year, each Bank shall deliver to FHFA a capital stock report that  indicates, as of the record date, the number of members located in each  voting State in the Bank's district, the number of shares of Bank stock  that each member (identified by its FHFA ID number) was required to  hold, and the number of shares of Bank stock that all members located in  each voting State were required to hold. If a Bank has issued more than  one class of stock, it shall report the total shares of stock of all  classes required to be held by the members. The Bank shall certify to  FHFA that, to the best of its knowledge, the information provided in the  capital stock report is accurate and complete, and that it has notified  each member of its minimum capital stock holding requirement as of the  record date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a Bank's capital plan was not in effect as of the record  date, the number of shares of Bank stock that any member was required to  hold as of the record date shall be determined in accordance with  Sec. Sec. 1263.20 and 1263.22 of this chapter. If a Bank's capital plan  was in effect as of the record date, the number of shares of Bank stock  that any member was required to hold as of the record date shall be  determined in accordance with the minimum investment established by the  capital plan for that Bank; however, for any member whose Bank stock is  less than the minimum investment during a transition period, the amount  of Bank stock to be reported shall be the number of shares of Bank stock  actually owned by the member as of the record date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Designation of member directorships as stock directorships.  Using the method of equal proportions, the Director annually will  conduct a designation of member directorships for each Bank based on the  number of shares of Bank stock required to be held by the members in  each State as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year. If a Bank  has issued more than one class of stock, the Director will designate the  directorships for each State in that Bank district based on the combined  number of shares required to be held by the members in that State. For  purposes of conducting the designation, if a Bank's capital plan was not  in effect on the immediately preceding December 31, the number of shares  of Bank stock required to be held by members as of that date shall be  determined in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1263.20 and 1263.22 of this  chapter. If a Bank's capital plan was in effect on the immediately  preceding December 31, the number of shares of Bank stock required to be  held by members as of that date shall be determined in accordance with  the minimum investment established by such capital plan; however, for  any members whose Bank stock is less than the minimum investment during  a transition period, the amount of stock to be used in the designation  of directorships shall be the number of shares of Bank stock actually  owned by those members as of that December 31. In all cases, the  Director will designate the directorships by using the information  provided by each Bank in its capital stock report required by paragraph  (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of the Bank Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notification. On or before June 1 of each year, FHFA will notify  each Bank in writing of the total number of directorships established  for the Bank and the number of member directorships designated as  representing the members in each voting state in the Bank district.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Change of state. If the annual designation of member  directorships results in an existing directorship being redesignated as  representing members in a different State, that directorship shall be  deemed to terminate in the previous State as of December 31 of that  year, and a new directorship to begin in the succeeding State as of  January 1 of the next year. The new directorship shall be filled by vote  of the members in the succeeding State and, in order to maintain the  staggered terms of directorships, shall be adjusted to a term equal to  the remaining term of the previous directorship if it had not been  redesignated to another State.  [74 FR 51460, Oct. 7, 2009. Redesignated and amended at 75 FR 17039,  17040, Apr. 5, 2010]</p>
