                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with section 18(e) of the Act and procedures in 29 CFR part 1902, and after determination that the State met the ``fully effective'' compliance staffing benchmarks as revised in 1984 in response to a Court Order in AFL-CIO v. Marshall (CA 74-406), and was satisfactorily providing reports to OSHA through participation in the Federal-State Unified Management Information System, the Assistant Secretary evaluated actual operations under the Utah State plan for a period of at least one year following certification of completion of developmental steps (41 FR 51014). Based on the 18(e) Evaluation Report for the period of October 1, 1982 through March 31, 1984, and after opportunity for public comment, the Assistant Secretary determined that in operation the State of Utah's occupational safety health program is at least as effective as the Federal program in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment and meets the criteria for

final State plan approval in section 18(e) of the Act and implementing regulations at 29 CFR part 1902. Accordingly, the Utah plan was granted final approval and concurrent Federal enforcement authority was relinquished under section 18(e) of the Act effective July 16, 1985.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as otherwise noted, the plan which has received final approval covers all activities of employers and all places of employment in Utah. The plan does not cover private sector maritime employment; employment on Hill Air Force Base; employment at the U.S. Department of Energy's Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserve, to the extent that it remains a U.S. DOE facility; Federal government employers and employees; the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), including USPS employees, and contract employees and contractor-operated facilities engaged in USPS mail operations; the enforcement of the field sanitation standard, 29 CFR 1928.110, and the enforcement of the temporary labor camps standard, 29 CFR 1910.142, with respect to any agricultural establishment where employees are engaged in ``agricultural employment'' within the meaning of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, 29 U.S.C. 1802(3), regardless of the number of employees, including employees engaged in hand packing of produce into containers, whether done on the ground, on a moving machine, or in a temporary packing shed, except that Utah retains enforcement responsibility over agricultural temporary labor camps for employees engaged in egg, poultry, or red meat production, or the post-harvest processing of agricultural or horticultural commodities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Utah is required to maintain a State program which is at least as effective as operations under the Federal program; to submit plan supplements in accordance with 29 CFR part 1953; to allocate sufficient safety and health enforcement staff to meet the benchmarks for State staffing established by the U.S. Department of Labor, or any revisions to those benchmarks; and, to furnish such reports in such form as the Assistant Secretary may from time to time require.
