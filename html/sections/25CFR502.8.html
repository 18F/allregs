                            <p class="depth0">Electronic or electromechanical facsimile means a game played in an  electronic or electromechanical format   that replicates a game of chance by incorporating all of the  characteristics of the game, except when, for bingo, lotto, and other  games similar to bingo, the electronic or electromechanical format  broadens participation by allowing multiple players to play with or  against each other rather than with or against a machine.
