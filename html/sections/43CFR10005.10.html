                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Within Utah, several federal agencies, state agencies, and tribal  governments have authorities and responsibilities related to the  management of fish and wildlife resources, through management of the  resource itself, through management of the land and water upon which  fish and wildlife depend, or, in the case of Federal reclamation  projects, through involvement in mitigation activities. The Act  specifically recognizes the authority of other Federal and State  agencies to take actions in accordance with other applicable laws. The  guidance for this is provided by Section 301(a)(2), which states that  ``Nothing herein is intended to limit or restrict the authorities of  Federal, State, or local governments, or political subdivisions thereof,  to plan, develop, or implement mitigation, conservation, or enhancement  of fish, wildlife, or recreation resources in the State in accordance  with applicable provisions of Federal or State law.'' In preparing and  implementing its plan, it is the Commission's intent to form a  cooperative partnership with other agencies having fish, wildlife, and  recreation responsibilities and authorities, both recognizing and  relying upon their authorities. The Commission recognizes that these  agencies may have specific legal obligations to take actions to maintain  or restore fish, wildlife, or recreation resources that are independent  of Commission mandates. While the Commission will, as appropriate,  authorize the use of funds to complement the resource protection and  restoration activities of these agencies, Commission involvement should  not be viewed as a replacement for funding or other actions that are  rightfully the responsibility of another agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agencies with land management authority. The Commission  recognizes that the Federal government, the State of Utah, and  applicable Indian tribes each own and/or manage lands that are important  to fish and wildlife resources   and provide significant outdoor recreation opportunities. At the Federal  level, the Forest Service manages National Forest System lands, the Fish  and Wildlife Service manages national wildlife refuges, the National  Park Service manages national parks, monuments, and recreation areas,  the Bureau of Reclamation manages reservoirs and lands adjoining those  reservoirs, and the Bureau of Land Management manages other public  lands. Indian tribes own and manage lands in accordance with treaties  between the tribes and the United States Government. The State of Utah  owns and manages state parks, wildlife management areas, and public  trust lands. The Commission recognizes the importance of federal,  tribal, and state lands to fish, wildlife, and recreation and will  entertain proposals for mitigation and conservation activities involving  these lands when the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The managing agency concurs with the proposed action,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All appropriate legal procedures have been followed, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The land management agency is willing to assume long-term  responsibility for operation and maintenance of mitigation and  conservation features and to refrain from management activities that may  negate or significantly diminish the effects of the project on fish,  wildlife, or recreation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agencies with Federal reclamation project mitigation  responsibilities and/or authorities. Several agencies also have direct  authorities and responsibilities relating to mitigation for the effects  of Federal reclamation projects in Utah. These include the Department of  the Interior Central Utah Project Office, the Bureau of Reclamation, the  Central Utah Water Conservancy District, the Fish and Wildlife Service,  and the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. The remainder of this  section summarizes the authorities and responsibilities of these  agencies with regards to Federal reclamation projects, with emphasis on  the Commission's relationship to these agencies. This section does not  identify or describe all of the potential relationships between the  Commission and other agencies with Federal reclamation project  mitigation obligations. As appropriate, the Commission may enter into  formal agreements with any or all of the above agencies in order to  provide additional detail regarding the relationship or to assign  specific program or project responsibilities. The arrangements that are  described in this section may also be modified through interagency  agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Secretary of the Interior's Representative to the Central Utah  Project. As required by Section 201(e) of the Act, the Secretary of the  Interior is ultimately responsible for carrying out all responsibilities  specifically identified in the Act. The Secretary's Representative  serves as the Secretary's official representative to the Central Utah  Project. The Secretary's Representative monitors activities undertaken  in fulfillment of the various aspects of the Act to ensure that these  activities, including mitigation activities, are in accordance with  applicable law and that Federal funds are used appropriately. The  Secretary's Representative also coordinates activities among Department  of the Interior agencies involved with the Central Utah Project. The  Commission is a Federal Commission within the executive branch of  government and its activities are subject to the direct oversight of  Congress. While essentially independent of the Secretary of the  Interior, the Commission nevertheless has a vital relationship with the  Department via both the budget process and the similarity in missions.  The Secretary's Representative serves as the principal link between the  Commission and the Department of the Interior and is responsible for  transmitting Congressional appropriations to fund the Commission's  mitigation, conservation, and administrative activities. For purposes of  plan development and implementation, the following will guide the  Commission's relationship to the Secretary's Representative:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Commission acknowledges the authority of the Secretary in  overseeing implementation of the Act and recognizes that the Secretary's  Representative plays an essential role in ensuring the compatibility of  mitigation and conservation measures with the overall Central Utah  Project. The Commission is committed to a strong   and productive partnership with the Secretary's Representative in  fulfilling the Commission's mitigation and conservation  responsibilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Commission will maintain close communication with the  Secretary's Representative regarding the relationship between the plan  and Congressional appropriations. The Commission will provide the  Secretary's Representative with both long range and annual funding  proposals and otherwise assist in preparing the Commission's budget  requests to Congress.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Commission and the Secretary's Representative will  independently and cooperatively monitor the plan in terms of meeting  Section 8 mitigation obligations as directed by the Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The Commission will actively involve the Secretary's  Representative in the Commission's NEPA related activities, including  the identification of appropriate roles for the Secretary's  Representative and Department of the Interior agencies in the  preparation and review of NEPA documents.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The Commission will, as appropriate, involve the Secretary's  Representative in coordinating Commission mitigation and conservation  activities with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and with individual Indian  tribes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The Commission will utilize the Secretary's Representative as  its principal contact for matters regarding the Department of the  Interior and, when appropriate, will seek assistance from the  Secretary's Representative in coordinating activities involving agencies  within the Department, especially when activities involve several  agencies. The Commission will, as appropriate, involve the Secretary's  Representative in resolving differences that might arise among the  various agencies within the Department with regard to the Commission's  plan, or the implementation of any measure contained in the plan. This  provision does not alter the direct working relationships that the  Commission maintains with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau  of Reclamation, the Bureau of Land Management, and other applicable  agencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> U.S.D.I. Bureau of Reclamation. Prior to the Act, the Bureau of  Reclamation (Bureau) had the responsibility for implementing mitigation  measures associated with Federal reclamation projects within the State  of Utah. Section 301(a)(1) of the Act granted authority to the  Commission ``to coordinate the implementation of the mitigation and  conservation provisions of this Act.'' Section 301(n) further  transferred from the Bureau to the Commission ``the responsibility for  implementing Section 8 funds for mitigation and conservation projects  and features authorized in this Act.'' While the Act therefore clearly  transfers mitigation responsibilities concerning the Bonneville Unit of  the Central Utah Project from the Bureau to the Commission, it does not  alter the Bureau's mitigation responsibilities with respect to other  components of the Colorado River Storage Project or other Federal  reclamation projects in Utah. For purposes of plan development and  implementation, the following will guide the Commission's relationship  to the Bureau:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Commission recognizes that the Bureau and the Commission  share fish, wildlife, and recreation mitigation responsibilities  associated with Federal reclamation projects within the State of Utah  and is committed to maintaining a strong and productive partnership with  the Bureau in this regard.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Except for those features that the Secretary has assigned to  others in allocating the $214,352,000 increase in CRSP authorization  specified in Section 201(a) of the Act, the Commission has the primary  authority and responsibility for all mitigation projects involving use  of Section 8 funds for the Bonneville Unit and for alternative  formulations of the Uintah and Upalco units of the Central Utah Project,  and all mitigation projects identified in Section 315 of the Act, or as  modified in the plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Bureau retains the responsibility and primary authority to  undertake fish, wildlife, and recreation mitigation and conservation  activities for Federal reclamation projects in Utah other than those as  described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section wherein the Bureau  acts at the direction of the Commission. The Commission also has   the authority to undertake selective fish, wildlife, and recreation  mitigation and conservation activities concerning these same projects,  as authorized in Section 315 of the Act or in the plan. The Commission  will actively consult with the Bureau with regard to potential  mitigation or enhancement activities in those areas in order to ensure  that Bureau and Commission mitigation activities are coordinated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The Bureau retains responsibility for implementation of fish,  wildlife, and recreation mitigation measures associated with Federal  reclamation projects in Utah that were initiated prior to the  establishment of the Act where that responsibility has not specifically  been transferred to the Commission, a water district, or other entity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The Bureau retains responsibility for operation, maintenance,  and replacement of facilities related to fish, wildlife, and recreation  mitigation measures undertaken by the Bureau where that responsibility  has not specifically been transferred to the Commission, a water  district, or other entity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The Bureau retains responsibility for mitigating future impacts  to fish, wildlife, and recreation caused by operation, maintenance, and  replacement of water resource development facilities where that  responsibility has not specifically been transferred to the Commission,  a water district, or other entity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The Commission has no responsibility or authority for  mitigation or replacement measures associated with Federal reclamation  projects in Utah that are not related to fish, wildlife, and recreation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Central Utah Water Conservancy District. The Central Utah Water  Conservancy District (District) is responsible for construction,  operation, and management of the various features of the Central Utah  Project. NEPA compliance regarding many of these features has resulted  in the identification of several measures that are to be undertaken as  mitigation for the Central Utah Project's impacts to fish, wildlife,  and/or recreation. NEPA compliance for future project features is likely  to identify additional fish, wildlife, and recreation mitigation and  conservation measures. The Act directs that the Commission give funding  priority to measures that result from applicable NEPA procedures. The  Act does not, however, specify what role the Commission is to have in  determining, or planning for, these measures. For purposes of plan  development and implementation, the following will guide the  Commission's relationship to the District:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Commission is committed to maintaining a strong and  productive partnership with the District in order to adequately plan for  and implement mitigation measures associated with the Central Utah  Project.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Commission recognizes that the District and the Commission  have complementary responsibilities for fish, wildlife, and recreation  mitigation regarding the Central Utah Project. The District retains the  overall responsibility for planning for mitigation activities associated  with its completion of the Central Utah Project. The Commission has the  responsibility for ensuring that mitigation measures meet with the  intent of the Act with regard to protection and restoration of fish,  wildlife, and recreation resources and for approving and implementing  mitigation and conservation measures. Accordingly, the Commission will  monitor District mitigation and conservation planning activities and  provide such assistance as is mutually agreed upon.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Commission will actively monitor or, as appropriate,  participate in NEPA procedures undertaken by the District that may  result in the identification of mitigation and conservation measures  that, if implemented, would require Commission funding or may affect  other mitigation activities of interest to the Commission. For NEPA  procedures that are likely to result in significant Commission  obligations, the Commission may request ``joint lead agency'' status  with the District. In such instances the specific involvement of the  Commission in the preparation of NEPA documentation will be determined  through agreement with the District.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The District retains responsibility for mitigating future  impacts to   fish, wildlife, and recreation caused by the operation, maintenance, and  replacement of its water resource development facilities, unless that  responsibility has been specifically transferred to the Commission or  other entity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The District retains responsibility for operation, maintenance,  and, where necessary, replacement of fish, wildlife, and recreation  mitigation features managed by the District, unless that responsibility  has been specifically transferred to the Commission or other entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service (Service) has mandated responsibility to implement several acts  relevant to the Commission's activities. In Section 301(b)(3), the Act  specifically references a Commission obligation to comply with the Fish  and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA) and the Endangered Species Act  (ESA). Other acts administered by the Service and relevant to Commission  activities include, but are not necessarily limited to, the Migratory  Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.) and the Bald Eagle Protection  Act (16 U.S.C. 668-668d). The FWCA directs that the Service, and the  state fish and wildlife agency, must be consulted where the ``waters of  any stream or other body of water are proposed or authorized to be  impounded, diverted * * * or otherwise controlled or modified * * * by  any department or agency of the United States, or by any public or  private agency under Federal permit or license. * * *'' The purpose of  this consultation is to provide for ``the conservation of wildlife  resources by preventing loss of and damage to such resources.'' The FWCA  provides the major mechanism for Service involvement in the Federal  reclamation project decision process. The Service's most important role  in Federal reclamation projects is in the development and later the  monitoring of fish and wildlife mitigation measures. The Service is also  responsible for reporting to the Secretary of the Interior on the status  of mitigation programs. The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act provides  for the funding of Service FWCA consultation by the agency sponsoring  the proposed activity. The Service's ESA responsibilities that are most  relevant to Commission activities include listing of new species,  preparation and implementation of recovery plans and consultations  regarding adverse effects on listed species. Section 7(a)(1) of the  Endangered Species Act authorizes Federal agencies to carry out programs  for the conservation of endangered and threatened species. Participating  in, and being consistent with, recovery plans is a fundamental component  of this obligation. Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA requires that, prior to  taking any action that may affect a listed species, a Federal agency  must consult with the Service to ensure that the action will not  jeopardize the continued existence of the species or adversely modify  critical habitat. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) establishes a  Federal role in protecting bird species that generally migrate across  national boundaries. In Utah, these include most indigenous bird  species. The MBTA is not intended as a substitute for state wildlife  management authority but rather as a complement. The Service is  responsible for implementing many of the features of the MBTA, and for  encouraging states to undertake actions to protect migratory bird  species. The Bald Eagle Protection Act prohibits the taking or  possession of either bald or golden eagles, both of which commonly  inhabit areas near Utah's rivers and wetlands. For purposes of plan  development and implementation, the following will guide the  Commission's relationship to the Service:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Commission acknowledges the biological expertise of the  Service with regard to Federal reclamation projects and other Commission  activities relating to the protection and restoration of fish and  wildlife resources and will seek to utilize this expertise to the  fullest extent. The Commission further recognizes the similarity in  agency missions with regard to fish and wildlife mitigation and  conservation and is committed to a strong and productive partnership  with the Service in this regard.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Commission acknowledges the Service's mandated  responsibility with regard to Federal reclamation projects and will  specifically consult with the Service regarding activities   that are subject to the FWCA. These include both projects directly  related to mitigation for Federal water resource projects and applicable  fish, wildlife, and recreation conservation projects. In developing its  plan and adopting specific projects, the Commission will give  significant weight to the Service's recommendations. Should the  Commission choose to not follow Service recommendations, it will seek  resolution through active consultation with the Service. As appropriate,  the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources will be asked to be involved in  these consultations as that agency also has co-responsibilities under  the FWCA. Should no agreement be reached, the Commission will document  its decision and provide this to the Service. The Commission recognizes  that the Service has a responsibility to forward its FWCA reports to the  Secretary regardless of the resolution of issues contained in the  reports. The Commission recognizes that several projects contained in  Title II, Section 304, and Section 315 have previously been subjected to  Service evaluation pursuant to FWCA. Prior to reallocating funds  authorized for these projects, the Commission will formally consult with  the Service regarding the relative adequacy of proposed new projects, or  significant modifications to Title II, Section 304, or Section 315  projects, in mitigating for impacts to fish and wildlife resources.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Commission will comply with applicable provisions of the  ESA and, accordingly, will consult with the Service regarding activities  that may affect a listed or candidate species, regardless whether the  effect is beneficial or adverse. In addition, the Commission will  endeavor to undertake mitigation and conservation projects that are  consistent with an adopted recovery plan for a listed species and that  aid in the protection of candidate species.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The Commission will, in accordance with the Act, formally seek  the Service's approval prior to reallocating funds from a project whose  primary objectives are the protection and/or restoration of fish and  wildlife resources to a project whose objectives are primarily related  to recreation. No such funds will be reallocated unless this meets with  the approval of the Service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The Commission anticipates that the Service will be an active  participant in the planning for, and implementation, of mitigation and  conservation projects undertaken pursuant to the Commission's plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The Commission will invite the Service to participate in NEPA  activities undertaken or funded by the Commission that bear on fish and/ or wildlife resources. The form that this participation will take will  be determined on a case-by-case basis and will require agreement on the  part of both agencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. As is the case with other  states, the State of Utah has the exclusive jurisdiction over non- migratory fish and wildlife and shared jurisdiction (with the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service) over all migratory birds and Federally listed  threatened and endangered fish and wildlife within the state. The  applicable state law is Utah Code, Section 23-15-2, which states that  ``All wildlife within the state, including but not limited to wildlife  on public or private lands or in public or private waters within the  state, shall fall within the jurisdiction of the Division of Wildlife  Resources.'' The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (UDWR) has  authorities and responsibilities at the state level similar to those of  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the Federal level, and, like the  Service, has mandated authorities under the Federal Fish and Wildlife  Coordination Act that relate directly to Federal Reclamation project  mitigation. These authorities are described in paragraph (b)(4) of this  section. In addition, the Act provides for the UDWR to assume primary  responsibility for implementing measures associated with the Act after  the Commission expires. In addition to the UDWR's responsibilities and  authorities discussed above, the State of Utah also has jurisdiction  over other activities that are relevant to the Commission's plan,  including the granting of water rights and, except on Federal and tribal  lands, management of land use. For purposes of plan development and  implementation, the following will   guide the Commission's relationship to the UDWR:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Commission acknowledges the biological expertise of the UDWR  with regard to Federal reclamation projects and other Commission  activities relating to the protection and restoration of fish and  wildlife resources and will seek to utilize this expertise to the  fullest extent practicable. The Commission further recognizes the  similarity in agency missions with regard to fish and wildlife  mitigation and conservation and is committed to a strong and productive  partnership with the UDWR in this regard.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Commission acknowledges the UDWR's authority over the  management of fish and wildlife within the State and will take no action  that is inconsistent with this authority.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Commission acknowledges that the UDWR has a mandated  authority regarding the planning and monitoring of Federal reclamation  mitigation. As is the case with the Service, the Commission will  formally consult with the UDWR regarding projects that are subject to  the FWCA. These include both projects directly related to mitigation for  Federal reclamation projects and applicable fish and wildlife  conservation projects not directly related to any Federal reclamation  project. Consultation will be in accordance with procedures defined in  the FWCA. It is anticipated that this consultation will be conducted in  conjunction with the Service. However, the Commission recognizes that  the UDWR has the right to prepare recommendations independent of the  Service should it so desire. The Commission will, in making its  decisions, give significant weight to recommendations made by the UDWR.  Should the Commission choose to not follow the UDWR's recommendations,  it will seek to resolve outstanding issues through active consultation  with the UDWR. As appropriate, the Service will be asked to be involved  in these consultations. Should no agreement be reached, the Commission  will document its decision and provide this to the UDWR. The Commission  recognizes that several mitigation projects contained in Title II,  Section 304, and Section 315 have previously been subjected to the UDWR  evaluation pursuant to FWCA. As is the case with the Service, the  Commission will specifically consult with the UDWR prior to  significantly modifying or reallocating funds away from these projects.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The Commission will specifically consult with the UDWR  regarding any project that might have an affect on species identified by  the UDWR as wildlife species of special concern and species listed by  the UDWR Natural Heritage Program as G1 and G2 plant and animal species.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The Commission anticipates that the UDWR will be an active  participant in the planning for, and implementation, of mitigation and  conservation projects undertaken pursuant to the Commission's plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The Commission will invite the UDWR to participate in NEPA  activities undertaken or funded by the Commission that bear on fish and/ or wildlife resources. The form that this participation will take will  be determined on a case-by-case basis and will require agreement on the  part of both agencies.</p>
