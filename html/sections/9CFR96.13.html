                            <p class="depth0">Foreign animal casings offered for importation into the United  States without certification may be disinfected, as prescribed in this  section, under the supervision of an APHIS inspector for use as food  containers, as an alternative for foreign certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Disinfect the casings in a solution made as follows: Dissolve 90  pounds common salt in 100 gallons water and mix. Add 2\3/4\ gallons  (10.35 liters) C. P. hydrochloric acid containing not less than 35  percent actual HCl and mix throughly. The finished solution must contain  not less than 1 percent actual hydrochloric acid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Containers of the disinfectant solution may be either of wood or  of metal, but the interior surfaces must be protected by means of an  acid resistant coating.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Not more than 175 pounds casings shall be treated with each 100  gallons of the solution. After the treatment of 175 pounds of casings,  or at the end of the day if less than 175 pounds of casings are  disinfected in any one day, the solution shall be discarded unless means  are provided for accurately determining the loss of strength. In event  means for accurately determining loss of strength are provided it will  be permissible to restore the strength of the solution with fresh acid  and use it repeatedly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Shake as much of the adherent salt as possible from the casings  and weigh them. Bundles must be separated but individual hanks need not  be untied. Place the casings in the disinfecting solution a few hanks at  a time with vigorous agitation to insure the fullest possible contact of  the solution with them. Then keep the casings completely submerged in  the solution for not less than three-fourths of an hour.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Remove the casings from the solution, rinse them with water, and  place them in a solution containing 8\1/2\ pounds of sodium bicarbonate  in each 100 gallons of water. 100 gallons of this solution is sufficient  for 175 pounds of casings. Keep the casings in this solution for 30  minutes, moving them about frequently and vigorously so as to insure  complete contact of the solution with the casings. After this  neutralization, remove the casings from the sodium bicarbonate solution  and wash them to remove the excess of bicarbonate.
