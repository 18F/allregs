                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the standard requirements of local cooperation and  according to the circumstances, local participation in project work may  be in the form of: contributed funds; the furnishing of materials,  equipment, or services; and/or accomplishment of work either  concurrently or within a specified reasonable period of time. The final  terms agreed upon will be set forth in writing and made a part of the CA  before commencement of work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contributed funds. Contributed funds may be accepted, or  refunded, without further reference or approval by the Chief of  Engineers. The required certificate of the district commander will cite  33 U.S.C. 701h as the pertinent authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Obligation of contributed funds. Per OMB Circular A-34, all  contributed funds must be received in cash and deposited with the  Treasury before any obligations can be made against such funds. Public  Law 84-99 assistance for well construction is exempted from this  requirement because financing is specifically authorized. However, the  CA for such well construction assistance (see subpart G of this part)  must be signed in advance of any obligations. To reduce administrative  problems, CA terms for well construction should be for no longer a  period than that which will allow for payments within the means of the  applicant. Public Law 84-99 limits the term to a maximum of 30 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Provision of work or services in kind. To the extent  practicable, local interests should be allowed to minimize the amount of  contributed funds by providing equivalent work or services in kind. Such  services do not include LERRD's.</p>
