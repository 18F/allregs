Sec. 201.51a  Special procedures for purity analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Uniform Blowing Procedure shall be used for the separation of pure seed and inert matter in the following: Kentucky bluegrass, Canada bluegrass, rough bluegrass, Pensacola variety of bahiagrass, orchardgrass, blue grama, and side-oats grama.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When kinds listed in this section appear in mixtures they shall be separated from other kinds before using the Uniform Blowing Procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To determine the blowing point for these procedures, individual calibration samples for Kentucky bluegrass, orchardgrass, and Pensacola variety of bahiagrass shall be used. The calibration sample for Kentucky bluegrass shall be used for Canada bluegrass, rough bluegrass, blue grama, and side-oats grama.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The blowing point for Canada bluegrass shall be the same as the blowing point determined for Kentucky bluegrass.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The blowing point for rough bluegrass shall be a factor of 0.82 (82 percent) of the blowing point determined for Kentucky bluegrass. The 0.82 factor is restricted to the General-type seed blower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The blowing point for blue grama shall be a factor of 1.157 of the blowing point determined for Kentucky bluegrass. Before blowing, extraneous material that will interfere with the blowing process shall be removed. The sample to be blown shall be divided into four approximately equal parts and each blown separately. The 1.157 factor is restricted to the General-type seed blower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The blowing point for side-oats grama shall be a factor of 1.480 of the blowing point determined for Kentucky bluegrass. Before blowing, extraneous material that will interfere with the blowing process shall be removed.

After completing the blowing procedure, remove all weed and other crop seeds from the light portion and add these to the weed or other crop separation, as appropriate. The remainder of the light portion shall be considered inert matter. Remove all weed and other crop seeds and other inert matter (stems, leaves, dirt) from the heavy portion and add these to the weed seed, other crop seed, or inert matter separations, as appropriate. The remainder of the heavy portion shall be considered pure seed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> With orchardgrass, after the blowing, proceed with the multiple unit procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Multiple Unit Procedure of determining the pure seed fraction shall be used only for the kinds included in the following table when multiple units are present in a sample. These methods are applicable to the kinds listed when they occur in mixtures or singly. Any single unit without attached structures, as described below, shall be considered a single unit. Multiple units and single units for the kinds listed shall remain intact.

The remaining multiple unit weight shall be added to the weight of the inert matter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For mixtures that include one or more of the kinds in the following table, determine the percentage of single units, based on the total weight of single units and multiple units, for each kind.

Secs. 201.51a (a) and (b) shall not be followed.
