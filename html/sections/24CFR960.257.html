If no such verification is available, then the PHA must obtain third-party verification of income amounts in order to calculate the change in income for the source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For any family member whose income is determined pursuant to a streamlined income determination, a PHA must obtain

third-party verification of all income amounts every 3 years.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p>
