                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prior to filing an application for conversion, you must adopt a business plan reflecting your intended plans for deployment of the proposed conversion proceeds. Your business plan is required, under Sec. 192.150, to be included in your conversion application. At a minimum, your business plan must address:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Your projected operations and activities for three years following the conversion. You must describe how you will deploy the conversion proceeds at the converted savings association (and holding company, if applicable), what opportunities are available to reasonably achieve your planned deployment of conversion proceeds in your proposed market areas, and how your deployment will provide a reasonable return on investment commensurate with investment risk, investor expectations, and industry norms, by the final year of the business plan. You must include three years of projected financial statements. The business plan must provide that the converted savings association must retain at least 50 percent of the net conversion proceeds. The appropriate Federal banking agency may require that a larger percentage of proceeds remain in the institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Your plan for deploying conversion proceeds to meet credit and lending needs in your proposed market areas. The appropriate Federal banking agencies strongly discourage business plans that provide for a substantial investment in mortgage securities or other securities, except as an interim measure to facilitate orderly, prudent deployment of proceeds during the three years following the conversion, or as part of a properly managed leverage strategy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The risks associated with your plan for deployment of conversion proceeds, and the effect of this plan on management resources, staffing, and facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The expertise of your management and board of directors, or that you have planned for adequate staffing and controls to prudently manage the growth, expansion, new investment, and other operations and activities proposed in your business plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You may not project returns of capital or special dividends in any part of the business plan. A newly converted company may not plan on stock repurchases in the first year of the business plan.</p>
