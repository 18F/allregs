An allowance for unredeemed loans and purchase  agreement deliveries, any supplemental payments resulting from price  support operations, and the value of marketing certificates, such as  those received by producers of wheat pursuant to the Agricultural  Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, and others of generally similar  character and effect, shall be added to the price specified above.  Prices received for milk wholesale, milkfat, beef cattle, sheep, and  lambs shall include wartime subsidy payments as provided by section  301(a)(1)(B). For Maryland Tobacco, type 32, the price data for each  calendar year shall be the weighted average price of type 32 tobacco  sold during the period January 1-December 31.
