                            <p class="depth0">Take the following steps to prepare PEMS for field testing:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Verify that ambient conditions at the start of the test are within the limits specified in the standard-setting part. Continue to monitor these values to determine if ambient conditions exceed the limits during the test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Install a PEMS and any accessories needed to conduct a field test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Power the PEMS and allow pressures, temperatures, and flows to stabilize to their operating set points.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Bypass or purge any gaseous sampling PEMS instruments with ambient air until sampling begins to prevent system contamination from excessive cold-start emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Conduct calibrations and verifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Operate any PEMS dilution systems at their expected flow rates using a bypass.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If you use a gravimetric balance to determine whether an engine meets an applicable PM standard, follow the procedures for PM sample preconditioning and tare weighing as described in Sec.  1065.590. Operate the PM-sampling system at its expected flow rates using a bypass.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Verify the amount of contamination in the PEMS HC sampling system before the start of the field test as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Select the HC analyzer range for measuring the maximum concentration expected at the HC standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Zero the HC analyzers using a zero gas or ambient air introduced at the analyzer port. When zeroing a FID, use the FID's burner air that would be used for in-use measurements (generally either ambient air or a portable source of burner air).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Span the HC analyzer using span gas introduced at the analyzer port.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Overflow zero or ambient air at the HC probe inlet or into a tee near the probe outlet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Measure the HC concentration in the sampling system:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For continuous sampling, record the mean HC concentration as overflow zero air flows.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For batch sampling, fill the sample medium and record its mean concentration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Record this value as the initial HC concentration, xTHCinit, and use it to correct measured values as described in Sec.  1065.660.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the initial HC concentration exceeds the greater of the following values, determine the source of the contamination and take corrective action, such as purging the system or replacing contaminated portions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 2% of the flow-weighted mean concentration expected at the standard or measured during testing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 2 [micro]mol/mol.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If corrective action does not resolve the deficiency, you may use a contaminated HC system if it does not prevent you from demonstrating compliance with the applicable emission standards.
