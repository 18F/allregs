The mortgagor is not permitted to

pay any additional origination fee of any kind to a mortgage broker or sponsored third-party originator. A mortgage broker's fee can be included as part of the origination fee only if the mortgage broker is engaged independently by the homeowner and there is no financial interest between the mortgage broker and the mortgagee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reasonable and customary amounts, but not more than the amount actually paid by the mortgagee, for any of the following items:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Recording fees and recording taxes, or other charges incident to the recordation of the insured mortgage;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Credit report;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Survey, if required by the mortgagee or the mortgagor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Title examination;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Mortgagee's title insurance;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Fees paid to an appraiser for the initial appraisal of the property; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Such other charges as may be authorized by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Repair administration fee.

The mortgagee shall collect the repair fee by adding it to the mortgage balance.
