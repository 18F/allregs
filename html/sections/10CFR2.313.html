The Commission may provide in  the notice of hearing that one or more members of the Commission, an  administrative law judge, an administrative judge, an Atomic Safety and  Licensing Board, or a named officer who has been delegated final  authority in the matter, shall be the presiding officer. The Commission  alone shall designate the presiding officer in a hearing conducted under  subpart O. If the Commission does not designate the presiding officer  for a hearing under subparts G, J, K, L, M, or N of this part, then the  Chief Administrative Judge shall issue an order designating:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An Atomic Safety and Licensing Board appointed under Section 191  of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or an administrative law  judge appointed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3105, for a hearing conducted under  subparts G, J, K, L, or N of this part; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, an administrative law  judge, or an administrative judge for a hearing conducted under subpart  M of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disqualification. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a designated presiding officer or a  designated member of an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board believes that  he or she is disqualified to preside or to participate as a board member  in the hearing, he or she shall withdraw by notice on the record and  shall notify the Commission or the Chief Administrative Judge, as  appropriate, of the withdrawal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a party believes that a presiding officer or a designated  member of an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board should be disqualified,  the party may move that the presiding officer or the Licensing Board  member disqualify himself or herself. The motion must be supported by  affidavits setting forth the alleged grounds for disqualification. If  the presiding officer does not grant the motion or the Licensing Board  member does not disqualify himself, the motion must be referred to the  Commission. The Commission will determine the sufficiency of the grounds  alleged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unavailability. If a presiding officer or a designated member of  an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board becomes unavailable during the  course of a hearing, the Commission or the Chief Administrative Judge,  as appropriate, will designate another presiding officer or Atomic  Safety and Licensing Board member.
