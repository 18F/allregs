                            <p class="depth0">This subpart sets forth the requirements for the Customs drawback  compliance program in which claimants and other parties in interest,  including Customs brokers, may participate after being certified by  Customs. Participation in the program is voluntary. Under the program,  Customs is required to inform potential drawback claimants and related  parties clearly about their rights and obligations under the drawback  law and regulations. Reduced penalties and/or warning letters may be  issued once a party has been certified for the program, and is in  general compliance with the appropriate procedures and requirements  thereof.</p>
