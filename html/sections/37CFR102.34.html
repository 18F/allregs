                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> Some systems of records under the Act which are maintained by USPTO contain, from time-to-time, material subject to the exemption appearing at 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1), relating to national defense and foreign policy materials. The systems of records published in the Federal Register by USPTO which are within this exemption are: COMMERCE/PAT-TM-6, COMMERCE/PAT-TM-7, COMMERCE/PAT-TM-8, COMMERCE/PAT-TM-9.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Some systems of records under the Act which are maintained by USPTO contain, from time-to-time, material subject to the exemption appearing at 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1), relating to national defense and foreign policy materials. The systems of records published in the Federal Register by USPTO which are within this exemption are: COMMERCE/PAT-TM-6, COMMERCE/PAT-TM-7, COMMERCE/PAT-TM-8, COMMERCE/PAT-TM-9.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> USPTO hereby asserts a claim to exemption of such materials wherever they might appear in such systems of records, or any systems of records, at present or in the future. The materials would be exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), and (f) to protect materials required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of the national defense and foreign policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The specific exemptions determined to be necessary and proper with respect to systems of records maintained by USPTO, including the parts of each system to be exempted, the provisions of the Act from which they are exempted, and the justification for the exemption, are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). The systems of records exempt (some only conditionally), the sections of the Act from which exempted, and the reasons therefor are as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). The systems of records exempt (some only conditionally), the sections of the Act from which exempted, and the reasons therefor are as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Investigative Records--Contract and Grant Frauds and Employee Criminal Misconduct--COMMERCE/DEPT-12, but only on condition that the general exemption claimed in Sec.  102.33(b)(3) is held to be invalid;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Investigative Records--Persons Within the Investigative Jurisdiction of USPTO--COMMERCE/DEPT-13;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Litigation, Claims and Administrative Proceeding Records--COMMERCE/DEPT-14;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Attorneys and Agents Registered to Practice Before the Office--COMMERCE/PAT-TM-1;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Complaints, Investigations and Disciplinary Proceedings Relating to Registered Patent Attorneys and Agents--COMMERCE/PAT-TM-2; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Non-Registered Persons Rendering Assistance to Patent Applicants--COMMERCE/PAT-TM-5.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The foregoing are exempted from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f). The reasons for asserting the exemption are to prevent subjects of investigation from frustrating the investigatory process, to insure the proper functioning and integrity of law enforcement activities, to prevent disclosure of investigative techniques, to maintain the ability to obtain necessary information, to fulfill commitments made to sources to protect their identities and the confidentiality of information and to avoid endangering these sources and law enforcement personnel. Special note is taken of the fact that the proviso clause in this exemption imports due process and procedural protections for the individual. The existence and general character of the information exempted will be made known to the individual to whom it pertains.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5). The systems of records exempt (some only conditionally), the sections of the act from which exempted, and the reasons therefor are as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5). The systems of records exempt (some only conditionally), the sections of the act from which exempted, and the reasons therefor are as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Investigative Records--Contract and Grant Frauds and Employee Criminal Misconduct--COMMERCE/DEPT-12, but only on condition that the general exemption claimed in Sec.  102.33(b)(3) is held to be invalid;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Investigative Records--Persons Within the Investigative Jurisdiction of USPTO--COMMERCE/DEPT-13; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Litigation, Claims, and Administrative Proceeding Records--COMMERCE/DEPT-14.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The foregoing are exempted from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), and (f). The reasons for asserting the exemption are to maintain the ability to obtain candid and necessary information, to fulfill commitments made to sources to protect the confidentiality of information, to avoid endangering these sources and, ultimately, to facilitate proper selection or continuance of the best applicants

or persons for a given position or contract. Special note is made of the limitation on the extent to which this exemption may be asserted. The existence and general character of the information exempted will be made known to the individual to whom it pertains.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> At the present time, USPTO claims no exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) (3), (4), (6) and (7).</p><p class="depth2">Sec.
