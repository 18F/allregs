If the contracting officer's statement of  facts indicates misconduct on the part of the contractor in regard to an  NRC contract, the Head of the Contracting Activity will refer the matter  of misconduct to the Inspector General to determine if an investigation  is required prior to referring the case to the suspension official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To the extent the Head of the Contracting Activity believes that  sufficient grounds for debarment exist, independent of any pending  investigation by the Inspector General, the Head of the Contracting  Activity shall immediately forward the case, without reference to any  pending investigation, and a recommendation for action to the Senior  Procurement Executive for review. In such circumstances, the Head of the  Contracting Activity will take no additional action in regard to a  specific matter of misconduct referred to the Inspector General prior to  consulting with the Inspector General.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em>. If the contractor fails to submit a timely written  response within 30 days after receipt of the notice in accordance with  FAR 9.407-3(c)(5), the suspending official may notify the contractor in  accordance with FAR 9.407-3(d) that the contractor is suspended.</p>
