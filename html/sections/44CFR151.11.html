Claims shall be submitted to the Director, FEMA, Washington, DC, 20472. Each claim shall include the following information:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Name, address, jurisdiction and nature (volunteer, private, municipal, etc.) of claimant's fire service organization;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Name, title, address and telephone number of individual authorized by the claimant fire service to make this claim in its behalf and his/her certification as to the accuracy of the information provided;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Name and telephone number of Federal employee familiar with the facts of the event and the name and address of the Federal agency having jurisdiction over the property on which the fire occurred;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Proof of authority to fight the fire (source of alarm, whether fire service was requested by responsible Federal official or whether such an official accepted the assistance when offered);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Personnel and equipment committed to fighting of fire (type of equipment and number of items); and an itemized list of direct expenses (e.g., hours of equipment operation, fuel costs, consumables, overtime pay and wages for any specially hired personnel) and direct losses (e.g., damaged or destroyed equipment, to include purchase cost, estimate of the cost of repairs, statement of depreciated value immediately preceding and subsequent to the damage or destruction and the extent of insurance coverage) actually incurred in fighting the fire.

If this information is available when the claim is submitted, it should accompany the claim. If it is not, the information should be submitted as soon as practicable, but no later than 15 days after the end of the Federal fiscal year in which the fire occurred.
