Cover sheet.</p><p class="depth0">The cover sheet will not exceed one page. It will include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The name of the NRC office responsible for preparing the statement and a list of any cooperating agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The title of the proposed action that is the subject of the statement with a list of the states, counties or municipalities where the facility or other subject of the action is located, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The name, address, and telephone number of the individual in NRC who can supply further information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A designation of the statement as a draft or final statement, or a draft or final supplement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> A one paragraph abstract of the statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> For draft environmental impact statements, the date by which comments must be received.

The minimum comment period is 45 days (see Sec. 51.73.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">3. Summary.</p><p class="depth0">Each environmental impact statement will contain a summary which adequately and accurately summarizes the statement. The summary will stress the major issues considered. The summary will discuss the areas of controversy, will identify any remaining issues to be resolved, and will present the major conclusions and recommendations. The summary will normally not exceed 15 pages.</p><p class="depth0">4. Purpose of and need for action.</p><p class="depth0">The statement will briefly describe and specify the need for the proposed action. The alternative of no action will be discussed. In the case of nuclear power plant construction or siting, consideration will be given to the potential impact of conservation measures in determining the demand for power and consequent need for additional generating capacity.</p><p class="depth0">5. Alternatives including the proposed action.</p><p class="depth0">This section is the heart of the environmental impact statement. It will present the environmental impacts of the proposal and the alternatives in comparative form. Where important to the comparative evaluation of alternatives, appropriate mitigating measures of the alternatives will be discussed. All reasonable alternatives will be identified. The range of alternatives discussed will encompass those proposed to be considered by the ultimate decisionmaker. An otherwise reasonable alternative will not be excluded from discussion solely on the ground that it is not within the jurisdiction of the NRC. \4\ The discussion of alternatives will take into accounts, without duplicating, the environmental information and analyses included in sections, 4., 6. and 7. of this appendix.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ With respect to limitations on NRC's NEPA authority and responsibility imposed by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, see Sec.

Affected environment.</p><p class="depth0">The environmental impact statement will succinctly describe the environment to be affected by the proposed action. Data and analyses in the statement will be commensurate with the importance of the impact, with less important material summarized, consolidated, or simply referenced. Effort and attention will be concentrated on important issues; useless bulk will be eliminated.</p><p class="depth0">7. Environmental consequences and mitigating actions.</p><p class="depth0">This section discusses the environmental consequences of alternatives, including the proposed actions and any mitigating actions which may be taken. Alternatives eliminated from detailed study will be identified and a discussion of those alternatives will be confined to a brief statement of the reasons why the alternatives were eliminated. The level of information for each alternative considered in detail will reflect the depth of analysis required for sound decisionmaking.</p><p class="depth0">The discussion will include any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the alternative be implemented, the relationship between short-term uses of man's environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity, and any irreversible or irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the alternative should it be implemented. This section will include discussions of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Direct effects and their significance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Indirect effects and their significance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Possible conflicts between the alternative and the objectives of Federal, regional, State, and local (and in the case of a reservation, Indian tribe) land use plans, policies and controls for the area concerned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Means to mitigate adverse environmental impacts.</p><p class="depth0">8. List of preparers.</p><p class="depth0">The environmental impact statement will list the names and qualifications (expertise, experience, professional disciplines), of the persons who were primarily responsible for preparing the environmental impact statement or significant background papers. Persons responsible for making an independent evaluation of information submitted by the applicant or petitioner for rulemaking or others will be included in the list. Where possible, the persons who are responsible for a particular analysis, including analyses in background papers, will be identified.</p><p class="depth0">9. Appendices.</p><p class="depth0">An appendix to an environmental impact statement will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Consist of material prepared in connection with an environmental impact statement (as distinct from material which is not so prepared and which is incorporated by reference (40 CFR 1502.21)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Normally consist of material which substantiates any analysis fundamental to the impact statement. Discussion of methodology used may be placed in an appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Normally be analytic.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Be relevant to the decision to be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Be circulated with the environmental impact statement or be readily available on request.</p><p class="depth0">Discussion of Footnotes</p><p class="depth0">1. Tiering.</p><p class="depth0">40 CFR 1502.20 states:</p><p class="depth0">``Agencies are encouraged to tier their environmental impact statements to eliminate repetitive discussions of the same issues and to focus on the actual issues ripe for decision at each level of environmental review

(Sec. 1508.28). Whenever a broad environmental impact statement has been prepared (such as a program or policy statement) and a subsequent statement or environmental assessment is then prepared on an action included within the entire program or policy (such as a site specific action) the subsequent statement or environmental assessment need only summarize the issues discussed in the broader statement and incorporate discussions from the broader statement by reference and shall concentrate on the issues specific to the subsequent action. The subsequent document shall state where the earlier document is available. Tiering may also be appropriate for different stages of actions. (Sec. 1508.28).''</p><p class="depth0">40 CFR 1508.28 states:</p><p class="depth0">`` `Tiering' refers to the coverage of general matters in broader environmental impact statements (such as national program or policy statements) with subsequent narrower statements or environmental analyses (such as regional or basinwide program statements or ultimately site-specific statements) incorporating by reference the general discussions and concentrating solely on the issues specific to the statement subsequently prepared. Tiering is appropriate when the sequence of statements or analyses is:</p><p class="depth0">``(a) From a program, plan, or policy environmental impact statement to a program, plan, or policy statement or analysis of lesser scope or to a site-specific statement or analysis.</p><p class="depth0">``(b) From an environmental impact statement on a specific action at an early stage (such as need and site selection) to a supplement (which is preferred) or a subsequent statement or analysis at a later stage (such as environmental mitigation). Tiering in such cases is appropriate when it helps the lead agency to focus on the issues which are ripe for decision and exclude from consideration issues already decided or not yet ripe.''</p><p class="depth0">Incorporation by reference. 40 CFR 1502.21 states:</p><p class="depth0">``Agencies shall incorporate material into an environmental impact statement by reference when the effect will be to cut down on bulk without impeding agency and public review of the action. The incorporated material shall be cited in the statement and its content briefly described. No material may be incorporated by reference unless it is reasonably available for inspection by potentially interested persons within the time allowed for comment. Material based on proprietary data which is itself not available for review and comment shall not be incorporated by reference.''</p><p class="depth0">2. Adoption.</p><p class="depth0">40 CFR 1506.3 states:</p><p class="depth0">``(a) An agency may adopt a Federal draft or final environmental impact statement or portion thereof provided that the statement or portion thereof meets the standards for an adequate statement under these regulations.</p><p class="depth0">``(b) If the actions covered by the original environmental impact statement and the proposed action are substantially the same, the agency adopting another agency's statement is not required to recirculate it except as a final statement. Otherwise the adopting agency shall treat the statement as a draft and recirculate it (except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section).</p><p class="depth0">``(c) A cooperating agency may adopt without recirculating the environmental impact statement of a lead agency when, after an independent review of the statement, the cooperating agency concludes that its comments and suggestions have been satisfied.</p><p class="depth0">``(d) When an agency adopts a statement which is not final within the agency that prepared it, or when the action it assesses is the subject of a referral under part 1504, or when the statement's adequacy is the subject of a judicial action which is not final, the agency shall so specify.''

The impacts to the public from radiological</p><p class="depth0">impacts from other than the disposal of                   exposures have been considered by the Commission in</p><p class="depth0">spent fuel and high-level waste.                          Table S-3 of this part. Based on information in the</p><p class="depth0">GEIS, impacts to individuals from radioactive gaseous</p><p class="depth0">and liquid releases, including radon-222 and</p><p class="depth0">technetium-99, would remain at or below the NRC's</p><p class="depth0">regulatory limits.Offsite radiological impacts--collective               1  There are no regulatory limits applicable to</p><p class="depth0">impacts from other than the disposal of                   collective doses to the general public from fuel-</p><p class="depth0">spent fuel and high-level waste.                          cycle facilities. The practice of estimating health</p><p class="depth0">effects on the basis of collective doses may not be</p><p class="depth0">meaningful. All fuel-cycle facilities are designed</p><p class="depth0">and operated to meet the applicable regulatory limits</p><p class="depth0">and standards. The Commission concludes that the</p><p class="depth0">collective impacts are acceptable.</p><p class="depth0">The Commission concludes that the impacts would not be</p><p class="depth0">sufficiently large to require the NEPA conclusion,</p><p class="depth0">for any plant, that the option of extended operation</p><p class="depth0">under 10 CFR part 54 should be eliminated.</p><p class="depth0">Accordingly, while the Commission has not assigned a</p><p class="depth0">single level of significance for the collective</p><p class="depth0">impacts of the uranium fuel cycle, this issue is</p><p class="depth0">considered Category 1.Nonradiological impacts of the uranium fuel            1  SMALL.

Unless the</p><p class="depth0">significance level is identified as beneficial, the impact is adverse, or in the case of ``small,'' may be</p><p class="depth0">negligible. The definitions of significance follow:SMALL--For the issue, environmental effects are not detectable or are so minor that they will neither</p><p class="depth0">destabilize nor noticeably alter any important attribute of the resource. For the purposes of assessing</p><p class="depth0">radiological impacts, the Commission has concluded that those impacts that do not exceed permissible levels in</p><p class="depth0">the Commission's regulations are considered small as the term is used in this table.MODERATE--For the issue, environmental effects are sufficient to alter noticeably, but not to destabilize,</p><p class="depth0">important attributes of the resource.LARGE--For the issue, environmental effects are clearly noticeable and are sufficient to destabilize important</p><p class="depth0">attributes of the resource.For issues where probability is a key consideration (i.e., accident consequences), probability was a factor in</p><p class="depth0">determining significance.\4\ This issue applies only to the in-scope portion of electric power transmission lines, which are defined as</p><p class="depth0">transmission lines that connect the nuclear power plant to the substation where electricity is fed into the</p><p class="depth0">regional power distribution system and transmission lines that supply power to the nuclear plant from the</p><p class="depth0">grid.\5\ NA (not applicable). The categorization and impact finding definitions do not apply to these issues.\6\ If, in the future, the Commission finds that, contrary to current indications, a consensus has been reached</p><p class="depth0">by appropriate Federal health agencies that there are adverse health effects from electromagnetic fields, the</p><p class="depth0">Commission will require applicants to submit plant-specific reviews of these health effects as part of their</p><p class="depth0">license renewal applications. Until such time, applicants for license renewal are not required to submit</p><p class="depth0">information on this issue.
