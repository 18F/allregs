                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When undistributed surplus property is transferred to a Federal  agency or another SASP, or disposed of by public sale, you are entitled  to recoup:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Direct costs you initially paid to the Federal holding agency,  including but not limited to, packing, preparation for shipment, and  loading. You will not be reimbursed for actions following receipt of the  property, including unloading, moving, repairing, preserving, or  storage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transportation costs you incurred, but were not reimbursed by a  donee, for initially moving the property from the Federal holding agency  to your distribution facility or other point of receipt. You must  document and certify the amount of reimbursement requested for these  costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reimbursable arrangements should be made prior to transfer of  the property. In the case of a Federal transfer, GSA will secure  agreement of the Federal agency to reimburse your authorized costs, and  annotate the amount of reimbursement on the transfer document. You must  coordinate and make arrangements for reimbursement when property is  transferred to another SASP. If you and the receiving SASP cannot agree  on an appropriate reimbursement charge, GSA will determine appropriate  reimbursement. The receiving SASP must annotate the reimbursement amount  on the transfer document prior to its being forwarded to GSA for  approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When undistributed property is disposed of by public sale, GSA  must approve the amount of sales proceeds you may receive to cover your  costs. Generally, this will not exceed 50 percent of the total sales  proceeds.</p>
