                            <p class="depth0">A Participating CMS Provider is required to receive and transmit three classes of Alert Messages: Presidential Alert; Imminent Threat Alert; and Child Abduction Emergency/AMBER Alert.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Presidential Alert. A Presidential Alert is an alert issued by the President of the United States or the President's authorized designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Imminent Threat Alert. An Imminent Threat Alert is an alert that meets a minimum value for each of three CAP elements: Urgency, Severity, and Certainty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Urgency. The CAP Urgency element must be either Immediate (i.e., responsive action should be taken immediately) or Expected (i.e., responsive action should be taken soon, within the next hour).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Severity. The CAP Severity element must be either Extreme (i.e., an extraordinary threat to life or property) or Severe (i.e., a significant threat to life or property).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certainty. The CAP Certainty element must be either Observed (i.e., determined to have occurred or to be ongoing) or Likely (i.e., has a probability of greater than 50 percent).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Child Abduction Emergency/AMBER Alert. (1) An AMBER Alert is an alert initiated by a local government official based on the U.S. Department of Justice's five criteria that should be met before an alert is activated:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Law enforcement confirms a child has been abducted;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The child is 17 years or younger;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Law enforcement believes the child is in imminent danger of serious bodily harm or death;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> There is enough descriptive information about the victim and the abduction to believe an immediate broadcast alert will help; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The child's name and other data have been entered into the National Crime Information Center.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> There are four types of AMBER Alerts: Family Abduction; Non-family Abduction; Lost, Injured or Otherwise Missing; and Endangered Runaway.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Family Abduction. A Family Abduction (FA) alert involves an abductor who is a family member of the abducted child such as a parent, aunt, grandfather, or stepfather.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Nonfamily Abduction. A Nonfamily Abduction (NFA) alert involves an abductor unrelated to the abducted child, either someone unknown to the child and/or the child's family or an acquaintance/friend of the child and/or the child's family.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Lost, Injured, or Otherwise Missing. A Lost, Injured, or Otherwise Missing (LIM) alert involves a case where the circumstances of the child's disappearance are unknown.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Endangered Runaway. An Endangered Runaway (ERU) alert involves a missing child who is believed to have run away and in imminent danger.</p>
