For each member there shall be an alternate member, and the provisions of this part applicable to the number, nomination, qualification and selection of members shall apply in like manner to alternate members. Three of the members, referred to in this part as ``producer members'', shall be producers or officers or employees of producers, and shall not be handlers, or directors, officers, or employees exercising a supervisory or managerial function of a handler. The six remaining members, referred to in this part as ``producer-handlers'', shall be selected from (a) handlers, or directors, officers or employees of a handler, or (b) producers who are also handlers or directors, officers or employees exercising a supervisory or managerial function of a handler. The Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may issue rules and regulations covering matters of eligibility for producer members, or revising the composition of the Committee prescribed in this section if it no longer is representative following a substantial change in the industry.
