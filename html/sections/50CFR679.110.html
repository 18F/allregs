Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Types of Scales Covered by Appendix--This appendix contains performance and technical requirements for belt, automatic hopper, platform, and hanging scales.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Testing and Approval of Scales Used to Weigh Catch at Sea--Scales used to weigh catch at sea are required to comply with four categories of performance and technical requirements: (1) Type evaluation; (2) initial inspection after installation while the vessel is tied up at a dock and is not under power at sea; (3) annual reinspection while the vessel is tied up at a dock and is not under power at sea; and (4) daily at-sea tests of the scale's accuracy. This appendix contains only the performance and technical requirements for type evaluation and initial and annual reinspections by an authorized scale inspector.</p><p class="depth0">2. Belt Scales</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Applicability. The requirements in this section apply to a scale or scale system that employs a conveyor belt in contact with a weighing element to determine the weight of a bulk commodity being conveyed across the scale.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Performance Requirements--2.2.1 Maximum Permissible Errors. For laboratory tests of a scale and initial inspections and annual reinspections of an installed scale when the vessel is tied up at a dock and is not under power at sea, the following maximum permissible errors (MPEs) are specified:</p><p class="depth0">2.2.1.1 Laboratory Tests.

A belt scale must be equipped with an indicator capable of displaying both the weight of fish in each haul or set and the cumulative weight of all fish or other material weighed on the scale between annual inspections (``the cumulative weight''), a rate of flow indicator, and a printer. The indications and printed representations must be clear, definite, accurate, and easily read under all conditions of normal operation of the belt scale.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.1.2 Values Defined. If indications or printed representations are intended to have specific values, these must be defined by a sufficient number of figures, words, or symbols, uniformly placed with reference to the indications or printed representations and as close as practicable to the indications or printed representations but not so positioned as to interfere with the accuracy of reading.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.1.3 Units.

In the event of a power failure, means must be provided to retain in a memory the weight of fish in each haul or set for which a printed record has not yet been made, the cumulative weight, and the information on the audit trail.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.1.11 Adjustable Components. An adjustable component that when adjusted affects the performance or accuracy of the scale must be held securely in position and must not be capable of adjustment without breaking a security means unless a record of the adjustment is made on the audit trail described in 2.3.1.12.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.1.12 Audit Trail. An audit trail in the form of an event logger must be provided to document changes made using adjustable components. The following information must be provided in an electronic form that cannot be changed or erased by the scale operator, can be printed at any time, and can be cleared by the scale manufacturer's representative upon direction by NMFS or by an authorized scale inspector:</p><p class="depth0">a.
