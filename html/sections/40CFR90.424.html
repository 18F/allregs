                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The CVS is calibrated using an accurate flowmeter and restrictor  valve.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The flowmeter calibration must be traceable to the National  Institute for Standards and Testing (NIST) and serves as the reference  value (NIST ``true'' value) for the CVS calibration. (Note: In no case  should an upstream screen or other restriction which can affect the flow  be used ahead of the flowmeter unless calibrated throughout the flow  range with such a device.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The CVS calibration procedures are designed for use of a  ``metering venturi'' type flowmeter. Large radius or American Society of  Mechanical Engineers (ASME) flow nozzles are considered equivalent if  traceable to NIST measurements. Other measurement systems may be used if  shown to be equivalent under the test conditions in this section and  traceable to NIST measurements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Measurements of the various flowmeter parameters are recorded  and related to flow through the CVS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Procedures using both PDP-CVS and CFV-CVS are outlined in the  following paragraphs. Other procedures yielding equivalent results may  be used if approved in advance by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> After the calibration curve has been obtained, verification of  the entire system may be performed by injecting a known mass of gas into  the system and comparing the mass indicated by the system to the true  mass injected. An indicated error does not necessarily mean that the  calibration is wrong, since other factors can influence the accuracy of  the system (for example, analyzer calibration, leaks, or HC hangup). A  verification procedure is found in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> PDP-CVS calibration. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The following calibration procedure  outlines the equipment, the test configuration, and the various  parameters which must be measured to establish the flow rate of the CVS  pump.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All the parameters related to the pump are simultaneously  measured with the parameters related to a flowmeter which is connected  in series with the pump.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The calculated flow rate, in cm\3\/s, (at pump inlet absolute  pressure and temperature) can then be plotted versus a correlation  function which is the value of a specific combination of pump  parameters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The linear equation which relates the pump flow and the  correlation function is then determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the event that a CVS has a multiple speed drive, a  calibration for each range used must be performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This calibration procedure is based on the measurement of the  absolute values of the pump and flowmeter parameters that relate the  flow rate at each point. Two conditions must be maintained to assure the  accuracy and integrity of the calibration curve:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The temperature stability must be maintained during calibration.  (Flowmeters are sensitive to inlet temperature oscillations; this can  cause the data points to be scattered. Gradual changes in temperature  are acceptable as long as they occur over a period of several minutes.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All connections and ducting between the flowmeter and the CVS  pump must be absolutely void of leakage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> During an exhaust emission test the measurement of these same  pump parameters enables the user to calculate the flow rate from the  calibration equation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Connect a system as shown in Figure 5 in Appendix B of this  subpart. Although particular types of equipment are shown, other  configurations that yield equivalent results may be used if approved in  advance by the Administrator. For the system indicated, the following  measurements and accuracies are required:</p><p class="depth0">Calibration Data Measurements ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Sensor-readout</p><p class="depth0">Parameter             Symbol      Units         tolerances ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Barometric pressure             PB        kPa          [.340 kPa.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(corrected)</em>.

Record the calibration  data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Reset the restrictor valve to a more restricted condition in an  increment of pump inlet depression that will yield a minimum of six data  points for the total calibration. Allow the system to stabilize for  three minutes and repeat the data acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Data analysis:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The air flow rate, Qs, at each test point is  calculated in standard cubic feet per minute 20 C, 101.3 kPa from the  flowmeter data using the manufacturer's prescribed method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The air flow rate is then converted to pump flow,  Vo, in cubic meter per revolution at absolute pump inlet  temperature and pressure:  [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]  Where:  Vo = Pump flow, m\3\/rev at Tp, Pp.

The calibration curves generated for the ranges will be  approximately parallel and the intercept values, Do, will  increase as the pump flow range decreases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> If the calibration has been performed carefully, the calculated  values from the equation will be within [0.50 percent of the measured  value of Vo. Values of M will vary from one pump to another,  but values of Do for pumps of the same make, model, and range  should agree within [three percent of each other. Calibrations should be  performed at pump start-up and after major maintenance to assure the  stability of the pump slip rate. Analysis of   mass injection data will also reflect pump slip stability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> CFV-CVS calibration. (1) Calibration of the CFV is based upon  the flow equation for a critical venturi. Gas flow is a function of  inlet pressure and temperature:  [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]  Where:  Qs = flow rate [m\3\/min.] Kv = calibration coefficient P = absolute pressure [kPa] T = absolute temperature [K]</p><p class="depth0">The calibration procedure described in paragraph (d)(3) of this  section establishes the value of the calibration coefficient at measured  values of pressure, temperature, and air flow.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The manufacturer's recommended procedure must be followed for  calibrating electronic portions of the CFV.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Measurements necessary for flow calibration are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Calibration Data Measurements ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Parameter                    Symbol               Units                      Tolerances ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Barometric Pressure (corrected).

(Leaks between the flow measuring devices  and the critical flow venturi will seriously affect the accuracy of the  calibration.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Set the variable flow restrictor to the open position, start the  blower, and allow the system to stabilize. Record data from all  instruments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Vary the flow restrictor and make at least eight readings across  the critical flow range of the venturi.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Data analysis. The data recorded during the calibration are to  be used in the following calculations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Calculate the air flow rate (designated as Qs) at  each test point in standard cubic feet per minute from the flow meter  data using the manufacturer's prescribed method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Calculate values of the calibration coefficient for each test  point:  [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]  Where:  Qs = Flow rate in standard cubic meters per minute, at the</p><p class="depth0">standard conditions of 20 C, 101.3 kPa. Tv = Temperature at venturi inlet, K. Pv = Pressure at venturi inlet, kPa = PB -</p><p class="depth0">PPI  Where:  PPI = Venturi inlet pressure depression, kPa.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Plot Kv as a function of venturi inlet pressure.  For choked flow, Kv will have a relatively constant value. As  pressure decreases (vacuum increases), the venturi becomes unchoked and  Kv decreases. (See Figure 7 in Appendix B to Subpart D.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For a minimum of eight points in the critical region, calculate  an average Kv and the standard deviation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If the standard deviation exceeds 0.3 percent of the average  Kv , take corrective action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> CVS system verification. The following ``gravimetric'' technique  may be used to verify that the CVS and analytical instruments can  accurately measure a mass of gas that has been injected into the system.  (Verification can also be accomplished by constant flow metering using  critical flow orifice devices.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Obtain a small cylinder that has been charged with 99.5 percent  or greater propane or carbon monoxide gas (CAUTION--carbon monoxide is  poisonous).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determine a reference cylinder weight to the nearest 0.01 grams.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Operate the CVS in the normal manner and release a quantity of  pure propane into the system during the   sampling period (approximately five minutes).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The calculations are performed in the normal way except in the  case of propane. The density of propane (0.6109 kg/m\3\/carbon atom) is  used in place of the density of exhaust hydrocarbons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The gravimetric mass is subtracted from the CVS measured mass  and then divided by the gravimetric mass to determine the percent  accuracy of the system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Good engineering practice requires that the cause for any  discrepancy greater than [two percent must be found and corrected.</p>
