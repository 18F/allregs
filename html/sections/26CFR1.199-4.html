                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The provisions of this section apply solely for purposes of section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). To determine its qualified production activities income (QPAI) (as defined in Sec. 1.199-1(c)) for a taxable year, a taxpayer must subtract from its domestic production gross receipts (DPGR) (as defined in Sec. 1.199-3(a)) the cost of goods sold (CGS) allocable to DPGR and other expenses, losses, or deductions (deductions), other than the deduction allowed under section 199,

that are properly allocable to such receipts. Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules for determining CGS allocable to DPGR. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for determining the deductions that are properly allocable to DPGR. Paragraph (d) of this section provides that a taxpayer generally must determine deductions allocable to DPGR or to gross income attributable to DPGR using Sec. Sec. 1.861-8 through 1.861-17 and Sec. Sec. 1.861-8T through 1.861-14T (the section 861 regulations), subject to the rules in paragraph (d) of this section (the section 861 method). Paragraph (e) of this section provides that certain taxpayers may apportion deductions to DPGR using the simplified deduction method. Paragraph (f) of this section provides a small business simplified overall method that a qualifying small taxpayer may use to apportion CGS and deductions to DPGR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Cost of goods sold allocable to domestic production gross receipts--(1) In general. When determining its QPAI, a taxpayer must subtract from DPGR the CGS allocable to DPGR. A taxpayer determines its CGS allocable to DPGR in accordance with this paragraph (b) or, if applicable, paragraph (f) of this section. In the case of a sale, exchange, or other disposition of inventory, CGS is equal to beginning inventory plus purchases and production costs incurred during the taxable year and included in inventory costs, less ending inventory. CGS is determined under the methods of accounting that the taxpayer uses to compute taxable income. See sections 263A, 471, and 472. If section 263A requires a taxpayer to include additional section 263A costs (as defined in Sec. 1.263A-1(d)(3)) in inventory, additional section 263A costs must be included in determining CGS. CGS allocable to DPGR also includes inventory valuation adjustments such as writedowns under the lower of cost or market method. In the case of a sale, exchange, or other disposition (including, for example, theft, casualty, or abandonment) of non-inventory property, CGS for purposes of this section includes the adjusted basis of the property. CGS allocable to DPGR for a taxable year may include the inventory cost and adjusted basis of qualifying production property (QPP) (as defined in Sec. 1.199-3(j)(1)), a qualified film (as defined in Sec. 1.199-3(k)(1)), or electricity, natural gas, and potable water (as defined in Sec. 1.199-3(l)) (collectively, utilities) that will generate (or have generated) DPGR notwithstanding that the gross receipts attributable to the sale, lease, rental, license, exchange, or other disposition of the QPP, qualified film, or utilities will be, or have been, included in the computation of gross income for a different taxable year. For example, advance payments that are DPGR may be included in gross income under Sec. 1.451-5(b)(1)(i) in a different taxable year than the related CGS allocable to that DPGR. If gross receipts are treated as DPGR pursuant to Sec. 1.199-1(d)(3)(i) or Sec. 1.199-3(i)(4)(i)(B)(6), (l)(4)(iv)(A), (m)(1)(iii)(A), (n)(6)(i), or (o)(2), then CGS must be allocated to such DPGR. Similarly, if gross receipts are treated as non-DPGR pursuant to Sec. 1.199-1(d)(3)(ii) or Sec. 1.199-3(i)(4)(ii), (l)(4)(iv)(B), (m)(1)(iii)(B), or (n)(6)(ii), then CGS must be allocated to such non-DPGR. See Sec. 1.199-3(m)(6)(iv) for rules relating to treatment of certain costs in the case of a taxpayer that uses the land safe harbor under that paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. When determining its QPAI, a taxpayer must subtract from DPGR the CGS allocable to DPGR. A taxpayer determines its CGS allocable to DPGR in accordance with this paragraph (b) or, if applicable, paragraph (f) of this section. In the case of a sale, exchange, or other disposition of inventory, CGS is equal to beginning inventory plus purchases and production costs incurred during the taxable year and included in inventory costs, less ending inventory. CGS is determined under the methods of accounting that the taxpayer uses to compute taxable income. See sections 263A, 471, and 472. If section 263A requires a taxpayer to include additional section 263A costs (as defined in Sec. 1.263A-1(d)(3)) in inventory, additional section 263A costs must be included in determining CGS. CGS allocable to DPGR also includes inventory valuation adjustments such as writedowns under the lower of cost or market method. In the case of a sale, exchange, or other disposition (including, for example, theft, casualty, or abandonment) of non-inventory property, CGS for purposes of this section includes the adjusted basis of the property. CGS allocable to DPGR for a taxable year may include the inventory cost and adjusted basis of qualifying production property (QPP) (as defined in Sec. 1.199-3(j)(1)), a qualified film (as defined in Sec. 1.199-3(k)(1)), or electricity, natural gas, and potable water (as defined in Sec. 1.199-3(l)) (collectively, utilities) that will generate (or have generated) DPGR notwithstanding that the gross receipts attributable to the sale, lease, rental, license, exchange, or other disposition of the QPP, qualified film, or utilities will be, or have been, included in the computation of gross income for a different taxable year. For example, advance payments that are DPGR may be included in gross income under Sec. 1.451-5(b)(1)(i) in a different taxable year than the related CGS allocable to that DPGR. If gross receipts are treated as DPGR pursuant to Sec. 1.199-1(d)(3)(i) or Sec. 1.199-3(i)(4)(i)(B)(6), (l)(4)(iv)(A), (m)(1)(iii)(A), (n)(6)(i), or (o)(2), then CGS must be allocated to such DPGR. Similarly, if gross receipts are treated as non-DPGR pursuant to Sec. 1.199-1(d)(3)(ii) or Sec. 1.199-3(i)(4)(ii), (l)(4)(iv)(B), (m)(1)(iii)(B), or (n)(6)(ii), then CGS must be allocated to such non-DPGR. See Sec. 1.199-3(m)(6)(iv) for rules relating to treatment of certain costs in the case of a taxpayer that uses the land safe harbor under that paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Allocating cost of goods sold--(i) In general. A taxpayer must use a reasonable method that is satisfactory to the Secretary based on all of the facts and circumstances to allocate CGS between DPGR and non-DPGR. Whether an allocation method is reasonable is based on all of the facts and circumstances including whether the taxpayer uses the most accurate information available; the relationship between CGS and the method used; the accuracy of the method chosen as compared with other possible methods; whether the method is used by the taxpayer for internal management or other business purposes; whether the method is used for other Federal or state income tax purposes; the availability of costing information; the time, burden, and cost of using alternative methods; and whether the taxpayer applies the method consistently from year to year. Depending on the facts and circumstances, reasonable methods may include methods based on gross receipts, number of

units sold, number of units produced, or total production costs. Ordinarily, if a taxpayer uses a method to allocate gross receipts between DPGR and non-DPGR, then the use of a different method to allocate CGS that is not demonstrably more accurate than the method used to allocate gross receipts will not be considered reasonable. However, if a taxpayer has information readily available to specifically identify CGS allocable to DPGR and can specifically identify that amount without undue burden or expense, CGS allocable to DPGR is that amount irrespective of whether the taxpayer uses another allocation method to allocate gross receipts between DPGR and non-DPGR. A taxpayer that does not have information readily available to specifically identify CGS allocable to DPGR and that cannot, without undue burden or expense, specifically identify that amount is not required to use a method that specifically identifies CGS allocable to DPGR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A taxpayer must use a reasonable method that is satisfactory to the Secretary based on all of the facts and circumstances to allocate CGS between DPGR and non-DPGR.

A taxpayer that does not have information readily available to specifically identify CGS allocable to DPGR and that cannot, without undue burden or expense, specifically identify that amount is not required to use a method that specifically identifies CGS allocable to DPGR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Gross receipts recognized in an earlier taxable year. If a taxpayer (other than a taxpayer that uses the small business simplified overall method of paragraph (f) of this section) recognizes and reports gross receipts on a Federal income tax return for a taxable year, and incurs CGS related to such gross receipts in a subsequent taxable year, then regardless of whether the gross receipts ultimately qualify as DPGR, the taxpayer must allocate the CGS to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> DPGR if the taxpayer identified the related gross receipts as DPGR in the prior taxable year; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Non-DPGR if the taxpayer identified the related gross receipts as non-DPGR in the prior taxable year or if the taxpayer recognized under the taxpayer's methods of accounting those gross receipts in a taxable year to which section 199 does not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rules for imported items or services. The cost of any item or service brought into the United States (as defined in Sec. 1.199-3(h)) without an arm's length transfer price may not be treated as less than its value immediately after it entered the United States for purposes of determining the CGS to be used in the computation of QPAI. Similarly, the adjusted basis of leased or rented property that gives rise to DPGR that has been brought into the United States (as defined in Sec. 1.199-3(h)) without an arm's length transfer price may not be treated as less than its value immediately after it entered the United States. When an item or service is imported into the United States that had been exported by the taxpayer for further manufacture, the increase in cost may not exceed the difference between the value of the property when exported and the value of the property when imported back into the United States after further manufacture. For this purpose, the value of property is its customs value as defined in section 1059A(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Rules for inventories valued at market or bona fide selling prices. If part of CGS is attributable to inventory valuation adjustments, then CGS allocable to DPGR includes inventory adjustments to QPP that is MPGE in whole or in significant part within the United States, a qualified film produced by the taxpayer, or utilities produced by the taxpayer in the United States. Accordingly, taxpayers that value inventory under Sec. 1.471-4 (inventories at cost or market, whichever is lower) or Sec. 1.471-2(c) (subnormal goods at bona fide selling prices) must allocate a proper share of such adjustments (for example, writedowns) to DPGR based on a reasonable method that is satisfactory to the Secretary based on all of the facts and circumstances. Factors taken into account in determining whether the method is reasonable include whether the taxpayer uses the most accurate information available; the relationship between the adjustment and the allocation base chosen; the accuracy of the method chosen as compared with other possible methods; whether the method is used by the taxpayer for internal management or other business purposes; whether the method is used for other Federal or state income tax purposes; the time, burden, and cost of using alternative methods; and whether the taxpayer applies the method consistently from year to year. If a taxpayer has information readily available to specifically identify the proper amount of inventory valuation adjustments allocable to DPGR, then the taxpayer must allocate that amount to DPGR. A taxpayer that does not have

information readily available to specifically identify the proper amount of inventory valuation adjustments allocable to DPGR and that cannot, without undue burden or expense, specifically identify the proper amount of inventory valuation adjustments allocable to DPGR, is not required to use a method that specifically identifies inventory valuations adjustments to DPGR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Rules applicable to inventories accounted for under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory method--(i) In general. This paragraph applies to inventories accounted for using the specific goods last-in, first-out (LIFO) method or the dollar-value LIFO method. Whenever a specific goods grouping or a dollar-value pool contains QPP, qualified films, or utilities that produces DPGR and goods that do not, the taxpayer must allocate CGS attributable to that grouping or pool between DPGR and non-DPGR using a reasonable method that is satisfactory to the Secretary based on all of the facts and circumstances. Whether a method of allocating CGS between DPGR and non-DPGR is reasonable must be determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In addition, this paragraph (b)(5) provides methods that a taxpayer may use to allocate CGS for inventories accounted for using the LIFO method. If a taxpayer uses the LIFO/FIFO ratio method provided in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section or the change in relative base-year cost method provided in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, then the taxpayer must use that method for all inventory accounted for under the LIFO method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. This paragraph applies to inventories accounted for using the specific goods last-in, first-out (LIFO) method or the dollar-value LIFO method. Whenever a specific goods grouping or a dollar-value pool contains QPP, qualified films, or utilities that produces DPGR and goods that do not, the taxpayer must allocate CGS attributable to that grouping or pool between DPGR and non-DPGR using a reasonable method that is satisfactory to the Secretary based on all of the facts and circumstances. Whether a method of allocating CGS between DPGR and non-DPGR is reasonable must be determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In addition, this paragraph (b)(5) provides methods that a taxpayer may use to allocate CGS for inventories accounted for using the LIFO method. If a taxpayer uses the LIFO/FIFO ratio method provided in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section or the change in relative base-year cost method provided in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, then the taxpayer must use that method for all inventory accounted for under the LIFO method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> LIFO/FIFO ratio method. A taxpayer using the specific goods LIFO method or the dollar-value LIFO method may use the LIFO/FIFO ratio method. The LIFO/FIFO ratio method is applied with respect to all LIFO inventory of a taxpayer on a grouping-by-grouping or pool-by-pool basis. Under the LIFO/FIFO ratio method, a taxpayer computes the CGS of a grouping or pool allocable to DPGR by multiplying the CGS of QPP, qualified films, or utilities in the grouping or pool that produced DPGR computed using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method by the LIFO/FIFO ratio of the grouping or pool. The LIFO/FIFO ratio of a grouping or pool is equal to the total CGS of the grouping or pool computed using the LIFO method over the total CGS of the grouping or pool computed using the FIFO method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Change in relative base-year cost method. A taxpayer using the dollar-value LIFO method may use the change in relative base-year cost method. The change in relative base-year cost method is applied with respect to all LIFO inventory of a taxpayer on a pool-by-pool basis. The change in relative base-year cost method determines the CGS allocable to DPGR by increasing or decreasing the total production costs (section 471 costs and additional section 263A costs) of QPP, a qualified film, or utilities that generate DPGR by a portion of any increment or liquidation of the dollar-value pool. The portion of an increment or liquidation allocable to DPGR is determined by multiplying the LIFO value of the increment or liquidation (expressed as a positive number) by the ratio of the change in total base-year cost (expressed as a positive number) of the QPP, qualified film, or utilities that will generate DPGR in ending inventory to the change in total base-year cost (expressed as a positive number) of all goods in the ending inventory. The portion of an increment or liquidation allocable to DPGR may be zero but cannot exceed the amount of the increment or liquidation. Thus, a ratio in excess of 1.0 must be treated as 1.0.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Taxpayers using the simplified production method or simplified resale method for additional section 263A costs. A taxpayer that uses the simplified production method or simplified resale method to allocate additional section 263A costs, as defined in Sec. 1.263A-1(d)(3), to ending inventory must follow the rules in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to determine the amount of additional section 263A costs allocable to DPGR. Allocable additional section 263A costs include additional section 263A costs included in beginning inventory as well as additional section 263A costs incurred during the taxable year. Ordinarily, if a taxpayer uses the simplified production method or the simplified resale method, the additional section

263A costs should be allocated in the same proportion as section 471 costs are allocated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (b) and assume that the taxpayer does not use the small business simplified overall method provided in paragraph (f) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Advance payments. T, a calendar year taxpayer, is a manufacturer of furniture in the United States. Under its method of accounting, T includes advance payments and other gross receipts derived from the sale of furniture in gross income when the payments are received. In December 2007, T receives an advance payment of $5,000 from X with respect to an order of furniture to be manufactured for a total price of $20,000. In 2008, T produces and sells the furniture to X. In 2008, T incurs $14,000 of section 471 and additional section 263A costs to produce the furniture ordered by X. T receives the remaining $15,000 of the contract price from X in 2008. Assuming that in 2007, T can reasonably determine that all the requirements of Sec. Sec. 1.199-1 and 1.199-3 will be met with respect to the furniture, the advance payment qualifies as DPGR in 2007. Assuming further that all the requirements of Sec. Sec. 1.199-1 and 1.199-3 are met with respect to the furniture in 2008, the remaining $15,000 of the contract price must be included in income and DPGR when received by T in 2008. T must include the $14,000 it incurred to produce the furniture in CGS and CGS allocable to DPGR in 2008. See Sec. 1.199-4(b)(2)(ii) for rules regarding gross receipts and costs recognized in different taxable years.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Use of standard cost method. X, a calendar year taxpayer, manufactures item A in a factory located in the United States and item B in a factory located in Country Y. Item A is produced by X within the United States and the sale of A generates DPGR. X uses the FIFO inventory method to account for its inventory and determines the cost of item A using a standard cost method. At the beginning of its 2007 taxable year, X's inventory contains 2,000 units of item A at a standard cost of $5 per unit. X did not incur significant cost variances in previous taxable years. During the 2007 taxable year, X produces 8,000 units of item A at a standard cost of $6 per unit. X determines that with regard to its production of item A it has incurred a significant cost variance. When X reallocates the cost variance to the units of item A that it has produced, the production cost of item A is $7 per unit. X sells 7,000 units of item A during the taxable year. X can identify from its books and records that CGS related to the sales of item A during the taxable year are $45,000 ((2,000 x $5) + (5,000 x $7)). Accordingly, X has CGS allocable to DPGR of $45,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Y elects, beginning with the calendar year 2007, to compute its inventories using the dollar-value, LIFO method under section 472. Y establishes a pool for items A and B. Y produces item A within the United States and the sales of item A generate DPGR. Y does not produce item B within the United States and the sale of item B does not generate DPGR. The composition of the inventory for the pool at the base date, January 1, 2007, is as follows:

All of X's production activities that generate non-DPGR are within SIC Industry Group BBB (SIC BBB). X is able to specifically identify CGS allocable to DPGR and to non-DPGR. X incurs $900 of research and experimentation expenses (R&E;) that are deductible under section 174, $300 of which are performed with respect to SIC AAA and $600 of which are performed with respect to SIC BBB. None of the R&E; is legally mandated R&E; as described in Sec. 1.861-17(a)(4) and none of the R&E; is included in CGS. X incurs section 162 selling expenses that are not includible in CGS and are definitely related to all of X's gross income. For 2010, the adjusted basis of X's assets is $5,000, $4,000 of which generates gross income attributable to DPGR and $1,000 of which generates gross income attributable to non-DPGR.

Accordingly, the rules of Sec. 1.861-14T do not apply to X's and Y's selling expenses, R&E;, and charitable contributions. X and Y are, however, members of an affiliated group for purposes of allocating and apportioning interest expense (see Sec. 1.861-11T(d)(6)) and are also members of an EAG. For 2010, the adjusted basis of Y's assets is $45,000, $21,000 of which generates gross income attributable to DPGR and $24,000 of which generates gross income attributable to non-DPGR. All of Y's activities that generate DPGR are within SIC Industry Group AAA (SIC AAA). All of Y's activities that generate non-DPGR are within SIC Industry Group BBB (SIC BBB). None of X's and Y's sales are to each other. Y is not able to specifically identify CGS allocable to DPGR and non-DPGR. In this case, because CGS is definitely related under the facts and circumstances to all of Y's gross receipts, apportionment of CGS between DPGR and non-DPGR based on gross receipts is appropriate.

trust or estate qualifies to use the simplified deduction method, the simplified deduction method must be applied at the trust or estate level, taking into account the trust's or estate's DPGR, non-DPGR, and other items from all sources, including its distributive or allocable share of those items of any lower-tier entity, prior to any charitable or distribution deduction. Whether the owner of a pass-thru entity may use the simplified deduction method is determined at the level of the entity's owner. If the owner of a pass-thru entity qualifies and uses the simplified deduction method, then the simplified deduction method is applied at the level of the owner of the pass-thru entity taking into account the owner's DPGR, non-DPGR, and other items from all sources including its distributive or allocable share of those items of the pass-thru entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Eligible taxpayer.

A qualifying small taxpayer may use the small business simplified overall method to apportion CGS and deductions between DPGR and non-DPGR. Under the small business simplified overall method, a taxpayer's total costs for the current taxable year (as defined in paragraph (f)(3) of this section) are apportioned between DPGR and non-DPGR based on relative gross receipts. Accordingly, the amount of total costs for the current taxable year apportioned to DPGR

is equal to the same proportion of total costs for the current taxable year that the amount of DPGR bears to total gross receipts.

See Sec. 1.199-3(m)(6)(iv)(B). For example, if a taxpayer has $1,000 of total costs for the current taxable year and $600 of such costs is attributable to land under the land safe harbor, then only $400 of such costs is apportioned between DPGR and non-DPGR under the small business simplified overall method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Members of an expanded affiliated group--(i) In general.
