The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall integrate these NEPA requirements as early in

the Agency planning processes as possible. The environmental review process shall be the focal point to ensure NEPA considerations are taken into account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Through this part, EPA adopts the CEQ Regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500 through 1508) implementing NEPA; subparts A through C of this part supplement those regulations, for actions proposed by EPA that are subject to NEPA requirements. Subparts A through C supplement, and are to be used in conjunction with, the CEQ Regulations.</p>
