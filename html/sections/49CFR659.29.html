                            <p class="depth0">At least every three (3) years, beginning with the initiation of  rail transit agency passenger operations, the oversight agency must  conduct an on-site review of the rail transit agency's implementation of  its system safety program plan and system security plan. Alternatively,  the on-site review may be conducted in an on-going manner over the three  year timeframe. At the conclusion of the review cycle, the oversight  agency must prepare and issue a report containing findings and  recommendations resulting from that review, which, at a minimum, must  include an analysis of the effectiveness of the system safety program  plan and   the security plan and a determination of whether either should be  updated.</p>
