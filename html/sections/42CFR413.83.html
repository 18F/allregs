If a hospital has its base-period GME costs reduced under Sec. 413.77(a) of this section because those costs included misclassified operating costs, the hospital may request that the contractor review the classification of the affected costs in its rate-of-increase ceiling or prospective payment base year for purposes of adjusting the hospital's target amount or hospital-specific rate. For those cost reports that are not subject to reopening under Sec. 405.1885 of this chapter, the hospital's reopening request must explicitly state that the review is limited to this one issue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule.
