                            <p class="depth0">Give the ultimate purchaser of each new engine written instructions for properly maintaining and using the engine, including the emission control system, as described in this section. The maintenance instructions also apply to service accumulation on your emission-data engines as described in Sec.  1042.245 and in 40 CFR part 1065. The restrictions specified in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section related to allowable maintenance apply only to Category 1 and Category 2 engines. Manufacturers may specify any maintenance for Category 3 engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Critical emission-related maintenance. Critical emission-related maintenance includes any adjustment, cleaning, repair, or replacement of critical emission-related components. This may also include additional emission-related maintenance that you determine is critical if we approve it in advance. You may schedule critical emission-related maintenance on these components if you meet the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You demonstrate that the maintenance is reasonably likely to be done at the recommended intervals on in-use engines. We will accept scheduled maintenance as reasonably likely to occur if you satisfy any of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You present data showing that any lack of maintenance that increases emissions also unacceptably degrades the engine's performance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You present survey data showing that at least 80 percent of engines in the field get the maintenance you specify at the recommended intervals.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You provide the maintenance free of charge and clearly say so in your maintenance instructions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> You otherwise show us that the maintenance is reasonably likely to be done at the recommended intervals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For engines below 130 kW, you may not schedule critical emission-related maintenance more frequently than the following minimum intervals, except as specified in paragraphs (a)(4), (b), and (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For EGR-related filters and coolers, PCV valves, and fuel injector tips (cleaning only), the minimum interval is 1,500 hours.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For the following components, including associated sensors and actuators, the minimum interval is 3,000 hours: Fuel injectors, turbochargers, catalytic converters, electronic control units, particulate traps, trap oxidizers, components related to particulate traps and trap oxidizers, EGR systems (including related components, but excluding filters and coolers), and other add-on components. For particulate traps, trap oxidizers, and components related to either of these, maintenance is limited to cleaning and repair only.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For Category 1 and Category 2 engines at or above 130 kW, you may not schedule critical emission-related maintenance more frequently than the following minimum intervals, except as specified in paragraphs (a)(4), (b), and (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For EGR-related filters and coolers, PCV valves, and fuel injector tips

(cleaning only), the minimum interval is 1,500 hours.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For the following components, including associated sensors and actuators, the minimum interval is 4500 hours: Fuel injectors, turbochargers, catalytic converters, electronic control units, particulate traps, trap oxidizers, components related to particulate traps and trap oxidizers, EGR systems (including related components, but excluding filters and coolers), and other add-on components. For particulate traps, trap oxidizers, and components related to either of these, maintenance is limited to cleaning and repair only.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> We may approve shorter maintenance intervals than those listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section where technologically necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If your engine family has an alternate useful life under Sec.  1042.101(e) that is shorter than the period specified in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, you may not schedule critical emission-related maintenance more frequently than the alternate useful life, except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Recommended additional maintenance. You may recommend any additional amount of maintenance on the components listed in paragraph (a) of this section, as long as you state clearly that these maintenance steps are not necessary to keep the emission-related warranty valid. If operators do the maintenance specified in paragraph (a) of this section, but not the recommended additional maintenance, this does not allow you to disqualify those engines from in-use testing or deny a warranty claim. Do not take these maintenance steps during service accumulation on your emission-data engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special maintenance. You may specify more frequent maintenance to address problems related to special situations, such as atypical engine operation. You must clearly state that this additional maintenance is associated with the special situation you are addressing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Noncritical emission-related maintenance. Subject to the provisions of this paragraph (d), you may schedule any amount of emission-related inspection or maintenance that is not covered by paragraph (a) of this section (that is, maintenance that is neither explicitly identified as critical emission-related maintenance, nor that we approve as critical emission-related maintenance). Noncritical emission-related maintenance generally includes maintenance on the components we specify in 40 CFR part 1068, Appendix I that is not covered in paragraph (a) of this section. You must state in the owners manual that these steps are not necessary to keep the emission-related warranty valid. If operators fail to do this maintenance, this does not allow you to disqualify those engines from in-use testing or deny a warranty claim. Do not take these inspection or maintenance steps during service accumulation on your emission-data engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Maintenance that is not emission-related. For maintenance unrelated to emission controls, you may schedule any amount of inspection or maintenance. You may also take these inspection or maintenance steps during service accumulation on your emission-data engines, as long as they are reasonable and technologically necessary. This might include adding engine oil, changing air, fuel, or oil filters, servicing engine-cooling systems, and adjusting idle speed, governor, engine bolt torque, valve lash, or injector lash. You may perform this nonemission-related maintenance on emission-data engines at the least frequent intervals that you recommend to the ultimate purchaser (but not intervals recommended for severe service).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Source of parts and repairs. State clearly on the first page of your written maintenance instructions that a repair shop or person of the owner's choosing may maintain, replace, or repair emission control devices and systems. Your instructions may not require components or service identified by brand, trade, or corporate name. Also, do not directly or indirectly condition your warranty on a requirement that the engine be serviced by your franchised dealers or any other service establishments with which you have a commercial relationship. You may disregard the requirements in this paragraph (f) if you do one of two things:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide a component or service without charge under the purchase agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Get us to waive this prohibition in the public's interest by convincing us the engine will work properly only with the identified component or service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Payment for scheduled maintenance. Owners are responsible for properly maintaining their engines. This generally includes paying for scheduled maintenance. However, manufacturers must pay for scheduled maintenance during the useful life if it meets all the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each affected component was not in general use on similar engines before the applicable dates shown in paragraph (6) of the definition of ``new marine engine'' in Sec.  1042.901.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The primary function of each affected component is to reduce emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The cost of the scheduled maintenance is more than 2 percent of the price of the engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Failure to perform the maintenance would not cause clear problems that would significantly degrade the engine's performance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Owners manual. Explain the owner's responsibility for proper maintenance in the owners manual.
