                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Acquisition planning should begin as soon as the agency need is  identified, preferably well in advance of the fiscal year in which  contract award or order placement is necessary. In developing the plan,  the planner shall form a team consisting of all those who will be  responsible for significant aspects of the acquisition, such as  contracting, fiscal, legal, and technical personnel. If contract  performance is to be in a designated operational area or supporting a  diplomatic or consular mission, the planner shall also consider  inclusion of the combatant commander or chief of mission, as  appropriate. The planner should review previous plans for similar  acquisitions and discuss them with the key personnel involved in those  acquisitions. At key dates specified in the plan or whenever significant  changes occur, and no less often than annually, the planner shall review  the plan and, if appropriate, revise it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements and logistics personnel should avoid issuing  requirements on an urgent basis or with unrealistic delivery or  performance schedules, since it generally restricts competition and  increases prices. Early in the planning process, the planner should  consult with requirements and   logistics personnel who determine type, quality, quantity, and delivery  requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The planner shall coordinate with and secure the concurrence of  the contracting officer in all acquisition planning. If the plan  proposes using other than full and open competition when awarding a  contract, the plan shall also be coordinated with the cognizant advocate  for competition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The planner shall coordinate the acquisition plan or strategy  with the cognizant small business specialist when the strategy  contemplates an acquisition meeting the dollar amounts in paragraph  (d)(2) of this section unless the contract or order is entirely reserved  or set-aside for small business under part 19. The small business  specialist shall notify the agency Office of Small and Disadvantaged  Business Utilization if the strategy involves contract bundling that is  unnecessary, unjustified, or not identified as bundled by the agency. If  the strategy involves substantial bundling, the small business  specialist shall assist in identifying alternative strategies that would  reduce or minimize the scope of the bundling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The strategy shall be coordinated with the cognizant small  business specialist in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section  if the estimated contract or order value is--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> $8 million or more for the Department of Defense;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> $6 million or more for the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration, the General Services Administration, and the Department  of Energy; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> $2.5 million or more for all other agencies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the strategy contemplates the award of multiple contracts or  orders, the thresholds in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section apply to  the cumulative maximum potential value, including options, of the  contracts and orders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The planner shall ensure that a COR is nominated as early as  practicable in the acquisition process by the requirements official or  in accordance with agency procedures. The contracting officer shall  designate and authorize a COR as early as practicable after the  nomination. See 1.602-2(d).
