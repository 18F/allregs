                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Indemnity may be paid for an animal only after the owner of the animal has applied for indemnification and been approved in accordance with Sec. 54.4. Indemnity may be paid only for the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Destruction of high-risk animals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Destruction of animals based on an epidemiologic investigation, when the Administrator determines that the destruction of these animals will contribute to the eradication of scrapie;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Destruction of live scrapie-positive animals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Destruction of animals that test positive on a live-animal screening test; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Destruction of suspect animals that are destroyed at the request of an APHIS representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No indemnity will be paid for an animal if the owner of the animal fails to provide APHIS, within 30 days of request, animal registration certificates, sale and movement records, or other records requested in accordance with Sec. 54.5. No indemnity will be paid until the premises, including all structures, holding facilities, conveyances, and materials contaminated because of occupation or use by the depopulated animals, have been properly cleaned and disinfected in accordance with Sec. 54.7(e). Additional guidance on acceptable means of cleaning and disinfection is also available in the Scrapie Flock Certification Program standards and the Scrapie Eradication Uniform Methods and Rules. Premises or portions of premises may be exempted from the cleaning and disinfecting requirements if a designated scrapie epidemiologist

determines, based on epidemiologic investigation, that cleaning and disinfection of such buildings, holding facilities, conveyances, or other materials on the premises will not significantly reduce the risk of the spread of scrapie, either because effective disinfection is not possible or because the normal operations on the premises prevent transmission of scrapie. No indemnity will be paid to an owner if the owner assembled or increased his flock for the purpose of collecting or increasing indemnity.</p>
