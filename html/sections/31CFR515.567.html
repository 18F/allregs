The travel-related transactions set  forth in Sec. 515.560(c) and such other transactions as are directly  incident to athletic competition by amateur or semi-professional  athletes or athletic teams traveling to participate in athletic  competition in Cuba are authorized, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The athletic competition in Cuba is held under the auspices of  the international sports federation for the relevant sport;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The U.S. participants in the athletic competition are selected  by the U.S. federation for the relevant sport; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The competition is open for attendance, and in relevant  situations, participation, by the Cuban public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General license for public performances, clinics, workshops,  other athletic or non-athletic competitions, and exhibitions.
