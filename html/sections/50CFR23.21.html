                                Sec.  23.21  What happens if a country enters a reservation for a
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. CITES is not subject to general reservations. Articles XV, XVI, and XXIII of the Treaty allow a Party to enter a specific reservation on a species listed in Appendix I, II, or III, or on parts, products, or derivatives of a species listed in Appendix III.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General provision. A Party can enter a reservation in one of the following ways:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A Party must provide written notification to the Depositary Government (Switzerland) on a specific new or amended listing in the Appendices within 90 days after the CoP that adopted the listing, or at any time for Appendix-III species.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A country must provide written notification on a specific species listing when the country ratifies, accepts, approves, or accedes to CITES.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requesting the United States take a reservation. You may submit information relevant to the issue of whether the United States should take a reservation on a species listing to the U.S. Management Authority. The request must be submitted within 30 calendar

days after the last day of the CoP where a new or amended listing of a species in Appendix I or II occurs, or at any time for a species (or its parts, products, or derivatives) listed in Appendix III.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Required CITES documents. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, Parties treat a reserving Party as if it were a non-Party for trade in the species concerned (including parts, products, and derivatives, as appropriate). The following table indicates when CITES documents must accompany a shipment and which Appendix should appear on the face of the document:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">If                                  Then------------------------------------------------------------------------(1) The shipment is between a Party and a   The shipment must be</p><p class="depth2">reserving Party, or the shipment is from    accompanied by a valid</p><p class="depth2">a non-Party to a reserving Party and is     CITES document(s) (see Sec.</p><p class="depth2">in transit through a Party                    23.26) that indicates the</p><p class="depth2">CITES Appendix in which the</p><p class="depth2">species is listed.------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) The shipment is from a reserving Party  The shipment must be</p><p class="depth2">to another reserving Party \1\ or non-      accompanied by a valid</p><p class="depth2">Party and is in transit through a Party     CITES document(s) (see Sec.</p><p class="depth2">23.26) that indicates the</p><p class="depth2">CITES Appendix in which the</p><p class="depth2">species is listed. \2\------------------------------------------------------------------------(3) The shipment is between a reserving     No CITES document is</p><p class="depth2">Party and another reserving Party \1\ or    required. \2\</p><p class="depth2">non-Party and is not in transit through a</p><p class="depth2">Party------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ Both reserving Parties must have a reservation for the same species,</p><p class="depth2">and if the species is listed in Appendix III, a reservation for the</p><p class="depth2">same parts, products, and derivatives.\2\ CITES recommends that reserving Parties treat Appendix-I species as</p><p class="depth2">if listed in Appendix II and issue CITES documents based on Appendix-</p><p class="depth2">II permit criteria (see Sec.   23.36). However, the CITES document</p><p class="depth2">must show the specimen as listed in Appendix I. If the United States</p><p class="depth2">entered a reservation, such a CITES document would be required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reservations taken by countries. You may consult the CITES website or contact us (see Sec.  23.7) for a list of countries that have taken reservations and the species involved.</p>
