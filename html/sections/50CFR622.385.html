A person who fishes in the EEZ may not combine a  trip limit specified in this section with any trip or possession limit  applicable to state waters. Except for Atlantic migratory group Spanish  mackerel harvested by gillnet, as specified in Sec. 622.377(b)(2)(vi), a  species subject to a trip limit specified in this section taken in the  EEZ may not be transferred at sea, regardless of where such transfer  takes place, and such species may not be transferred in the EEZ.

Total commercial harvest in the southern zone is still subject to the  southern zone quota and accountability measures.
