A bond  with a co-principal shall not be used to join an entity which does not  have a distinct legal status (e.g. an unincorporated division of a  corporation). However, an entity which does not have a distinct legal  status may use another bond if listed on the bond by the principal at  the time of execution or by subsequent rider (see Sec. 113.24). A bond  with co-principal may not be used to join different legal entities (e.g.  an individual and a corporation, a partnership and a corporation).</p>
