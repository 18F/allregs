                            <p class="depth0">Every storage battery on every vehicle, unless located in the engine  compartment, shall be covered by a fixed part of the motor vehicle or  protected by a removable cover or enclosure. Removable covers or  enclosures shall be substantial and shall be securely latched or  fastened. The storage battery compartment and adjacent metal parts which  might corrode by reason of battery leakage shall be painted or coated  with an acid-resisting paint or coating and shall have openings to  provide ample battery ventilation and drainage. Wherever the cable to  the starting motor passes through a metal compartment, the cable shall  be protected against grounding by an acid and waterproof insulating  bushing. Wherever a battery and a fuel tank are both placed under the  driver's seat, they shall be partitioned from each other, and each  compartment shall be provided with an independent cover, ventilation,  and drainage.    Sec. Sec. 393.31-393.33  [Reserved]</p>
