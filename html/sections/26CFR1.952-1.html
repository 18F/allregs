                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. For purposes of sections 951 through 964, a controlled foreign corporation's subpart F income for any taxable year shall, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and subject to the limitations of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, consist of the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The income derived by such corporation for such year from the insurance of United States risks (determined in accordance with the provisions of section 953 and Secs. 1.953-1 through 1.953-6),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The income derived by such corporation for such year which constitutes foreign base company income (determined in accordance with the provisions of section 954 and Secs. 1.954-1 through 1.954-8),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(i)</em> An amount equal to the product of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An amount equal to the product of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The income of such corporation other than income which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is attributable to earnings and profits of the foreign corporation included in the gross income of a United

States person under section 951 (other than by reason of this paragraph) (determined in accordance with the provisions of section 951 and Sec. 1.951-1), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is described in section 952(b),
multiplied by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The international boycott factor determined in accordance with the provisions of section 999(c)(1), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In lieu of the amount determined under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, the amount described under section 999(c)(2) of such international boycott income, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The sum of the amount of any illegal bribes, kickbacks, or other payments paid after November 3, 1976, by or on behalf of the corporation during the taxable year of the corporation directly or indirectly to an official, employee, or agent in fact of a government. An amount is paid by a controlled foreign corporation where it is paid by an officer, director, employee, shareholder or agent of such corporation for the benefit of such corporation. For purposes of this section, the principles of section 162(c) and the regulations thereunder shall apply. In the case of payments made after September 3, 1982, a payment is illegal if the payment would be unlawful under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 if the payor were a United States person. The fair market value of an illegal payment made in the form of property or services shall be considered the amount of such illegal payment.
Pursuant to section 951(a)(1)(A)(i) and Sec. 1.951-1, a United States shareholder of such controlled foreign corporation must include his pro rata share of such subpart F income in his gross income for his taxable year in which or with which such taxable year of the foreign corporation ends. See section 952(a). However, see paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.957-2 for special rule limiting the subpart F income to the income derived from the insurance of United States risks in the case of certain controlled foreign corporations described in section 957(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exclusion of U.S. income--(1) Taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967. For rules applicable to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, see 26 CFR 1.952-1(b)(1) (Revisedof April 1, 1975).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967. For rules applicable to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, see 26 CFR 1.952-1(b)(1) (Revisedof April 1, 1975).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a controlled foreign corporation's subpart F income for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1966, shall not include any item of income from sources within the United States which is effectively connected for that year with the conduct by such corporation of a trade or business in the United States unless, pursuant to a treaty to which the United States is a party, such item of income either is exempt from the income tax imposed by chapter 1 (relating to normal taxes and surtaxes) of the Code or is subject to such tax at a reduced rate.
Thus, for example, dividends received from sources within the United States by a foreign corporation engaged in business in the United States during the taxable year, which are not effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that corporation, shall not be excluded from subpart F income under section 952(b) and this subparagraph even though such dividends are subject to the tax of 30 percent imposed by section 881 (a). Also, for example, if, by reason of an income tax convention to which the United States is a party, an amount of interest from sources within the United States which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a business in the United States by a foreign corporation is subject to tax under chapter 1 at a flat rate of 15 percent, as provided in Sec. 1.871-12, such interest is not excluded from subpart F income under section 952(b) and this subparagraph. The deductions attributable to items of income which are excluded from subpart F income under this subparagraph shall not be taken into account for purposes of section 952.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rule applicable under section 956 (b)(2). For purposes only of paragraph (b)(1))(viii) of Sec. 1.956-2, an item of income derived by a controlled foreign corporation from sources within the United States with respect to which for the taxable year a tax is imposed in accordance with section 882(a) shall be considered described in section 952(b) whether or not such item of income

would have constituted subpart F income for such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Limitation on a controlled foreign corporation's subpart F income--(1) In general. A United States shareholder's pro rata share (determined in accordance with the rules of paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.951-1) of a controlled foreign corporation's subpart F income for any taxable year shall not exceed his pro rata share of the earnings and profits (as defined in section 964(a) and Sec. 1.964-1) of such corporation for such taxable year, computed as of the close of such taxable year without diminution by reason of any distributions made during such taxable year, minus the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

For purposes of applying this subparagraph, the reduction (if any) provided by subdivision (i) of this subparagraph in a United States shareholder's pro rata share of the earnings and profits of a controlled foreign corporation shall be taken into account before the reduction provided by subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. See section 952(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules. For purposes only of determining the limitation under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph on a United States shareholder's pro rata share of a controlled foreign corporation's subpart F income for any taxable year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Status of foreign corporation. The earnings and profits, or deficit in earnings and profits, of a foreign corporation for any taxable year shall be taken into account whether or not such foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation at the time such earnings and profits are derived or such deficit in earnings and profits is incurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Deficits in earnings and profits taken into account only once. A controlled foreign corporation's deficit in earnings and profits for any taxable year preceding the taxable year shall be taken into account for the taxable year only to the extent such deficit has not been taken into account under this paragraph, paragraph (d) of this section, or paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of Sec. 1.963-2 (applied as if section 963 had not been repealed by the Tax Reduction Act of 1975) in computing a minimum distribution, for any taxable year preceding the taxable year, to reduce earnings and profits of such preceding year of such controlled foreign corporation or of any other controlled foreign corporation. To the extent a controlled foreign corporation's (the ``first corporation'') excess foreign base company shipping deductions for any taxable year (determined under Sec. 1.955A-3(c)(2)(i)) reduce the foreign base company shipping income of another member of a related group (as defined in Sec. 1.955A-2(b)), such deductions shall not be taken into account in determining the earnings and profits or deficits in earnings and profits of such first corporation for such taxable year for purposes of this paragraph (c) and paragraph (d) of this section. The rule of the preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent the excess foreign base company shipping deductions of the first corporation reduce the foreign

base company shipping income of another member of a related group below zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determination of pro rata share. A United States shareholder's pro rata share of a controlled foreign corporation's earnings and profits, or deficit in earnings and profits, for any taxable year shall be determined in accordance with the principles of paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.951-1 and paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of Sec. 1.963-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Illustrations. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A is a United States shareholder who owns 100 percent of the only class of stock of M Corporation, a controlled foreign corporation organized on January 1, 1963. Both A and M Corporation use the calandar year as a taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> During 1963, M Corporation derives $20,000 of subpart F income and has earnings and profits of $30,000. Corporation M makes no distributions to A during such year. The limitation under section 952(c) on M Corporation's subpart F income for 1963 is $30,000; and $20,000 is includible in A's gross income for such year under section 951(a)(1)(A)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> On January 1, 1964, M Corporation acquires 100 percent of the only class of stock of N Corporation, a controlled foreign corporation which uses the calendar year as a taxable year. During 1964, N Corporation derives $6,000 of subpart F income, has $7,000 of earnings and profits, and distributes $5,000 to M Corporation. The limitation under section 952(c) on N Corporation's subpart F income for 1964 is $7,000; and $6,000 of subpart F income is includible in A's gross income for such year under section 951(a)(1)(A)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> During 1964, M Corporation derives $8,000 of rents which constitute subpart F income, makes a $10,000 distribution to A, and has earnings and profits of $12,000 (including the $5,000 dividend received from N Corporation). The limitation under section 952(c) on M Corporation's subpart F income for 1964 is $7,000, determined as follows:
Corporation M's earnings and profits for 1964 (determined        $12,000</p><p class="depth0">under section 964(a) and Sec. 1.964-1 as of the close of</p><p class="depth0">such year without diminution for any distributions made</p><p class="depth0">during such year).........................................Less: Corporation M's earnings and profits for 1964                5,000</p><p class="depth0">described in section 959(b)...............................</p><p class="depth0">------------Limitation on M Corporation's Subpart F income for 1964....        7,000</p><p class="depth0">Thus, for 1964 with respect to A's interest in M Corporation, $7,000 of subpart F income is includible in his gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A)(i). The $10,000 dividend received from M Corporation is excludible from A's gross income for 1964 under section 959(a)(1) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.959-1.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A is a United States shareholder who owns 100 percent of the only class of stock of R Corporation which was organized on January 1, 1961. R Corporation is a controlled foreign corporation for the entire period after December 31, 1962, here involved. Both A and R Corporation use the calendar year as a taxable year. During 1963, R Corporation derives $25,000 of subpart F income and has $50,000 of earnings and profits. Corporation R has $15,000 of earnings and profits for 1961, and a deficit in earnings and profits of $45,000 for 1962. Thus, R Corporation has as of December 31, 1963, a net deficit in earnings and profits of $30,000 for the years 1961 and 1962. Corporation R makes no distributions to A during 1963. The limitation under section 952(c) on R Corporation's subpart F income for 1963 is $20,000 ($50,000 minus $30,000), and $20,000 of subpart F income is includible in A's gross income for 1963 under section 951(a)(1)(A)(i). During 1964, R Corporation derives $18,000 of subpart F income and has $30,000 of earnings and profits. Corporation R makes no distributions to A during 1964. The entire $18,000 of subpart F income is includible in A's gross income for 1964 under section 951(a)(1)(A)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Treatment of deficits in earnings and profits attributable to stock of other foreign corporation indirectly owned by a United States shareholder--(1) In general.

If one or more foreign corporations (whether or not a controlled foreign corporation) includible in a chain of foreign corporations has a deficit in earnings and profits (determined under section 964(a) and Sec. 1.964-1) for the taxable year, the amount of deficit taken into account under section 952(d) with respect to a United States shareholder in such chain as a reduction in earnings and profits for the taxable year of a controlled foreign corporation includible in such chain shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to such shareholder's pro rata share of the total deficit in earnings and profits for the taxable year of all includible foreign corporations as his pro rata share of the earnings and profits (determined under paragraph (c) of this section but without regard to the provisions of subparagraph (1)(ii) of such paragraph) for the taxable year of such includible controlled foreign corporation bears to his pro rata share of the total earnings and profits (as so determined under paragraph (c) of this section) for the taxable year of all includible controlled foreign corporations. The amount of deficit taken into account under this subdivision with respect to any controlled foreign corporation includible in a chain of foreign corporations shall not exceed the United States shareholder's pro rata share of the controlled foreign corporation's earnings and profits for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Taxable year. The taxable year from which a deficit is allocated under this paragraph, and the taxable year to which such deficit is allocated to reduce earnings and profits, shall be the taxable year of the foreign corporation ending with or within the taxable year of the United States shareholder described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Illustration. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Domestic corporation M owns 100 percent, 20 percent, and 100 percent, respectively, of the only class of stock of foreign corporations A, B, and F, respectively.

Corporation B owns 75 percent of the only class of stock of foreign corporation D, and 50 percent of the only class of stock of each of foreign corporations G and H, respectively. C Corporation owns 75 percent of the only class of stock of foreign corporation E.

See section 904(d)(3)(D).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The application of paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, a U.S. person, is the sole shareholder of CFC, a controlled foreign corporation formed on January 1, 1998, whose functional currency is the u. In 1998, CFC earns 100u of foreign base company sales income that is general limitation income described in section 904(d)(1)(I) and incurs a (200u) loss attributable to activities that would have produced general limitation income that is not subpart F income. In 1998 CFC also earns 100u of foreign personal holding company income that is passive income described in section 904(d)(1)(A), and 100u of foreign personal holding company income that is dividend income subject to a separate limitation described in section 904(d)(1)(E) for dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation. CFC's subpart F income for 1998, 300u, exceeds CFC's current earnings and profits, 100u, by 200u. Under section 952(c)(1)(A) and paragraph (e) of this section, subpart F income is limited to CFC's current earnings and profits of 100u, all of which is included in A's gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A). The 200u of CFC's 1998 subpart F income that is not included in A's income in 1998 by reason of section 952(c)(1)(A) is subject to recapture under section 952(c)(2) and paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of determining the amount and type of income included in A's gross income and the amount and type of income in CFC's recapture account, the rules of paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section apply. Under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the amount by which CFC's subpart F income exceeds its earnings and profits for 1998, 200u, first reduces from 100u to 0 CFC's subpart F income in the general limitation category, which has a current year deficit of (100u) in earnings and profits. Next, under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, the remaining 100u by which CFC's 1998 subpart F income exceeds earnings and profits is applied proportionately to reduce CFC's subpart F income in the separate categories for passive income (100u) and dividends from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation (100u). Thus, A includes 50u of passive limitation/foreign personal holding company income and 50u of dividends from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation/foreign personal holding company income in gross income in 1998. CFC has 100u in its general limitation/foreign base company sales income recapture account attributable to the 100u of foreign base company sales income that is not included in A's income by reason of the earnings and profits limitation of section 952(c)(1)(A). CFC also has 50u in its passive limitation recapture account, all of which is attributable to foreign personal holding company income, and 50u in its recapture account for dividends from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation, all of which is attributable to foreign personal holding company income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of computing post-1986 undistributed earnings, the rules of sections 902 and 960, including the rules of Sec. 1.960-1(i), apply. Under Sec. 1.960-1(i), the general limitation deficit of (100u) is allocated proportionately to reduce passive limitation earnings of 100u and noncontrolled section 902 dividend earnings of 100u. Thus, passive limitation earnings are reduced by 50u to 50u (100u passive limitation earnings/200u total earnings in positive separate categories x (100u) general limitation deficit=50u reduction), and the noncontrolled section 902 corporation earnings are reduced by 50u to 50u (100u noncontrolled section 902 corporation earnings/200u total earnings in positive separate categories x (100u) general limitation deficit=50u reduction). All of CFC's post-1986 foreign income taxes with respect to passive limitation income and dividends from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation are deemed paid by A under section 960 with respect to the subpart F inclusions (50u inclusion/50u earnings in each separate category). After the inclusion and deemed-paid taxes are computed, at the close of 1998 CFC has a (100u) deficit in general limitation earnings (100u subpart F earnings + (200u) nonsubpart F loss), 50u of passive limitation earnings (100u of earnings attributable to foreign personal holding company income -50u inclusion) with a corresponding passive limitation/foreign personal holding company income recapture account of 50u, and 50u of earnings subject to a separate limitation for dividends from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation (100u earnings -50u inclusion) with a corresponding noncontrolled section 902 corporation/foreign personal holding company income recapture account of 50u.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1 with the addition of the following facts. In 1999, CFC earns 100u of foreign base company sales income that is general limitation income and 100u of foreign personal

holding company income that is passive limitation income. In addition, CFC incurs (10u) of expenses that are allocable to its separate limitation for dividends from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation. Thus, CFC's subpart F income for 1999, 200u, exceeds CFC's current earnings and profits, 190u, by 10u. Under section 952(c)(1)(A) and paragraph (e) of this section, subpart F income is limited to CFC's current earnings and profits of 190u, all of which is included in A's gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of determining the amount and type of income included in A's gross income and the amount and type of income in CFC's recapture accounts, the rules of paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section apply. While CFC's general limitation post-1986 undistributed earnings for 1999 are 0 ((100u) opening balance + 100u subpart F income), CFC's general limitation subpart F income (100u) does not exceed its general limitation current earnings and profits (100u) for 1999. Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, the amount by which CFC's subpart F income exceeds its earnings and profits for 1999, 10u, is applied proportionately to reduce CFC's subpart F income in the separate categories for general limitation income, 100u, and passive income, 100u. Thus, A includes 95u of general limitation foreign base company sales income and 95u of passive limitation foreign personal holding company income in gross income in 1999. At the close of 1999 CFC has 105u in its general limitation/foreign base company sales income recapture account (100u from 1998 + 5u from 1999), 55u in its passive limitation/foreign personal holding company income recapture account (50u from 1998 + 5u from 1999), and 50u in its dividends from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation/foreign personal holding company income recapture account (all from 1998).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of computing post-1986 undistributed earnings in each separate category, the rules of sections 902 and 960, including the rules of Sec. 1.960-1(i), apply. Thus, post-1986 undistributed earnings (or an accumulated deficit) in each separate category are increased (or reduced) by current earnings and profits or current deficits in each separate category. The accumulated deficit in CFC's general limitation earnings and profits (100u) is reduced to 0 by the addition of 100u of 1999 earnings and profits. CFC's passive limitation earnings of 50u are increased by 100u to 150u, and CFC's noncontrolled section 902 corporation earnings of 50u are decreased by (10u) to 40u. After the addition of current year earnings and profits and deficits to the separate categories there are no deficits remaining in any separate category. Thus, the allocation rules of Sec. 1.960-1(i)(4) do not apply in 1999. Accordingly, in determining the post-1986 foreign income taxes deemed paid by A, post-1986 undistributed earnings in each separate category are unaffected by earnings in the other categories. Foreign taxes deemed paid under section 960 for 1999 would be determined as follows for each separate category: with respect to the inclusion of 95u of foreign base company sales income out of general limitation earnings, the section 960 fraction is 95u inclusion/0 total earnings; with respect to the inclusion of 95u of passive limitation income the section 960 fraction is 95u inclusion/150u passive earnings. Thus, no general limitation taxes would be associated with the inclusion of the general limitation earnings because there are no accumulated earnings in the general limitation category. After the deemed-paid taxes are computed, at the close of 1999 CFC has a (95u) deficit in general limitation earnings and profits ((100u) opening balance + 100u current earnings -95u inclusion), 55u of passive limitation earnings and profits (50u opening balance + 100u current foreign personal holding company income -95u inclusion), and 40u of earnings and profits subject to the separate limitation for dividends from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation (50u opening balance + (10u) expense).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, a U.S. person, is the sole shareholder of CFC, a controlled foreign corporation whose functional currency is the u. At the beginning of 1998, CFC has post-1986 undistributed earnings of 275u, all of which are general limitation earnings described in section 904(d)(1)(I). CFC has no previously-taxed earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1) or (c)(2). In 1998, CFC has a (200u) loss in the shipping category described in section 904(d)(1)(D), 100u of foreign personal holding company income that is passive income described in section 904(d)(1)(A), and 125u of general limitation manufacturing earnings that are not subpart F income. CFC's subpart F income for 1998, 100u, exceeds CFC's current earnings and profits, 25u, by 75u. Under section 952(c)(1)(A) and paragraph (e) of this section, subpart F income is limited to CFC's current earnings and profits of 25u, all of which is included in A's gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A). The 75u of CFC's 1998 subpart F income that is not included in A's income in 1998 by reason of section 952(c)(1)(A) is subject to recapture under section 952(c)(2) and paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of determining the amount and type of income included in A's gross income and the amount and type of income in CFC's recapture account, the rules of paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section apply. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the amount of CFC's subpart F income in excess of earnings and profits for 1998, 75u, reduces the 100u of passive limitation foreign personal holding company income. Thus, A includes 25u of passive limitation foreign personal holding company income in gross

income, and CFC has 75u in its passive limitation/foreign personal holding company income recapture account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of computing post-1986 undistributed earnings in each separate category the rules of sections 902 and 960, including the rules of Sec. 1.960-1(i), apply. Under Sec. 1.960-1(i), the shipping limitation deficit of (200u) is allocated proportionately to reduce general limitation earnings of 400u and passive limitation earnings of 100u. Thus, general limitation earnings are reduced by 160u to 240u (400u general limitation earnings/500u total earnings in positive separate categories x (200u) shipping deficit=160u reduction), and passive limitation earnings are reduced by 40u to 60u (100u passive earnings/500u total earnings in positive separate categories x (200u) shipping deficit=40u reduction). Five-twelfths of CFC's post-1986 foreign income taxes with respect to passive limitation earnings are deemed paid by A under section 960 with respect to the subpart F inclusion (25u inclusion/60u passive earnings). After the inclusion and deemed-paid taxes are computed, at the close of 1998 CFC has 400u of general limitation earnings (275u opening balance + 125u current earnings), 75u of passive limitation earnings (100u of foreign personal holding company income -25u inclusion), and a (200u) deficit in shipping limitation earnings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 3 with the addition of the following facts. In 1999, CFC earns 50u of general limitation earnings that are not subpart F income and 75u of passive limitation income that is foreign personal holding company income. Thus, CFC has 125u of current earnings and profits. CFC distributes 200u to A. Under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, the recapture rules are applied first. Thus, the amount by which 1999 current earnings and profits exceed subpart F income, 50u, is recharacterized as passive limitation foreign personal holding company income. CFC's total subpart F income for 1999 is 125u of passive limitation foreign personal holding company income (75u current earnings plus 50u recapture account), and the passive limitation/foreign personal holding company income recapture account is reduced from 75u to 25u.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> CFC has 150u of previously-taxed earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) (25u attributable to 1998 and 125u attributable to 1999), all of which is passive limitation earnings and profits. Under section 959(c), 150u of the 200u distribution is deemed to be made from earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2). The remaining 50u is deemed to be made from earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3). Under paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, the dividend distribution is deemed to be made first out of the passive limitation recapture account to the extent thereof (25u). Under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, the passive limitation recapture account is reduced from 25u to 0. The remaining distribution of 25u is treated as made out of CFC's general limitation earnings and profits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of computing post-1986 undistributed earnings, the rules of section 902 and 960, including the rules of Sec. 1.960-1(i), apply. Thus, the shipping limitation accumulated deficit of (200u) reduces general limitation earnings and profits of 450u and passive limitation earnings and profits of 150u on a proportionate basis. Thus, 100% of CFC's post-1986 foreign income taxes with respect to passive limitation earnings are deemed paid by A under section 960 with respect to the 1999 subpart F inclusion of 125u (100u inclusion (numerator limited to denominator)/100u passive earnings). No post-1986 foreign income taxes remain to be deemed paid under section 902 in connection with the 25u distribution from the passive limitation/foreign personal holding company income recapture account. One-twelfth of CFC's post-1986 foreign income taxes with respect to general limitation earnings are deemed paid by A under section 902 with respect to the distribution of 25u general limitation earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) (25u inclusion/300u general limitation earnings). After the deemed-paid taxes are computed, at the close of 1999 CFC has 425u of general limitation earnings and profits (400u opening balance + 50u current earnings--25u distribution), 0 of passive limitation earnings (75u recapture account + 75u current foreign personal holding company income--125u inclusion--25u distribution), and a (200u) deficit in shipping limitation earnings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Effective date. Paragraph (e) of this section and this paragraph (f) apply to taxable years of a controlled foreign corporation beginning after March 3, 1997.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Treatment of distributive share of partnership income--(1) In general. A controlled foreign corporation's distributive share of any item of income of a partnership is income that falls within a category of subpart F income described in section 952(a) to the extent the item of income would have been income in such category if received by the controlled foreign corporation directly. For specific rules regarding the treatment of a distributive share of partnership income under certain provisions of subpart F, see Secs. 1.954-1(g), 1.954-2(a)(5), 1.954-3(a)(6), and 1.954-4(b)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

The application of this paragraph (g) may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, is an 80-percent partner in PRS, a foreign partnership. PRS earns $100 of interest income that is not export financing interest as defined in section 954(c)(2)(B), or qualified banking or financing income as defined in section 954(h)(3)(A), from a person unrelated to CFC. This interest income would have been foreign personal holding company income to CFC, under section 954(c), if it had received this income directly. Accordingly, CFC's distributive share of this interest income, $80, is foreign personal holding company income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effective date.
