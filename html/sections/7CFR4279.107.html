                            <p class="depth0">For all new loans there are two types of non-refundable guarantee fees to be paid by the lender. The fees may be passed on to the borrower. The fees may be forwarded to the Agency through an electronic funds transfer

system or, at the Agency's discretion, by a check payable to USDA using a USDA-approved form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial guarantee fee. The initial fee is paid at the time the Loan Note Guarantee is issued. The fee may be included as an eligible loan purpose in the guaranteed loan. The fee will be the rate (a specified percentage not to exceed 2 percent) multiplied by the principal loan amount, multiplied by the percent of guarantee. Subject to specified annual limits set by the Agency, the initial guarantee fee may be reduced to 1 percent if the borrower's business supports value-added agriculture and results in farmers benefiting financially, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is a high impact business development investment in accordance with Sec. 4279.155(b)(5), and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is located in a rural community that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is experiencing long-term population decline and job deterioration, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has remained persistently poor over the last 60 years, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is experiencing trauma as a result of natural disaster, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Is experiencing fundamental structural changes in its economic base.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Annual renewal fee. The annual renewal fee is paid once a year and is required to maintain the enforceability of the guarantee as to the lender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The rate of the annual renewal fee (a specified percentage) is established by Rural Development in an annual notice published in the Federal Register, multiplied by the outstanding principal loan balance as of December 31 of each year, multiplied by the percent of guarantee. The rate is the rate in effect at the time the loan is obligated, and will remain in effect for the life of the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Annual renewal fees are due on January 31. Payments not received by April 1 are considered delinquent and, at the Agency's discretion, may result in cancellation of the guarantee to the lender. Holders' rights will continue in effect as specified in the Loan Note Guarantee and Assignment Guarantee Agreement. Any delinquent annual renewal fees will bear interest at the note rate and will be deducted from any loss payment due the lender. For loans where the Loan Note Guarantee is issued between October 1 and December 31, the first annual renewal fee payment will be due January 31 of the second year following the date the Loan Note Guarantee was issued.
