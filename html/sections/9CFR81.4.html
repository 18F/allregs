                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Information required on certificates. A certificate must show any official animal identification numbers of each animal to be moved. A certificate must also show the number of animals covered by the certificate; the purpose for which the animals are to be moved; the points of origin and destination; the consignor; and the consignee. The certificate must include a statement by the issuing accredited veterinarian, State veterinarian, or Federal veterinarian that the animals were not exhibiting clinical signs associated with CWD at the time of examination. The certificate must also include a statement that the animals are from a herd that has achieved Certified status in the CWD Herd Certification Program, and must provide the herd's program status, with the following exceptions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certificates issued for animals captured from a wild population for interstate movement and release do not need to state that the animals are from a herd that has achieved Certified status in the CWD Herd Certification Program but must include the statement required in Sec. 81.3(b); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certificates issued for animals moved directly to slaughter do not need to state that the animals are from a herd that has achieved Certified status in the CWD Herd Certification Program and must state that an APHIS employee or State representative has been notified in advance of the date the animals are being moved to slaughter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Animal identification documents attached to certificates. As an alternative to typing or writing individual animal identification on a certificate, another document may be used to provide this information, but only under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The document must be a State form or APHIS form that requires individual identification of animals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A legible copy of the document must be stapled to the original and each copy of the certificate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each copy of the document must identify each animal to be moved with the certificate, but any information pertaining to other animals, and any unused space on the document for recording animal identification, must be crossed out in ink; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The following information must be typed or written in ink in the identification column on the original and each copy of the certificate and must be circled or boxed, also in ink, so that no additional information can be added:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name of the document; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Either the serial number on the document or, if the document is not imprinted with a serial number, both the name of the person who issued the document and the date the document was issued.
