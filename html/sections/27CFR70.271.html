                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Method of collection. (1) The liability, at law or in equity, of a transferee of property of any person liable in respect of any tax imposed under provisions of 26 U.S.C. enforced and administered by the Bureau, in any case where the liability of the transferee arises on the liquidation of a corporation or partnership, or a corporate reorganization within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. 368(a), shall be assessed against such transferee and paid and collected in the same manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations as in the case of the tax with respect to which such liability is incurred, except as hereinafter provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applicable provisions. The provisions of 26 U.S.C. made applicable by 26 U.S.C. 6901(a) to the liability of a transferee referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, include the provisions relating to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Delinquency in payment after notice and demand and the amount of interest attaching because of such delinquency;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The authorization of distraint and proceedings in court for collection; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The prohibition of claims and suits for refund.
For detailed provisions relating to assessments, collections, and refunds, see 26 U.S.C. chapters 63, 64, and 65, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definition of transferee. As used in this section, the term ``transferee'' includes the shareholder of a dissolved corporation, the assignee or donee of an insolvent person, the successor of a corporation, a party to a reorganization as defined in 26 U.S.C. 368, and all other classes of distributees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Period of limitations on assessment. The period of limitations for assessment of the liability of a transferee is as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Initial transferee. In the case of the liability of an initial transferee, 1 year after the expiration of the period of limitations for assessment against the transferor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transferee of transferee. In the case of the liability of a transferee of a transferee, 1 year after the expiration of the period of limitations for assessment against the preceding transferee, or 3 years after the expiration of the period of limitations for assessment against the taxpayer, whichever of such periods first expires.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Court proceeding against taxpayer or last preceding transferee. If, before the expiration of the period specified in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, (whichever is applicable), a court proceeding against the taxpayer or last preceding transferee for the collection of the tax or liability in respect thereof, respectively, has been begun within the period of limitation for the commencement of such proceeding, then within 1 year after the return of execution in such proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Extension by agreement--(1) Extension of time for assessment. The time prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 6901 for the assessment of the liability of a transferee may, prior to the expiration of such time, be extended for any period of time agreed upon in writing by the transferee and the appropriate TTB officer. The extension shall become effective when the agreement has been executed by both parties. The period

agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Extension of times for credit or refund. (i) For the purposes of determining the period of limitations on credit or refund to the transferee of overpayments made by such transferee or overpayments made by the taxpayer to which such transferee may be legally entitled to credit or refund, an agreement and any extension thereof referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, shall be deemed an agreement and extension thereof for purposes of 26 U.S.C. 6511(c) (relating to limitations on credit or refund in case of extension of time by agreement).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For the purpose of determining the limit specified in 26 U.S.C. 6511(c)(2) on the amount of the credit or refund, if the agreement is executed after the expiration of the period of limitations for assessment against the taxpayer with reference to whom the liability of such transferee arises, the periods specified in 26 U.S.C. 6511(b)(2) shall be increased by the period from the date of such expiration to the date the agreement is executed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Period of assessment against taxpayer. For the purpose of determining the period of limitations for assessment against a transferee, if the taxpayer is deceased, or, in the case of a corporation, has terminated its existence, the period of limitations for assessment against the taxpayer shall be the period that would be in effect had the termination of existence not occurred.
