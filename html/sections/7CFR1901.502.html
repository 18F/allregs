Sales from the Rural Housing Insurance Fund will be made to the Federal Financing Bank to the extent necessary to service certificates of beneficial ownership held by the Federal Financing Bank. Sales in excess of those needed for servicing requirements will be made to the public. In addition to sales, this subpart provides policy for the servicing of outstanding certificates of beneficial ownership, insurance contracts, and insured notes held by investors.
