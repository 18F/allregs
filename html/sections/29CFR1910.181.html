The base is at a lower elevation than its supports. The location of the base of a basket derrick can be changed by varying the length of the rope supports. The top of the pole is secured with multiple reeved guys to position the top of the pole to the desired location by varying the length of the upper guy lines. The load is raised and lowered by ropes through a sheave or block secured to the top of the pole.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC27OC91.038</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Breast derrick means a derrick without boom. The mast consists of two side members spread farther apart at the base than at the top and tied together at top and bottom by rigid members. The mast is prevented from tipping forward by guys connected to its top. The load is raised and lowered by ropes through a sheave or block secured to the top crosspiece.

The load is raised and lowered by ropes reeved through sheaves or blocks at the top of the mast.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC27OC91.041</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Guy derrick means a fixed derrick consisting of a mast capable of being rotated, supported in a vertical position by guys, and a boom whose bottom end is hinged or pivoted to move in a vertical plane with a reeved rope between the head of the mast and the boom point for raising and lowering the boom, and a reeved rope from the boom point for raising and lowering the load.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC27OC91.042</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Shearleg derrick means a derrick without a boom and similar to a breast derrick. The mast, wide at the bottom and narrow at the top, is hinged at the bottom and has its top secured by a multiple reeved guy to permit handling loads at various radii by means of load tackle suspended from the mast top.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> A stiffleg derrick is a derrick similar to a guy derrick except that the mast is supported or held in place by two or more stiff members, called stifflegs, which are capable of resisting either tensile or compressive forces. Sills are generally provided to connect the lower ends of the stifflegs to the foot of the mast.
