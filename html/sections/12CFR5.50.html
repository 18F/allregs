For purposes of this section, they are considered subject to section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act, 12 U.S.C 1842, and do not require either a prior or subsequent notice to the OCC under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Assessing financial condition. In assessing the financial condition of the acquiring person, the OCC weighs any debt servicing requirements in light of the acquiring person's overall financial strength; the institution's earnings performance, asset condition, capital adequacy, and future prospects; and the likelihood of the acquiring party

making unreasonable demands on the resources of the institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Procedures--(1) Exceptions to rules of general applicability.

No rebuttal filing is effective unless the OCC indicates in writing that the information submitted has been found to be sufficient to rebut the presumption of control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Filings. (i) The OCC does not accept a notice of a change in control unless it is technically complete, i.e., the information provided is responsive to every item listed in the notice form and is accompanied by the appropriate fee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The OCC does not accept a notice of a change in control unless it is technically complete, i.e., the information provided is responsive to every item listed in the notice form and is accompanied by the appropriate fee.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The notice must contain personal and biographical information, detailed financial information, information regarding the future prospects of the institution, details of the proposed change in control, information on any structural or managerial changes contemplated for the institution, and other relevant information required by the OCC. The OCC may waive any of the informational requirements of the notice if the OCC determines that it is in the public interest.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> When the acquiring person is an individual, or group of individuals acting in concert, the requirement to provide personal financial data may be satisfied with a current statement of assets and liabilities and an income summary, together with a statement of any material changes since the date of the statement or summary. However, the OCC may require additional information, if appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The OCC has 60 days from the date it declares the notice to be technically complete to review the notice.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> When the OCC declares a notice technically complete, the appropriate district office sends a letter of acknowledgment to the applicant indicating the technically complete date.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> As set forth in paragraph (g) of this section, the applicant shall publish an announcement within 10 days of filing the notice with the OCC. The publication of the announcement triggers a

20-day public comment period. The OCC may waive or shorten the public comment period if an emergency exists. The OCC also may shorten the comment period for other good cause. The OCC may act on a proposed change in control prior to the expiration of the public comment period if the OCC makes a written determination that an emergency exists.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> An applicant shall notify the OCC immediately of any material changes in a notice submitted to the OCC, including changes in financial or other conditions, that may affect the OCC's decision on the filing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Within the 60-day period, the OCC may inform the applicant that the acquisition has been disapproved, has not been disapproved, or that the OCC will extend the 60-day review period.

Following final agency action under 12 CFR part 19, further review by the courts is available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Conditional actions. The OCC may impose conditions on its action not to disapprove a notice to assure satisfaction of the relevant statutory criteria for non-objection to a notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Disapproval of notice. The OCC may disapprove a notice if it finds that any of the following factors exist:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The proposed acquisition of control would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of the United States;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The effect of the proposed acquisition of control in any section of the country may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly or the proposed acquisition of control would in any other manner be in restraint of trade, and the anticompetitive effects of the proposed acquisition of control are not clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Either the financial condition of any acquiring person or the future prospects of the institution is such as might jeopardize the financial stability of the bank or prejudice the interests of the depositors of the bank;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The competence, experience, or integrity of any acquiring person, or of any of the proposed management personnel, indicates that it would not be in the interest of the depositors of the bank, or in the interest of the public, to permit that person to control the bank;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> An acquiring person neglects, fails, or refuses to furnish the OCC all the information it requires; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The OCC determines that the proposed transaction would result in an adverse effect on the Bank Insurance Fund or the Savings Association Insurance Fund.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Disapproval notification. If the OCC disapproves a notice, it mails a written notification to the proposed acquiring person within three days after the decision containing a statement of the basis for disapproval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Disclosure--(1) Announcement.

The OCC may authorize a delayed announcement if an immediate announcement would not be in the public interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Announcement. The applicant shall publish an announcement in a newspaper of general circulation in the community where the affected national bank is located within ten days of filing.

The announcement also must state that the public portion of the notice is available upon request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notwithstanding any other provisions of this paragraph (g), if the OCC determines in writing that an emergency exists and that the announcement requirements of this paragraph (g) would seriously threaten the safety and soundness of the national bank to be acquired, including situations where the OCC must act immediately in order to prevent the probable failure of a national bank, the OCC may waive or shorten the publication requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Release of information. (i) Upon the request of any person, the OCC releases the information provided in the public portion of the notice and makes it

available for public inspection and copying as soon as possible after a notice has been filed.
