He should be sure, if loans are made, that the  objectives of the loans can be accomplished and the Government's  financial interest will be adequately protected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nonresidential buildings. Construction plans and specifications  for new buildings or improvements to existing buildings must comply with  flood plain area management or control laws, regulations or ordinances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Flood insurance coverage. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any property on which flood  insurance is required must be covered by such insurance during its  anticipated economic and useful life in an amount at least equal to its  development or replacement cost (except estimated land cost), or to the  maximum limit of coverage made available with respect to the particular  type of property under the National Flood Insurance Program, whichever  is less. However, if the financial assistance provided is in the form of  a loan, the amount of flood insurance required need not exceed the  outstanding principal balance of the loan and need not be required  beyond the term of the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contents of a building must be insured separately from a  building but coverage cannot be written on the contents of a three- walled machinery shed or similar type open building.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Flood insurance shall not be required on any state owned  property that is covered under an adequate state policy of self- insurance satisfactory to the Secretary of HUD, who will publish a list  of states with such policies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> It will be emphasized that under the terms of the security  instrument it is the borrower's responsibility to provide and maintain  proper flood insurance coverage. If flood insurance is not provided on  any property for which it is required, the flood insurance premium will  be paid to protect the Government's security interest. For borrowers  required to escrow for flood insurance, payment of the premium will be  handled in accordance with Sec. 1806.28 of this subpart. Existing  borrowers required to escrow will be notified by letter at least 90 days  prior to initiating escrowing for flood insurance. If FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 pays the flood insurance  premium for borrowers not required to escrow, the cost will be charged  to the borrower's account as a recoverable cost. Failure to provide  flood insurance is a nonmonetary default and will be a consideration in  determining if the loan is to be continued.
