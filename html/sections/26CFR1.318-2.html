                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The application of paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.318-1 may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. H, an individual, owns all of the stock of corporation A.  Corporation A is not considered to own the stock owned by H in  corporation A.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. H, an individual, his wife, W, and his son, S, each own  one-third of the stock of the Green Corporation. For purposes of  determining the amount of stock owned by H, W, or S for purposes of  section 318(a)(2)(C) and (3)(C), the amount of stock held by the other  members of the family shall be added pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of  Sec. 1.318-1 in applying the 50-percent requirement of such section. H,  W, or S, as the case may be, is for this purpose deemed to own 100  percent of the stock of the Green Corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The application of section 318(a)(1), relating to members of a  family, may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth2">Example. An individual, H, his wife, W, his son, S, and his grandson  (S's son), G, own the 100 outstanding shares of stock of a corporation,  each owning 25 shares. H, W, and S are each considered as owning 100  shares. G is   considered as owning only 50 shares, that is, his own and his father's.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The application of section 318(a)(2) and (3), relating to  partnerships, trusts and corporations, may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. A, an individual, has a 50 percent interest in a  partnership. The partnership owns 50 of the 100 outstanding shares of  stock of a corporation, the remaining 50 shares being owned by A. The  partnership is considered as owning 100 shares. A is considered as  owning 75 shares.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. A testamentary trust owns 25 of the outstanding 100  shares of stock of a corporation. A, an individual, who holds a vested  remainder in the trust having a value, computed actuarially equal to 4  percent of the value of the trust property, owns the remaining 75  shares. Since the interest of A in the trust is a vested interest rather  than a contingent interest (whether or not remote), the trust is  considered as owning 100 shares. A is considered as owning 76 shares.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. The facts are the same as in (2), above, except that A's  interest in the trust is a contingent remainder. A is considered as  owning 76 shares. However, since A's interest in the trust is a remote  contingent interest, the trust is not considered as owning any of the  shares owned by A.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. A and B, unrelated individuals, own 70 percent and 30  percent, respectively, in value of the stock of Corporation M.  Corporation M owns 50 of the 100 outstanding shares of stock of  Corporation O, the remaining 50 shares being owned by A. Corporation M  is considered as owning 100 shares of Corporation O, and A is considered  as owning 85 shares.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. A and B, unrelated individuals, own 70 percent and 30  percent, respectively, of the stock of corporation M. A, B, and  corporation M all own stock of corporation O. Since B owns less than 50  percent in value of the stock of corporation M, neither B nor  corporation M constructively owns the stock of corporation O owned by  the other. However, for purposes of certain sections of the Code, such  as sections 304 and 856(d), the 50-percent limitation of section  318(a)(2)(C) and (3)(C) is disregarded or is reduced to less than 30  percent. For such purposes, B constructively owns his proportionate  share of the stock of corporation O owned directly by corporation M, and  corporation M constructively owns the stock of corporation O owned by B.
