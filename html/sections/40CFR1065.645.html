                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section describes how to determine the amount of water in an  ideal gas, which you need for various performance verifications and  emission calculations. Use the equation for the vapor pressure of water  in paragraph (a) of this section or another appropriate equation and,  depending on whether you measure dewpoint or relative humidity, perform  one of the calculations in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.  Paragraph (d) of this section provides an equation for determining  dewpoint from relative humidity and dry bulb temperature measurements.  The equations for the vapor pressure of water as presented in this  section are derived from equations in ``Saturation Pressure of Water on  the New Kelvin Temperature Scale'' (Goff, J.A., Transactions American  Society of Heating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Vol. 63, No. 1607,  pages 347-354). Note that the equations were originally published to  derive vapor pressure in units of atmospheres and have been modified to  derive results in units of kPa by converting the last term in each  equation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Vapor pressure of water. Calculate the vapor pressure of water  for a given saturation temperature condition, Tsat, as  follows, or use good engineering judgment to use a different  relationship of the vapor pressure of water to a   given saturation temperature condition:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For humidity measurements made at ambient temperatures from (0  to 100) [deg]C, or for humidity measurements made over super-cooled  water at ambient temperatures from (-50 to 0) [deg]C, use the following  equation: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.039</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For humidity measurements over ice at ambient temperatures from  (-100 to 0) [deg]C, use the following equation:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.040</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Dewpoint. If you measure humidity as a dewpoint, determine the  amount of water in an ideal gas, xH20, as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30AP10.034  Where:  xH20 = amount of water in an ideal gas. pH20 = water vapor pressure at the measured dewpoint,</p><p class="depth2">Tsat = Tdew. pabs = wet static absolute pressure at the location of your</p><p class="depth2">dewpoint measurement.  Example::  pabs = 99.980 kPa Tsat = Tdew = 9.5 [deg]C Using Eq. 1065.645-1, pH20 = 1.186581 kPa xH2O = 1.186581/99.980 xH2O = 0.011868 mol/mol</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Relative humidity. If you measure humidity as a relative  humidity, RH%, determine the amount of water in an ideal gas,  xH2O, as follows:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30AP10.035  Where:  xH20 = amount of water in an ideal gas. RH% = relative humidity. pH20 = water vapor pressure at 100% relative humidity at the</p><p class="depth2">location of your relative humidity measurement,</p><p class="depth2">Tsat = Tamb. pabs = wet static absolute pressure at the location of your</p><p class="depth2">relative humidity measurement.  Example:  RH% = 50.77% pabs = 99.980 kPa Tsat = Tamb = 20 [deg]C Using Eq. 1065.645-1, pH20 = 2.3371 kPa xH2O = (50.77% [middot] 2.3371)/99.980 xH2O = 0.011868 mol/mol</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> describes how to calculate dewpoint  temperature from relative humidity, RH%. This is based on ``ITS-90  Formulations for Vapor Pressure, Frostpoint Temperature, Dewpoint  Temperature, and Enhancement Factors in the Range -100 to +100 [deg]C''  (Hardy, B., The Proceedings of the Third International Symposium on  Humidity & Moisture, Teddington, London, England, April 1998). Calculate  pH20sat as described in paragraph (a) of this section based  on setting Tsat equal to Tamb. Calculate  pH20scaled by multiplying pH20sat by RH%.  Calculate the dewpoint, Tdew, from pH20 using the  following equation: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.041  Where:  ln(pH2O) = the natural log of pH2Oscaled, which is</p><p class="depth2">the water vapor pressure scaled to the relative humidity at</p><p class="depth2">the location of the relative humidity measurement,</p><p class="depth2">Tsat = Tamb.</p><p class="depth2">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.042</p><p class="depth2">[73 FR 37327, June 30, 2008, as amended at 73 FR 59331, Oct. 8, 2008; 75  FR 23048, Apr. 30, 2010; 76 FR 57456, Sept. 15, 2011;79 FR 23796, Apr.  28, 2014]</p>
