                            <p class="depth0">An incinerator burning hazardous waste must be designed, constructed, and maintained so that, when operated in accordance with operating requirements specified under Sec. 264.345, it will meet the following performance standards:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an incinerator burning hazardous waste must

achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 99.99% for each principal organic hazardous constituent (POHC) designated (under Sec. 264.342) in its permit for each waste feed. DRE is determined for each POHC from the following equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.171
where:
Win = mass feed rate of one principal organic hazardous</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an incinerator burning hazardous waste must

achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 99.99% for each principal organic hazardous constituent (POHC) designated (under Sec. 264.342) in its permit for each waste feed. DRE is determined for each POHC from the following equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.171
where:
Win = mass feed rate of one principal organic hazardous</p><p class="depth3">constituent (POHC) in the waste stream feeding the incinerator
and
Wout = mass emission rate of the same POHC present in exhaust</p><p class="depth3">emissions prior to release to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An incinerator burning hazardous wastes FO20, FO21, FO22, FO23, FO26, or FO27 must achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 99.9999% for each principal organic hazardous constituent (POHC) designated (under Sec. 264.342) in its permit. This performance must be demonstrated on POHCs that are more difficult to incinerate than tetra-, penta-, and hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans. DRE is determined for each POHC from the equation in Sec. 264.343(a)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An incinerator burning hazardous waste and producing stack emissions of more than 1.8 kilograms per hour (4 pounds per hour) of hydrogen chloride (HCl) must control HCl emissions such that the rate of emission is no greater than the larger of either 1.8 kilograms per hour or 1% of the HCl in the stack gas prior to entering any pollution control equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An incinerator burning hazardous waste must not emit particulate matter in excess of 180 milligrams per dry standard cubic meter (0.08 grains per dry standard cubic foot) when corrected for the amount of oxygen in the stack gas according to the formula:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.172
Where Pc is the corrected concentration of particulate</p><p class="depth2">matter, Pm is the measured concentration of</p><p class="depth2">particulate matter, and Y is the measured concentration of</p><p class="depth2">oxygen in the stack gas, using the Orsat method for oxygen</p><p class="depth2">analysis of dry flue gas, presented in part 60, appendix A</p><p class="depth2">(Method 3), of this chapter. This correction procedure is to</p><p class="depth2">be used by all hazardous waste incinerators except those</p><p class="depth2">operating under conditions of oxygen enrichment. For these</p><p class="depth2">facilities, the Regional Administrator will select an</p><p class="depth2">appropriate correction procedure, to be specified in the</p><p class="depth2">facility permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For purposes of permit enforcement, compliance with the operating requirements specified in the permit (under Sec. 264.345) will be regarded as compliance with this section. However, evidence that compliance with those permit conditions is insufficient to ensure compliance with the performance requirements of this section may be ``information'' justifying modification, revocation, or reissuance of a permit under Sec. 270.41 of this chapter.
