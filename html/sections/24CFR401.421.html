                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Plan required. For any project not subject to mandatory project-based assistance under Sec. 401.420, the PAE must develop a Rental Assistance Assessment Plan in accordance with section 515(c)(2) of MAHRA to determine whether assistance should be renewed as project-based assistance or whether some or all of the assisted units should be converted to tenant-based assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Matters to be assessed. The PAE must include an assessment of the impact of converting to tenant-based assistance and the impact of renewing project-based assistance on:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The ability of the tenants to find adequate, available, decent, comparable, and affordable housing in the local market;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The types of tenants residing in the project (such as elderly families, disabled families, large families, and cooperative homeowners);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The local housing needs identified in the applicable Consolidated Plan developed under part 91 of this title;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The cost of providing assistance, comparing the applicable payment standard to the rent levels permitted by Secs. 401.410 and 401.411;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The long-term financial stability of the project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The ability of residents to make reasonable choices about their individual living situations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The quality of the neighborhood in which the tenants would reside; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The project's ability to compete in the marketplace.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conversion may be phased in. Any conversion from project-based assistance to tenant-based assistance may occur over a period of not more than 5 years if the PAE decides the transition period is needed for the financial viability of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reports to HUD. The PAE must report to HUD on the matters specified in section 515(c)(2)(C) of MAHRA at least semi-annually.
