individual's premature application will not prevent the individual from establishing eligibility at a later time by applying for educational assistance again after having completed those academic requirements. In determining whether an individual has met the service requirements of this section, VA will exclude any period during which the individual is not entitled to credit for service for periods of time specified in Sec. 3.15.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility based solely on active duty.
