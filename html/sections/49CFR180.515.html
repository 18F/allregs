                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When a tank car passes the required inspection and test with  acceptable results, the tank car facility must mark the date of the  inspection and test and due date of the next inspection and test  qualified on the tank car in accordance with the applicable provisions  of Appendix C of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars (IBR, see  Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). When a tank car facility performs  multiple inspections and tests at the same time, one date may be used to  satisfy the requirements of this section. One date also may be shown  when multiple inspections and tests have the same due date. Dates  displayed on the ``consolidated stencil'' (see the applicable provisions  of Appendix C of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars) take precedence  over dates modified, and not stenciled, pursuant to interval adjustments  for service equipment, linings, and granted alternative inspection  intervals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Converted DOT 105, 109, 112, 114, or 120 class tank cars must  have the new specification and conversion date permanently marked in  letters and figures at least 0.95 cm (0.375 inch) high on the outside of  the manway nozzle or the edge of the manway nozzle flange on the left  side of the car. The marking may have the last numeral of the  specification number omitted (e.g., ``DOT 111A100W'' instead of ``DOT  111A100W1'').</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When qualified within six months of installation and protected  from deterioration, the test date marking of a reclosing pressure relief  device is the installation date on the tank car.
