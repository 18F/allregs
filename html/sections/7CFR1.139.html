                                Sec. 1.139  Procedure upon failure to file an answer or admission
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The failure to file an answer, or the admission by the answer of all  the material allegations of fact contained in the complaint, shall  constitute a waiver of hearing. Upon such admission or failure to file,  complainant shall file a proposed decision, along with a motion for the  adoption thereof, both of which shall be served upon the respondent by  the Hearing Clerk. Within 20 days after service of such motion and  proposed decision, the respondent may file with the Hearing Clerk  objections thereto. If the Judge finds that meritorious objections have  been filed, complainant's Motion shall be denied with supporting  reasons. If meritorious objections are not filed, the Judge shall issue  a decision without further procedure or hearing. Copies of the decision  or denial of complainant's Motion shall be served by the Hearing Clerk  upon each of the parties and may be appealed pursuant to Sec. 1.145.  Where the decision as proposed by complainant is entered, such decision  shall become final and effective without further proceedings 35 days  after the date of service thereof upon the respondent, unless there is  an appeal to the Judicial Officer by a party to the proceeding pursuant  to Sec. 1.145: Provided, however, That no decision shall be final for  purposes of judicial review except a final decision of the Judicial  Officer upon appeal.</p>
