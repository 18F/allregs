TVA shall, upon request, identify the contour marking the upper limit of the flood control storage zone at particular reservoir locations.</p><p class="depth0">Flood risk profile elevation means the elevation of the 500-year flood that has been adjusted for surcharge at the dam. Surcharge is the ability to raise the water level behind the dam above the top-of-gates elevation.</p><p class="depth0">Flowage easement shoreland means privately-owned properties where TVA has the right to flood the land.</p><p class="depth0">Footprint means the total water surface area of either a square or rectangular shape occupied by an adjoining property owner's dock, pier, boathouse, or boatwells.</p><p class="depth0">Full summer pool means the targeted elevation to which TVA plans to fill each reservoir during its annual operating cycle. Applicants are encouraged to consult the appropriate TVA Watershed Team or the TVA website to obtain the full summer pool elevation for the reservoir in question at the time the application is submitted.</p><p class="depth0">Land-based structure means any structure constructed on ground entirely above the full summer pool elevation of a TVA reservoir but below the maximum shoreline contours of that reservoir.</p><p class="depth0">Maximum shoreline contour means an elevation typically five feet above the top of the gates of a TVA dam. It is sometimes the property boundary between TVA property and adjoining private property.</p><p class="depth0">Nonnavigable houseboat means any houseboat not in compliance with one or more of the criteria defining a navigable houseboat.</p><p class="depth0">Owner or landowner ordinarily means all of the owners of a parcel of land. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this part, in all cases where TVA approval is required to engage in an activity and the applicant's eligibility to seek approval depends on status as an owner of real property, the owner or owners of only a fractional interest or of fractional interests totaling less than one in any such property shall not be considered, by virtue of

such fractional interest or interests only, to be an owner and as such eligible to seek approval to conduct the activity without the consent of the other co-owners. In cases where the applicant owns water access rights across adjoining private property that borders TVA-owned shoreland, TVA may exercise its discretion to consider such person an owner, taking into account the availability of the shoreline to accommodate similarly situated owners and such other factors as TVA deems to be appropriate. In subdivisions where TVA had an established practice prior to September 8, 2003 of permitting individual or common water-use facilities on or at jointly-owned lots without the consent of all co-owners, TVA may exercise its discretion to continue such practice, taking into account the availability of the shoreline to accommodate similarly situated owners and other factors as TVA deems to be appropriate; provided, however, that the issuance of a TVA permit conveys no property interests, and the objections of a co-owner may be a basis for revocation of the permit.</p><p class="depth0">Shoreland means the surface of land lying between minimum winter pool elevation of a TVA reservoir and the maximum shoreline contour.</p><p class="depth0">Shoreline means the line where the water of a TVA reservoir meets the shore when the water level is at the full summer pool elevation.</p><p class="depth0">Shoreline Management Zone (SMZ) means a 50-foot-deep vegetated zone designated by TVA on TVA-owned land.</p><p class="depth0">TVA means the Tennessee Valley Authority.</p><p class="depth0">TVA Investigating Officer means a TVA employee or a person under contract to TVA appointed by the Vice President or the CEO to investigate any issue concerning an appeal of a decision on an application under this part.</p><p class="depth0">TVA property means real property owned by the United States and under the custody and control of TVA.</p><p class="depth0">Vice President means the Vice President, Natural Resources, TVA, or a position with functionally equivalent supervisory responsibilities.</p><p class="depth0">Water-based structure means any structure, fixed or floating, constructed on or in navigable waters of the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Winter drawdown elevation means the elevation to which a reservoir water level is lowered during fall to provide storage capacity for winter and spring floodwaters.</p><p class="depth0">Winter pool means the lowest level expected for the reservoir during the flood season.
