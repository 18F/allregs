That request must be made in writing to the Director  of the VA facility within one year of the date of the letter notifying  the educational institution of the original decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An educational institution which, under paragraph (a)(2) of this  section, is delaying the reporting of the enrollment or reenrollment of  a veteran shall provide the veteran with notice of the delay at the time  that the veteran enrolls or reenrolls.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In addition, educational institutions must--   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3685; Pub.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3684(a); Pub. L. 99-576)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Where a veteran or an eligible person, who is pursing a course  leading to a standard college degree, transfers between consecutive  school terms from one approved institution to another approved  institution, for the purpose of enrolling in, and pursuing, a similar  course at the second institution, the veteran or eligible person shall,  for the purpose of entitlement to the payment of educational assistance  allowance be considered to be enrolled at the first institution during  the interval, if the interval does not exceed 30 days, following the  termination date of the school term of the first institution.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3680)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nonpunitive grade. A school may assign a nonpunitive grade for a  course or subject in which the veteran or eligible person is enrolled  even though the veteran or eligible person does not withdraw from the  course or subject. When this occurs, the school must report the  assignment of the nonpunitive grade in a form specified by the Secretary  in time for VA to receive it before the earlier of the following dates  is reached:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Thirty days from the date on which the school assigns the grade,  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sixty days from the last day of the enrollment period for which  the nonpunitive grade is assigned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Interruptions, terminations and changes in hours of credit or  attendance. When a veteran or eligible person interrupts or terminates  his or her training for any reason, including unsatisfactory conduct or  progress, or when he or she changes the number of hours of credit or  attendance, this fact must be reported to VA by the school in a form  specified by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the change in status or change in number of hours of credit  of attendance occurs on a day other than one indicated by paragraph  (d)(2) or (3) of this section, the school will initiate a report of the  change in time for the VA to receive it within 30 days of the date on  which the change occurs. If the course in which the veteran or eligible  person is enrolled does not lead to a standard college degree, and  attendance must be certified for the course, the school may include the  information on the monthly certification of attendance.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3684(a), 1788(a); Pub. L. 99-576)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the enrollment of the veteran or eligible person has been  certified by the school for more than one term, quarter or semester and  the veteran or eligible person interrupts or terminates his or her  training at the end of a term, quarter or semester within the certified  period of enrollment, the school shall report the change in status to  the Department of Veterans Affairs   in time for the Department of Veterans Affairs to receive the report  within 30 days of the last officially scheduled registration date for  the next term, quarter or semester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the change in status or change in the number of hours of  credit or attendance occurs during the 30 days of a drop-add period, the  school must report the change in status or change in the number of hours  of credit or attendance to the Department of Veterans Affairs in time  for the Department of Veterans Affairs to receive the report within 30  days from the last date of drop-add period or 60 days from the first day  of the enrollment period, whichever occurs first.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3684(a))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Correspondence courses. Where the course in which a veteran is  enrolled under 38 U.S.C. chapter 34 or a spouse or surviving spouse is  enrolled under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 is pursued exclusively by  correspondence, the school will report by an endorsement on the  veteran's or eligible spouse's or surviving spouse's certification the  number of lessons completed by the veteran, spouse or surviving spouse  and serviced by the school. Such reports will be submitted quarterly in  a form specified by the Secretary.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3680)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Certification. All reports required by this paragraph must be in  a form specified by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Courses not leading to a standard college degree. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as  provided in this paragraph VA requires that a certification of  attendance be submitted monthly for each veteran or eligible person  enrolled in a course not leading to a standard college degree. The fact  that the course may be pursued on a quarter, semester or term basis will  not relieve the veteran or eligible person and the school of this  requirement. Unless exempted by this paragraph this requirement also  applies to courses measured on a credit-hour basis. This requirement  does not apply to--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Courses measured on a credit-hour basis pursuant to footnote 6  of Sec. 21.4270(a),</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A course pursued on a less than one-half-time basis,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A course pursued by a serviceperson while on active duty, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> A correspondence course which must meet the requirements of  paragraph (e) of this section.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3680(a)(2), 3688(a)(7); Pub. L. 99-576)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Courses leading to a standard college degree. Schools which have  veterans or eligible persons enrolled in courses which lead to a  standard college degree are not required to submit periodic  certifications for students enrolled in such courses. Certifications  are, however, required under paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (h) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Apprentice or other on-the-job training. A certification of  attendance must be submitted monthly during the period of enrollment in  the same manner as certifications required in paragraph (f)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Flight training courses. Where the course consists exclusively  of flight training, the school will report by an endorsement on the  veteran's certification the type and number of hours of actual flight  training received by, and the cost thereof to, the veteran. Such reports  may be submitted monthly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> (1) and (2) of this  section.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3474, 3524)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A veteran's or eligible person's progress may become  unsatisfactory according to the regularly prescribed standards and  practices of the school as a result of the grades he or she receives The  school shall report such unsatisfactory progress to VA in time for   VA to receive it before the earlier of the following dates is reached:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Thirty days from the date on which the school official, who is  responsible for determining whether a student is making progress, first  received the final grade report which establishes that the veteran  either is not progressing satisfactorily, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sixty days from the last day of the enrollment period during  which the veteran or eligible person earned the grades that caused him  or her not to meet the satisfactory progress standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the unsatisfactory progress, conduct or attendance of the  veteran or eligible person is caused by any factors other than the  grades which he or she receives, the school shall report the  unsatisfactory progress, conduct or attendance to VA in time for VA to  receive it within 30 days of the date on which the progress, conduct or  attendance of the veteran or eligible person becomes unsatisfactory.
