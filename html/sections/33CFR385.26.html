                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Project Implementation Report is a  document that provides information on plan formulation and evaluation,  engineering and design, estimated benefits and costs, environmental  effects, and the additional information and analysis necessary for the  Secretary of the Army to approve the project for implementation, or for  Congress to authorize the project for implementation. The Project  Implementation Report bridges the gap between the conceptual level of  detail contained in the ``Final Integrated Feasibility Report and  Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement,'' dated April 1, 1999 and  the detailed design necessary to prepare plans and specifications  required to proceed to construction. Prior to requesting approval or  authorization for the implementation of a project, the Corps of  Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor shall, in consultation with the  Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the  Department of Commerce, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Miccosukee  Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental  Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, complete a  Project Implementation Report addressing the project's justification in  accordance with section 601(f)(2) of WRDA 2000, and other factors  required by section 601(h)(4)(A) of WRDA 2000. To eliminate duplication  with State and local procedures, the Project Implementation Report shall  also address the factors of relevant State laws, including sections  373.1501 and 373.470 of the Florida Statutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before completion of the draft Project Implementation Report,  the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor shall provide the  South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force with information about  the alternative plans developed and evaluated for the Project  Implementation Report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Project Implementation Report shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be consistent with the Plan and applicable law, policy, and  regulation, including the Principles and Guidelines of the Water  Resources Council, as modified by section 601(f)(2)(A) of WRDA 2000;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Be based on the best available science;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Comply with all applicable Federal, State, and Tribal laws;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Contain sufficient information for proceeding to final design  of the project, such as: additional plan formulation and evaluation,  environmental and/or economic benefits, engineering and design, costs,  environmental impacts, real estate requirements, and the preparation of  the appropriate National Environmental Policy Act documentation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Contain the information necessary to determine that the activity  is justified by the environmental benefits derived by the South Florida  ecosystem in accordance with section 601(f)(2)(A) and/or that the  benefits of the project are commensurate with costs, and that the  project is cost-effective;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Comply, in accordance with section 601(b)(2)(A)(ii) of WRDA  2000, with applicable water quality standards and applicable water  quality permitting requirements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Identify, in accordance with Sec. 385.35, the appropriate  quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for  the natural system;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Identify, in accordance with Sec. 385.35, the amount of water  to be reserved or allocated for the natural system under State law  necessary to implement the provisions in paragraphs (a)(3)(vi) and (vii)  of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Identify the quantity, timing, and distribution of water made  available for other water-related needs of the region;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Determine, in accordance with Sec. 385.36, if existing legal  sources of water are to be eliminated or transferred;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Determine, in accordance with Sec. 385.37(b) that  implementation of the selected alternative will not reduce levels of  service for flood protection that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Were in existence on the date of enactment of section 601 of  WRDA 2000; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Are in accordance with applicable law; and consider, as  appropriate, in accordance with Sec. 385.37(c), opportunities to provide  additional flood protection;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> Include an assessment of the monetary and non-monetary  benefits and costs, optimization and justification, cost-effectiveness,  and engineering feasibility of the project;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiii)</em> Include a discussion of any significant changes in cost or  scope of the project from that presented in the ``Final Integrated  Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement,''  dated April 1, 1999;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiv)</em> Include an analysis, prepared by RECOVER as described in  paragraph (c) of this section, of the project's contributions towards  achieving the goals and purposes of the Plan, including, as appropriate,  suggestions for improving the performance of the alternative plans;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xv)</em> Describe how the project contributes to the achievement of  interim goals established pursuant to Sec. 385.38 and the interim  targets established pursuant to Sec. 385.39;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xvi)</em> Include, in accordance with Sec. 385.28(c), a draft Project  Operating Manual as an appendix;

In formulating alternative plans  to be evaluated, the project as described in the ``Final Integrated  Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement,''  dated April 1, 1999 shall be included as one of the alternative plans  that is evaluated. For the selected plan, the guidance memorandum shall  also describe the process for evaluating that plan as the next-added  increment of the Plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identification of selected alternative plan. The guidance  memorandum shall also include a process for identification of a selected  alternative plan, based on the analyses conducted in paragraph (b)(2) of  this section. The alternative plan to be selected should be the plan  that maximizes net benefits, both monetary and non-monetary, on a  system-wide basis, provided that this plan is justified on a next-added  increment basis. Alternative plans that are not justified on a next- added increment basis shall not be selected. The guidance memorandum  shall describe an iterative process for evaluating and/or combining  alternative options until an alternative is identified that maximizes  net benefits while still providing benefits that justify costs on a  next-added increment basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> RECOVER performance evaluation of alternative plans. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior  to the identification of a selected alternative plan, RECOVER shall  evaluate the performance of alternative plans towards achieving the  goals and purposes of the Plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> RECOVER shall prepare information for the Project Delivery Team  describing the results of the evaluations of alternative plans developed  for the Project Implementation Report towards achieving the goals and  purposes of the Plan, including, as appropriate, suggestions for  improving the performance of the alternative plans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> NEPA documentation for Project Implementation Reports. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor shall prepare the  appropriate NEPA document to accompany the Project Implementation  Report.
