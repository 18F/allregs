                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In every investigation under this part involving a motion for temporary relief, the question of whether the complainant shall be required to post a bond as a prerequisite to the issuance of such relief shall be addressed by the parties, the presiding administrative law judge, and the Commission in the manner described in Sec.

The same restrictions and requirements applicable to individual and corporate sureties on Customs bonds, which are set forth in 19 CFR part 113, shall apply with respect to sureties on bonds filed with the Commission by complainants as a prerequisite to a temporary relief under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930. If the surety is an individual, the individual must file an affidavit of the type shown in appendix A to Sec.  210.68. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, while the bond of the individual surety is in effect, an updated affidavit must be filed every four months (computed from the date on which the bond was approved by the Secretary or the Commission).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The bond and accompanying documentation must be submitted to the Commission within the time specified in the Commission notice, order, determination, or opinion requiring the posting of a bond, or within such other time as the Commission may order.
