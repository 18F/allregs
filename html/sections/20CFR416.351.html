                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. You may have considered applying for SSI benefits for  yourself or for another person, and you may have contacted us in  writing, by telephone or in person to inquire about filing an  application for these benefits. It is possible that in responding to  your inquiry, we may have given you misinformation about your  eligibility for such benefits, or the eligibility of the person on whose  behalf you were considering applying for benefits, which caused you not  to file an application at that time. If this happened, and later an  application for such benefits is filed with us, we may establish an  earlier filing date under this section.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1: Ms. Jones calls a Social Security office to inquire about  filing an application for SSI benefits. During her conversation with an  SSA employee, she tells the employee about her resources. The SSA  employee tells Ms. Jones that because her countable resources are above  the allowable limit, she would be ineligible for SSI benefits. The  employee fails to consider certain resource exclusions under the SSI  program which would have reduced Ms. Jones' countable resources below  the allowable limit, making her eligible for benefits. Because Ms. Jones  thought that she would be ineligible, she decides not to file an  application for SSI benefits. Ms. Jones later reads about resource  exclusions under the SSI program. She recontacts the Social Security  office to file an SSI application, and alleges that she had been  previously misinformed about her eligibility for SSI benefits. She files  an application for SSI benefits, provides the information required under  paragraph (f) of this section to show that an SSA employee provided  misinformation, and requests a deemed filing date based upon her receipt  of misinformation.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2: Mr. Adams resides in a State which provides State  supplementary payments that are administered by SSA under the SSI  program. He telephones a Social Security office and tells an SSA  employee that he does not have enough income to live on and wants to  file for SSI benefits. Mr. Adams   states that his only income is his monthly Social Security benefit  check. The SSA employee checks Mr. Adams' Social Security record and  advises him that he is ineligible for SSI benefits based on the amount  of his monthly Social Security benefit. The employee does not consider  whether Mr. Adams would be eligible for State supplementary payments.  Because Mr. Adams was told that he would not be eligible for benefits  under the SSI program, he does not file an application. The employee  does not make a record of Mr. Adams' oral inquiry or take any other  action. A year later, Mr. Adams speaks to a neighbor who receives the  same Social Security benefit amount that Mr. Adams does, but also  receives payments under the SSI program. Thinking the law may have  changed, Mr. Adams recontacts a Social Security office and learns from  an SSA employee that he would be eligible for State supplementary  payments under the SSI program and that he could have received these  payments earlier had he filed an application. Mr. Adams explains that he  did not file an application earlier because he was told by an SSA  employee that he was not eligible for SSI benefits. Mr. Adams files an  application for the benefits, provides the information required under  paragraph (f) of this section to show that an SSA employee provided  misinformation, and requests a deemed filing date based on the  misinformation provided to him earlier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Deemed filing date of an application based on misinformation.  Subject to the requirements and conditions in paragraphs (c) through (g)  of this section, we may establish a deemed filing date of an application  for SSI benefits under the following provisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If we determine that you failed to apply for SSI benefits for  yourself because we gave you misinformation about your eligibility for  such benefits, we will deem an application for such benefits to have  been filed with us on the later of--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The date on which the misinformation was provided to you; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The date on which you met all of the requirements for  eligibility for such benefits, other than the requirement of filing an  application.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Before we may establish a deemed filing date of an application  for benefits for you under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, you or a  person described in Sec. 416.315 must file an application for such  benefits. If you die before an application for the benefits is filed  with us, we will consider establishing a deemed filing date of an  application for such benefits only if a person who would be qualified  under Sec. 416.542(b) to receive any benefits due you, or someone on his  or her behalf, files an application for the benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you had authority under Sec. 416.315 to sign an  application for benefits for another person, and we determine that you  failed to apply for SSI benefits for that person because we gave you  misinformation about that person's eligibility for such benefits, we  will deem an application for such benefits to have been filed with us on  the later of--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The date on which the misinformation was provided to you; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The date on which the person met all of the requirements for  eligibility for such benefits, other than the requirement of filing an  application.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Before we may establish a deemed filing date of an application  for benefits for the person under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section,  you, such person, or another person described in Sec. 416.315 must file  an application for such benefits. If the person referred to in paragraph  (b)(2)(i) of this section dies before an application for the benefits is  filed with us, we will consider establishing a deemed filing date of an  application for such benefits only if a person who would be qualified  under Sec. 416.542(b) to receive any benefits due the deceased person,  or someone on his behalf, files an application for the benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requirements concerning the misinformation. We apply the  following requirements for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The misinformation must have been provided to you by one of our  employees while he or she was acting in his or her official capacity as  our employee. For purposes of this section, an employee includes an  officer of SSA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> of this section. In  addition, for us to find that   the information you received was incomplete, the employee must have  failed to provide you with the appropriate, additional information which  he or she would be required to provide in carrying out his or her  official duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The misinformation may have been provided to you orally or in  writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The misinformation must have been provided to you in response to  a specific request by you to us for information about your eligibility  for benefits or the eligibility for benefits of the person referred to  in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section for which you were considering  filing an application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Evidence that misinformation was provided. We will consider the  following evidence in making a determination under paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Preferred evidence. Preferred evidence is written evidence which  relates directly to your inquiry about your eligibility for benefits or  the eligibility of another person and which shows that we gave you  misinformation which caused you not to file an application. Preferred  evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A notice, letter, or other document which was issued by us and  addressed to you; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Our record of your telephone call, letter, or in-person  contact.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other evidence. In the absence of preferred evidence, we will  consider other evidence, including your statements about the alleged  misinformation, to determine whether we gave you misinformation which  caused you not to file an application. We will not find that we gave you  misinformation, however, based solely on your statements. Other evidence  which you provide or which we obtain must support your statements.  Evidence which we will consider includes, but is not limited to, the  following--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Your statements about the alleged misinformation, including  statements about--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The date and time of the alleged contact(s);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> How the contact was made, e.g., by telephone or in person;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The reason(s) the contact was made;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Who gave the misinformation; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The questions you asked and the facts you gave us, and the  questions we asked and the information we gave you at the time of the  contact;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Statements from others who were present when you were given the  alleged misinformation, e.g., a neighbor who accompanied you to our  office;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If you can identify the employee or the employee can recall  your inquiry about benefits--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Statements from the employee concerning the alleged contact,  including statements about the questions you asked, the facts you gave,  the questions the employee asked, and the information provided to you at  the time of the alleged contact; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Our assessment of the likelihood that the employee provided the  alleged misinformation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An evaluation of the credibility and the validity of your  allegations in conjunction with other relevant information; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any other information regarding your alleged contact.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Information which does not constitute satisfactory proof that  misinformation was given. Certain kinds of information will not be  considered satisfactory proof that we gave you misinformation which  caused you not to file an application. Examples of such information  include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General informational pamphlets that we issue to provide basic  program information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The SSI Benefit Estimate Letter that is based on an individual's  reported and projected income and is an estimate which can be requested  at any time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> General information which we review or prepare but which is  disseminated by the media, e.g., radio, television, magazines, and  newspapers; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Information provided by other governmental agencies, e.g., the  Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, State  unemployment agencies, and State and local governments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Claim for benefits based on misinformation. You may make a claim  for benefits based on misinformation at   any time. Your claim must contain information that will enable us to  determine if we did provide misinformation to you about your eligibility  for SSI benefits, or the eligibility of a person on whose behalf you  were considering applying for benefits, which caused you not to file an  application for the benefits. Specifically, your claim must be in  writing and it must explain what information was provided; how, when,  and where it was provided and by whom; and why the information caused  you not to file an application. If you give us this information, we will  make a determination on such a claim for benefits if all of the  following conditions are also met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(ii)</em> or (b)(2)(ii) of this section, as appropriate. The  application must be filed after the alleged misinformation was provided.  This application may be--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An application on which we have made a previous final  determination or decision awarding the benefits, but only if the  claimant continues to be eligible for benefits (or again could be  eligible for benefits) based on that application;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An application on which we have made a previous final  determination or decision denying the benefits, but only if such  determination or decision is reopened under Sec. 416.1488; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A new application on which we have not made a final  determination or decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The establishment of a deemed filing date of an application for  benefits based on misinformation could result in the claimant becoming  eligible for benefits or for additional benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> We have not made a previous final determination or decision to  which you were a party on a claim for benefits based on alleged  misinformation involving the same facts and issues. This provision does  not apply, however, if the final determination or decision may be  reopened under Sec. 416.1488.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Effective date. This section applies only to misinformation  which we provided on or after December 19, 1989. In addition, this  section is effective only for benefits payable for months after December  1989.
