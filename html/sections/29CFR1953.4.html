                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Developmental changes. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sections 1902.2(b) and 1956.2(b) of  this chapter require that each State with a developmental plan must set  forth in its plan, as developmental steps, those changes which must be  made to its initially-approved plan for its program to be at least as  effective as the Federal program and a timetable for making these  changes. The State must notify OSHA of a developmental change when it  completes a developmental step or fails to meet any developmental step.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the completion of a developmental step is the adoption of a  program component which is identical to the Federal program component,  the State need only submit documentation, such as the cover page of an  implementing directive or a notice of promulgation, that it has adopted  the program component, within 60 days of adoption of the change, but  must make the underlying documentation available for Federal and public  review upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the completion of a developmental step involves the adoption  of policies or procedures which differ from the Federal program, the  State must submit one copy of the required plan supplement within 60  days of adoption of the change.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When a developmental step is missed, the State must submit a  supplement which documents the impact on the program of the failure to  complete the developmental step, an explanation of why the step was not  completed on time and a revised timetable with a new completion date  (generally not to exceed 90 days) and any other actions necessary to  ensure completion. Where the State has an operational status agreement  with OSHA under Sec. 1954.3 of this Chapter, the State must provide an  assurance that the missed step will not affect the effectiveness of  State enforcement in any issues for which the State program has been  deemed to be operational.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the State fails to submit the required documentation or  supplement, as provided in Sec. 1953.4(a)(2), (3) or (4), when the  developmental step is scheduled for completion, OSHA shall notify the  State that documentation or a supplement is required and set a timetable  for submission of any required documentation or supplement, generally  not to exceed 60 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Federal Program changes. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a significant change in the  Federal program would have an adverse impact on the ``at least as  effective'' status of the State program if a parallel State program  modification were not made, State adoption of a change in response to  the Federal program change shall be required. A Federal program change  that would not result in any diminution of the effectiveness of a State  plan compared to Federal OSHA generally would not require adoption by  the State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples of significant changes to the Federal program that  would normally require a State response would include a change in the  Act, promulgation or revision of OSHA standards or regulations, or  changes in policy or procedure of national importance. A Federal program  change that only establishes procedures necessary to implement a new or  established policy, standard or regulation does not require a State  response, although the State would be expected to establish policies and  procedures which are ``at least as effective,'' which must be available  for review on request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When there is a change in the Federal program which requires  State action, OSHA shall advise the States. This notification shall also  contain a date by which States must adopt a corresponding change or  submit a statement why a program change is not necessary. This date will  generally be six months from the date of notification, except where the  Assistant Secretary   determines that the nature or scope of the change requires a different  time frame, for example, a change requiring legislative action where a  State has a biennial legislature or a policy of major national  implications requiring a shorter implementing time frame. State  notification of intent may be required prior to adoption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the State change is different from the Federal program  change, the State shall submit one copy of the required supplement  within 60 days of State adoption. The supplement shall contain a copy of  the relevant legislation, regulation, policy or procedure and  documentation on how the change maintains the ``at least as effective  as'' status of the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the State adopts a change identical to the Federal program  change, the State is not required to submit a supplement. However, the  State shall provide documentation that it has adopted the change, such  as the cover page of an implementing directive or a notice of  promulgation, within 60 days of State adoption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The State may demonstrate why a program change is not necessary  because the State program is already the same as or at least as  effective as the Federal program change. Such submissions will require  review and approval as set forth in Sec. 1953.6.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Where there is a change in the Federal program which does not  require State action but is of sufficient national interest to warrant  indication of State intent, the State may be required to provide such  notification within a specified time frame.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Evaluation changes. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Special and periodic evaluations of a  State program by OSHA in cooperation with the State may show that some  portion of a State plan has an adverse impact on the effectiveness of  the State program and accordingly requires modification to the State's  underlying legislation, regulations, policy or procedures as an  evaluation change. For example, OSHA could find that additional  legislative or regulatory authority may be necessary to effectively  pursue the State's right of entry into workplaces, or to assure various  employer rights.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> OSHA shall advise the State of any evaluation findings that  require a change to the State plan and the reasons supporting this  decision. This notification shall also contain a date by which the State  must accomplish this change and submit either the change supplement or a  timetable for its accomplishment and interim steps to assure continued  program effectiveness, documentation of adoption of a program component  identical to the Federal program component, or, as explained in  paragraph (c)(5) of this section, a statement demonstrating why a  program change is not necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the State adopts a program component which differs from a  corresponding Federal program component, the State shall submit one copy  of a required supplement within 60 days of adoption of the change. The  supplement shall contain a copy of the relevant legislation, regulation,  policy or procedure and documentation on how the change maintains the  ``at least as effective as'' status of the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the State adopts a program component identical to a Federal  program component, submission of a supplement is not required. However,  the State shall provide documentation that it has adopted the change,  such as the cover page of an implementing directive or a notice of  promulgation, within 60 days of adoption of the change and shall retain  all other documentation within the State available for review upon  request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The State may demonstrate why a program change is not necessary  because the State program is meeting the requirements for an ``at least  as effective'' program. Such submission will require review and approval  as set forth in Sec. 1953.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> State-initiated changes. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A State-initiated change is any  change to the State plan which is undertaken at a State's option and is  not necessitated by Federal requirements. State-initiated changes may  include legislative, regulatory, administrative, policy or procedural  changes which impact on the effectiveness of the State program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A State-initiated change supplement is required whenever the  State takes an action not otherwise covered by this part that would  impact on the effectiveness of the State program. The State shall notify  OSHA as soon as it   becomes aware of any change which could affect the State's ability to  meet the approval criteria in parts 1902 and 1956 of this chapter, e.g.,  changes to the State's legislation, and submit a supplement within 60  days. Other State initiated supplements must be submitted within 60 days  after the change occurred. The State supplement shall contain a copy of  the relevant legislation, regulation, policy or procedure and  documentation on how the change maintains the ``at least as effective  as'' status of the plan. If the State fails to notify OSHA of the change  or fails to submit the required supplement within the specified time  period, OSHA shall notify the State that a supplement is required and  set a time period for submission of the supplement, generally not to  exceed 30 days.</p>
