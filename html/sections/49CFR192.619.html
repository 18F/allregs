However,  for steel pipe in pipelines being converted under Sec. 192.14 or uprated  under subpart K of this part, if any variable necessary to determine the  design pressure under the design formula (Sec. 192.105) is unknown, one  of the following pressures is to be used as design pressure:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Eighty percent of the first test pressure that produces yield  under section N5 of Appendix N of ASME B31.8 (incorporated by reference,  see Sec. 192.7), reduced by the appropriate factor in paragraph  (a)(2)(ii) of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the pipe is 12\3/4\ inches (324 mm) or less in outside  diameter and is not tested to yield under this paragraph, 200 p.s.i.
