                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Whenever the PBGC issues or has issued a plan  restoration order under ERISA section 4047, it shall issue to the plan  sponsor a restoration payment schedule order in accordance with the  rules of this section. PBGC, through its Executive Director, shall also  issue a certification to its Board of Directors and the IRS, as  described in paragraph (c) of this section. If more than one plan is or  has been restored, the PBGC shall issue a separate restoration payment  schedule order and separate certification with respect to each restored  plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of 26 CFR 1.412(c)(1)-3 over a period extending no more  than 30 years after the initial post-restoration valuation date, as  defined in paragraph (a)(1) of 26 CFR 1.412(c)(1)-3. The restoration  payment schedule shall be consistent with the requirements of 26 CFR  1.412(c)(1)-3 and may require payments at intervals of less than one   year, as determined by the PBGC. The PBGC may, in its discretion, amend  the restoration payment schedule at any time, consistent with the  requirements of 26 CFR 1.412(c)(1)-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)-3)</em> and any other factor that the  PBGC deems relevant, and, based on that review, determines that it is in  the best interests of the plan's participants and beneficiaries and the  single-employer insurance program that the restored plan not be  reterminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Periodic PBGC review. As long as a restoration payment schedule  order issued under this section is in effect, the PBGC shall review  annually the funding status of the plan with respect to which the order  applies. As part of this review, the PBGC, through its Executive  Director, shall issue a certification in the form described in paragraph  (c) of this section. As a result of its funding review, PBGC may amend  the restoration payment schedule, consistent with the requirements of  paragraph (c)(2) of 26 CFR 1.412(c)(1)-3.</p>
