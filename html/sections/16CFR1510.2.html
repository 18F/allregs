Examples of products which may have similar noisemaking characteristics but which are excluded from the scope of this definition are: dolls, stuffed animals, crib exercisers, crib mobiles, pull toys, shoe lace holders, bells which are not part of the noisemaking component of a rattle, plastic keys or other figures on loops or chains which produce sound by striking together, games, puzzles and musical instruments such as tambourines, castanets, and maracas.</p>
