Cover the entire surface with organic solvent in which PCBs are soluble to at least 5 percent by weight. Contain and collect any runoff solvent for disposal. Scrub rough surfaces with a scrub brush or disposable scrubbing pad and solvent such that each 900 cm\2\ (1 square foot) of the surface is always very wet for 1 minute. Wipe smooth surfaces with a solvent-soaked, disposable absorbent pad such that each 900 cm\2\ (1 square foot) is wiped for 1 minute. Any surface <1 square foot shall also be wiped for 1 minute. Wipe, mop, and/or sorb the solvent onto absorbent material until no visible traces of the solvent remain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> First rinse. Wet the surface with clean rinse solvent such that the entire surfaces is very wet for 1 minute. Drain and contain the solvent from the surface. Wipe the residual solvent off the drained surface using a clean, disposable absorbent pad until no liquid is visible on the surface.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Second wash. Repeat the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section. The rinse solvent from the first rinse (paragraph (b) of this section) may be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Second rinse.
