The effect of the repeal will generally be to increase the tax liability  of taxpayers who elected to adopt the methods of accounting provided by  sections 452 and 462. References to sections of law in Sec. Sec.  1.9000-2 to 1.9000-8, inclusive, are references to the Internal Revenue  Code of 1954 unless otherwise specified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Act of June 15, 1955, provides that if the amount of any tax  is increased by the repeal of sections 452 and 462 and if the last date  prescribed for the payment of such tax (or any installment thereof) is  before December 15, 1955, then the taxpayer shall on or before such date  file a statement as prescribed in Sec. 1.9000-3. The last date  prescribed for payment for this purpose shall be determined without  regard to any extensions of time and without regard to the provisions of  the Act of June 15, 1955.</p>
