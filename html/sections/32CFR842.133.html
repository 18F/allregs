                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Customer complaints. Do not automatically adjudicate customer complaint claims until a determination is made that a valid claim exists. Complaints and personal property losses suffered by customers of MWR sales or service operations are normally not within the scope of this subpart. Customer complaints may not be claims at all. They may be no more than expressions of customer dissatisfactions. The activity manager is responsible for adjudicating and satisfying or otherwise disposing of a customer's complaint according to applicable NAFI regulations. Where possible, the activity manager resolves them by reimbursement, repair, or replacement in kind. However, if a complaint involving a claim cannot be satisfactorily settled under those procedures or includes a demand for consequential damage (such as for personal injury or property damage to other than the article purchased or serviced), process it as a tort claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Claims generated by concessionaires. Most concessionaires must have commercial insurance. Any unresolved claims or complaints against concessionaires or their insurers are sent to the appropriate contracting officers.</p>
