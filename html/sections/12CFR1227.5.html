If a suspending official determines that  grounds exist under paragraph (b) of this section for issuance of a  proposed suspension order with respect to a particular person and any  affiliates thereof, the suspending official may issue a written notice  of proposed suspension to the person and any affiliates thereof, and  shall provide a copy of such notice to the regulated entity and to all  of the other regulated entities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Content of notice.

The response shall identify:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any information and argument in opposition to the proposed  suspension;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any specific facts that contradict the statements contained in  the notice of proposed suspension.
