                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will rank proposals using the  13 criteria listed below. In the following list, a description of each  criterion is followed by examples and the points they would receive for  that criterion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wetlands conservation. Will the project reverse coastal wetland  loss or habitat degradation in decreasing or stable coastal wetland  types? Will it   conserve wetlands to prevent losses of decreasing or stable wetland  types? (Maximum: 7 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The majority of the project area (over 50 percent) is nationally  decreasing coastal wetland types, \2\ or the majority is regionally  decreasing wetlands types in which the case for regionally decreasing is  well-documented (Up to 7 points). The nationally decreasing types are  estuarine intertidal emergent; estuarine intertidal forested; estuarine  intertidal scrub-shrub; marine intertidal; palustrine emergent;  palustrine forested; and palustrine scrub-shrub. Describe the wetlands  using terms listed above. Include a breakdown showing the percentage of  the proposal's total and wetland acreage in decreasing types. Provide  National Wetlands Inventory codes/information if available. Information  about these can be found on the National Wetland Inventory's web site at  http://wetlands.fws.gov. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">\2\ These designations are based on the National Wetlands Priority  Conservation Plan. For more information about the plan, or to receive a  copy of the document, refer to the contact information provided in Sec.   84.21. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The majority of the project area (over 50 percent) is  nationally stable coastal wetlands types \2\ (Up to 5 points). The  nationally stable types are estuarine intertidal non-vegetated and  estuarine subtidal. Describe the wetlands using the terms listed above.  Include a breakdown showing the percentage of the proposal's total and  wetland acreage in stable types. Provide National Wetlands Inventory  codes/information if available.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Wetlands benefited are less than 50 percent of the project  area. (Up to 3 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the project would benefit wetlands in the upper portion of  the coastal watershed, but does not demonstrate significant and direct  benefits to coastal wetlands, the proposal will not receive any points.  (0 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> We will award a full 7 points to proposals that document that  over 50 percent of their project area would be, upon project completion,  decreasing coastal wetland types. A combination of decreasing and stable  types that is over 50 percent of the project area could receive an  intermediate score of 4, 5, or 6 points, depending on the balance  between decreasing and stable types. If wetlands are 50 percent or less  of the project area, use the following guide for allocating points: 25  to 50 percent of the project area is decreasing or stable wetlands, 2,  3, or 4 points; 5 to 24 percent, 1 or 2 points; and less than 5 percent,  0 points.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maritime forests on coastal barriers. Will the proposal  significantly benefit maritime forests on coastal barriers? The coastal  barrier does not need to be a unit of the Coastal Barrier Resources  System. (Maximum: 7 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The proposal documents significant benefit to maritime forests  on a coastal barrier. Describe the forest in sufficient detail so  reviewers can determine whether it meets the definition of ``maritime  forest.'' (Up to 7 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The proposal does not benefit maritime forests on a coastal  barrier. (0 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For this criterion most scores should be either 0 or 7. If  questions arise about the significance of the benefit or whether the  forests meet the strict definition, an intermediate score could be  given.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Long-term conservation. Does the project ensure long-term  conservation of coastal wetland functions? The project must provide at  least 20 years of conservation benefits to be eligible. (Maximum: 7  points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Once the project is complete, the project will provide  continuing coastal wetlands benefits in perpetuity (100 years or  longer). (7 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Once the project is complete, the project will provide  continuing coastal wetland benefits for 50-99 years. (3 to 6 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Once the project is complete, the proposal will provide  continuing coastal wetlands benefits for 20-49 years. (1 to 3 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The proposal should show how the project will be maintained and  the benefits sustained over time. Proposals must include adequate  documentation of long-term conservation of coastal wetland values, such  as a 25-year easement, to receive points for this criterion. If part of  the project's benefits will be perpetual (owned in fee title, for  example) and part is estimated to last 20 years, reviewers should weigh   the different elements of the project and give an intermediate score.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Coastal watershed management. Would the completed project help  accomplish the natural resource goals and objectives of one or more  formal, ongoing coastal ecosystem or coastal watershed management  plan(s) or effort(s)? Describe the management plan or effort(s).  (Maximum: 3 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The project supports the natural resource goals of identified  formal, ongoing coastal ecosystem or coastal watershed management plans  or efforts. Describe the management plan(s) and/or effort(s) and explain  how this project relates to its objectives. A plan that very  specifically identifies the site will receive more points than a plan  containing many generic references. (Up to 3 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The project does not support the natural resource goals and  objectives of a formal, ongoing coastal ecosystem or coastal watershed  management effort. If the proposal benefits the upper portions of  coastal watersheds, but provides no significant and direct benefits to  the coastal wetlands ecosystems, the proposal will not receive points.  (0 points)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Conservation of threatened and endangered species. Will the  project benefit any federally listed endangered or threatened species,  species proposed for Federal listing, recently delisted species, or  designated or proposed critical habitat in coastal wetlands? Will it  benefit State-listed threatened and endangered species? (Maximum: 5  points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The project will provide, restore, or enhance important habitat  (e.g., nesting, breeding, feeding, nursery areas) for federally listed  or proposed endangered or threatened species that use the coastal area  project site for at least part of their life cycle. The project will  benefit recently delisted species and habitat conservation plans  developed under the auspices of the Endangered Species Act. List the  species and their status (e.g., threatened or endangered) and provide  documentation (e.g., cite recovery plan, attach letter from species  expert) of current or recent species occurrence in the coastal area  project site. Describe the importance of the habitat. (Up to 5 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The project will provide, restore, or enhance important habitat  for State-listed threatened and endangered species. (Up to 2 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The project will not provide, restore, or enhance important  habitat for federally or State-listed or proposed endangered or  threatened species in the coastal area project site for any part of  their life cycle. If the proposal provides benefits to threatened and  endangered species in the upper portion of the coastal watershed, but  provides no significant and direct benefits to threatened and endangered  species using coastal wetlands ecosystem habitat, the proposal will not  receive any points. (0 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The combined scores of subparagraphs (a)(5)(i) and (a)(5)(ii)  of this section cannot exceed the 5-point maximum.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Benefits to fish. Will the project provide, restore, or enhance  important fisheries habitat? (Maximum: 5 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The project will provide, restore, or enhance important habitat  (i.e., spawning, nursery, juvenile, or foraging habitat) for specific  species that use the coastal area project site for at least part of  their life cycle. These species may include anadromous,  interjurisdictional, or other important species. List species, habitat  types, and benefits to each species. (Up to 5 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The project does not document current or future benefits to  fish species and their habitat. (0 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The more specific the information is on the use of the area  and the importance of the habitat, the greater the points. An area  specifically identified as critical for conservation in a fisheries  management plan will, for example, receive more points than one which is  not.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Benefits to coastal-dependent or migratory birds. Will the  project provide, restore, or enhance important habitat for coastal- dependent or migratory birds?</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The project will provide, restore, or enhance important habitat  (i.e., breeding, staging, foraging, wintering/summering habitat)  benefits for at least part of the life cycle of coastal dependent or  migratory birds. List the   species and habitat types, and describe the benefits to each. (Up to 5  points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The project will not significantly benefit coastal-dependent or  migratory birds. (0 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> We will give maximum points to projects that benefit coastal- dependent species identified in the North American Waterfowl Plan or  listed as species of management concern. \3\ Proposals should also  include information that demonstrates how the project will contribute to  the regional goals developed under the U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan,  the North American Waterbird Conservation Plan, Partners in Flight, the  North American Waterfowl Management Plan, or other bird conservation  initiatives. Proposals that fail to do so will not receive maximum  points. Indicate if the proposed area has been specifically identified  by any program or agency for its migratory bird values. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">\3\ For more information about species of management concern, visit  the website migratorybirds.fws.gov or contact the Division of Migratory  Bird Management at 703-358-1714. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Prevent or reduce contamination. Will the project prevent or  reduce input of contaminants to the coastal wetlands and associated  coastal waters, or restore coastal wetlands and other associated coastal  waters that are already contaminated? (Maximum: 5 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The project will prevent significant inputs of contaminants or  will provide significant improvements to the quality of the coastal  wetland and associated waters through protection from contaminants or  restoration, including assimilation of nutrients and nonpersistent toxic  substances. Describe the types and sources of possible or current  impairment to the coastal wetland and other associated coastal waters  (e.g., to water quality, sediments, flora, or fauna). Describe how  contaminant inputs or residues will be prevented, reduced, or  eliminated. Preventing contaminants by precluding residential  development through acquisition will not normally warrant full points  unless the applicant can be shown that significant contamination would  have occurred otherwise. (Up to 5 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The proposal will not significantly prevent impairment or  improve the quality of the coastal wetland and associated coastal  waters. If the proposal provides positive water quality benefits in the  upper portions of watersheds, but provides no significant and direct  positive water quality benefits to coastal wetland ecosystems, the  proposal will not receive points. (0 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Show direct links between contamination and wildlife and  aquatic habitats. To receive full points, you should provide  documentation of the linkage. Reviewers may consider the extent of  contaminants prevention/reduction when assigning points. Proposals  having the potential to produce an attractive nuisance (e.g., acquiring  and/or restoring a wetland that will be attractive to wildlife and that  also has the potential to accumulate high levels of persistent toxic  metals or hydrocarbon compounds) will not receive points.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Catalyst for future conservation. Is the project proposal  designed to leverage other ongoing coastal wetlands protection projects  in the area, such as acquisition of areas to add to already acquired  coastal lands, or provide impetus for additional restoration? (Maximum:  4 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The project will be essential (e.g., key to completion or  implementation of a greater conservation plan) to further advance or  promote other coastal projects under way. Explain why. (Up to 4 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The project proposal does not demonstrate a positive impact on  other coastal projects. (0 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To receive the maximum number of points, the proposal should  be essential to the initiation or completion of a larger project.  Examples may include acquisition of key in-holdings within a larger  protected area, funds necessary to acquire fee simple interest in  properties where a conservation easement has already been secured, and  funds necessary to complete restoration activities to a protected area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Partners in conservation. Will the proposal receive financial  support, including in-kind match, from private, local, or other Federal  interests? (Maximum: 4 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The proposal includes the State applicant plus one or more non- State financial partners. (Up to 4 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The proposal includes only financial support from the State  applicant. (0 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A written description of commitment of funds or in-kind match  from the partners must accompany the proposal. (This requirement is in  addition to signing the Assurances Form.) The purpose of this criterion  is to promote partnerships with private, local, or other Federal  agencies rather than to increase the dollar amount of the matching  share. Therefore, no specific minimum amount is indicated here. At least  two partners, in addition to the State applicant, should have committed  money to the project to receive maximum points.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Federal share reduced. Does the proposal significantly reduce  the Federal share by providing more than the required match amount? In  the case of a Territory or Commonwealth that does not require match  funds, does the proposal include financial support from sources other  than the Territory or Commonwealth? (Maximum: 5 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The State, territory, or commonwealth applicant must have a non- Federal funding source (in-kind match does not count for this criterion)  that reduces the Federal share. (Up to 5 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The maximum Federal share is requested by the proposal. (0  points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The purpose of this criterion is to increase the amount of  money from non-Federal sources. This increase decreases the need for  Federal match dollars, so that Federal dollars can help more projects.  Documentation of each partner's financial commitment must accompany the  proposal to receive points. If the State itself provides the excess  match, the State should receive credit for reducing the Federal share.  Each 5 percent above the required State match would be approximately  equal to 1 point. The following two examples, using both a 50 and 75  percent Federal match share, define a 10 percent increase in a State's  match amount.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Example 1-50--Percent Federal Match  If the total project costs are $100,000, then the required State match</p><p class="depth5">share is $50,000. If the State or a partner provides an additional cash contribution equal</p><p class="depth5">to 10 percent of the $50,000, $5,000. This is defined as a 10</p><p class="depth5">percent increase in the State match. \4\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth5">\4\ From sources other than Federal agencies. Natural Resource  Damage Assessment funds may in some cases be defined as ``non-Federal.''  See discussion under Sec.  84.46 on What are the cost-sharing  requirements?  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Example 2-75--Percent Federal Match  If the total project costs are $100,000, then the required State match</p><p class="depth5">share is $25,000. If the State or a partner provides an additional cash contribution equal</p><p class="depth5">to 10 percent of the $25,000, $2,500. This is defined as a 10</p><p class="depth5">percent increase in the State match. \4\</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Education/outreach program or wildlife-oriented recreation. Is  the project designed to increase environmental awareness and develop  support for coastal wetlands conservation? Does it provide recreational  opportunities that are consistent with the conservation goals of the  site? (Maximum: 3 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The proposal includes a site-specific, substantive education/ outreach or wildlife-oriented recreation program. (Up to 3 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The proposal does not include a substantive education/outreach  or wildlife-oriented recreation program. (0 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The proposal must describe what makes this program substantive  and link it closely with the specific site to receive full points.  Programs supported by activities or funds from partners should be  encouraged over use of project dollars. Project proposals may include  substantive education/outreach components necessary for the completion  of the project. However, these should be activities that complement or  support the primary goal of the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Other factors. Do any other factors, not covered in the  previous criteria, make this project or site particularly unique and  valuable? Does the project offer important benefits that   are not reflected in the other criteria? The following list includes  examples of projects that provide benefits not reflected in other  criteria. (Maximum: 4 points)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The project might provide significant benefits to, for example:  rare or threatened habitat types; biodiverse habitats; rare and  declining species; and the local community.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The project would be particularly cost-effective, providing  very significant resource benefits for the cost.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The project would assist in the prevention or control of  invasive species.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The project would provide important cultural or historical  resource benefits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The project would provide other benefits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Reviewers should not assign points to resource values covered  by other criteria. The proposal should provide a short narrative to  support claims to Other Factors points.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional considerations. We will factor the following  considerations into the ranking process if two or more proposals have  the same point totals. The tie-breaking factors are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The project would prevent the destruction or degradation of  habitat from pending sale of property, from adverse effects of current  activities such as draining of wetlands, or from natural processes such  as erosion at excessive rates;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The project would protect unique and significant biological  diversity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The project has lower costs per acre conserved; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the project proposal the State or third party provides lands  as opposed to using lands already owned by the State or third party as  part of the State matching share.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All proposals must include the information described in  paragraphs (b) (1)-(4) of this section. If a tie occurs between two or  more proposals, the reviewers need to have this information available  immediately to decide which proposal or proposals should be recommended  for selection.</p>
