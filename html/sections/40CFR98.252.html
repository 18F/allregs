Calculate and report the emissions from stationary combustion units under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) by following the requirements of subpart C, except for emissions from combustion of fuel gas. For CO2 emissions from combustion of fuel gas, use either Equation C-5 in subpart C of this part or the Tier 4 methodology in subpart C of this part, unless either of the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section are met, in which case use either Equations C-1 or C-2a in subpart C of this part. For CH4 and N2O emissions from combustion of fuel gas, use the applicable procedures in Sec. 98.33(c) for the same tier methodology that was used for calculating CO2 emissions. (Use the default CH4 and N2O emission factors for ``Fuel Gas'' in Table C-2 of this part. For Tier 3, use either the default high heat value for fuel gas in Table C-1 of subpart C of this part or a calculated HHV, as allowed in Equation C-8 of subpart C of this part.) You may aggregate units, monitor common stacks, or monitor common (fuel) pipes as provided in Sec. 98.36(c) when calculating and reporting emissions from stationary combustion units. Calculate and report the emissions from flares under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The annual average fuel gas flow rate in the fuel gas line to the combustion unit, prior to any split to individual burners or ports, does not exceed 345 standard cubic feet per minute at 60 [deg]F and 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute and either of the conditions in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section exist. Calculate the annual average flow rate using company records assuming total flow is evenly distributed over 525,600 minutes per year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A flow meter is not installed at any point in the line supplying fuel gas or an upstream common pipe.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The fuel gas line contains only vapors from loading or unloading, waste or wastewater handling, and remediation activities that are combusted in a thermal oxidizer or thermal incinerator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The combustion unit has a maximum rated heat input capacity of less

than 30 mmBtu/hr and either of the following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A flow meter is not installed at any point in the line supplying fuel gas or an upstream common pipe; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The fuel gas line contains only vapors from loading or unloading, waste or wastewater handling, and remediation activities that are combusted in a thermal oxidizer or thermal incinerator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> CO2, CH4, and N2O coke burn-off emissions from each catalytic cracking unit, fluid coking unit, and catalytic reforming unit under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> CO2 emissions from sour gas sent off site for sulfur recovery operations under this subpart. You must follow the calculation methodologies from Sec. 98.253(f) and the monitoring and QA/QC methods, missing data procedures, reporting requirements, and recordkeeping requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> CO2 process emissions from each on-site sulfur recovery plant under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from each coke calcining unit under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> CO2 and CH4 emissions from asphalt blowing operations under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> CH4 emissions from equipment leaks, storage tanks, loading operations, delayed coking units, and uncontrolled blowdown systems under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from each process vent not specifically included in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> CO2 emissions from non-merchant hydrogen production process units (not including hydrogen produced from catalytic reforming units) following the calculation methodologies, monitoring and QA/QC methods, missing data procedures, reporting requirements, and recordkeeping requirements of subpart P of this part.
