                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Confidentiality of information will be maintained by  BIS consistent with the non-disclosure provisions of the Act, the Export  Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730 through 774), the  International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120 through  130), and applicable exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act, as  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disclosure of confidential business information contained in  advance notifications. Information contained in advance notifications of  exports and imports of Schedule 1 chemicals is not subject to the  confidential business information provisions of the Act. Disclosure of  such information will be in accordance with the provisions of the  relevant statutory and regulatory authorities as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exports of Schedule 1 chemicals. Confidentiality of all  information contained in these advance notifications will be maintained  consistent with the non-disclosure provisions of the Export  Administration Regulations (15 CFR   parts 730 through 774), the International Traffic in Arms Regulations  (22 CFR parts 120 through 130), and applicable exemptions under the  Freedom of Information Act, as appropriate; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Imports of Schedule 1 chemicals. Confidentiality of information  contained in these advance notifications will be maintained pursuant to  applicable exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disclosure of confidential business information pursuant to  Sec. 404(b) of the Act--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disclosure to the Organization for the  Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As provided by Section  404(b)(1) of the Act, the U.S. Government will disclose or otherwise  provide confidential business information to the Technical Secretariat  of the OPCW or to other States Parties to the Convention, in accordance  with provisions of the Convention, particularly with the provisions of  the Annex on the Protection of Confidential Information (Confidentiality  Annex).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Convention provisions. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The Convention provides that States  Parties may designate information submitted to the Technical Secretariat  as confidential, and requires the OPCW to limit access to, and prevent  disclosure of, information so designated, except that the OPCW may  disclose certain confidential information submitted in declarations to  other States Parties if requested. The OPCW has developed a  classification system whereby States Parties may designate the  information they submit in their declarations as ``restricted,''  ``protected,'' or ``highly protected,'' depending on the sensitivity of  the information. Other States Parties are obligated, under the  Convention, to store and restrict access to information which they  receive from the OPCW in accordance with the level of confidentiality  established for that information.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The OPCW Inspection Team members are prohibited, under the terms  of their employment contracts and pursuant to the Confidentiality Annex  of the Convention, from disclosing to any unauthorized persons, during  their employment and for five years after termination of their  employment, any confidential information coming to their knowledge or  into their possession in the performance of their official duties.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> U.S. Government designation of information to the Technical  Secretariat. It is the policy of the U.S. Government to designate all  facility information it provides to the Technical Secretariat in  declarations, reports and Schedule 1 advance notifications as  ``protected.'' It is the policy of the U.S. Government to designate  confidential business information that it discloses to Inspection Teams  during inspections as ``protected'' or ``highly protected,'' depending  on the sensitivity of the information. The Technical Secretariat is  responsible for storing and limiting access to any confidential business  information contained in a document according to its established  procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of the Act provides  that the U.S. Government must disclose confidential business information  to any committee or subcommittee of Congress with appropriate  jurisdiction upon the written request of the chairman or ranking  minority member of such committee or subcommittee. No such committee or  subcommittee, and no member and no staff member of such committee or  subcommittee, may disclose such information or material except as  otherwise required or authorized by law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of the Act provides that the U.S. Government must disclose  confidential business information to other Federal agencies for  enforcement of the Act or any other law, and must disclose such  information when relevant in any proceeding under the Act. Disclosure  will be made in such manner as to preserve confidentiality to the extent  practicable without impairing the proceeding. Section 719.14(b) of the  CWCR provides that all hearings will be closed, unless the  Administrative Law Judge for good cause shown determines otherwise.  Section 719.20 of the CWCR provides that parties may request that the  administrative law judge segregate and restrict access to confidential  business information contained in material in the record of an  enforcement proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Disclosure to the public; national interest determination.  Section 404(c) of the Act provides that confidential business  information, as defined by the Act, that is in the possession of the  U.S. Government, is exempt from public disclosure in response to a  Freedom of Information Act request, except when such disclosure is  determined to be in the national interest.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> National interest determination. The United States National  Authority (USNA), in coordination with the CWC interagency group, shall  determine on a case-by-case basis if disclosure of confidential business  information in response to a Freedom of Information Act request is in  the national interest.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notification of intent to disclose pursuant to a national  interest determination. The Act provides for notification to the  affected person of intent to disclose confidential business information  based on the national interest, unless such notification of intent to  disclose is contrary to national security or law enforcement needs. If,  after coordination with the agencies that constitute the CWC interagency  group, the USNA does not determine that such notification of intent to  disclose is contrary to national security or law enforcement needs, the  USNA will notify the person that submitted the information and the  person to whom the information pertains of the intent to disclose the  information.
