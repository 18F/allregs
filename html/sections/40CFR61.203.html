EPA shall be notified at least  30 days prior to each such emissions test so that EPA may, at its  option, observe the test. If meteorological conditions are such that a  test cannot be properly conducted, then the owner or operator shall  notify EPA and test as soon as conditions permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within ninety days after the testing is required, the owner  or operator shall provide EPA with a report detailing the actions taken  and the results of the radon-222 flux testing. Each report shall also  include the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name and location of the facility;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A list of the stacks at the facility including the size and  dimensions of each stack;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The name of the person responsible for the operation of the  facility and the name of the person preparing the report (if different);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A description of the control measures taken to decrease the  radon flux from the source and any actions taken to insure the long term  effectiveness of the control measures; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The results of the testing conducted, including the results of  each measurement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each report shall be signed and dated by a corporate officer in  charge of the facility and contain the following declaration immediately  above the signature line: ``I certify under penalty of law that I have  personally examined and am familiar with the information submitted  herein and based on may inquiry of those individuals immediately  responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that the submitted  information is true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are  significant penalties for submitting   false information including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.  See, 18 U.S.C. 1001.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the owner or operator of an inactive stack chooses to conduct  measurements over a one year period as permitted by Method 115 in  appendix B to part 61, within ninety days after the testing commences  the owner or operator shall provide EPA with an initial report,  including the results of the first measurement period and a schedule for  all subsequent measurements. An additional report containing all the  information in Sec. 61.203(b) shall be submitted within ninety days  after completion of the final measurements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If at any point an owner or operator of a stack once again uses  an inactive stack for the disposal of phosphogypsum or for water  management, the stack ceases to be in inactive status and the owner or  operator must notify EPA in writing within 45 days. When the owner or  operator ceases to use the stack for disposal of phosphogypsum or water  management, the stack will once again become inactive and the owner or  operator must satisfy again all testing and reporting requirements for  inactive stacks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If an owner or operator removes phosphogypsum from an inactive  stack, the owner shall test the stack in accordance with the procedures  described in 40 CFR part 61, appendix B, Method 115. The stack shall be  tested within ninety days of the date that the owner or operator first  removes phosphogypsum from the stack, and the test shall be repeated at  least once during each calendar year that the owner or operator removes  additional phosphogypsum from the stack. EPA shall be notified at least  30 days prior to an emissions test so that EPA may, at its option,  observe the test. If meteorological conditions are such that a test  cannot be properly conducted, then the owner shall notify EPA and test  as soon as conditions permit. Within ninety days after completion of a  test, the owner or operator shall provide EPA with a report detailing  the actions taken and the results of the radon-222 flux testing. Each  such report shall include all of the information specified by  Sec. 61.203(b).</p>
