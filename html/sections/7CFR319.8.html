                            <p class="depth0">Pursuant to sections 411-414 and 434 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7711-7714 and 7754), the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that the unrestricted importation into the United States from all foreign countries and localities of any parts or products of plants of the genus Gossypium, including seed cotton; cottonseed; cotton lint, linters, and other forms of cotton fiber (not including yarn, thread, and cloth); cottonseed hulls, cake, meal, and other cottonseed products, except oil; cotton waste, including gin waste and thread waste; any other unmanufactured parts of cotton plants; second-hand burlap and other fabrics, shredded or otherwise, that have been used or are of the kinds ordinarily used, for containing cotton, grains (including grain products), field seeds, agricultural roots, rhizomes, tubers, or other underground crops, may result in the entry into the United States of the pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella (Saund.)), the golden nematode of potatoes (Heterodera rostochiensis Wr.), the flag smut disease (Urocystis tritici Koern.), and other injurious plant diseases and insect pests. Accordingly, to prevent the introduction into the United States of plant pests, the importation of those articles into the United States is prohibited unless they are imported in accordance with the regulations in this subpart or their importation has been authorized for experimental, therapeutic, or developmental purposes by a controlled import permit issued in accordance with Sec. 319.6.

Sections 319.8-2 and 319.8-3 shall not be applicable to such importations. In addition, such importations need not comply with the requirements of Sec. 319.8-4 relating to notice of arrival inasmuch as there is available to the inspector the essential information normally supplied by the importer at the time of importation. Sections 319.8-5 through 319.8-27 shall not be applicable to importations into Guam. Inspection of such importations may be made under the general authority of Sec. 330.105(a) of this chapter.
