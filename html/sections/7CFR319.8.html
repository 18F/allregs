Accordingly, to prevent the introduction into the United States of plant pests, the importation of those articles into the United States is prohibited unless they are imported in accordance with the regulations in this subpart or their importation has been

authorized for experimental, therapeutic, or developmental purposes by a controlled import permit issued in accordance with Sec.  319.6.
