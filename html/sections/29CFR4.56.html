                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Review by the Administrator. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any interested party affected  by a wage determination issued under section 2(a) of the Act may request  review and reconsideration by the Administrator. A request for review  and reconsideration may be made by the contracting agency or other  interested party, including contractors or prospective contractors and  associations of contractors, representatives of employees, and other  interested Governmental agencies. Any such request must be accompanied  by supporting evidence. In no event shall the Administrator review a  wage determination or its applicability after the opening of bids in the  case of a competitively advertised procurement, or, later than 10 days  before commencement of a contract in the case of a negotiated  procurement, exercise of a contract option or extension. This limitation  is necessary in order to ensure competitive equality and an orderly  procurement process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator shall, upon receipt of a request for  reconsideration, review the data sources relied upon as a basis for the  wage determination, the evidence furnished by the party requesting  review or reconsideration, and, if necessary to resolve the matter, any  additional information found to be relevant to determining prevailing  wage rates and fringe benefits in a particular locality. The  Administrator, pursuant to a review of available information, may issue  a new wage determination, may cause the wage determination to be  revised, or may affirm the wage determination issued, and will notify  the requesting party in writing of the action taken. The Administrator  will render a decision within 30 days of receipt of the request or will  notify the requesting party in writing within 30 days of receipt that  additional time is necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Review by the Administrative Review Board. Any decision of the  Administrator under paragraph (a) of this section may be appealed to the  Administrative Review Board within 20 days of issuance of the  Administrator's decision. Any such appeal shall be in accordance with  the provisions of part 8 of this title.  [48 FR 49762, Oct. 27, 1983. Redesignated at 61 FR 68664, Dec. 30, 1996]</p>
