However, this provision shall not be deemed to require the mortgagor to give priority in the allocation of any such available assistance to an existing tenant instead of an eligible applicant on the mortgagor's waiting list or otherwise to supersede tenant selection procedures which are not otherwise inconsistent with applicable program regulation or instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Subject to the provisions of any contract made in connection with the purchase of a multifamily housing project owned by the Secretary, this section shall not be deemed to require a mortgagor subject to the requirement of this subpart to enter into a Housing Assistance Payments Contract pursuant to 24 CFR part 982 for the benefit of an existing tenant who obtains a Certificate of Family Participation.
