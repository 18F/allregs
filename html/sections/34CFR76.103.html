If a State submits an annual plan under that program, this section does not apply to that plan.</p><p class="depth2">Note: This section is based on a provision in the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA). Section 427 of the Department of Education Organization Act (DEOA), 20 U.S.C. 3487, provides that except to the extent inconsistent with the DEOA, the GEPA ``shall apply to functions transferred by this Act to the extent applicable on the day preceding the effective date of this Act.'' Although standardized nomenclature is used in this section to reflect the creation of the Department of Education, there is no intent to extend the coverage of the GEPA beyond that authorized under section 427 or other applicable law.
