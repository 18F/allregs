                                Sec. 779.348  Goods must be made at the establishment which sells them.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Further to make certain that the exemption applies to retail establishments only and not to factories, an additional requirement of the exemption is that the goods which the exempt establishment makes or processes must be made or processed at the establishment which sells the goods. The exemption does not apply to an establishment which makes or processes goods for sale to customers who will go to other places to buy them. Thus an establishment that makes or processes any goods which the employer will sell from another establishment, is not exempt. If the establishment making the goods does not sell such goods but makes them for the purpose of selling them at other establishments the establishment making the goods is a factory and not a retail establishment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where the making or processing of the goods takes place away from the selling establishment, the section 13(a)(4) requirement that both the making or processing and selling take place at the same establishment cannot be met. This will be true even though the place at which the goods are made or processed services the retail selling establishment exclusively. In such a situation, while the selling establishment may qualify for exemption under section 13(a)(2), the separate establishment at which the goods are made or processed will not be exempt. The latter is a manufacturing establishment. For example, a candy kitchen manufacturing candy for sale at separate retail outlets is a manufacturing establishment and not a retail establishment. (Fred Wolferman, Inc. v. Gustafson, 169 F. 2d 759 (CA-8.))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The fact that goods made or processed on the premises of a bona fide retail establishment are sold by the establishment through outside salesmen (as, for example, department store salesmen taking orders from housewives for draperies) will not defeat the exemption if otherwise applicable. On the other hand, in the case of a factory or similar establishment devoted to making or processing goods, the fact

that its goods are sold at retail by outside salesmen provides no ground for recognizing the establishment as a retail establishment or qualifying it for exemption.</p>
