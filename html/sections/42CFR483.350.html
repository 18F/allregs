Sections 1905(a)(16) and (h) of the Act provide that inpatient psychiatric services for individuals under age 21 include only inpatient services that are provided in an institution (or distinct part thereof) that is a psychiatric hospital as defined in section 1861(f) of the Act or in another inpatient setting that the Secretary has specified in regulations.
