                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The definitions in this section and the definitions  under section 150 apply for purposes of section 148 and Sec. Sec.  1.148-1 through 1.148-11.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Certain definitions. The following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0">Accounting method means both the overall method used to account for  gross proceeds of an issue (e.g., the cash method or a modified accrual  method) and the method used to account for or allocate any particular  item within that overall accounting method (e.g., accounting for  investments, expenditures, allocations to and from different sources,  and particular items of the foregoing).</p><p class="depth0">Annuity contract means annuity contract as defined in section 72.</p><p class="depth0">Available amount means available amount as defined in Sec. 1.148- 6(d)(3)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">Bona fide debt service fund means a fund, which may include proceeds  of an issue, that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is used primarily to achieve a proper matching of revenues with  principal and interest payments within each bond year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is depleted at least once each bond year, except for a  reasonable carryover amount not to exceed the greater of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> the earnings on the fund for the immediately preceding bond  year; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> one-twelfth of the principal and interest payments on the issue  for the immediately preceding bond year.</p><p class="depth0">Bond year means, in reference to an issue, each 1-year period that  ends on the day selected by the issuer. The first and last bond years  may be short periods. If no day is selected by the issuer before the  earlier of the final maturity date of the issue or the date that is 5  years after the issue date, bond years end on each anniversary of the  issue date and on the final maturity date.</p><p class="depth0">Capital project or capital projects means all capital expenditures,  plus related working capital expenditures to which the de minimis rule  under Sec. 1.148-6(d)(3)(ii)(A) applies, that carry out the  governmental purposes of an issue. For example, a capital project may  include capital expenditures for one or more buildings, plus related  start-up operating costs.</p><p class="depth0">Commingled fund means any fund or account containing both gross  proceeds of an issue and amounts in excess of $25,000 that are not gross  proceeds of that issue if the amounts in the fund or account are  invested and accounted for collectively, without regard to the source of  funds deposited in the fund or account. An open-end regulated investment  company under section 851, however, is not a commingled fund.</p><p class="depth0">Computation date means each date on which the rebate amount for an  issue is computed under Sec. 1.148-3(e).</p><p class="depth0">Computation period means the period between computation dates. The  first computation period begins on the issue date and ends on the first  computation date. Each succeeding computation period begins on the date  immediately following the computation date and ends on the next  computation date.</p><p class="depth0">Consistently applied means applied uniformly within a fiscal period  and between fiscal periods to account for gross proceeds of an issue and  any amounts that are in a commingled fund.</p><p class="depth0">De minimis amount means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1))</em> or premium on an obligation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An amount that does not exceed 2 percent multiplied by the  stated redemption price at maturity; plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any original issue premium that is attributable exclusively to  reasonable underwriters' compensation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(A))</em> or premium on an obligation, an amount that does not  exceed 2 percent multiplied by the stated redemption price at maturity.</p><p class="depth0">Economic accrual method (also known as the constant interest method  or actuarial method) means the method of computing yield that is based  on the compounding of interest at the end of each compounding period.</p><p class="depth0">Fair market value means fair market value as defined in Sec. 1.148- 5(d)(6).</p><p class="depth0">Fixed rate investment means any investment whose yield is fixed and  determinable on the issue date.</p><p class="depth0">Fixed yield bond means any bond whose yield is fixed and  determinable on the issue date using the assumptions and rules provided  in Sec. 1.148-4(b).</p><p class="depth0">Fixed yield issue means any issue if each bond that is part of the  issue is a fixed yield bond.</p><p class="depth0">Gross proceeds means any proceeds and replacement proceeds of an  issue.</p><p class="depth0">Guaranteed investment contract includes any nonpurpose investment  that has specifically negotiated withdrawal or reinvestment provisions  and a specifically negotiated interest rate, and also includes any  agreement to supply investments on two or more future dates (e.g., a  forward supply contract).</p><p class="depth0">Higher yielding investments means higher yielding investments as  defined in section 148(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Investment means any investment property as defined in sections  148(b)(2) and 148(b)(3), and any other tax-exempt bond.</p><p class="depth0">Investment proceeds means any amounts actually or constructively  received from investing proceeds of an issue.</p><p class="depth0">Investment-type property is defined in paragraph (e) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0">Issue price means, except as otherwise provided, issue price as  defined in sections 1273 and 1274. Generally, the issue price of bonds  that are publicly offered is the first price at which a substantial  amount of the bonds is sold to the public. Ten percent is a substantial  amount. The public does not include bond houses, brokers, or similar  persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters or  wholesalers. The issue price does not change if part of the issue is  later sold at a different price. The issue price of bonds that are not  substantially identical is determined separately. The issue price of  bonds for which a bona fide public offering is made is determined as of  the sale date based on reasonable expectations regarding the initial  public offering price. If a bond is issued for property, the applicable  Federal tax-exempt rate is used in lieu of the Federal rate in  determining the issue price under section 1274. The issue price of bonds  may not exceed their fair market value as of the sale date.</p><p class="depth0">Issuer generally means the entity that actually issues the issue,  and, unless the context or a provision clearly requires otherwise, each  conduit borrower of the issue. For example, rules imposed on issuers to  account for gross proceeds of an issue apply to a conduit borrower to  account for any gross proceeds received under a purpose investment.  Provisions regarding elections, filings, liability for the rebate  amount, and certifications of reasonable expectations apply only to the  actual issuer.</p><p class="depth0">Multipurpose issue means an issue the proceeds of which are used for  two or more separate purposes determined in accordance with Sec. 1.148- 9(h).</p><p class="depth0">Net sale proceeds means sale proceeds, less the portion of those  sale proceeds invested in a reasonably required reserve or replacement  fund under section 148(d) and as part of a minor portion under section  148(e).</p><p class="depth0">Nonpurpose investment means any investment property, as defined in  section 148(b), that is not a purpose investment.</p><p class="depth0">Payment means a payment as defined in Sec. 1.148-3(d) for purposes  of computing the rebate amount, and a payment as defined in Sec. 1.148- 5(b) for purposes of computing the yield on an investment.</p><p class="depth0">Plain par bond means a qualified tender bond or a bond--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Issued with not more than a de minimis amount of original issue  discount or premium;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Issued for a price that does not include accrued interest other  than pre-issuance accrued interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> That bears interest from the issue date at a single, stated,  fixed rate or that is a variable rate debt instrument under section  1275, in each case with interest unconditionally payable at least  annually; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> That has a lowest stated redemption price that is not less than  its outstanding stated principal amount.</p><p class="depth0">Plain par investment means an investment that is an obligation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Issued with not more than a de minimis amount of original issue  discount or premium, or, if acquired on a   date other than the issue date, acquired with not more than a de minimis  amount of market discount or premium;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Issued for a price that does not include accrued interest other  than pre-issuance accrued interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> That bears interest from the issue date at a single, stated,  fixed rate or that is a variable rate debt instrument under section  1275, in each case with interest unconditionally payable at least  annually; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> That has a lowest stated redemption price that is not less than  its outstanding stated principal amount.</p><p class="depth0">Pre-issuance accrued interest means amounts representing interest  that accrued on an obligation for a period not greater than one year  before its issue date but only if those amounts are paid within one year  after the issue date.</p><p class="depth0">Proceeds means any sale proceeds, investment proceeds, and  transferred proceeds of an issue. Proceeds do not include, however,  amounts actually or constructively received with respect to a purpose  investment that are properly allocable to the immaterially higher yield  under Sec. 1.148-2(d) or section 143(g) or to qualified administrative  costs recoverable under Sec. 1.148-5(e).</p><p class="depth0">Program investment means a purpose investment that is part of a  governmental program in which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The program involves the origination or acquisition of purpose  investments;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> At least 95 percent (90 percent for qualified student loans  under section 144(b)(1)(A)) of the cost of the purpose investments  acquired under the program represents one or more loans to a substantial  number of persons representing the general public, States or political  subdivisions, 501(c)(3) organizations, persons who provide housing and  related facilities, or any combination of the foregoing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> At least 95 percent of the receipts from the purpose investments  are used to pay principal, interest, or redemption prices on issues that  financed the program, to pay or reimburse administrative costs of those  issues or of the program, to pay or reimburse anticipated future losses  directly related to the program, to finance additional purpose  investments for the same general purposes of the program, or to redeem  and retire governmental obligations at the next earliest possible date  of redemption;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The program documents prohibit any obligor on a purpose  investment financed by the program or any related party to that obligor  from purchasing bonds of an issue that finance the program in an amount  related to the amount of the purpose investment acquired from that  obligor; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The issuer has not waived the right to treat the investment as a  program investment.</p><p class="depth0">Purpose investment means an investment that is acquired to carry out  the governmental purpose of an issue.</p><p class="depth0">Qualified administrative costs means qualified administrative costs  as defined in Sec. 1.148-5(e).</p><p class="depth0">Qualified guarantee means a qualified guarantee as defined in Sec.  1.148-4(f).</p><p class="depth0">Qualified hedge means a qualified hedge as defined in Sec. 1.148- 4(h)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Reasonable expectations or reasonableness. An issuer's expectations  or actions are reasonable only if a prudent person in the same  circumstances as the issuer would have those same expectations or take  those same actions, based on all the objective facts and circumstances.  Factors relevant to a determination of reasonableness include the  issuer's history of conduct concerning stated expectations made in  connection with the issuance of obligations, the level of inquiry by the  issuer into factual matters, and the existence of covenants, enforceable  by bondholders, that require implementation of specific expectations.  For a conduit financing issue, factors relevant to a determination of  reasonableness include the reasonable expectations of the conduit  borrower, but only if, under the circumstances, it is reasonable and  prudent for the issuer to rely on those expectations.</p><p class="depth0">Rebate amount means 100 percent of the amount owed to the United  States under section 148(f)(2), as further described in Sec. 1.148-3.</p><p class="depth0">Receipt means a receipt as defined in Sec. 1.148-3(d) for purposes  of computing the rebate amount, and a receipt as defined in Sec. 1.148- 5(b) for purposes of computing yield on an investment.</p><p class="depth0">Refunding escrow means one or more funds established as part of a  single transaction or a series of related transactions, containing  proceeds of a refunding issue and any other amounts to provide for  payment of principal or interest on one or more prior issues. For this  purpose, funds are generally not so established solely because of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The deposit of proceeds of an issue and replacement proceeds of  the prior issue in an escrow more than 6 months apart, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The deposit of proceeds of completely separate issues in an  escrow.</p><p class="depth0">Replacement proceeds is defined in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Restricted working capital expenditures means working capital  expenditures that are subject to the proceeds-spent-last rule in Sec.  1.148-6(d)(3)(i) and are ineligible for any exception to that rule.</p><p class="depth0">Sale proceeds means any amounts actually or constructively received  from the sale of the issue, including amounts used to pay underwriters'  discount or compensation and accrued interest other than pre-issuance  accrued interest. Sale proceeds also include, but are not limited to,  amounts derived from the sale of a right that is associated with a bond,  and that is described in Sec. 1.148-4(b)(4). See also Sec. 1.148- 4(h)(5) treating amounts received upon the termination of certain hedges  as sale proceeds.</p><p class="depth0">Stated redemption price means the redemption price of an obligation  under the terms of that obligation, including any call premium.</p><p class="depth0">Transferred proceeds means transferred proceeds as defined in Sec.  1.148-9 (or the applicable corresponding provision of prior law).</p><p class="depth0">Unconditionally payable means payable under terms in which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Late payment or nonpayment results in a significant penalty to  the borrower or reasonable remedies to the lender, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It is reasonably certain on the issue date that the payment will  actually be made.</p><p class="depth0">Value means value determined under Sec. 1.148-4(e) for a bond, and  value determined under Sec. 1.148-5(d) for an investment.</p><p class="depth0">Variable yield bond means any bond that is not a fixed yield bond.</p><p class="depth0">Variable yield issue means any issue that is not a fixed yield  issue.</p><p class="depth0">Yield means yield computed under Sec. 1.148-4 for an issue, and  yield computed under Sec. 1.148-5 for an investment.</p><p class="depth0">Yield restricted means required to be invested at a yield that is  not materially higher than the yield on the issue under section 148(a)  and Sec. 1.148-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definition of replacement proceeds--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Amounts are  replacement proceeds of an issue if the amounts have a sufficiently  direct nexus to the issue or to the governmental purpose of the issue to  conclude that the amounts would have been used for that governmental  purpose if the proceeds of the issue were not used or to be used for  that governmental purpose. For this purpose, governmental purposes  include the expected use of amounts for the payment of debt service on a  particular date. The mere availability or preliminary earmarking of  amounts for a governmental purpose, however, does not in itself  establish a sufficient nexus to cause those amounts to be replacement  proceeds. Replacement proceeds include, but are not limited to, sinking  funds, pledged funds, and other replacement proceeds described in  paragraph (c)(4) of this section, to the extent that those funds or  amounts are held by or derived from a substantial beneficiary of the  issue. A substantial beneficiary of an issue includes the issuer and any  related party to the issuer, and, if the issuer is not a state, the  state in which the issuer is located. A person is not a substantial  beneficiary of an issue solely because it is a guarantor under a  qualified guarantee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sinking fund. Sinking fund includes a debt service fund,  redemption fund, reserve fund, replacement fund, or any similar fund, to  the extent reasonably expected to be used directly or indirectly to pay  principal or interest on the issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Pledged fund--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A pledged fund is any amount that  is directly or indirectly pledged to pay principal or interest on the  issue. A pledge need not be cast in any particular form but, in  substance, must provide reasonable assurance that the amount will be  available to pay principal or interest on the issue, even if   the issuer encounters financial difficulties. A pledge to a guarantor of  an issue is an indirect pledge to secure payment of principal or  interest on the issue. A pledge of more than 50 percent of the  outstanding stock of a corporation that is a conduit borrower of the  issue is not treated as a pledge for this purpose, unless the  corporation is formed or availed of to avoid the creation of replacement  proceeds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, however, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The issuer or a substantial beneficiary may grant rights in the  amount that are superior to the rights of the bondholders or the  guarantor; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount does not exceed reasonable needs for which it is  maintained, the required level is tested no more frequently than every 6  months, and the amount may be spent without any substantial restriction  other than a requirement to replenish the amount by the next testing  date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Other replacement proceeds--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Bonds outstanding longer than  necessary--(A) In general. Replacement proceeds arise to the extent that  the issuer reasonably expects as of the issue date that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term of an issue will be longer than is reasonably necessary  for the governmental purposes of the issue, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> There will be available amounts during the period that the issue  remains outstanding longer than necessary. Whether an issue is  outstanding longer than necessary is determined under Sec. 1.148-10.  Replacement proceeds are created under this paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) at  the beginning of each fiscal year during which an issue remains  outstanding longer than necessary in an amount equal to available  amounts of the issuer as of that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Safe harbor against creation of replacement proceeds. As a safe  harbor, replacement proceeds do not arise under paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A)  of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For the portion of an issue that is to be used to finance  restricted working capital expenditures, if that portion is not  outstanding longer than 2 years;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For the portion of an issue (including a refunding issue) that  is to be used to finance or refinance capital projects, if that portion  has a weighted average maturity that does not exceed 120 percent of the  average reasonably expected economic life of the financed capital  projects, determined in the same manner as under section 147(b); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For the portion of an issue that is a refunding issue, if that  portion has a weighted average maturity that does not exceed the  remaining weighted average maturity of the prior issue, and the issue of  which the prior issue is a part satisfies paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) (1) or  (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Bonds financing a working capital reserve--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general.  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section,  replacement proceeds arise to the extent a working capital reserve is,  directly or indirectly, financed with the proceeds of the issue  (regardless of the expenditure of proceeds of the issue). Thus, for  example, if an issuer that does not maintain a working capital reserve  borrows to fund a working capital reserve, the issuer will have  replacement proceeds. To determine the amount of a working capital  reserve maintained, an issuer may use the average amount maintained as a  working capital reserve during annual periods of at least 1 year, the  last of which ends within 1 year before the issue date. For example, the  amount of a working capital reserve may be computed using the average of  the beginning or ending monthly balances of the amount maintained as a  reserve (net of unexpended gross proceeds) during the 1 year period  preceding the issue date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exception to creation of replacement proceeds. Replacement  proceeds do not arise under paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section with  respect to an issue--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All of the net proceeds of which are spent within 6 months of  the issue date under section 148(f)(4)(B)(iii)(I); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> That is not subject to the rebate requirement under the  exception provided by section 148(f)(4)(D).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Elections. Except as otherwise provided, any required elections  must be made in writing, and, once made, may not be revoked without the  permission of the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Investment-type property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Investment-type  property includes any property, other than property described in section  148(b)(2)(A), (B), (C) or (E), that is held principally as a passive  vehicle for the production of income. For this purpose, production of  income includes any benefit based on the time value of money.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prepayments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general--(A) Generally. Except as otherwise  provided in this paragraph (e)(2), a prepayment for property or  services, including a prepayment for property or services that is made  after the date that the contract to buy the property or services is  entered into, also gives rise to investment-type property if a principal  purpose for prepaying is to receive an investment return from the time  the prepayment is made until the time payment otherwise would be made. A  prepayment does not give rise to investment-type property if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prepayments on substantially the same terms are made by a  substantial percentage of persons who are similarly situated to the  issuer but who are not beneficiaries of tax-exempt financing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The prepayment is made within 90 days of the reasonably expected  date of delivery to the issuer of all of the property or services for  which the prepayment is made; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The prepayment meets the requirements of paragraph  (e)(2)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Example. The following example illustrates an application of  this paragraph (e)(2)(i):</p><p class="depth0">Example. Prepayment after contract is executed. In 1998, City A  enters into a ten-year contract with Company Y. Under the contract,  Company Y is to provide services to City A over the term of the contract  and in return City A will pay Company Y for its services as they are  provided. In 2004, City A issues bonds to finance a lump sum payment to  Company Y in satisfaction of City A's obligation to pay for Company Y's  services to be provided over the remaining term of the contract. The use  of bond proceeds to make the lump sum payment constitutes a prepayment  for services under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, even though the  payment is made after the date that the contract is executed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Customary prepayments. The determination of whether a  prepayment satisfies paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A)(1) of this section is  generally made based on all the facts and circumstances. In addition, a  prepayment is deemed to satisfy paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A)(1) of this  section if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The prepayment is made for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Maintenance, repair, or an extended warranty with respect to  personal property (for example, automobiles or electronic equipment); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Updates or maintenance or support services with respect to  computer software; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The same maintenance, repair, extended warranty, updates or  maintenance or support services, as applicable, are regularly provided  to nongovernmental persons on the same terms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(A)</em> if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It is made by or for one or more utilities that are owned by a  governmental person, as defined in Sec. 1.141-1(b) (each of which is  referred to in this paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A) as the issuing municipal  utility), to purchase a supply of natural gas; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> At least 90 percent of the prepaid natural gas financed by the  issue is used for a qualifying use. Natural gas is used for a qualifying  use if it is to be--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Used by the issuing municipal utility to produce electricity  that will be furnished to retail electric customers of the issuing  municipal utility who are located in the electricity service area of the  issuing municipal utility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Used by the issuing municipal utility to produce electricity  that will   be sold to a utility that is owned by a governmental person and  furnished to retail electric customers of the purchaser who are located  in the electricity service area of the purchaser;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Sold to a utility that is owned by a governmental person if the  requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)(2)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this  section are satisfied by the purchaser (treating the purchaser as the  issuing municipal utility); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Used to fuel the pipeline transportation of the prepaid gas  supply acquired in accordance with this paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It is made by or for one or more utilities that are owned by a  governmental person (each of which is referred to in this paragraph  (e)(2)(iii)(B) as the issuing municipal utility) to purchase a supply of  electricity; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> At least 90 percent of the prepaid electricity financed by the  issue is used for a qualifying use. Electricity is used for a qualifying  use if it is to be--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Furnished to retail electric customers of the issuing municipal  utility who are located in the electricity service area of the issuing  municipal utility; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sold to a utility that is owned by a governmental person and  furnished to retail electric customers of the purchaser who are located  in the electricity service area of the purchaser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Service area. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(iii), the  service area of a utility owned by a governmental person consists of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any area throughout which the utility provided, at all times  during the 5-year period ending on the issue date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a natural gas utility, natural gas transmission  or distribution service; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of an electric utility, electricity distribution  service; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any area recognized as the service area of the utility under  state or Federal law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Retail customer. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(iii), a  retail customer is a customer that purchases natural gas or electricity,  as applicable, other than for resale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Commodity swaps. A prepayment does not fail to meet the  requirements of this paragraph (e)(2)(iii) by reason of any commodity  swap contract that may be entered into between the issuer and an  unrelated party (other than the gas or electricity supplier), or between  the gas or electricity supplier and an unrelated party (other than the  issuer), so long as each swap contract is an independent contract. A  swap contract is an independent contract if the obligation of each party  to perform under the swap contract is not dependent on performance by  any person (other than the other party to the swap contract) under  another contract (for example, a gas or electricity supply contract or  another swap contract); provided, however, that a commodity swap  contract will not fail to be an independent contract solely because the  swap contract may terminate in the event of a failure of a gas or  electricity supplier to deliver gas or electricity for which the swap  contract is a hedge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Remedial action. Issuers may apply principles similar to the  rules of Sec. 1.141-12, including Sec. 1.141-12(d) (relating to  redemption or defeasance of nonqualified bonds) and Sec. 1.141-12(e)  (relating to alternative use of disposition proceeds), to cure a  violation of paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)(2) or (e)(2)(iii)(B)(2) of this  section. For this purpose, the amount of nonqualified bonds is  determined in the same manner as for output contracts taken into account  under the private business tests, including the principles of Sec.  1.141-7(d), treating nonqualified sales of gas or electricity under this  paragraph (e)(2)(iii) as satisfying the benefits and burdens test under  Sec. 1.141-7(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Additional prepayments as permitted by the Commissioner. The  Commissioner may, by published guidance, set forth additional  circumstances in which a prepayment does not give rise to investment- type property.
