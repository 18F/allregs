                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The thorax is part of the upper torso assembly shown in drawing 180-3000. For the thorax with arm impact test, the dummy is tested as a complete assembly (drawing 180-0000). The dummy's thorax is equipped with T1 and T12 laterally oriented accelerometers as specified in 49 CFR 572.200(d), and deflection potentiometers for the thorax and shoulder as specified in 180-3881, installed as shown in drawing 180-0000 sheet 2 of 5. When subjected to the test procedure as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the thorax shall meet performance requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Test procedure. (1) Soak the dummy assembly (180-0000) in a test environment as specified in 49 CFR 572.200(j).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Seat the dummy, outfitted with the torso jacket (180-3450) and cotton underwear pants on a certification bench, specified in Figure V3, the seat pan and the seatback surfaces of which are covered with a 2-mm-thick PTFE (Teflon) sheet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Align the outermost portion of the pelvis flesh of the impacted side of the seated dummy tangent to a vertical plane located within 10 mm of the side edge of the bench as shown in Figure V5-A, while the midsagittal plane of the dummy is in vertical orientation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Push the dummy at the knees and at mid-sternum of the upper torso with just sufficient horizontally oriented force towards the seat back until the back of the upper torso is in contact with the seat back.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> While maintaining the dummy's position as specified in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section, the top of the shoulder rib mount (drawing 180-3352) orientation in the fore-and-aft direction is 24.6 2.0 degrees relative to horizontal as shown in Figure V5-B in appendix A to this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Adjust orientation of the legs such that they are symmetrical about the mid-sagittal plane, the thighs touch the seat pan, the inner part of the right and left legs at the knees are as close as possible to each other, the heels touch the designated foot support surface and the feet are vertical and as close together as possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Orient the arm downward to the lowest detent such that the longitudinal centerline of the arm is parallel to the inferior-superior orientation of the spine box.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The impactor is specified in 49 CFR 572.200(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The impactor is guided, if needed, so that at contact with the dummy's arm, its longitudinal axis is within 1 degree of a horizontal plane and perpendicular to the midsagittal plane of the dummy. The centerpoint of the impactor face is within 2 mm of the vertical midpoint of the second thoracic rib and coincident with a line parallel to the seat back incline passing through the center of the shoulder yoke assembly arm rotation pivot (drawing 180-3327), as shown in Figure V5-A in appendix A to this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> The dummy's arm is impacted at 6.7 0.1 m/s.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Time zero is defined as the time of contact between the impact probe and the arm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Allow a period of at least thirty (30) minutes between successive tests of the same thorax assembly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Performance criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> While the impactor is in contact with the dummy's arm, the thoracic ribs and the shoulder shall conform to the following range of deflections:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Shoulder not less than 31 mm and not more than 40 mm;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Upper thorax rib not less than 25 mm and not more than 32 mm;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Middle thorax rib not less than 30 mm and not more than 36 mm;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Lower thorax rib not less than 32 mm and not more than 38 mm;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Peak lateral acceleration of the upper spine (T1) shall not be less than 34 g and not more than 43 g, and the lower spine (T12) not less than 29 g and not more than 37 g;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Peak impactor acceleration after 5 ms after time zero shall be not less than 30 g and not more than 36 g.
