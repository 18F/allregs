Such constituents  must be identified and quantified if present, at levels detectable by  using appropriate analytical procedures. The appendix VIII, part 261  constituents excluded from this analysis must be identified and the  basis for their exclusion explained. This analysis will be used to  provide all information required by this subpart and Sec. Sec.  270.22  and 270.66 of this chapter and to enable the permit writer to prescribe  such permit conditions as necessary to protect human health and the  environment. Such analysis must be included as a portion of the part B  permit application, or, for facilities operating under the interim  status standards of this subpart, as a portion of the trial burn plan  that may be submitted before the part B application under provisions of  Sec.  270.66(g) of this chapter as well as any other analysis required  by the permit authority in preparing the permit. Owners and operators of  boilers and industrial furnaces not operating under the interim status  standards must provide the information required by Sec.

Sec.  266.104 through 266.107, based on the Director's  engineering judgment. If the applicant is seeking a waiver from a trial  burn to demonstrate conformance with a particular emission standard, the  operating requirements during this initial period of operation shall  include those specified by the applicable provisions of Sec.  266.104,  Sec.  266.105, Sec.  266.106, or Sec.  266.107.

As specified in paragraphs (e)(2)  through (e)(5) of this section, each operating parameter shall be  measured, and permit limits on the parameter shall be established,  according to either of the following procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Instantaneous limits. A parameter may be measured and recorded  on an instantaneous basis (i.e., the value that occurs at any time) and  the permit limit specified as the time-weighted average during all valid  runs of the trial burn; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Hourly rolling average. (1) The limit for a parameter may be  established and continuously monitored on an hourly rolling average  basis defined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A continuous monitor is one which continuously samples the  regulated parameter without interruption, and evaluates the detector  response at least once each 15 seconds, and computes and records the  average value at least every 60 seconds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An hourly rolling average is the arithmetic mean of the 60 most  recent 1-minute average values recorded by the continuous monitoring  system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The permit limit for the parameter shall be established based on  trial burn data as the average over all valid test runs of the highest  hourly rolling average value for each run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rolling average limits for carcinogenic metals and lead. Feed  rate limits for the carcinogenic metals (i.e., arsenic, beryllium,  cadmium and chromium) and lead may be established either on an hourly  rolling average basis as prescribed by paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this  section or on (up to) a 24 hour rolling average basis. If the owner or  operator elects to use an average period from 2 to 24 hours:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The feed rate of each metal shall be limited at any time to ten  times the feed rate that would be allowed on an hourly rolling average  basis;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The continuous monitor shall meet the following specifications:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A continuous monitor is one which continuously samples the  regulated parameter without interruption, and evaluates the detector  response at least once each 15 seconds, and computes and records the  average value at least every 60 seconds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The rolling average for the selected averaging period is defined  as the arithmetic mean of one hour block averages for the averaging  period. A one hour block average is the arithmetic mean of the one  minute averages recorded during the 60-minute period beginning at one  minute after the beginning of the preceding clock hour; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The permit limit for the feed rate of each metal shall be  established   based on trial burn data as the average over all valid test runs of the  highest hourly rolling average feed rate for each run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Feed rate limits for metals, total chloride and chlorine, and  ash. Feed rate limits for metals, total chlorine and chloride, and ash  are established and monitored by knowing the concentration of the  substance (i.e., metals, chloride/chlorine, and ash) in each feedstream  and the flow rate of the feedstream. To monitor the feed rate of these  substances, the flow rate of each feedstream must be monitored under the  continuous monitoring requirements of paragraphs (e)(6) (i) and (ii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Conduct of trial burn testing. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If compliance with all  applicable emissions standards of Sec. Sec.  266.104 through 266.107 is  not demonstrated simultaneously during a set of test runs, the operating  conditions of additional test runs required to demonstrate compliance  with remaining emissions standards must be as close as possible to the  original operating conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Prior to obtaining test data for purposes of demonstrating  compliance with the emissions standards of Sec. Sec.  266.104 through  266.107 or establishing limits on operating parameters under this  section, the facility must operate under trial burn conditions for a  sufficient period to reach steady-state operations. The Director may  determine, however, that industrial furnaces that recycle collected  particulate matter back into the furnace and that comply with an  alternative implementation approach for metals under Sec.  266.106(f)  need not reach steady state conditions with respect to the flow of  metals in the system prior to beginning compliance testing for metals  emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Trial burn data on the level of an operating parameter for which  a limit must be established in the permit must be obtained during  emissions sampling for the pollutant(s) (i.e., metals, PM, HCl/ Cl2, organic compounds) for which the parameter must be  established as specified by paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> General requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Fugitive emissions. Fugitive emissions  must be controlled by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Keeping the combustion zone totally sealed against fugitive  emissions; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Maintaining the combustion zone pressure lower than atmospheric  pressure; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> An alternate means of control demonstrated (with part B of the  permit application) to provide fugitive emissions control equivalent to  maintenance of combustion zone pressure lower than atmospheric pressure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Automatic waste feed cutoff. A boiler or industrial furnace  must be operated with a functioning system that automatically cuts off  the hazardous waste feed when operating conditions deviate from those  established under this section. The Director may limit the number of  cutoffs per an operating period on a case-by-case basis. In addition:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The permit limit for (the indicator of) minimum combustion  chamber temperature must be maintained while hazardous waste or  hazardous waste residues remain in the combustion chamber,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exhaust gases must be ducted to the air pollution control system  operated in accordance with the permit requirements while hazardous  waste or hazardous waste residues remain in the combustion chamber; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Operating parameters for which permit limits are established  must continue to be monitored during the cutoff, and the hazardous waste  feed shall not be restarted until the levels of those parameters comply  with the permit limits. For parameters that may be monitored on an  instantaneous basis, the Director will establish a minimum period of  time after a waste feed cutoff during which the parameter must not  exceed the permit limit before the hazardous waste feed may be  restarted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Changes. A boiler or industrial furnace must cease burning  hazardous waste when changes in combustion properties, or feed rates of  the hazardous waste, other fuels, or industrial furnace feedstocks, or  changes in the boiler or industrial furnace design or operating  conditions deviate from the limits as specified in the permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Monitoring and Inspections. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator must  monitor and   record the following, at a minimum, while burning hazardous waste:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If specified by the permit, feed rates and composition of  hazardous waste, other fuels, and industrial furnace feedstocks, and  feed rates of ash, metals, and total chloride and chlorine;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If specified by the permit, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons  (HC), and oxygen on a continuous basis at a common point in the boiler  or industrial furnace downstream of the combustion zone and prior to  release of stack gases to the atmosphere in accordance with operating  requirements specified in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.
