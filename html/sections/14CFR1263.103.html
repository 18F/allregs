In addition, the  party causing the demand to be issued shall furnish the Office of  General Counsel a written, detailed statement of the information sought  and its relevance to the proceeding in connection with which it is  requested. The General Counsel or designate may waive the requirement  that a written summary be furnished where he/she deems it unnecessary.  The election to waive the requirement of a written summary in no way  constitutes a waiver of any other requirements set forth in this  section.</p>
