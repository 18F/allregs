                                Sec. 339.3  Exchanges with privilege of deferring reporting of interest
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the Secretary of the  Treasury hereby grants to owners who have not been reporting the  interest on their securities on an accrual basis for Federal income tax  purposes the privilege of exchanging such securities for Series H bonds  and of continuing to defer reporting of the interest on the securities  exchanged (except interest referred to in paragraph (b)(5) of this  section) for Federal income tax purposes to the taxable year in which  the Series H bonds received in exchange are disposed of, are redeemed,  or have reached final maturity, whichever is earlier. \2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ The interest paid semiannually by check on all Series H bonds,  whether issued in exchange under this or any other section, or  otherwise, is subject to the Federal income tax for the taxable year in  which it is received. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(3)</em> of  this section), and any supporting evidence which may be required under  the governing regulations \3\ may be presented or forwarded to any  authorized agency. \4\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ For example, a beneficiary named on Series E bonds would have to  submit proof of the death of the registered owner in order to exchange  such bonds for Series H bonds.</p><p class="depth0">\4\ Agents authorized to pay Series E bonds and savings notes are  authorized to accept and handle exchange subscriptions submitted by  natural persons whose names are inscribed on the face of the bonds and  notes as owners or coowners in their own right. However, as agents of  subscribers they may forward any exchange subscription to a Federal  Reserve Bank or Branch or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Washington,  DC 20226, for acceptance and handling. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A Series H bond issued upon exchange will be registered in the  name of the owner of the securities submitted in any authorized form of  registration. However, the principal coowner must be named as owner or  coowner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The total current redemption value of the securities submitted  for exchange in any one transaction must amount to $500 or more. If the  total current redemption value is in an even multiple of $500, Series H  bonds must be requested in that exact amount. If the total current  redemption value exceeds $500, but is not in an even multiple of $500,  the owner has the option of furnishing cash necessary to obtain Series H  bonds of the next higher $500 multiple, or of receiving payment of the  difference between the total current redemption value and the next lower  multiple of $500. For example, under the rules prescribed in this  circular, if the securities submitted for exchange in one transaction  total $4,253.33 current redemption value, the owner may elect to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Receive $4,000 in Series H bonds and the amount of the  difference, $253.33, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pay the difference, $246.67, necessary to obtain $4,500 in  Series H bonds. \5\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\5\ If a paying agent accepts a subscription solely for the purpose  of forwarding it, or if the owner forwards it direct, to a Federal  Reserve Bank or Branch or to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, the  remittance for the difference, by check or other form of exchange (which  will be accepted subject to collection), must be drawn to the order of  the Federal Reserve Bank or the United States Treasury, as the case may  be. The remittance must accompany the subscription and the securities to  be exchanged. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any amount paid to the owner as a cash adjustment (as in  paragraph (3)(i) of this section) must be treated as income for Federal  income tax purposes for the year in which it is received up to an amount  not in excess of the total interest on the securities exchanged. \6\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\6\ The amount, if any, paid to the owner in excess of the interest  is a repayment on account of the purchase price of the securities  exchanged, not income. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Each Series H bond issued under this section will be stamped  ``EX'' or ``EXCH'' to show that it was issued upon exchange. Each bond  also will bear a legend showing how much of its issue price represents  interest on the securities exchanged. This interest must be treated as  income for Federal income tax purposes for the year in which the Series  H bond is redeemed, is disposed of, or finally matures, whichever is  earlier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The Series H bonds will be dated as of the first day of the  month in which the securities, the exchange subscription, any necessary  cash difference and supporting evidence, if any, are accepted for  exchange by an authorized agency.</p>
