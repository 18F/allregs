This section limits the types of materials that can be openly burned within the Indian reservation to control emissions of particulate matter and other noxious fumes to the atmosphere and ground-level concentrations of particulate matter. It is EPA's goal to eliminate open burning disposal practices where alternative methods are feasible and practicable, to encourage the development of alternative disposal methods, to emphasize resource recovery, and to encourage utilization of the highest and best practicable burning methods to minimize emissions where other disposal practices are not feasible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Who is affected by this section? This section applies to any person who conducts open burning and to the owner of the property upon which open burning is conducted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> What is exempted from this section?
