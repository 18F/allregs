                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this program is to provide financial  incentives to biorefineries in existence on June 18, 2008, the date of  the enactment of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (the  2008 Farm Bill) (Pub. L. 110-246), to replace the use of fossil fuels  used to produce heat or power at their facilities by installing new  systems that use renewable biomass, or to produce new energy from  renewable biomass.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope. The Agency may make payments under this program to any  biorefinery that meets the requirements of the program up to the limits  established for the program. Based on our research and survey of medium- sized project costs, the Agency has determined that the dollar amount  identified will provide adequate incentive for biorefineries to apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Agency will determine the amount of payments to be made to a  biorefinery taking into consideration the percentage reduction in fossil  fuel used by the biorefinery (including the quantity of fossil fuels a  renewable biomass system is replacing), and the cost and cost- effectiveness of the renewable biomass system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Agency will determine who receives payment under this  program based on the percentage reduction in fossil fuel used by the  biorefinery that will result from the installation of the renewable  biomass system; the cost and cost-effectiveness of the renewable biomass  system; and other scoring criteria identified in Sec. 4288.21. The  above criteria will be used to determine priority for awards of 50  percent of total eligible project costs, up to the maximum award  applicable for the fiscal year.</p>
