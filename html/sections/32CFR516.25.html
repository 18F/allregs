                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The DA Form 4 (See figure C-2, appendix G, of this  part) is used to authenticate Army records or documents. Documents  attached to a properly prepared and sealed DA Form 4 are self- authenticating. (See Fed. R. Evid. 902).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preparation at the installation level. A DA Form 4 need not be  prepared until the trial attorney presenting the government's case  identifies documents maintained at the installation level which he will  need at trial. Once documents are identified, the custodian of the  documents will execute his portion of the DA Form 4. (See figure C-2,  appendix G, of this part). The custodian certifies that the documents  attached to the DA Form 4 are true copies of official documents.  Documents attached to each form should be generally identified; each  document need not be mentioned specifically. Only the upper portion of  the form should be executed at the local level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Actions at HQDA. Upon receipt of the DA Form 4 with documents  attached thereto, HQDA will affix a ribbon and seal and deliver it to  the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army.  That office will place the official Army seal on the packet.</p>
