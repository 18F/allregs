                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agreement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the  Interior, and the Governor shall, not later than December 13, 2004, and  in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department  of Commerce, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole  Tribe of Florida, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, and the  South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, execute an Interim Goals  Agreement establishing interim goals to facilitate inter-agency  planning, monitoring, and assessment so as to achieve the overarching  objectives of the Plan and to provide a means by which the restoration  success of the Plan may be evaluated, and ultimately reported to  Congress in accordance with Sec. 385.40 throughout the implementation  process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After execution of the Interim Goals Agreement, the Department  of the Army shall memorialize the agreement in appropriate Corps of  Engineers guidance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interim goals are a means by which the restoration  success of the Plan may be evaluated at specific points by agency  managers, the State, and Congress throughout the overall planning and  implementation process. In addition, interim goals will facilitate  adaptive management and allow the Corps of Engineers and its non-Federal  sponsors opportunities to make adjustments if actual project performance  is less than anticipated, including recommending changes to the Plan.  Interim goals are not standards or schedules enforceable in court.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The interim goals shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Facilitate inter-agency planning, monitoring and assessment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Be provided to the independent scientific review panel  established in accordance with Sec. 385.22(a);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Be considered in developing the Master Implementation  Sequencing Plan, Project Implementation Reports, and Comprehensive Plan  Modification Reports; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Be considered in making budgetary decisions concerning  implementation of the Plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To ensure flexibility in implementing the Plan over the next  several decades, and to ensure that interim goals may reflect changed  circumstances or new information resulting from adaptive management, the  interim goals may be modified, consistent with the processes set forth  in paragraph (d) of this section, to reflect new information resulting  from changed or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific and technical  information, new or updated modeling; information developed through the  assessment principles contained in the Plan; and future authorized  changes to the Plan integrated into the implementation of the Plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management  District shall sequence and schedule projects as appropriate to achieve  the interim goals and the interim targets established pursuant to  Sec. 385.39 to the   extent practical given funding, technical, or other constraints.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the interim goals have not been met or are unlikely to be  met, then the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management  District shall determine why the interim goals have not been met or are  unlikely to be met and either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Initiate adaptive management actions pursuant to Sec. 385.31(d)  to achieve the interim goals as soon as practical, consistent with the  purposes of the Plan and consistent with the interim targets established  pursuant to Sec. 385.39; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Recommend changes to the interim goals in accordance with  paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Principles for developing interim goals. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> RECOVER, using best  available science and information, shall recommend a set of interim  goals for implementation of the Plan, consisting of regional hydrologic  performance targets, improvements in water quality, and anticipated  ecological responses for areas such as, Lake Okeechobee, the Kissimmee  River Region, the Water Conservation Areas, the Lower East Coast, the  Upper East Coast, the Everglades Agricultural Area, and the  Caloosahatchee River, Everglades National Park, Big Cypress National  Preserve, Biscayne Bay, Florida Bay, and other estuaries and nearshore  areas. These interim goals shall reflect the incremental accomplishment  of the expected performance level of the Plan, and will identify  improvements in quantity, quality, timing, and distribution of water for  the natural system provided by the Plan in five-year increments that  begin in 2005, with the goals reflecting the results expected to be  achieved by 2010 and for each five-year increment thereafter. The  interim goals shall be developed through the use of appropriate models  and tools and shall provide a quantitative basis for evaluating the  restoration success of the Plan during the period of implementation. In  developing the interim goals for the five-year increments, RECOVER shall  use the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan as the basis for  predicting performance at a given time. RECOVER may recommend additional  interim goals in addition to those initially developed and may propose  revisions to the initial set of interim goals as new information is  gained through adaptive management. Interim goals shall include  incremental improvements in the quantity, quality, timing, and  distribution of water anticipated to be required to meet long-term  hydrological and ecological restoration goals, based on best available  science. These goals may be modified, based on best available science  and the adaptive assessment principles contained in the Plan, in  accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In developing its recommendations for interim goals, RECOVER  shall consider indicators including, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Hydrologic indicators, including:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The amount of water, in addition to the pre-CERP baseline and  assumptions regarding without project conditions, which will be  available to the natural system;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Hydroperiod targets in designated sample areas throughout the  Everglades;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The changes in the seasonal and annual overland flow volumes in  the Everglades that will be available to the natural system;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The frequency of extreme high and low water levels in Lake  Okeechobee; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The frequency of meeting salinity envelopes in estuaries such as  the St. Lucie, Caloosahatchee, Biscayne Bay, and Florida Bay and  nearshore areas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Improvement in water quality; including:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Total phosphorus concentrations in the Everglades; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Lake Okeechobee phosphorus concentrations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Ecological responses, including:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Increases in total spatial extent of restored wetlands;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Improvement in habitat quality; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Improvement in native plant and animal abundance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In developing the interim goals based upon water quality and  expected ecological responses, the Corps of Engineers, The Department of  the Interior,   and the South Florida Water Management District shall take into  consideration the extent to which actions undertaken by Federal, State,  tribal, and other entities under programs not within the scope of this  part may affect achievement of the goals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Process for establishing interim goals. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The recommendations  of RECOVER shall be provided to the Corps of Engineers, the Department  of the Interior, and the South Florida Water Management District. These  recommendations shall be provided no later than June 14, 2004. The  proposed Interim Goals Agreement shall be developed by the Secretary of  the Army, the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor in consultation  with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of  Florida, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the  Commerce, other Federal, State, and local agencies, and the South  Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force. In considering the interim  goals to be included in the Interim Goals Agreement, the Secretary of  the Army, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Governor, shall be  provided with, and consider, the technical recommendations of RECOVER  and any modifications to those recommendations by the Corps of  Engineers, the Department of Interior, or the South Florida Water  Management District. The Secretary of the Army shall provide a notice of  availability of the proposed agreement to the public in the Federal  Register and seek public comments. After considering comments of the  public on the proposed agreement, and incorporating any suggestions that  are appropriate and consistent with the goals and purposes of the Plan,  the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Interior, and the  Governor, shall execute the final agreement, and the Secretary of the  Army shall provide a notice of availability to the public in the Federal  Register by no later than December 13 2004.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In developing its recommendations for interim goals, RECOVER  shall use the principles in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Interior, and  the Governor shall review the Interim Goals Agreement at a minimum of  every five years after the date of the Interim Goals Agreement, to  determine if the interim goals should be revised. Thereafter, the  Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Governor  shall revise the interim goals and execute a new agreement as  appropriate. However, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the  Interior, and the Governor may review and revise the interim goals  whenever appropriate as new information becomes available. Any revisions  to the interim goals shall be consistent with the process established in  this section.</p>
