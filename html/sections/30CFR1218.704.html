                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Interest. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The ONRR will assess interest on all delinquent  debts as prescribed by applicable statutes and regulations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Interest will accrue on debts involving Federal and Indian oil  and gas leases under 30 CFR 1218.54, 1218.102, and 1218.150.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Interest will accrue on debts involving Federal and Indian  solid mineral and geothermal resource leases under 30 CFR 1218.202 and  1218.302.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Interest will accrue on civil penalties ONRR assesses under 30  CFR part 1241.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interest begins to accrue on all debts from the date that the  payment was due unless otherwise specified by law or lease terms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Penalties. The ONRR will assess penalties under our authority in  30 U.S.C. 1719 and 1720a, and implementing regulations at 30 CFR part  1241.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Administrative costs. The ONRR initially will assess $436 for  administrative costs incurred as a result of your failure to pay a  delinquent debt. We will publish a notice of any increase in  administrative costs assessed under this section in the Federal  Register. The ONRR also may assess $436 for administrative costs that  continue to accrue during any appeal process if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The notice we provide you under 30 CFR 1218.703 grants you the  right to appeal and you exercise that right; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Your appeal is denied and we refer the delinquent debt to  Treasury under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Allocation of payments.

The Director may decide to waive collection of all or  part of the administrative costs under paragraph (c) of this section  either in compromise of the delinquent debt or if the Director  determines collection of this charge would be against equity and good  conscience or not in the Government's best interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The ONRR's decision whether to collect or waive collection of  administrative costs under paragraph (f) of this section is the final  decision for the Department and is not subject to administrative review.</p>
