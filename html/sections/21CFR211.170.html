                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An appropriately identified reserve sample that is representative of each lot in each shipment of each active ingredient shall be retained. The reserve sample consists of at least twice the quantity necessary for all tests required to determine whether the active ingredient meets its established specifications, except for sterility and pyrogen testing. The retention time is as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For an active ingredient in a drug product other than those described in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section, the reserve sample shall be retained for 1 year after the expiration date of the last lot of the drug product containing the active ingredient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For an active ingredient in a radioactive drug product, except for nonradioactive reagent kits, the reserve sample shall be retained for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Three months after the expiration date of the last lot of the drug product containing the active ingredient if the

expiration dating period of the drug product is 30 days or less; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Six months after the expiration date of the last lot of the drug product containing the active ingredient if the expiration dating period of the drug product is more than 30 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For an active ingredient in an OTC drug product that is exempt from bearing an expiration date under Sec. 211.137, the reserve sample shall be retained for 3 years after distribution of the last lot of the drug product containing the active ingredient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An appropriately identified reserve sample that is representative of each lot or batch of drug product shall be retained and stored under conditions consistent with product labeling. The reserve sample shall be stored in the same immediate container-closure system in which the drug product is marketed or in one that has essentially the same characteristics. The reserve sample consists of at least twice the quantity necessary to perform all the required tests, except those for sterility and pyrogens. Except for those for drug products described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, reserve samples from representative sample lots or batches selected by acceptable statistical procedures shall be examined visually at least once a year for evidence of deterioration unless visual examination would affect the integrity of the reserve sample. Any evidence of reserve sample deterioration shall be investigated in accordance with Sec. 211.192. The results of the examination shall be recorded and maintained with other stability data on the drug product. Reserve samples of compressed medical gases need not be retained. The retention time is as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a drug product other than those described in paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section, the reserve sample shall be retained for 1 year after the expiration date of the drug product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a radioactive drug product, except for nonradioactive reagent kits, the reserve sample shall be retained for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Three months after the expiration date of the drug product if the expiration dating period of the drug product is 30 days or less; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Six months after the expiration date of the drug product if the expiration dating period of the drug product is more than 30 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For an OTC drug product that is exempt for bearing an expiration date under Sec. 211.137, the reserve sample must be retained for 3 years after the lot or batch of drug product is distributed.
