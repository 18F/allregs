                            <p class="depth0">Liability for tax incurred on the use of an article is not  extinguished or reduced because of any subsequent sale or lease of the  article even if such sale   or lease would have been exempt if the article had been so sold or  leased prior to use. If a manufacturer, producer, or importer of an  article incurs liability for tax on his use thereof, and thereafter  sells or leases the article in a transaction which otherwise would be  subject to tax, liability for tax is not incurred on such sale or lease.
