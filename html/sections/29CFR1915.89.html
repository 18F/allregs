This procedure shall be  used to ensure that   all potentially hazardous-energy sources have been isolated and the  machinery, equipment, or system to be serviced has been rendered  inoperative through the use of lockout or tags-plus procedures before  employees perform any servicing when the energization or start-up of the  machinery, equipment, or system, or the release of hazardous energy  could cause injury.</p><p class="depth0">Compliance With This Program</p><p class="depth0">All employees are required to comply with the restrictions and  limitations imposed on them during the use of lockout or tags-plus  applications. Authorized employees are required to perform each lockout  or tags-plus application in accordance with this procedure. No employee,  upon observing that machinery, equipment, or systems are secured using  lockout or tags-plus applications, shall attempt to start, open, close,  energize, or operate that machinery, equipment, or system. ________________________________________________________________________  Type of compliance enforcement to be taken for violation of the above.</p><p class="depth0">Procedures for Lockout/Tags-Plus Systems</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Notify each affected employee that servicing is required on the  machinery, equipment, or system, and that it must be isolated and  rendered inoperative using a lockout or tags-plus system. ________________________________________________________________________  Method of notifying all affected employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The authorized employee shall refer to shipyard employer's  procedures to identify the type and magnitude of the energy source(s)  that the machinery, equipment, or system uses, shall understand the  hazards of the energy, and shall know the methods to control the energy  source(s). ________________________________________________________________________  Type(s) and magnitude(s) of energy, its hazards and the methods to  control the energy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the machinery, equipment, or system is operating, shut it  down in accordance with the written procedures (depress the stop button,  open switch, close valve, etc.) established by the employer. ________________________________________________________________________  Type(s) and location(s) of machinery, equipment, or system operating  controls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Secure each energy-isolating device(s) through the use of a  lockout or tags-plus system (for instance, disconnecting, blanking, and  affixing tags) so that the energy source is isolated and the machinery,  equipment, or system is rendered inoperative. ________________________________________________________________________  Type(s) and location(s) of energy-isolating devices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Lockout System. Affix a lock to each energy-isolating device(s)  with assigned individual lock(s) that will hold the energy-isolating  device(s) in a safe or off position. Potentially hazardous energy (such  as that found in capacitors, springs, elevated machine members, rotating  flywheels, hydraulic systems, and air, gas, steam, or water pressure,  etc.) must be controlled by methods such as grounding, repositioning,  blocking, bleeding down, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Tags-Plus System. Affix a tag to each energy-isolating device  and provide at least one additional safety measure that clearly  indicates that removal of the device from the safe or off position is  prohibited. Potentially hazardous energy (such as that found in  capacitors, springs, elevated machine members, rotating flywheels,  hydraulic systems and air, gas, steam, or water pressure, etc.) must be  controlled by methods such as grounding, repositioning, blocking,  bleeding down, etc. ________________________________________________________________________  Type(s) of hazardous energy--methods used to control them.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Ensure that the machinery, equipment, or system is relieved,  disconnected, restrained, or rendered safe from the release of all  potentially hazardous energy by checking that no personnel are exposed,  and then verifying the isolation of energy to the machine, equipment, or  system by operating the push button or other normal operating  control(s), or by testing to make certain it will not operate.  CAUTION: Return operating control(s) to the safe or off position after  verifying the isolation of the machinery, equipment, or system.  ________________________________________________________________________  Method of verifying the isolation of the machinery, equipment, or  system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The machinery, equipment, or system is now secured by a lockout  or tags-plus system, and servicing by the authorized person may be  performed.</p><p class="depth0">Procedures for Removal of Lockout/Tags-Plus Systems</p><p class="depth0">When servicing is complete and the machinery, equipment, or system  is ready to return to normal operating condition, the following steps  shall be taken:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Notify each authorized and affected employee(s) that the  lockout/tags-plus system will be removed and the machinery, equipment,  or system reenergized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Inspect the work area to ensure that all employees have been  safely positioned or removed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Inspect the machinery, equipment, or system and the immediate  area around the machinery, equipment, or system to ensure that  nonessential items have been removed   and that the machinery, equipment or system components are operationally  intact.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reconnect the necessary components, remove the lockout/tags-plus  material and hardware, and reenergize the machinery, equipment, or  system through the established detailed procedures determined by the  employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Notify all affected employees that servicing is complete and the  machinery, equipment, or system is ready for testing or use.</p>
