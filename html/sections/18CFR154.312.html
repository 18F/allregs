If the cost-of-service is allocated among rate zones, show how the classified cost-of-service is allocated among rate zones by function. If the pipeline proposes to establish rate zones for the first time, or to change existing rate zone boundaries, explain how the rate zone boundaries are established.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Show how the classified costs of service provided in Schedule I-2 or Schedule I-3 (i) are allocated among the pipeline's services and rate schedules.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provide the formulae used in the allocation of the cost-of-service. Provide the factors underlying the allocation of the cost-of-service (e.g., contract demand, annual billing determinants, three-day peak). Provide the load factor or other basis for any imputed demand quantities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Explain any changes in the basis for the allocation of the cost-of-service from the allocation methodologies underlying the currently effective rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Schedule I-4.

Provide the basis for any variation between estimated and actual base period data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Statement J. Comparison and Reconciliation of Estimated Operating Revenues With Cost-of-service. Compare the total revenues by rate schedule (Schedule G-2) to the allocated cost-of-service (Statement I). Identify any surcharges that are reflected in Statement N or in Statement I.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Schedule J-1. Summary of Billing Determinants. Provide a summary of all billing determinants used to derive rates. Provide a reconciliation of customers' total billing determinants as shown on Schedule G-2 with those used to derive rates in Schedule J-2. Provide an explanation of how any discount adjustment is developed. If billing determinants are imputed for interruptible service, explain the method for calculating the billing determinants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Schedule J-2. Derivation of Rates. Show the derivation of each rate component of each rate. For each rate component of each rate schedule, include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A reference (by page, line, and column) to the allocated cost-of-service in Statement I.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A reference to the appropriate billing determinants in Schedule J-1.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Explain any changes in the method used for the derivation of rates from the method used in developing the underlying rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Statement K. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Statement L. Balance Sheet. Provide a balance sheet in the form prescribed by the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts for Natural Gas
