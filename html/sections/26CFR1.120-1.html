                                Sec. 1.120-1  Statutory subsistence allowance received by police.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 120 excludes from the gross income of an individual  employed as a police official by a State, Territory, or possession of  the United States, by any of their political subdivisions, or by the  District of Columbia, any amount received as a statutory subsistence  allowance to the extent that such allowance does not exceed $5 per day.  For purposes of this section, the term ``statutory subsistence  allowance'' means an amount which is designated as a subsistence  allowance under the laws of a State, a Territory, or a possession of the  United States, any political subdivision of any of the foregoing, or the  District of Columbia and which is paid to an individual who is employed  as a police official of such governmental unit. A subsistence allowance  paid to a police official by any of the foregoing governmental units  which is not so provided by statute may not be excluded from gross  income under the provisions of section 120. The term ``police official''  includes an employee of any of the foregoing governmental units who has  police duties, such as a sheriff, a detective, a policeman, or a State  police trooper, however designated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The exclusion provided by section 120 is to be computed on a  daily basis, that is, for each day for which the statutory allowance is  paid. If the statute providing the allowance does not specify the daily  amount of such allowance, the allowance shall be converted to a daily  basis for the purpose of applying the limitation provided herein. For  example, if a State statute provides for a weekly subsistence allowance,  the daily amount is to be determined by dividing the weekly amount by  the number of days for which the allowance is paid. Thus, if a State  trooper receives a weekly statutory subsistence allowance of $40 would  be $8, that is, $40 divided by 5 for 5 days of the week, the daily  amount would be $8, that is, $40 divided by 5. However, for purposes of  this section, only $5 per day may be excluded, or $25 on a weekly basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Expenses in respect of which the allowance under section 120 is  paid may not be deducted under any provision of the income tax laws  except to the extent that (1) such expenses exceed the amount of the  exclusion, and (2) the excess is otherwise allowable as a deduction. For  example, if a State statute provides a subsistence allowance of $3 per  day and the taxpayer, a state trooper, incurs expenditures of $4.50 for  meals while away from home overnight on official police duties only $3  would be excludable under this section. Expenses relating to such  exclusion ($3) may not be deducted under any provision of the income tax  laws. However, the remaining $1.50 may be an allowable deduction under  section 162 as traveling expenses while away from home in the  performance of official duties. See Sec. 1.162-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the case of taxable years ending after September 30, 1958,  section 120 and this section do not apply to amounts received as a  statutory subsistence allowance for any day after September 30, 1958.</p>
