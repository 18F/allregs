                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Program requirements. (1) A worker, after being separated from adversely affected employment, must participate in an approved job search program (JSP), or have completed a JSP, as a condition for receiving TRA, except where the State agency determines that an acceptable JSP is not reasonably available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A TRA claimant is subject to participation in a JSP as a condition for

receiving TRA for weeks of unemployment which begin after the date the claimant is notified of the requirement and has filed an initial claim for TRA. The claimant is not subject to the JSP as a condition for receiving TRA for weeks which begin prior to that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When the State agency determines that the worker has failed to begin participation in an approved JSP, or ceased to participate in such a JSP before completion, and there is no justifiable cause for such failure or cessation, no TRA may be paid to the worker for weeks beginning with the week that failure or cessation occurred when it is determined that such failure or cessation was without justifiable cause. TRA may be paid thereafter to an otherwise eligible worker only for weeks beginning with the week the worker begins or resumes participation in an approved JSP or complete the JSP. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(3), justifiable cause means such reasons as would justify an individual's conduct when measured by conduct expected of a reasonable individual in like circumstances, including but not limited to reasons beyond the individual's control and reasons related to the individual's capability to enroll in an approved JSP or complete the JSP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A worker in training approved under Sec. Sec.  617.22 through 617.26, or approved by the State agency under State law, is excepted from the JSP qualifying requirement while the worker is attending and making satisfactory progress in the training. This exception applies whether training begins before or after entitlement to basic TRA commences, and also applies after training begins for a worker who is attending a JSP program. Exceptions to the JSP qualifying requirement must be documented in the worker's claim file by the State agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Approved JSPs. A job search program may be approved if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The JSP is provided through the Workforce Investment Act, the public employment service, or any other Federal or State funded program, and complies with paragraphs (w), (x), and (y) of Sec.  617.3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The JSP is sponsored by a company or firm from which the worker has been separated, and complies with paragraphs (w), (x), and (y) of Sec.  617.3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determination of reasonably available. (1) Reasonably available means an existing approved JSP that is located in the worker's normal commuting area, as defined in Sec.  617.3, and has sufficient capacity to accommodate the worker.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When the State determines that a JSP is not reasonably available for a worker, the requirement is not a condition of qualifying for TRA for the weeks involved. When a determination is made with respect to a worker, the State agency must document its determination, and the weeks involved, in the worker's claim file, prior to making TRA payments to the worker.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The State agency may issue a blanket waiver of the JSP qualifying requirement for TRA for groups of workers, where deemed appropriate, when it is determined that there is no functioning JSP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> All determinations that a JSP is not reasonably available should extend only for that period of time that a JSP is not reasonably available, and the exception for workers in approved training should extend until the completion of training. If the State determines that a JSP is reasonably available at a later date, then the JSP qualifying requirement must be met for entitlement to basic TRA for weeks of unemployment beginning with the week in which JSP becomes reasonably available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> JSP allowances. Subsistence and transportation costs shall be approved for workers participating in JSPs when deemed appropriate and within available State funding levels. Costs incurred may not exceed those allowable for training under Sec. Sec.  617.27 and 617.28, if, and when, the State refers a worker to a JSP outside the normal commuting area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Termination of requirement. The job search program requirement set out in this section shall not be a condition of entitlement to TRA for any week.
