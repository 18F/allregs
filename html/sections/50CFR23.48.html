                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. Article VII(6) of the Treaty grants an exemption that  allows international trade in certain specimens for noncommercial loan,  donation, or exchange between registered scientific institutions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> U.S. and foreign general provisions. The following provisions  apply to the registration of scientific institutions and acceptance of  shipments from registered scientific institutions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The receiving and sending scientific institutions must be  registered with the Management Authority in their country. Scientists  who wish to use this exemption must be affiliated with a registered  scientific institution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When a Management Authority is satisfied that a scientific  institution has met the criteria for registration, it will assign the  institution a five-character code consisting of the ISO country code and  a unique three-digit number. In the case of a non-Party, the Secretariat  will ensure that the institution meets the standards and assign it a  unique code.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Management Authority must communicate the name, address,  and assigned code to the Secretariat, which maintains a register of  scientific institutions and provides that information to all Parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A registered scientific institution does not need separate CITES  documents for the noncommercial loan, donation, or exchange of  preserved, frozen, dried, or embedded museum specimens, herbarium  specimens, or live plant material with another registered institution.  The shipment must have an external label that contains information  specified in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> U.S. application to register as a scientific institution. To  register, complete Form 3-200-39 and submit it to the U.S. Management  Authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> apply to the  registration of U.S. and foreign institutions for scientific exchange.  To be issued a certificate of scientific exchange as a registered U.S.  scientific institution, you must provide sufficient information for us  to find that your institution meets all of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Collections of wildlife or plant specimens are permanently  housed and professionally curated, and corresponding records are kept.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specimens are accessible to all qualified users, including those  from other institutions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specimens are properly accessioned in a permanent catalog.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Records are permanently maintained for loans and transfers to  and from other institutions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Specimens are acquired primarily for research that is to be  reported in scientific publications, and CITES specimens are not used  for commercial purposes or as decorations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Collections are prepared and arranged in a way that ensures  their accessibility to researchers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Specimen labels, permanent catalogs, and other records are  accurate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Specimens are legally acquired and lawfully possessed under a  country's wildlife and plant laws.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Appendix-I specimens are permanently and centrally housed under  the direct control of the institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> U.S. standard conditions. In addition to the conditions in Sec.   23.56, any activity conducted under a certificate of scientific exchange  must meet all of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Both scientific institutions involved in the exchange must be  registered by the applicable Management Authorities (or the Secretariat  in the case of a non-Party), and be included in   the Secretariat's register of scientific institutions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An institution may send and receive only preserved, frozen,  dried, or embedded museum specimens, herbarium specimens, or live plant  materials that have been permanently and accurately recorded by one of  the institutions involved in the exchange and that are traded as a  noncommercial loan, donation, or exchange.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An institution may use specimens acquired under a certificate of  scientific exchange and their offspring only for scientific research or  educational display at a scientific institution and may not use  specimens for commercial purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The institution must keep records to show that the specimens  were legally acquired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A customs declaration label must be affixed to the outside of  each shipping container or package that contains all of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The acronym ``CITES.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A description of the contents (such as ``herbarium  specimens'').</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The names and addresses of the sending and receiving  registered institutions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The signature of a responsible officer of the sending  registered scientific institution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The scientific institution codes of both registered scientific  institutions involved in the loan, donation, or exchange.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A registered institution may destroy samples during analysis,  provided that a portion of the sample is maintained and permanently  recorded at a registered scientific institution for future scientific  reference.</p>
