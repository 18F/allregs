MPOs may be used to facilitate a ``cooling-off'' period following domestic violence and sexual assault incidents, to include incidents involving children. The commander should provide a written copy of the order within 24 hours of its issuance to the person with whom the member is ordered not to have contact and to the installation LE activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial notification. In the event a MPO is issued against a Soldier and any individual involved in the order does not reside on a Army installation at any time during the duration of the MPO, the installation PMO/DES will notify the appropriate civilian authorities (local magistrate courts, family courts, and local police) of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The issuance of the protective order;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The individuals involved in the order;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any change made in a protective order;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The termination of the protective order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A Civilian Protective Order (CPO) is an order issued by a judge, magistrate or other authorized civilian official, ordering an individual to avoid contact with his or her spouse or children.
