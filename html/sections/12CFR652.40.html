                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Unencumbered. All investments that Farmer Mac holds in its  liquidity reserve and as supplemental liquidity in accordance with this  section must be unencumbered. For the purposes of this section, an  investment is unencumbered if it is free of lien, and it is not  explicitly or implicitly pledged to secure, collateralize, or enhance  the credit of any transaction.   Additionally, an unencumbered investment held in the liquidity reserve  cannot be used as a hedge against interest rate risk if liquidation of  that particular investment would expose Farmer Mac to a material risk of  loss.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Marketable. All investments that Farmer Mac holds in its  liquidity reserve in accordance with this section must be readily  marketable. For purposes of this section, an investment is readily  marketable if it:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Can be easily and quickly converted into cash with little or no  loss in value;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exhibits low credit and market risk;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has ease and certainty of valuation; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Except for money market instruments, can be easily sold or  converted to cash through repurchase agreements in active and sizable  markets without significantly affecting prices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Liquidity reserve requirement, supplemental liquidity, and  discounts. Farmer Mac must maintain at all times a liquidity reserve  sufficient to fund at least 90 days of the principal portion of maturing  obligations and other borrowings. Farmer Mac must also hold supplemental  liquid assets sufficient to fund obligations and other borrowings  maturing after 90 calendar days to meet board liquidity policy in  accordance with Sec. 652.35.
