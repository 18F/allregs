                                Sec. 307.7  Safety requirements for electrical stimulating (EST)
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Electrical stimulating (EST) equipment is equipment  that provides electric shock treatment to carcasses for the purpose of  accelerating rigor mortis of facilitating blood removal. These  provisions do not apply to electrical equipment used to stun and/or  slaughter animals or to facilitate hide removal. Electrical stimulating  equipment consists of two separate pieces--the control system and the  applicator. The EST control system contains the circuitry to generate  pulsed DC or AC voltage for stimulation and is separate from the  equipment used to apply the voltage to the carcass. The voltage is  applied by inserting a probe that penetrates the carcass or is inserted  in the rectum, placing a clamp in the nose, a carcass rub-bar, a  conveyor with energized surfaces traveling with the carcass, or any  other acceptable method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Safety requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Circuits, grounding. Either a bonded  grounding conductor shall lead from each section of the carcass rail  within the stimulating enclosure to the service ground, or the secondary  voltage (stimulating circuit) shall be insulated from the service  ground. If the stimulating section of the carcass rail and carcass drive  mechanisms are insulated from the service ground then the stimulating  rail or the return path shall be electrically bonded to the transformer  secondary to isolate the stimulation voltage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Enclosure. Electrical stimulation shall occur in an area that  will prevent persons from contacting an energized surface. If the area  is surrounded by physical barriers, the enclosure shall be either  electrically grounded or it shall be made of materials that do not  conduct electricity. The interior of the stimulating area shall be  visible from the start switch so the operator can be assured that there  is no person, equipment or material present that should not be there  prior to starting the stimulating sequence. If light or sound beam  sensors form the enclosure, the stimulating equipment shall be  automatically shut off when the sensor signals are broken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Mandatory Warning Devices and Signals. The following warning  devices or signals shall be installed at each opening to the stimulating  area through which a person would normally enter:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A red light that flashes distinctly during the operating cycle  of the stimulating equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An ANSI Z53.1-Color Code sign reading (a) ``Danger Electrical  Hazard'' for stimulating voltage below 50 or (b) ``Danger High Voltage''  for stimulating voltage above 50.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An emergency stop button.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Optional Warning Device--Horn or Bell. If a warning horn or bell  is installed, the signal shall be audible   above background noises in the vicinity, and it shall sound for at least  1 second before each manual stimulation or before the carcass chain is  started in an automatic system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Operation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Training. Only persons who have received safety  instruction by the equipment manufacturer or designee may operate  electrical stimulating equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cleaning and Maintenance. To prevent an electrical shock to  personnel, the electricity supplied to the stimulating surfaces shall be  locked-off when cleaning, mechanical inspection, maintenance or testing  are performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Water. To prevent an electrical shock, personnel shall not spray  streams of water on energized carcasses or on energized stimulating  surfaces.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Special provisions for manually operated equipment.(1)  Stimulating probes or clamps shall be stored in a sanitary container  which is insulated with a material approved by the Administrator. \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ A list of approved insulation materials is available upon  request from the Facilities, Equipment and Sanitation Division,  Technical Services, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department  of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The electric wires attached to a clamp or probe shall not allow  for contact between the probe or clamp and an electrical ground and  shall not extend outside the enclosure.  [53 FR 46432, Nov. 17, 1988, as amended at 64 FR 56415, Oct. 20, 1999]</p>
