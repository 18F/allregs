                            <p class="depth0">For airplanes with one or more pressurized compartments the following apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The airplane structure must be strong enough to withstand the flight loads combined with pressure differential loads from zero up to the maximum relief valve setting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The external pressure distribution in flight, and stress concentrations and fatigue effects must be accounted for.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If landings may be made with the compartment pressurized, landing loads must be combined with pressure differential loads from zero up to the maximum allowed during landing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The airplane structure must be designed to be able to withstand the pressure differential loads corresponding to the maximum relief valve setting multiplied by a factor of 1.33 for airplanes to be approved for operation to 45,000 feet or by a factor of 1.67 for airplanes to be approved for operation above 45,000 feet, omitting other loads.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any structure, component or part, inside or outside a pressurized compartment, the failure of which could interfere with continued safe flight and landing, must be designed to withstand the effects of a sudden release of pressure through an opening in any compartment at any operating altitude resulting from each of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The penetration of the compartment by a portion of an engine following an engine disintegration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any opening in any pressurized compartment up to the size Ho in square feet; however, small compartments may be combined with an adjacent pressurized compartment and both considered as a single compartment for openings that cannot reasonably be expected to be confined to the small compartment. The size Ho must be computed by the following formula:
Ho=PAs
where,
Ho=Maximum opening in square feet, need not exceed 20 square</p><p class="depth3">feet.P=(As/6240)+.024As=Maximum cross-sectional area of the pressurized shell</p><p class="depth3">normal to the longitudinal axis, in square feet; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The maximum opening caused by airplane or equipment failures not shown to be extremely improbable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In complying with paragraph (e) of this section, the fail-safe features of the design may be considered in determining the probability of failure or penetration and probable size of openings, provided that possible improper operation of closure devices and inadvertent door openings are also considered. Furthermore, the resulting differential pressure loads must be combined in a rational and conservative

manner with 1-g level flight loads and any loads arising from emergency depressurization conditions. These loads may be considered as ultimate conditions; however, any deformations associated with these conditions must not interfere with continued safe flight and landing. The pressure relief provided by intercompartment venting may also be considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Bulkheads, floors, and partitions in pressurized compartments for occupants must be designed to withstand the conditions specified in paragraph (e) of this section. In addition, reasonable design precautions must be taken to minimize the probability of parts becoming detached and injuring occupants while in their seats.
