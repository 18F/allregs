                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of this subpart, the following rules of construction apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> One notice per credit extension. A consumer is entitled to no more than one risk-based pricing notice under Sec. 1022.72(a) or (c), or one notice under Sec. 1022.74(d), (e), or (f), for each grant, extension, or other provision of credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if a consumer has previously received a risk-based pricing notice in connection with a grant, extension, or other provision of credit, another risk-based pricing notice is required if the conditions set forth in Sec. 1022.72(d) have been met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Multi-party transactions--(1) Initial creditor. The person to whom a credit obligation is initially payable must provide the risk-based pricing notice described in Sec. 1022.72(a) or (c), or satisfy the requirements for and provide the notice required under one of the exceptions in Sec. 1022.74(d), (e), or (f), even if that person immediately assigns the credit agreement to a third party and is not the source of funding for the credit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initial creditor. The person to whom a credit obligation is initially payable must provide the risk-based pricing notice described in Sec. 1022.72(a) or (c), or satisfy the requirements for and provide the notice required under one of the exceptions in Sec. 1022.74(d), (e), or (f), even if that person immediately assigns the credit agreement to a third party and is not the source of funding for the credit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Purchasers or assignees. A purchaser or assignee of a credit contract with a consumer is not subject to the requirements of this subpart and is not

required to provide the risk-based pricing notice described in Sec. 1022.72(a) or (c), or satisfy the requirements for and provide the notice required under one of the exceptions in Sec. 1022.74(d), (e), or (f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Example. A consumer obtains credit to finance the purchase of an automobile. If a bank or finance company is the person to whom the loan obligation is initially payable, the bank or finance company must provide the risk-based pricing notice to the consumer (or satisfy the requirements for and provide the notice required under one of the exceptions noted above) based on the terms offered by that bank or finance company only. The auto dealer has no duty to provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer. However, the bank or finance company may comply with this rule if the auto dealer has agreed to provide notices to consumers before consummation pursuant to an arrangement with the bank or finance company, as permitted under Sec. 1022.73(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Multiple consumers--(1) Risk-based pricing notices. In a transaction involving two or more consumers who are granted, extended, or otherwise provided credit, a person must provide a notice to each consumer to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 1022.72(a) or (c). Whether the consumers have the same address or not, the person must provide a separate notice to each consumer if a notice includes a credit score(s). Each separate notice that includes a credit score(s) must contain only the credit score(s) of the consumer to whom the notice is provided, and not the credit score(s) of the other consumer. If the consumers have the same address, and the notice does not include a credit score(s), a person may satisfy the requirements by providing a single notice addressed to both consumers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Risk-based pricing notices. In a transaction involving two or more consumers who are granted, extended, or otherwise provided credit, a person must provide a notice to each consumer to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 1022.72(a) or (c). Whether the consumers have the same address or not, the person must provide a separate notice to each consumer if a notice includes a credit score(s). Each separate notice that includes a credit score(s) must contain only the credit score(s) of the consumer to whom the notice is provided, and not the credit score(s) of the other consumer. If the consumers have the same address, and the notice does not include a credit score(s), a person may satisfy the requirements by providing a single notice addressed to both consumers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Credit score disclosure notices. In a transaction involving two or more consumers who are granted, extended, or otherwise provided credit, a person must provide a separate notice to each consumer to satisfy the exceptions in Sec. 1022.74(d), (e), or (f). Whether the consumers have the same address or not, the person must provide a separate notice to each consumer. Each separate notice must contain only the credit score(s) of the consumer to whom the notice is provided, and not the credit score(s) of the other consumer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples. (i) Two consumers jointly apply for credit with a creditor. The creditor obtains credit scores on both consumers. Based in part on the credit scores, the creditor grants credit to the consumers on material terms that are materially less favorable than the most favorable terms available to other consumers from the creditor. The creditor provides risk-based pricing notices to satisfy its obligations under this subpart. The creditor must provide a separate risk-based pricing notice to each consumer whether the consumers have the same address or not. Each risk-based pricing notice must contain only the credit score(s) of the consumer to whom the notice is provided.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Two consumers jointly apply for credit with a creditor.

Even though the two consumers reside at the same address, the creditor must provide a separate credit score disclosure notice to each of the consumers. Each notice must contain only the credit score of the consumer to whom the notice is provided.</p>
