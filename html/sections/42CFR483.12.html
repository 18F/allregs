The documentation must be made by--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The resident's physician when transfer or discharge is necessary under paragraph (a)(2)(i) or paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A physician when transfer or discharge is necessary under paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Notice before transfer. Before a facility transfers or discharges a resident, the facility must--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Notify the resident and, if known, a family member or legal representative of the resident of the transfer or discharge and the reasons for the move in writing and in a language and manner they understand.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Record the reasons in the resident's clinical record; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Include in the notice the items described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Timing of the notice.

The written notice specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section must include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The reason for transfer or discharge;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The effective date of transfer or discharge;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The location to which the resident is transferred or discharged;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A statement that the resident has the right to appeal the action to the State;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The name, address and telephone number of the State long term care ombudsman;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> For nursing facility residents with developmental disabilities, the mailing address and telephone number of the agency responsible for the protection and advocacy of developmentally disabled individuals established under Part C of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> For nursing facility residents who are mentally ill, the mailing address and telephone number of the agency responsible for the protection and advocacy of mentally ill individuals established under the Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Orientation for transfer or discharge.

Room changes in a facility that is a composite distinct part (as defined in Sec. 483.5(c)) must be limited to moves within the particular building in which the resident resides, unless the resident voluntarily agrees to move to another of the composite distinct part's locations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of bed-hold policy and readmission--(1) Notice before transfer.

Before a nursing facility transfers a resident to a hospital or allows a resident to go on therapeutic leave, the nursing facility must provide written information to the resident and a family member or legal representative that specifies--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The duration of the bed-hold policy under the State plan, if any, during which the resident is permitted to return and resume residence in the nursing facility; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The nursing facility's policies regarding bed-hold periods, which must be consistent with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, permitting a resident to return.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Bed-hold notice upon transfer. At the time of transfer of a resident for hospitalization or therapeutic leave, a nursing facility must provide to the resident and a family member or legal representative written notice which specifies the duration of the bed-hold policy described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Permitting resident to return to facility. A nursing facility must establish and follow a written policy under which a resident, whose hospitalization or therapeutic leave exceeds the bed-hold period under the State plan, is readmitted to the facility immediately upon the first availability of a bed in a semi-private room if the resident--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requires the services provided by the facility; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is eligible for Medicaid nursing facility services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Readmission to a composite distinct part. When the nursing facility to which a resident is readmitted is a composite distinct part (as defined in Sec. 483.5(c) of this subpart), the resident must be permitted to return to an available bed in the particular location of the composite distinct part in which he or she resided previously. If a bed is not available in that location at the time of readmission, the resident must be given the option to return to that location upon the first availability of a bed there.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Equal access to quality care. (1) A facility must establish and maintain identical policies and practices regarding transfer, discharge, and the provision of services under the State plan for all individuals regardless of source of payment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A facility must establish and maintain identical policies and practices regarding transfer, discharge, and the provision of services under the State plan for all individuals regardless of source of payment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The facility may charge any amount for services furnished to non-Medicaid residents consistent with the notice requirement in Sec. 483.10(b)(5)(i) and (b)(6) describing the charges; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State is not required to offer additional services on behalf of a resident other than services provided in the State plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Admissions policy. (1) The facility must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The facility must--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Not require residents or potential residents to waive their rights to Medicare or Medicaid; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Not require oral or written assurance that residents or potential residents are not eligible for, or will not apply for, Medicare or Medicaid benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The facility must not require a third party guarantee of payment to the facility as a condition of admission or expedited admission, or continued stay in the facility. However, the facility may require an individual who has legal access to a resident's income or resources available to pay for facility care to sign a contract, without incurring personal financial liability, to provide facility payment from the resident's income or resources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of a person eligible for Medicaid, a nursing facility must not charge, solicit, accept, or receive, in addition to any amount otherwise required to be paid under the State plan, any gift, money, donation, or other consideration as a precondition of admission, expedited admission or continued stay in the facility. However,--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A nursing facility may charge a resident who is eligible for Medicaid for items and services the resident has requested and received, and that are not specified in the State plan as included in the term ``nursing facility services'' so long as the facility gives proper notice of the availability and cost of these services to residents and does not condition the resident's admission or continued stay on the request for and receipt of such additional services; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A nursing facility may solicit, accept, or receive a charitable, religious, or philanthropic contribution from an organization or from a person unrelated to a Medicaid eligible resident or potential resident, but only to the extent that the contribution is not a condition of admission, expedited admission, or continued stay in the facility for a Medicaid eligible resident.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> States or political subdivisions may apply stricter admissions standards under State or local laws than are specified in this section, to prohibit discrimination against individuals entitled to Medicaid.
