                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Secretary, based on monitoring reports or on other reliable  information, may determine that a primary inspection agency which has  been accepted under this subpart is not adequately carrying out one or  more of its required functions. In so determining, the Secretary shall  consider the impact of disqualification on manufacturers and other  affected parties and shall seek to assure that the manufacturing process  is not disrupted unnecessarily. Whenever the Secretary disqualifies a  primary inspection agency under this section, the primary inspection  agency shall have a right to a Formal or Informal Presentation of Views  under subpart D of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A primary inspection agency which has been disqualified under  paragraph (a) may resubmit an application under Sec. 3282.353. The  submission shall include a full explanation of how problems or  inadequacies which resulted in disqualifications have been rectified and  how the primary inspection agency shall assure that such problems shall  not recur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When appropriate, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal  Register or otherwise make available to the public for comment a  disqualified PIA's application for requalification, subject to the  provisions of Sec. 3282.54.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Both provisional and final acceptance of any IPIA (or DAPIA)  automatically expires at the end of any period of one year during which  it has not acted as an IPIA (or DAPIA). An IPIA (or DAPIA) has not acted  as such unless it has actively performed its services as an IPIA (or  DAPIA) for at least one manufacturer by which it has been selected. An  IPIA (or DAPIA) whose acceptance has expired pursuant to this section  may resubmit an application under Sec. 3282.353 in order to again be  qualified as an IPIA (or DAPIA), when it can show a bona fide prospect  of performing IPIA (or DAPIA) services.
