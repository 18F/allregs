Where the service provider is the licensee, if the service provider provides the record company all information necessary for the record company to determine whether additional royalties are payable by the service provider hereunder as a result of revenue recognized from a person or entity other than the service provider as described in the immediately preceding sentence, then the record company shall provide such further information as necessary for the service provider to calculate the additional royalties and indemnify the service provider for such additional royalties. The sole obligation of the record company shall be to pay the licensee such additional royalties if actually payable

as royalties hereunder; provided, however, that this shall not affect any otherwise existing right or remedy of the copyright owner nor diminish the licensee's obligations to the copyright owner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Computation of subscriber-based royalty rates. For purposes of paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section, to determine the subscriber-based minimum applicable to any particular subpart C offering, as defined in Sec.  385.21, the total number of subscriber-months for the accounting period shall be calculated, taking into account all end users who were subscribers for complete calendar months, prorating in the case of end users who were subscribers for only part of a calendar month, and deducting on a prorated basis for end users covered by a free trial period subject to the free trial royalty rate as described in Sec.  385.24. The product of the total number of subscriber-months for the accounting period and the specified number of cents per subscriber shall be used as the subscriber-based component of the minimum for the accounting period.</p>
