                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Minerals are locatable if they meet the requirements in Sec. 3830.11 and are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Recognized as a mineral by the scientific community; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Found on Federal lands open to mineral entry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under the Surface Resources Act, certain varieties of mineral materials are locatable if they are uncommon because they possess a distinct and special value. As provided in McClarty v. Secretary of the Interior, 408 F.2d 907 (9th Cir. 1969), we determine whether mineral materials have a distinct and special value by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Comparing the mineral deposit in question with other deposits of such minerals generally;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determining whether the mineral deposit in question has a unique physical property;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determining whether the unique property gives the deposit a distinct and special value;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Determining whether, if the special value is for uses to which ordinary varieties of the mineral are put, the deposit has some distinct and special value for such use; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Determining whether the distinct and special value is reflected by the higher price that the material commands in the market place.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Block pumice having one dimension of 2 or more inches is an uncommon variety of mineral material under the Surface Resources Act, and is subject to location under the mining laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limestone of chemical or metallurgical grade, or that is suitable for making cement, is subject to location under the mining laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Gypsum suitable for the manufacture of wall board or plaster, or uses requiring a high state of purity, is subject to location under the mining laws.</p>
