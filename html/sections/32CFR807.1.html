Base Chiefs of Information Management will set up procedures to meet these needs and will make available Master Publications Libraries for public use according to AFR 4-61. They will also advise requesters that these libraries are available, since in many cases this will satisfy their needs and reduce workloads in processing sales requests. If the item is on sale by the Superintendent of Documents, GPO, refer the request to that outlet. Refer general public requests for Air Force administrative publications and forms to the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), Defense Publication Section, US Department of Commerce, 4285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161-0001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Air Force does not consider these unaltered publications and forms as records, within the meaning of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), as outlined in 5 U.S.C. 552 and implemented by part 806 of this chapter. Refer requests that invoke the FOIA to the chief, base information management, for processing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Units will process requests under the Foreign Military Sales Program (FMS) as specified in AFR 4-71, chapter 11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Units will send requests from foreign governments, their representatives, or international organizations to the MAJCOM foreign disclosure policy office and to HQ USAF/CVAII, Washington DC 20330-5000.
