The amount of the  assessment shall, in the case of tax shown on a return by the taxpayer,  be the amount so shown, and in all other cases the amount of the  assessment shall be the amount shown on the supporting list or record.  The date of the assessment is the date the summary record is signed by  an assessment officer.
