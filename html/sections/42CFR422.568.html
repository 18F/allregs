                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Method and place for filing a request. An enrollee must ask for  a standard organization determination by making a request with the MA  organization or, if applicable, to the entity responsible for making the  determination (as directed by the MA organization), in accordance with  the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The request may be made orally or in writing, except as provided  in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requests for payment must be made in writing (unless the MA  organization or entity responsible for making the determination has  implemented a voluntary policy of accepting verbal payment requests).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> of this section, when a party has made a request for a  service, the MA organization must notify the enrollee of its  determination as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition  requires, but no later than 14 calendar days after the date the  organization receives the request for a standard organization  determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Extensions. The MA organization may extend the timeframe by up  to 14 calendar days if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The enrollee requests the extension;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The extension is justified and in the enrollee's interest due  to the need for additional medical evidence from a noncontract provider  that may change an MA organization's decision to deny an item or  service; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The extension is justified due to extraordinary, exigent, or  other non-routine circumstances and is in the enrollee's interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice of extension. When the MA organization extends the  timeframe, it must notify the enrollee in writing of the reasons for the  delay, and inform the enrollee of the right to file an expedited  grievance if he or she disagrees with the MA organization's decision to  grant an extension. The MA organization must notify the enrollee of its  determination as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition  requires, but no later than upon expiration of the extension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Timeframe for requests for payment. The MA organization must  process requests for payment according to the ``prompt payment''  provisions set forth in Sec. 422.520.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Written notice for MA organization denials. The MA organization  must give the enrollee a written notice if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An MA organization decides to deny service or payment in whole  or in part, or reduce or prematurely discontinue the level of care for a  previously authorized ongoing course of treatment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An enrollee requests an MA organization to provide an  explanation of a practitioner's denial of an item or service, in whole  or in part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Form and content of the MA organization notice. The notice of  any denial under paragraph (d) of this section must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use approved notice language in a readable and understandable  form;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State the specific reasons for the denial;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inform the enrollee of his or her right to a reconsideration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For service denials, describe both the standard and expedited  reconsideration processes, including the enrollee's right to, and  conditions for, obtaining an expedited reconsideration and the rest of  the appeal process; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For payment denials, describe the standard reconsideration  process and the rest of the appeal process; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Comply with any other notice requirements specified by CMS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effect of failure to provide timely notice. If the MA  organization fails to provide the enrollee with timely notice of an  organization determination as specified in this section, this failure  itself constitutes an adverse organization determination and may be  appealed.
