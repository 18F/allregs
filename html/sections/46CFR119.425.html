Sec.  116.405(c) and 116.970 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Horizontal dry exhaust pipes are permitted only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> They do not pass through living or berthing spaces;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> They terminate above the deepest load waterline;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> They are so arranged as to prevent entry of cold water from rough or boarding seas;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> They are constructed of corrosion resisting material at the hull penetration; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> They are installed in compliance with Sec. Sec.  116.405(c) and 116.970 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The exhaust pipe cooling water system must comply with the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Water for cooling the exhaust pipe must be obtained from the engine cooling water system or a separate engine driven pump.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Water for cooling an exhaust pipe, other than a vertical exhaust, must be injected into the exhaust system as near to the engine manifold as practicable. The water must pass through the entire length of the exhaust pipe.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The part of the exhaust system between the point of cooling water injection and the engine manifold must be water-jacketed or effectively insulated and protected in compliance with Sec. Sec.  116.400(b) and 116.970 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each vertical exhaust pipe must be water-jacketed or suitably insulated between the engine manifold and the spark arrester required by Sec.  119.430(g) of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When the exhaust cooling water system is separate from the engine cooling water system, a suitable warning device, visual or audible, must be installed at the operating station to indicate any reduction in normal water flow in the exhaust cooling system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A suitable hull strainer must be installed in the circulating raw water intake line for the exhaust cooling system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Engine exhaust cooling systems built in accordance with the requirements of American Boat and Yacht Council (ABCY) P-1, ``Installation of Exhaust Systems for Propulsion and Auxiliary Engines,'' will be considered as meeting the requirements of this section.</p>
