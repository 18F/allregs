                                Sec. 531.37  Overtime workweeks.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 7 requires that the employee receive compensation for  overtime hours at ``a rate of not less than one and one-half times the  regular rate at which he is employed.'' When overtime is worked by an  employee who receives the whole or part of his or her wage in facilities  and it becomes necessary to determine the portion of wages represented  by facilities, all such facilities must be measured by the requirements  of section 3(m) and subpart B of this part. It is the Administrator's  opinion that deductions may be made, however, on the same basis in an  overtime workweek as in nonovertime workweeks (see Sec. 531.36), if  their purpose and effect are not to evade the overtime requirements of  the Act or other law, providing the amount deducted does not exceed the  amount which could be deducted if the employee had only worked the  maximum number of straight-time hours during the workweek. Deductions in  excess of this amount for such articles as tools or other articles which  are not ``facilities'' within the meaning of the Act are illegal in  overtime workweeks as well as in nonovertime workweeks. There is no  limit on the amount which may be deducted for ``board, lodging, or other  facilities'' in overtime workweeks (as in workweeks when no overtime is  worked), provided that these deductions are made only for the  ``reasonable cost'' of the items furnished. These principles assume a  situation where bona fide deductions are made for particular items in  accordance with the agreement or understanding of the parties. If the  situation is solely one of refusal or failure to pay the full amount of  wages required by section 7, these principles have no application.  Deductions made only in overtime workweeks, or increases in the prices  charged for articles or services during overtime workweeks will be  scrutinized to determine whether they are manipulations to evade the  overtime requirements of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where deductions are made from the stipulated wage of an  employee, the regular rate of pay is arrived at on the basis of the  stipulated wage before any deductions have been made. Where board,  lodging, or other facilities are   customarily furnished as additions to a cash wage, the reasonable cost  of the facilities to the employer must be considered as part of the  employee's regular rate of pay. See Walling v. Alaska Pacific  Consolidated Mining Co., 152 F.2d 812 (9th Cir. 1945), cert. denied, 327  U.S. 803.
