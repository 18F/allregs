                            <p class="depth0">This part prescribes policies and procedures for contracting for  supplies and services under the Federal Supply Schedule program, which  is directed and managed by the General Services Administration (see  Subpart 8.4, Federal Supply Schedules, for additional information). GSA  may delegate certain responsibilities to other agencies (e.g., GSA has  delegated authority to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to  procure medical supplies under the VA Federal Supply Schedules Program).  The VA Federal Supply Schedules Program is covered by this subpart.  Additionally, the Department of Defense manages a similar system of  schedule contracting for military items; however, the Department of  Defense systems are not a part of the Federal Supply Schedule program.
