                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Identity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Product definition. Frozen peas is the food in  ``package'' form as that term is defined in Sec. 1.20 of this chapter,  prepared from the succulent seed of the pea plant of the species Pisum  sativum L. Any suitable variety of pea may be used. It is blanched,  drained, and preserved by freezing in such a way that the range of  temperature of maximum crystallization is passed quickly. The freezing  process shall not be regarded as complete until the product temperature  has reached -18 C (0 F) or lower at the thermal center, after thermal  stabilization. Such food may contain one, or any combination of two or  more, of the following safe and suitable optional ingredients:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Natural and artificial flavors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Condiments such as spices and mint leaves.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Dry nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Salt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Monosodium glutamate and other glutamic acid salts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Size specifications. If size graded, frozen peas shall contain  not less than 80 percent by weight of peas of the size declared or of  smaller sizes. The sample unit may not contain more than 20 percent by  weight of peas of the next two larger sizes, of which not more than one  quarter by weight of such peas may be of the larger of these two sizes,  and may contain no peas larger than the next two larger sizes, if such  there be. The following sizes and designations shall apply:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Round hole sieve size through</p><p class="depth0">which peas will pass</p><p class="depth0">Size designation           ----------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Millimeters          Inch ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Extra small..........................  Up to 7.5...............    0.295 Very small...........................  Up to 8.2...............      .32 Small................................  Up to 8.75..............      .34 Medium...............................  Up to 10.2..............      .40 Large................................  Over 10.2...............      .40 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Labeling. The name of the product is ``peas''. The term  ``early'', ``June'', or ``early June'' shall precede or follow the name  in the case of smooth-skin or substantially smooth-skin peas, such as  Alaska-type peas. Where the peas are of sweet green wrinkled varieties,  the name may include the designation ``sweet'', ``green'', ``wrinkled'',  or any combination thereof. The label shall contain the words ``frozen''  or ``quick frozen''. The name of the food shall include a declaration of  any flavoring that characterizes the product as specified in Sec. 101.22  of this chapter and a declaration of any condiment such as spices and  mint leaves that characterizes the product, e.g., ``Spice added''. Where  a statement of pea size is made, such statement shall indicate either  the size designation as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section or  the applicable sieve size. However, the optional descriptive words  ``petite'' or ``tiny'' may be used in conjunction with the product name  when an average of 80 percent or more of the peas will pass through a  circular opening of a diameter of 8.75 mm (0.34 in) or less for sweet  green wrinkled peas and 8.2 mm (0.32 in) for smooth-skin or  substantially smooth-skin peas, such as Alaska-type peas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Label declaration. Each of the ingredients used in the food  shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of  parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Quality. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The standard of quality for frozen peas is as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Not more than 4 percent by weight blond peas, i.e., yellow or  white but edible peas;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Not more than 10 percent by weight blemished peas, i.e.,  slightly stained or spotted peas;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Not more than 2 percent by weight seriously blemished peas,  i.e., peas that are hard, shrivelled, spotted, discolored or otherwise  blemished to an extent that the appearance or eating quality is  seriously affected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Not more than 15 percent by weight pea fragments, i.e.,  portions of peas, separated or individual cotyledons, crushed, partial  or broken cotyledons and loose skins, but excluding entire intact peas  with skins detached;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Not more than 0.5 percent by weight, or more than 12 sq cm (2 sq  in) in area, extraneous vegetable material, i.e., vine or leaf or pod  material from the pea plant or other such material per sample unit as  defined in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The sum of the pea material described in paragraphs (b)(1) (i),  (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section shall not exceed 15 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> For peas that meet the organoleptic and analytical  characteristics of sweet green wrinkled varieties:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The alcohol-insoluble solids may not be more than 19 percent  based on the procedure set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(4)</em> of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> For smooth-skin or substantially smooth-skin varieties the  alcohol insoluble solids may not be more than 23 percent based on the  procedure set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> The quality of a lot shall be considered acceptable when the  number of defectives does not exceed the acceptance number in the  sampling plans set forth in Sec. 158.3(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The sample unit for determining compliance with the requirements  of paragraph (b)(1) of this section other than those of paragraphs  (b)(1)(vii)(a) and (b)(1)(viii) of this section, shall be 500 g (17.6  oz). For the determination of alcohol-insoluble solids as specified in  paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the container may be the sample unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Alcohol-insoluble solids determination. (i) Extracting  solutions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> One hundred parts of ethanol denatured with five parts of  methanol volume to volume (formula 3A denatured alcohol), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A mixture of 95 parts of formula 3A denatured alcohol and five  parts of isopropanol v/v.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Eighty percent alcohol (8 liters of extracting solutions,  specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) (a) or (b) of this section, diluted to  9.5 liters with water).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Drying dish--a flat-bottom dish with a tight fitting cover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Drying oven--a properly ventilated oven thermostatically  controlled at 100[2 C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Procedure--Transfer frozen contents of package to plastic bag;  tie bag securely and immerse in water bath with continuous flow at room  temperature. Avoid agitation of bag during thawing by using clamps or  weights. When sample completely thaws, remove bag, blot off adhering  water, and transfer peas to U.S. No. 8 sieve, using (20 cm.) size for  container of less than 3 lb. net weight and (30.5 cm.) for larger  quantities. Without shifting peas, incline sieve to aid drainage, drain  2 minutes. With cloth wipe surplus water from lower screen surface.  Weigh 250 g. of peas into high-speed blender, add 250 g. of water and  blend to smooth paste. For less than 250 g. sample, use entire sample  with equal weight of water. Weight 20 g.[10 mg. of the paste into 250  ml. distillation flask, add 120 ml. of extracting solutions specified in  paragraph (b)(3)(i) (a) or (b) of this section, and reflux 30 minutes on  steam or water bath or hotplate. Fit into a buchner funnel a filter  paper of appropriate size (previously prepared by drying in flatbottom  dish for 2 hours in drying oven, covering, cooling in desiccator, and  weighing). Apply vacuum to buchner funnel and transfer contents of  beaker so as to avoid running over edge of paper. Aspirate to dryness  and wash   material on filter with 80 percent alcohol until washings are clear and  colorless. Transfer paper and alcohol-insoluble solids to drying dish  used to prepare paper, dry uncovered for 2 hours in drying oven, cover,  cool in desiccator, and weigh at once. From this weight deduct weight of  dish, cover, and paper. Calculate percent by weight of alcohol-insoluble  solids.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Brine flotation test. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Explanation--The brine flotation test  utilizes salt solutions of various specific gravities to separate the  peas according to maturity. The brine solutions are based on the  percentage by weight of pure salt (NaCl) in solution at 20 C. In making  the test the brine solutions are standardized to the proper specific  gravity equivalent to the specified ``percent of salt solutions at 20  C'' by using a salometer spindle accurately calibrated at 20 C. A 250  ml glass beaker or similar receptacle is filled with the brine solution  to a depth of approximately 50 mm. The brine solution and sample (100  peas per container) must be at the same temperature and should closely  approximate 20 C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Procedure--After carefully removing the skins from the peas,  place the peas into the solution. Pieces of peas and loose skins should  not be used in making the brine flotation test. If cotyledons divide,  use both cotyledons in the test and consider the two separated  cotyledons as 1 pea; and, if an odd cotyledon sinks, consider it as one  pea. Only peas that sink to the bottom of the receptacle within 10  seconds after immersion are counted as ``peas that sink''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the quality of the frozen peas falls below the standard  prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the  general statement of substandard quality specified in the Code of  Federal Regulations but in lieu of the words prescribed in the second  line of the rectangle the following words may be used where the frozen  peas fall below the standard in only one respect: ``Below standard in  quality ------'', the blank to be filled in with the specific reason for  substandard quality as listed in the standard.
