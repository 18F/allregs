                                Sec. 1494.401  Performance security.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement to establish performance security. Prior to the  submission of an offer to CCC in response to an Invitation, an eligible  exporter must establish performance security, in a form which is  acceptable to CCC, in order to guarantee the eligible exporter's  faithful performance of the Agreement. If CCC enters into an Agreement  with the eligible exporter, this performance security must remain in  effect until its cancellation or reduction is authorized by CCC pursuant  to paragraph (f) of this section. An offer made by an eligible exporter  will not be considered if   proof of the establishment of the performance security is not made  available to CCC by 3 p.m. on the date for which the offer is submitted  for consideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form of performance security. The performance security must be  acceptable to CCC and may be an irrevocable standby letter of credit, a  bond, or a certified or cashier's check. If a standby letter of credit  is furnished as performance security, the opening bank may be a U.S.  bank or a foreign bank. If the standby letter of credit is opened by a  foreign bank, it must be 100 percent confirmed by a U.S. bank. If a bond  is furnished as performance security, the surety(ies) must be among  those appearing on the list of approved sureties maintained by the U.S.  Department of the Treasury. If a cashier's or certified check is  furnished as performance security, the bank issuing the cashier's or  certified check must be a U.S. bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amount of performance security. The amount of the performance  security to be furnished to CCC in response to a particular Invitation  will depend upon whether the eligible exporter intends to select  ``Option A'' or ``Option B'' for the timing of the bonus payment. If the  eligible exporter furnishes performance security under ``Option A'' of  the applicable Invitation, the eligible exporter may request payment of  the bonus after export of the eligible commodity but before entry of the  commodity into the eligible country. If the eligible exporter furnishes  performance security under ``Option B'' of the applicable Invitation,  the eligible exporter may request payment of the bonus only after the  exported eligible commodity has entered into the eligible country. The  applicable Invitation will specify the exact amount of performance  security for the eligible commodity required under either ``Option A''  or ``Option B'' and the method and rate for determining liquidated  damages. After the exporter and CCC enter into an Agreement, the  exporter may request CCC to change the performance security option for  an entire Agreement from ``Option B'' to ``Option A'' and, if CCC agrees  to this change, the exporter will increase the performance security  amount to the level required by the applicable Invitation for ``Option  A''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional security. The exporter shall promptly furnish such  additional security as CCC may determine is necessary to protect CCC  under an Agreement if the surety(ies) or obligating bank:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Becomes unacceptable to the U.S. Government or CCC; and/or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fails to furnish reports on its financial condition as required  by the U.S. Government or CCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Right to funds under the performance security. If CCC enters  into an Agreement with an exporter under the EEP, CCC will have the  right to funds from the performance security established by the exporter  for such Agreement to recover:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount of any bonus paid to the exporter under the Agreement  if the exporter fails to perform in accordance with such Agreement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any funds owed by the exporter to CCC related to the specific  EEP Agreement for which the performance security was established,  including those for liquidated damages, discounts for late performance,  overpayments made by CCC, storage charges, or other damages or charges  as determined by CCC; and/or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any amounts or funds that could be owed by the exporter to CCC  in accordance with subparagraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this section for  unfulfilled obligations under the Agreement if the performance security  should expire prior to the exporter's fulfillment of these obligations.  Should the exporter fulfill these obligations, in accordance with the  Agreement, after CCC has drawn upon the performance security, CCC will  return the funds drawn to the exporter or other appropriate party, as  determined by CCC. CCC may return the performance security if it  determines that the exporter is not liable for any damages incurred by  CCC as a result of the exporter's failure to fulfill its obligations  under the Agreement and that the exporter will not retain any bonus  payment which was not earned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Cancellation or reduction of performance security. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CCC will  agree, upon   request by the exporter, to a cancellation of the performance security  established for an Agreement when CCC determines, on the basis of  evidence provided by the exporter or other evidence available to CCC,  that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The exporter has fully performed under the Agreement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The exporter has fully compensated CCC for all costs incurred  or damages suffered by CCC, unless CCC has determined to hold the  exporter harmless for such damages pursuant to Sec. 1494.801(d) as a  result of the exporter's nonperformance of the Agreement; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> It is no longer in the best interest of the EEP to require the  exporter to maintain the performance security, and the exporter submits  to CCC a written statement agreeing that all other terms and conditions  of the Agreement will remain unchanged pending final resolution of the  exporter's liabilities to CCC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To support a request for the cancellation of performance  security furnished in connection with an Agreement, the exporter must  provide to CCC evidence of the export of the eligible commodity as  provided by Sec. 1494.701(c), and the entry of the eligible commodity  into the eligible country or countries. The entry certification must be  in English or accompanied by a certified or other translation acceptable  to CCC. To show entry of the eligible commodity into the eligible  country, the exporter must furnish to CCC an original certification  signed by a duly authorized customs or port official of the eligible  country, by the eligible buyer, by an agent or representative of the  vessel or shipline which delivered the eligible commodity to the  eligible country, or by a private surveyor in the target country or  other documentation deemed acceptable by the GSM showing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the eligible commodity entered the eligible country;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The identification of the export carrier;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The quantity of the eligible commodity unloaded;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The kind, type, grade and/or class of the eligible commodity;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The date(s) and place(s) of unloading of the eligible commodity  in the eligible country.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the exporter makes multiple shipments against a sales  contract with an eligible buyer, CCC may agree to a proportional  reduction in the amount of the required performance security when the  exporter has furnished evidence that the exporter has performed under  the Agreement with respect to a particular shipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Upon the payment of liquidated damages by an exporter to CCC  under a specific Agreement or the determination by CCC, pursuant to  Sec. 1494.801(d), to hold the exporter harmless for the payment of  liquidated damages owed to CCC under a specific Agreement, CCC will  allow the exporter to cancel or reassign that portion of the performance  security opened for such specific Agreement that would relate to the  value of the liquidated damages.</p>
