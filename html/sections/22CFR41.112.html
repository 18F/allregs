                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Significance of period of validity of visa. The period of validity of a nonimmigrant visa is the period during which the alien may use it in making application for admission. The period of visa validity has no relation to the period of time the immigration authorities at a port of entry may authorize the alien to stay in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Validity of visa and number of applications for admission. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, a nonimmigrant visa shall have the validity prescribed in schedules provided to consular officers by the Department, reflecting insofar as practicable the reciprocal treatment accorded U.S. nationals, U.S. permanent residents, or aliens granted refugee status in the U.S. by the government of the country of which the alien is a national, permanent resident, refugee or stateless resident.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, a nonimmigrant visa shall have the validity prescribed in schedules provided to consular officers by the Department, reflecting insofar as practicable the reciprocal treatment accorded U.S. nationals, U.S. permanent residents, or aliens granted refugee status in the U.S. by the government of the country of which the alien is a national, permanent resident, refugee or stateless resident.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, United States nonimmigrant visas shall have a maximum validity period of 10 years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An unexpired visa is valid for application for admission even if the passport in which the visa is stamped has expired, provided the alien is also in possession of a valid passport issued by the authorities of the country of which the alien is a national.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limitation on validity. If warranted in an individual case, a consular officer may issue a nonimmigrant visa for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A period of validity that is less than that prescribed on a basis of reciprocity,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A number of applications for admission within the period of the validity of the visa that is less than that prescribed on a basis of reciprocity,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Application for admission at a specified port or at specified ports of entry, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use on and after a given date subsequent to the date of issuance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Automatic extension of validity at ports of entry.
