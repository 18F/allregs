In addition to information required by subpart B of  this part and by FCC Form 601, applications for an Unserved Area  authorization to operate a Cellular system must comply with all  applicable requirements set forth in part 1 of this chapter, including  the requirements specified in Sec. Sec. 1.913, 1.923, and 1.924, and  must include the information listed below. Geographical coordinates must  be correct to 1 second using the NAD 83 datum.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Exhibit I--Geographic Information System (GIS) map files.  Geographic Information System (GIS) map files must be submitted showing  the entire proposed CGSA, the new cell sites (transmitting antenna  locations), and the service area boundaries of additional and modified  cell sites that extend into Unserved Area being claimed as CGSA. See  Sec. 22.911. The FCC will specify the file format required for the GIS  map files, which are to be submitted electronically via the Universal  Licensing System (ULS).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exhibit II--Reduced-size PDF map.
