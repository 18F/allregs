Dogs and cats must have adequate air for breathing at all times when being transported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> During surface transportation, auxiliary ventilation, such as fans, blowers or air conditioning, must be used in any animal cargo space containing live dogs or cats when the ambient temperature within the animal cargo space reaches 85 [deg]F (29.5 [deg]C). Moreover, the ambient temperature

may not exceed 85 [deg]F (29.5 [deg]C) for a period of more than 4 hours; nor fall below 45 [deg]F (7.2 [deg]C) for a period of more than 4 hours.
