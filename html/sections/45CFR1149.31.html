reason for disqualification exists, including the time and circumstances of the discovery of such facts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The motion must be filed promptly after discovery of the grounds for disqualification or the objection will be deemed waived; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The party, or representative of record, must certify in writing that the motion is made in good faith.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Once a motion has been filed to disqualify the reviewing official or the ALJ, the ALJ will halt the proceedings until resolving the matter of disqualification. If the ALJ determines that the reviewing official is disqualified, the ALJ will dismiss the complaint without prejudice. If the ALJ disqualifies himself/herself, the case will be promptly reassigned to another ALJ. However, if the ALJ denies a motion to disqualify, the matter will be determined by the authority head only during his/her review of the initial decision on appeal.</p>
