                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Categories of fees. Fees will be charged according to the  Category of the FOIA request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Commercial use requests. The agency will assess charges to  recover the full direct cost of searching for, reviewing, and  duplicating the requested document. The agency may recover the cost of  searching for and reviewing records even if there is ultimately no  disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requests from educational and non-commercial scientific  institutions. The agency will charge for duplication costs. To qualify  for this category the requestor must show: (i) That requested records  are being sought under the auspices of a qualified institution as  defined in Sec. 1100.1 (e) or (f) of this part; (ii) the records are  not sought for commercial use; and (iii) the records are being sought in  furtherance of scholarly or scientific research of the institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Requests by representatives of the news media. The agency will  charge duplication costs for the requests in this category.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All other requests. All other requests shall be charged fees  which, recover the full reasonable cost for searching for and  duplicating the requested records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General fee schedule. The agency shall use the most efficient  and least costly method to comply with requests for documents made under  the FOIA. The agency will charge fees to recover all allowable direct  costs incurred. The agency may charge fees for searching for and  reviewing requested documents even if the documents are determined to be  exempt from disclosure or cannot be located. If search charges are  likely to exceed $25, the agency shall notify the requestor, unless the  requestor has indicated in advance the willingness to pay higher fees.  The following fees shall be charged in accordance with paragraph (a) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Searches--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Manual. The fee charged will be the salary rate(s)  (i.e.,   basic pay plus 16.1 percent) of the employee(s) conducting the search.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Computer. The fee charged will be the actual direct cost of  providing the service including the cost of operating the central  processing unit for the operating time that is directly attributed to  searching for records responsive to a request and the operator/ programmer salary apportionable to the search.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Review. The fee charged will equal the salary rate(s) (basic pay  plus 16.1 percent) of the employee(s) conducting the review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Duplication. Copies of documents photocopied on one-side of a  8\1/2\ x 11 inch sheet of paper will be provided at $.10 per page.  Photocopies on two sides of a single 8\1/2\ x 11 inch sheet of paper  will be provided at $.20 per page. For duplication of other materials,  the charge will be the direct cost of duplication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Restrictions on charging fees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except for documents provided  in response to a commercial use request, the first 100 pages of  duplication or the first two (2) hours of search time shall be provided  at no charge. For the purposes of this section, two (2) hours of search  time by computer entitles the requestor to two (2) hours of computer  operator salary translated into computer search costs. Computer search  costs consist of operator salary plus central proceeding unit operating  time costs for the duration of the search.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fees shall not be charged to any requestor, including commercial  use requestors, if the cost of collecting a fee would be equal to or  greater than the fee itself.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Waiver or reduction of fees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Documents shall be furnished  without charge or at reduced charge if disclosure of the information is  in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly  to public understanding of the operations or activities of the  government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the  requestor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following factors shall be used to determine whether a fee  will be waived or reduced:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The subject of the request. Whether the subject of the requested  records concerns ``the operations or activities of the government'';</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The informative value of the information to be disclosed.  Whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding  of government operations or activities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the  general public likely to result from disclosure. Whether disclosure of  the requested information will contribute to ``public understanding'';</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The significance of the contribution to public understanding.  Whether disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to public  understanding of government operations or activities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest. Whether  the requestor has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the  disclosure; and if so</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The primary interest in disclosure. Whether the magnitude of  the identified commercial interest of the requestor is sufficiently  large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that  disclosure is ``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Assessment and collection of fees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interest will accrue from  the date the bill is mailed if the fee is not paid within thirty (30)  days. Interest will be assessed at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C.  3717.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the agency reasonably believes that a requestor(s) is making  multiple requests to avoid the assessment of fees, the agency may  aggregate such requests and charge accordingly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The agency may request an advance payment of the fee if</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The allowable charges are likely to exceed $250; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The requestor has failed previously to pay a fee in a timely  fashion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the agency requests an advance payment, the time limits  prescribed in section (a)(6) of the Freedom of Information Act will  begin only after the agency has received full payment.</p>
