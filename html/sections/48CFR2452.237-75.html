As used in this clause--</p><p class="depth2">Access means physical entry into and, to the extent authorized, mobility within a Government facility.</p><p class="depth2">Contractor employee means an employee of the prime contractor or of any subcontractor, affiliate, partner, joint venture, or team members with which the contractor is associated. It also includes consultants engaged by any of those entities.</p><p class="depth2">Facility and Government facility mean buildings, including areas within buildings that are owned, leased, shared, occupied, or otherwise controlled by the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth2">NACI means National Agency Check with Inquiries, the minimum background investigation prescribed by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</p><p class="depth2">PIV Card means the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card, the Federal Government-issued identification credential (identification badge).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General. The performance of this contract requires contractor employees to have access to HUD facilities. All such employees who do not already possess a current PIV Card acceptable to HUD shall be required to provide personal background information, undergo a background investigation (NACI or other OPM-required or approved investigation), including an FBI National Criminal History Fingerprint Check, and obtain a PIV Card prior to being permitted access to any such facility in performance of this contract. HUD may accept a PIV Card issued by another Federal Government agency but shall not be required to do so. No contractor employee will be permitted access to a HUD facility without a proper PIV Card.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Background information. (1) For each contractor employee subject to the requirements of this clause and not in possession of a current PIV Card acceptable to HUD, the contractor shall submit the following properly completed forms: Standard Form (SF) 85, ``Questionnaire for Non-sensitive Positions,'' FD 258 (Fingerprint Chart), and a partial Optional Form (OF) 306 (Items 1, 2, 6, 8-13, 16, and 17).

After completion of the investigation, the GTR will notify the contractor in writing when any contractor employee is determined to be unsuitable for access to a Government facility. The contractor shall immediately remove such employee(s) from work on this contract that requires physical presence in a Government facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Affected contractor employees who have had a federal background investigation without a subsequent break in federal employment or federal contract service exceeding 2 years may be exempt from the investigation requirements of this clause subject to verification of the previous investigation.

HUD will revoke the PIV Card and the employee's access if the background investigation process (including adjudication of investigation results) for the employee has not been completed within 6 months after the issuance of the PIV Card.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> HUD will issue a PIV Card to each contractor employee who is to be given access to HUD facilities and who does not already possess a PIV Card acceptable to HUD (see paragraph (b) of this clause).
