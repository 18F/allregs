                                Sec. 233.29  How monthly reports are treated and what notices are required.

                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> What happens if a completed monthly report is received on time. When the agency receives a completed monthly report by the date specified in Sec. 233.28 it shall process the payment. The agency shall notify the recipient of any changes from the prior payment and the basis for its determinations. This notice must meet the requirements of Sec. 205.10(a)(4)(i)(B) of this chapter on adequate notice if the payment is being reduced or assistance is being terminated. This notice must be received by the recipient no later than his or her resulting payment or in lieu of the payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> What happens if the completed monthly report is received before the extension deadline. (1) If the completed monthly report is not received by the date specified in Sec. 233.28, the agency shall send a notice to the recipient. This notice shall inform him or her that the monthly report is overdue or is not complete and that he or she has at least 10 additional days to file. It must inform the recipient that termination may result if that is the agency's policy, if the report is not filed within the extension period. This notice must reach the recipient at least 10 days before the expected payment. However, in States in which the date specified in Sec. 233.28 is within 10 days of the expected payment date, the notice must reach the recipient on or before the expected payment date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When the report is received within the extension period, the agency may delay payment to the recipient, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In a State that pays within 25 days of the budget month the payment may be delayed 10 days;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In a State that pays within 25 to 45 days of the budget month, the payment may not be delayed beyond the 45th day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> What happens if a monthly report is not received by the end of the extension period. An agency may terminate assistance if it has not received a report

or has received an incomplete report, and the 10 day extension period has expired. If the State decides to terminate assistance, it must send the recipient a notice which meets the requirements of Sec. 205.10(a)(4)(i)(B) on adequate notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> How a recipient may delay an adverse action based on a monthly report. If a recipient's assistance is reduced or terminated based on information in the monthly report, and he or she requests a fair hearing within 10 days, the assistance payment shall be reinstated immediately at the previous month's level pending the hearing decision. The payment shall be made effective from the date assistance was reduced or terminated.
