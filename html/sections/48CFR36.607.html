The work should be described in any release only in general terms, unless information relating to the work is classified. If negotiations are terminated without awarding a contract to the highest rated firm, the contracting officer may release that information

and state that negotiations will be undertaken with another (named) architect-engineer firm. When an award has been made, the contracting officer may release award information, (see 5.401).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Debriefings of successful and unsuccessful firms will be held after final selection has taken place and will be conducted, to the extent practicable, in accordance with 15.503, 15.506(b) through (f), 15.507(c). Note that 15.506(d)(2) through (d)(5) do not apply to architect-engineer contracts.
