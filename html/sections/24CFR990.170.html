                                Sec. 990.170  Computation of utilities expense level (UEL): Overview.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The UEL for each PHA is based on its consumption for each utility, the applicable rates for each utility, and an applicable inflation factor. The UEL for a given funding period is the product of the utility rate multiplied by the payable consumption level multiplied by the inflation factor. The UEL is expressed in terms of PUM costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Utility rate. The utility rate for each type of utility will be the actual average rate from the most recent 12-month period that ended June 30th prior to the beginning of the applicable funding period. The rate will be calculated by dividing the actual utility cost by the actual utility consumption, with consideration for pass-through costs (e.g., state and local utility taxes, tariffs) for the time period specified in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Payable consumption level. The payable consumption level is based on the current consumption level adjusted by a utility consumption incentive. The incentive shall be computed by comparing current consumption levels of each utility to the rolling base consumption level. If the comparison reflects a decrease in the consumption of a utility, the PHA shall retain 75 percent of this decrease. Alternately, if the comparison reflects an increase in the consumption of a utility, the PHA shall absorb 75 percent of this increase.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Inflation factor for utilities. The UEL shall be adjusted annually by an inflation/deflation factor based upon the fuels and utilities component of the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). The annual adjustment to the UEL shall reflect the most recently published and localized data available from BLS at the time the annual adjustment is calculated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Increases in tenant utility allowances. Increases in tenant utility allowances, as a component of the formula income, as described in Sec. 990.195, shall result in a commensurate increase of operating subsidy. Decreases in such utility allowances shall result in a commensurate decrease in operating subsidy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Records and reporting. (1) Appropriate utility records, satisfactory to HUD, shall be developed and maintained, so that consumption and rate data can be determined.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appropriate utility records, satisfactory to HUD, shall be developed and maintained, so that consumption and rate data can be determined.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All records shall be kept by utility and by project for each 12-month period ending June 30th.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> HUD will notify each PHA when HUD has the automated systems capacity to receive such information. Each PHA then will be obligated to provide consumption and cost data to HUD for all utilities for each project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a PHA has not maintained or cannot recapture utility data from its records for a particular utility, the PHA shall compute the UEL by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Using actual consumption data for the last complete year(s) of available data or data of comparable project(s) that have comparable utility delivery systems and occupancy, in accordance with a method prescribed by HUD; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Requesting field office approval to use actual PUM utility expenses for its UEL in accordance with a method prescribed by HUD when the PHA cannot obtain necessary data to calculate the UEL in accordance with paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section.</p>
