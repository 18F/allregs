Section 808  currently provides that such equipment and supplies shall vest in the  criminal justice agency or nonprofit organization that purchased the  property if such agency or nonprofit certifies to the appropriate State  office (as indicated in the statute) that it will use the property for  criminal justice purposes, and further provides that, if such  certification is not made, title to the property shall vest in the State  office, which shall seek to have the property used for criminal justice  purposes elsewhere in the State prior to using it or disposing of it in  any other manner.</p><p class="depth0">PARTS 2801	2866 [RESERVED]</p>
