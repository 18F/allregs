                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses  under EAJA, the applicant must meet one of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicant must be a prevailing party to the adversary  adjudication for which it seeks an award; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicant must be a party to an adversary adjudication  arising from an agency action to enforce the party's compliance with a  statutory or regulatory requirement in which the demand by the agency  was substantially in excess of the decision of the adjudicative officer  and the demand is unreasonable when compared with such decision under  the facts and circumstances of the case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the criteria set out in paragraph (a) of this  section, a party seeking an award must be one of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth  of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business  interests, and not more than 500 employees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3))</em>  with not more than 500 employees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the  Agricultural Marketing Act (2 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500  employees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local  government, or organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million  and nor more than 500 employees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For purposes only of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a small  entity as defined in 5 U.S.C. 601.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of  employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the  adversary adjudication was initiated: Provided, that for purposes of  eligibility in proceedings covered by Sec. 1.183(a)(1)(ii) of this  part, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be  determined as of the date the applicant filed its appeal under 41 U.S.C.  606.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In interpreting the criteria set forth in paragraph (b) of this  section, the following apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be  considered as an ``individual'' rather than a ``sole owner of an  unincorporated business'' if the issues on which the applicant prevails  are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business  interests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly  perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the  applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included  on a proportional basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all  of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any  individual, corporation, or other entity that directly or indirectly  controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of  the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant  directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares  or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this  subpart, unless the adjudicative officer determines such treatment would  be unjust and contrary to the purposes of EAJA in light of the actual  relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the  adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships of the  applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute   special circumstances that would make an award unjust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on  behalf of one or more other person or entity that would be ineligible is  not itself eligible for an award.</p>
