                            <p class="depth0">The proceedings to enforce forfeiture of perishable goods shall be in the nature of a proceeding in rem in the district court of the United States for the district wherein such seizure is made. Whenever such property is liable to perish or become greatly reduced in price or value by keeping, or when it cannot be kept without great expense, the Director or his delegate shall advise the owner, when known, of the seizure thereof. The owner may apply to the Director or his delegate to have the property examined any time prior to referral of the property to the U.S. Marshal for disposition, and if in the opinion of the Director or his delegate it shall be necessary to sell such property to prevent waste or expense, the Director or his delegate shall cause the property to be appraised. Thereupon the owner shall have the property returned to him upon giving a corporate surety bond (see Sec. 72.24) in an amount equal to the appraised value of the property, which bond shall be conditioned to abide the final order, decree, or judgment of the court having cognizance of the case, and to pay the amount of the appraised value to the Director or his delegate, the U.S. Marshal, or otherwise, as may be ordered and directed by the court, which bond shall be filed by the Director or his delegate officer with the U.S. Attorney for the district in which the proceedings

may be commenced. If the owner of such property neglects or refuses to give such bond within a reasonable time considering the condition of the property the Director or his delegate shall request the U.S. Marshal to proceed to sell the property at public sale as soon as practicable and to pay the proceeds of sale, less reasonable costs of the seizure and sale, to the court to abide its final order, decree, or judgment.
