                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Using depositions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. At a hearing, all or part of  a deposition may be used against a party on these conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The party was present or represented at the taking of the  deposition or had reasonable notice of it;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It is used to the extent it would be admissible if the deponent  were present and testifying; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The use is allowed by Sec. 502.209(a)(2) through (7).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Impeachment and other uses. Any party may use a deposition to  contradict or impeach the testimony given by the deponent as a witness,  or for any other purpose allowed by Sec. 502.156 of subpart J of this  part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Deposition of party, representative, or designee. An adverse  party may use for any purpose the deposition of a party or anyone who,  when deposed, was the party's officer, director, managing  representative, or designee under Sec. 502.203(b)(6) or Sec.  502.204(a)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Unavailable witness. A party may use for any purpose the  deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, if the Commission or  presiding officer finds:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the witness is dead;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the witness cannot attend or testify because of age,  illness, infirmity, or imprisonment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That the party offering the deposition could not procure the  witness's attendance by subpoena; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> On motion and notice, that exceptional circumstances make it  desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the  importance of live testimony at a hearing, to permit the deposition to  be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Using part of a deposition. If a party offers in evidence only  part of a deposition, an adverse party may require the offeror to  introduce other parts that in fairness should be considered with the  part introduced, and any party may itself introduce any other parts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Substituting a party. Substituting a party does not affect the  right to use a deposition previously taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Deposition taken in an earlier action. A deposition lawfully  taken and, if required, filed in any Federal or State court action may  be used in a later action involving the same subject matter between the  same parties, or their representatives or successors in interest, to the  same extent as if taken in the later action. A deposition previously  taken may also be used as allowed by Sec. 502.156 of subpart J of this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> and  Sec. 502.209(d)(3), an objection may be made at a hearing to the  admission of any deposition testimony that would be inadmissible if the  witness were present and testifying.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Form of presentation. Unless the presiding officer orders  otherwise, a party must provide a transcript of any deposition testimony  the party offers, but may provide the presiding officer with the  testimony in nontranscript form as well.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Waiver of objections. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To the notice. An objection to an  error or irregularity in a deposition notice is waived unless promptly  served in writing on the party giving the notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To the officer's qualification. An objection based on  qualification of the officer before whom a deposition is to be taken is  waived if not made:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Before the deposition begins; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Promptly after the basis for disqualification becomes known or,  with reasonable diligence, could have been known.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To the taking of the deposition. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Objection to competence,  relevance, or materiality. An objection to a deponent's competence, or  to the competence, relevance, or materiality of testimony, is not waived  by a failure to make the objection before or during the deposition,  unless the ground for it might have been corrected at that time.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Objection to an error or irregularity. An objection to an error  or irregularity at an oral examination is waived if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> It relates to the manner of taking the deposition, the form of a  question or answer, the oath or affirmation, a party's conduct, or other  matters that might have been corrected at that time; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> It is not timely made during the deposition.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Objection to a written question. An objection to the form of a  written question under Sec. 502.204 of this subpart is waived if not  served in writing on the party submitting the question within the time  for serving responsive questions or, if the question is a recross- question, within 7 days after being served with it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To completing and returning the deposition. An objection to how  the officer transcribed the testimony, or prepared, signed, certified,  sealed, endorsed, sent, or otherwise dealt with the deposition, is  waived unless a motion to suppress is made promptly after the error or  irregularity becomes known or, with reasonable diligence, could have  been known.
