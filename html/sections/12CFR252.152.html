Subject to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a foreign banking organization will remain subject to the applicable requirements of this subpart until its reported combined U.S. assets on the FR Y-7Q are below $50 billion for each of four consecutive calendar quarters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Intermediate holding company requirement.
