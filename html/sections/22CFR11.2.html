                            <p class="depth0">The Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service has established the following rules regarding the written examination:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When and where given. The written examination will be given annually or semiannually, if required, in designated cities in the United States and at Foreign Service posts on dates established by the Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service. Applicants must indicate in their applications whether they are applying for the Department of State or for the U.S. Information Agency. Candidates who pass the written examination successfully may request a transfer of their applications to the other agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Designation to take written examination. No person will be permitted to take a written examination for appointment as a Foreign Service officer

or Foreign Service information officer who has not been specifically designated by the Board of Examiners to take that particular examination. Prior to each written examination, the Board will establish a closing date for the receipt of applications for designation to take the examination. No person will be designated for the examination who has not, as of that closing date, filed an application with the Board. To be designated for the written examination, a candidate, as of the date of the examination, must be a citizen of the United States and shall be at least 21 years of age, except that an applicant who has been awarded a bachelor's degree by a college or university, or has successfully completed the junior year at a college or university, may qualify if at least 20 years of age.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Content. The written examination is designed to permit the Board to test the candidate's intelligence, breadth and quality of knowledge, and understanding. It will consist of three parts: (1) A general ability test, (2) an English expression test, and (3) a general background test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Grading. The several parts of the written examination are weighted in accordance with the rules established by the Board of Examiners.
