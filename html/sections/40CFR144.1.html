An UIC program is necessary in any  State listed by EPA under section 1422 of the SDWA. Because all States  have been listed, the SDWA requires all States to submit an UIC program  within 270 days after July 24, 1980, the effective date of 40 CFR part  146, which was the final element of the UIC minimum requirements to be  originally promulgated, unless the Administrator grants an extension,  which can be for a period not to exceed an additional 270 days. If a  State fails to submit an approvable program, EPA will establish a  program for that State. Once a program is established, SDWA provides  that all underground injections in listed States are unlawful and  subject to penalties unless authorized by a permit or a rule. This part  sets forth the requirements governing all UIC programs, authorizations  by permit or rule and prohibits certain types of injection. The  technical regulations governing these authorizations appear in 40 CFR  part 146.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Structure of the UIC program--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Part 144. This part sets forth  the permitting and other program requirements that must be met by UIC  Programs, whether run by a State or by EPA. It is divided into the  following subparts:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Subpart A describes general elements of the program, including  definitions and classifications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Subpart B sets forth the general program requirements,  including the performance standards applicable to all injection  activities, basic elements that all UIC programs must contain, and  provisions for waiving permit of rule requirements under certain  circumstances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Subpart C sets forth requirements for wells authorized by  rule.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Subpart D sets forth permitting procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Subpart E sets forth specific conditions, or types of  conditions, that must at a minimum be included in all permits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Subpart F sets forth the financial responsibility requirements  for owners and operators of all existing and new Class I hazardous waste  injection wells.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Subpart G of this part sets forth requirements for owners and  operators of Class V injection wells.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Subpart H of part 146 sets forth requirements for owners or  operators of Class VI injection wells.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Part 145. While part 144 sets forth minimum requirements for all  UIC Programs, these requirements are specifically identified as elements  of a State application for primacy to administer an UIC Program in part  145. Part 145 also sets forth the necessary elements of a State  submission and the procedural requirements for approval of State  programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Part 124. The public participation requirements that must be met  by UIC Programs, whether administered by the State or by EPA, are set  forth in part 124. EPA must comply with all part 124 requirements; State  administered programs must comply with part 124 as required by part 145.  These requirements carry out the purposes of the public participation  requirement of 40 CFR part 25 (Public Participation), and supersede the  requirements of that part as they apply to the UIC Program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Part 146. This part sets forth the technical criteria and  standards that must be met in permits and authorizations by rule as  required by part 144.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Scope of the permit or rule requirement. The UIC permit program  regulates underground injection by six classes of wells (see definition  of ``well injection,'' Sec.  144.3). The six classes of wells are set  forth in Sec.  144.6. All owners or operators of these injection wells  must be authorized either by permit or rule by the Director. In carrying  out the mandate of the SDWA, this subpart provides that no injection  shall be authorized by permit or rule if it results in the movement of  fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking  water (USDWs--see Sec.  144.3 for definition), if the presence of that  contaminant may cause a violation of any primary drinking water  regulation under 40 CFR part 141 or may adversely affect the health of  persons (Sec.  144.12). Existing Class IV wells which inject hazardous  waste directly into an underground source of drinking water are to be  eliminated over a period of six months and new such Class IV wells are  to be prohibited (Sec.  144.13). For Class V wells, if remedial action  appears necessary, a permit may be required (Sec.  144.25) or the  Director must require remedial action or closure by order (Sec.   144.6(c)). During UIC program development, the Director may identify  aquifers and portions of aquifers which are actual or potential sources  of drinking water. This will provide an aid to the Director in carrying  out his or her duty to protect all USDWs. An aquifer is a USDW if it  fits the definition under Sec.  144.3, even if it has not been  ``identified.'' The Director may also designate ``exempted aquifers''  using the criteria in 40 CFR 146.4 of this chapter. Such aquifers are  those which would otherwise qualify as ``underground sources of drinking  water'' to be protected, but which have no real potential to be used as  drinking water sources. Therefore, they are not USDWs. No aquifer is an  exempted aquifer until it has been affirmatively designated under the  procedures at Sec.  144.7. Aquifers which do not fit the definition of  ``underground source of drinking water'' are not ``exempted aquifers.''  They are simply not subject to the special protection afforded USDWs.  During initial Class VI program development, the Director shall not  expand the areal extent of an existing Class II enhanced oil recovery or  enhanced gas recovery aquifer exemption for Class VI injection wells and  EPA shall not approve a program that applies for aquifer exemption  expansions of Class II-Class VI exemptions as   part of the program description. All Class II to Class VI aquifer  exemption expansions previously issued by EPA must be incorporated into  the Class VI program descriptions pursuant to requirements at Sec.   145.23(f)(9).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specific inclusions. The following wells are included among  those types of injection activities which are covered by the UIC  regulations. (This list is not intended to be exclusive but is for  clarification only.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any injection well located on a drilling platform inside the  State's territorial waters.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any dug hole or well that is deeper than its largest surface  dimension, where the principal function of the hole is emplacement of  fluids.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any well used by generators of hazardous waste, or by owners  or operators of hazardous waste management facilities, to dispose of  fluids containing hazardous waste. This includes the disposal of  hazardous waste into what would otherwise be septic systems and  cesspools, regardless of their capacity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any septic tank, cesspool, or other well used by a multiple  dwelling, community, or Regional system for the injection of wastes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specific exclusions. The following are not covered by these  regulations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Injection wells located on a drilling platform or other site  that is beyond the State's territorial waters.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Individual or single family residential waste disposal systems  such as domestic cesspools or septic systems.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Non-residential cesspools, septic systems or similar waste  disposal systems if such systems (A) Are used solely for the disposal of  sanitary waste, and (B) have the capacity to serve fewer than 20 persons  a day.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Injection wells used for injection of hydrocarbons which are of  pipeline quality and are gases at standard temperature and pressure for  the purpose of storage.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any dug hole, drilled hole, or bored shaft which is not used for  the subsurface emplacement of fluids.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The prohibition applicable to Class IV wells under Sec.  144.13  does not apply to injections of hazardous wastes into aquifers or  portions thereof which have been exempted pursuant to Sec.  146.04.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Interim Status under RCRA for Class I Hazardous Waste Injection  Wells. The minimum national standards which define acceptable injection  of hazardous waste during the period of interim status under RCRA are  set out in the applicable provisions of this part, parts 146 and 147,  and Sec.  265.430 of this chapter. The issuance of a UIC permit does not  automatically terminate RCRA interim status. A Class I well's interim  status does, however, automatically terminate upon issuance to that well  of a RCRA permit, or upon the well's receiving a RCRA permit-by-rule  under Sec.  270.60(b) of this chapter. Thus, until a Class I well  injecting hazardous waste receives a RCRA permit or RCRA permit-by-rule,  the well's interim status requirements are the applicable requirements  imposed pursuant to this part and parts 146, 147, and 265 of this  chapter, including any requirements imposed in the UIC permit.
