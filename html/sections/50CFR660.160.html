A C/P coop must comply with the provisions of this section. The C/P coop, member limited entry permit owners, and owners and operators of vessels registered to member limited entry permits, are jointly and severally responsible for compliance with the provisions of this section. Pursuant to 15 CFR part 904, each C/P coop, member permit owner, and owner and operator of a vessel registered to a coop member permit may be charged jointly and severally for violations of the provisions of this section. For purposes of enforcement, a C/P coop is a legal entity that can be subject to NOAA enforcement action for violations of the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> C/P Coop Program species and allocations--(1) C/P Coop Program species. C/P Coop Program species are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> C/P Coop Program species. C/P Coop Program species are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Species with formal allocations to the C/P Coop Program are Pacific whiting, canary rockfish, darkblotched rockfish, Pacific Ocean perch, widow rockfish;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Species with set-asides for the MS and C/P Programs combined, as described in Table 1d and 2d, subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> C/P Coop Program annual allocations. The C/P Coop Program allocation of Pacific whiting is equal to the catcher/processor sector allocation. Only a single coop may be formed in the catcher/processor sector with the one permitted coop receiving the catcher/processor sector allocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In years where the Pacific whiting harvest specification is known by the start of the catcher/processor sector primary whiting season specified at Sec. 660.131(b)(2)(iii)(A), allocation for Pacific whiting will be made by the start of the season.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In years where the Pacific whiting harvest specification is not known by the start of the catcher/processor sector primary whiting season specified at Sec. 660.131(b)(2)(iii)(A), NMFS will issue Pacific whiting allocations in two parts. Before the start of the primary whiting season, NMFS will allocate Pacific whiting based on the C/P Coop Program allocation percent multiplied by the lower end of the range of potential harvest specifications for Pacific whiting for that year. After the final

Pacific whiting harvest specifications are established, NMFS will allocate any additional amounts of Pacific whiting to the C/P Coop Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Non-whiting groundfish species--(i) Non-whiting groundfish species with a catcher/processor sector allocation are established in accordance with regulation at Sec. 660.55(i). The pounds associated with each species will be provided when the coop permit is issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Non-whiting groundfish species with a catcher/processor sector allocation are established in accordance with regulation at Sec. 660.55(i). The pounds associated with each species will be provided when the coop permit is issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In years where the groundfish harvest specifications are known by the start of the catcher/processor sector primary whiting season specified at Sec. 660.131(b)(2)(iii)(A), allocation of non-whiting groundfish species with an allocation will be made by the start of the season.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In years where the groundfish harvest specifications are not known by the start of the catcher/processor sector primary whiting season specified at Sec. 660.131(b)(2)(iii)(A), NMFS will issue allocations for non-whiting groundfish species with an allocation in two parts. Before the start of the primary whiting season, NMFS will allocate non-whiting groundfish species with an allocation based on the C/P Coop Program allocation percent multiplied by the lower end of the range of potential harvest specifications for those species for that year. After the final groundfish harvest specifications are established, NMFS will allocate any additional amounts of non-whiting groundfish species with an allocation to the C/P Coop Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Groundfish species with at-sea sector set-asides will be managed on an annual basis unless there is a risk of a harvest specification being exceeded, unforeseen impact on another fisheries, or conservation concerns in which case inseason action may be taken. Set asides may be adjusted through the biennial specifications and management measures process as necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Groundfish species not addressed under paragraph (i) or (ii) above, will be managed on an annual basis unless there is a risk of a harvest specification being exceeded, unforeseen impact on another fisheries, or conservation concerns in which case inseason action may be taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Halibut set-asides. Annually a specified amount of the Pacific halibut will be held in reserve as a shared set-aside for bycatch in the at-sea Pacific whiting fisheries and the shorebased trawl sector south of 40[deg]10[min] N lat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Non-whiting groundfish species reapportionment. The Regional Administrator may make available for harvest to the mothership sector of the Pacific whiting fishery, the amounts of the catcher/processor sector's non-whiting catch allocation remaining when the catcher/processor sector reaches its Pacific whiting allocation or participants in the catcher/processor sector do not intend to harvest the remaining sector allocation. If participants in the sector do not intend to harvest the sector's remaining allocation, the designated coop manager must submit a cease fishing report to NMFS indicating that harvesting has concluded for the year. At any time after greater than 80 percent of the catcher/processor sector Pacific whiting allocation has been harvested, the Regional Administrator may contact the designated coop manager to determine whether they intend to continue fishing. When considering redistribution of non-whiting catch allocation, the Regional Administrator will take into consideration the best available data on total projected fishing impacts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Reaching the catcher/processor sector allocation. When the catcher/processor sector allocation of Pacific whiting or non-whiting groundfish catch allocation is reached or is projected to be reached, further taking and retaining, receiving, or at-sea processing by a catcher/processor is prohibited. No additional unprocessed groundfish may be brought on board after at-sea processing is prohibited, but a catcher/processor may continue to process catch that was on board before at-sea processing was prohibited. The catcher/processor sector will close when the allocation of any one species is reached or projected to be reached.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Announcements. The Regional Administrator will announce in the Federal Register when the catcher/processor sector allocation of Pacific whiting or non-whiting groundfish with an allocation is reached, or is projected to be reached, and specify the appropriate action. In order to prevent exceeding

an allocation and to avoid underutilizing the resource, prohibitions against further taking and retaining, receiving, or at-sea processing of Pacific whiting, or reapportionment of non-whiting groundfish with allocations may be made effective immediately by actual notice to fishers and processors, by e-mail, Internet (http://www.nwr.noaa.gov/Groundfish-Halibut/Groundfish-Fishery-Management/Whiting-Management/index.cfm), phone, fax, letter, press release, and/or USCG Notice to Mariners (monitor channel 16 VHF), followed by publication in the Federal Register, in which instance public comment will be sought for a reasonable period of time thereafter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> C/P coop permit and agreement--(1) Eligibility and registration--(i) Eligibility. To be an eligible coop entity a group of C/P-endorsed permit owners (coop members) must be a recognized entity under the laws of the United States or the laws of a State and that represents all of the coop members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Eligibility and registration--(i) Eligibility.

Each year, the coop entity must submit a complete application to NMFS for a C/P coop permit. The application must be submitted to NMFS by between February 1 and March 31 of the year in which it intends to participate. NMFS will not consider any applications received after March 31. A C/P coop permit expires on December 31 of the year in which it was issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Application for a C/P coop permit. The designated coop manager, on behalf of the coop entity, must submit a complete application form and include each of the items listed in paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. Only complete applications will be considered for issuance of a C/P coop permit. An application will not be considered complete if any required application fees and annual coop reports have not been received by NMFS. NMFS may request additional supplemental documentation as necessary to make a determination of whether to approve or disapprove the application. Application forms and instruction are available on the NMFS NWR Web site (http://www.nwr.noaa.gov) or by request from NMFS. The designated coop manager must sign the application acknowledging the responsibilities of a designated coop manager defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Coop agreement. Signed copies of the coop agreement must be submitted to NMFS before the coop is authorized to engage in fishing activities. A coop agreement must include all of the information listed in this paragraph to be considered a complete coop agreement. NMFS will only review complete coop agreements. A coop agreement will not be accepted unless it includes all of the required information; the descriptive items listed in this paragraph appear to meet the stated purpose; and information submitted is correct and accurate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Coop agreement contents. The coop agreement must be signed by the coop members (C/P-endorsed permit owners) and include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A list of all vessels registered to C/P-endorsed permits that the member permit owners intend to use for fishing under the C/P coop permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All C/P-endorsed limited entry member permits identified by permit number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A description of the coop's plan to adequately monitor and account for the catch of Pacific whiting and non-whiting groundfish allocations, and to monitor and account for the catch of prohibited species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A clause stating that if a permit is registered to a new permit owner during the effective period of the coop agreement, any new owners of that member permit would be coop members and are required to comply with membership restrictions in the coop agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A description of the coop's enforcement and penalty provisions adequate to maintain catch of Pacific whiting and non-whiting groundfish within the allocations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A description of measures to reduce catch of overfished species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> A clause describing how the annual report will be produced to document the coop's catch, bycatch data, and any other significant activities undertaken by the coop during the year, and the submission deadlines for that report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Identification of the designated coop manager.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Acceptance of a coop agreement--(1) If NMFS does not accept the coop agreement, the coop permit application will be returned to the applicant with a letter stating the reasons the coop agreement was not accepted by NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Coop agreements that are not accepted may be resubmitted for review by sufficiently addressing the deficiencies identified in the NMFS letter and resubmitting the entire coop permit application by the date specified in the NMFS letter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An accepted coop agreement that was submitted with the C/P coop permit application and for which a C/P coop permit was issued will remain in place through the end of the calendar year. The designated coop manager must resubmit a complete coop agreement to NMFS consistent with the coop agreement contents described in this paragraph if there is a material change to the coop agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Within 7 calendar days following a material change, the designated coop manager must notify NMFS of the material change. Within 30 calendar days, the designated coop manger must submit to NMFS the revised coop agreement with a letter that describes such changes. NMFS will review the material changes and provide a letter to the coop manager that either accepts the changes as given or does not accept the revised coop agreement with a letter stating the reasons that it was not accepted by NMFS. The coop may resubmit the coop agreement with further revisions to the material changes responding to NMFS concerns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Effective date of C/P coop permit. A C/P coop permit will be effective on the date approved by NMFS and will allow fishing from the start of the C/P sector primary whiting season until the end of the calendar year or until one or more of the following events occur, whichever comes first:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> NMFS closes the C/P sector fishing season for the year or the designated coop manager notifies NMFS that the coop has completed fishing for the calendar year,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The C/P coop has reached its Pacific whiting allocation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A material change to the coop agreement has occurred and the designated coop manager failed to notify NMFS within 7 calendar days of the material change and submit to NMFS the revised coop agreement with a letter that describes such changes within 30 calendar days, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> NMFS has determined that a coop failure occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Initial administrative determination. For all complete applications, NMFS will issue an IAD that either approves or disapproves the application. If approved, the IAD will include a C/P coop permit. If disapproved, the IAD will provide the reasons for this determination. The IAD for a C/P coop permit follows the same requirement as specified for limited entry permits at Sec. 660.25(g)(4)(ii), if the applicant does not appeal the IAD within the 30 calendar days, the IAD becomes the final decision of the Regional Administrator acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Appeals. An appeal to a C/P coop permit action follows the same process as the general permit appeals process defined at Sec. 660.25(g), subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fees. The Regional Administrator is authorized to charge fees for administrative costs associated with the issuance of a C/P coop permit consistent with the provisions given at Sec. 660.25(f), subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> C/P-endorsed permit--(1) General. Any vessel participating in the C/P sector of the non-tribal primary Pacific whiting fishery during the season described at Sec. 660.131(b) of this subpart must be registered to a valid limited entry permit with a C/P endorsement. A C/P-endorsed permit is a limited entry permit and is subject to the limited entry permit provisions given at Sec. 660.25(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. Any vessel participating in the C/P sector of the non-tribal primary Pacific whiting fishery during the season described at Sec. 660.131(b) of this subpart must be registered to a valid limited entry permit with a C/P endorsement. A C/P-endorsed permit is a limited entry permit and is subject to the limited entry permit provisions given at Sec. 660.25(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Non-severable. A C/P endorsement is not severable from the limited entry trawl permit, and therefore, the endorsement may not be registered to another permit owner or to another vessel separately from the limited entry trawl permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Restriction on C/P vessel operating as a catcher vessel in the mothership sector. A vessel registered to a C/P-endorsed permit cannot operate as a catcher vessel delivering unprocessed Pacific whiting to a mothership processor during the same calendar year it participates in the C/P sector.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Restriction on C/P vessel operating as mothership. A vessel registered to a C/P-endorsed permit cannot operate as a mothership during the same calendar year it participates in the C/P sector.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Renewal, change in permit ownership, vessel registration, or combination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Renewal. A C/P-endorsed permit must be renewed annually consistent with the limited entry permit regulations given at Sec. 660.25(b)(4). If a vessel registered to the C/P-endorsed permit will operate as a mothership in the year for which the permit is renewed, the permit owner must make a declaration as part of the permit renewal that while participating in the whiting fishery they will operate solely as a mothership during the calendar year to which its limited entry permit applies. Any such declaration is binding on the vessel for the calendar year, even if the permit is registered to a different permit owner during the year, unless it is rescinded in response to a written request from the permit owner. Any request to rescind a declaration must be made by the permit owner and granted in writing by the Regional Administrator before any unprocessed whiting has been taken on board the vessel that calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Change of permit ownership. A C/P-endorsed permit is subject to the limited entry permit change in permit ownership regulations given at Sec. 660.25(b)(4), subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Change of vessel registration. A C/P-endorsed permit is subject to the limited entry permit change of vessel registration regulations given at Sec. 660.25(b)(4), subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Combination. If two or more permits are combined, the resulting permit is one permit with an increased size endorsement. A C/P-endorsed permit that is combined with another limited entry trawl-endorsed permit that does not have a C/P endorsement will result in a single trawl limited entry permit with a C/P endorsement with a larger size endorsement. Any request to combine permits is subject to the provisions provided at Sec. 660.25(b), including the combination formula for resulting size endorsements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Appeals. An appeal to a C/P-endorsed permit action follows the same process as the general permit appeals process defined at Sec. 660.25(g), subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fees. The Regional Administrator is authorized to charge fees for the administrative costs associated with review and issuance of a C/P endorsement consistent with the provisions at Sec. 660.25(f), subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Cost recovery. The owner of a vessel registered to a C/P-endorsed limited entry trawl permit, the operator of a vessel registered to a C/P-endorsed limited entry trawl permit, and the owner of the C/P-endorsed limited entry trawl permit registered to that vessel, are considered both the fish buyer and the fish seller as defined at Sec. 660.111, and must comply with the cost recovery program specified at Sec. 660.115.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Retention requirements. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Observer requirements--(1) Observer coverage requirements--(i) Coverage. The following observer coverage pertains to certified observers obtained from an observer provider permitted by NMFS. Any vessel registered to a C/P-endorsed limited entry trawl permit that is 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA or longer must carry two certified observers, and any vessel registered to a C/P-endorsed limited entry trawl permit that is shorter than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA must carry one certified observer, each day that the vessel is used to take, retain, receive, land, process, or transport groundfish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Observer coverage requirements--(i) Coverage.
