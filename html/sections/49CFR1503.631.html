                                Sec.  1503.631  Interlocutory appeals.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, a party may not appeal a ruling or decision of the ALJ to the TSA decision maker until the initial decision has been entered on the record. A decision or order of the TSA decision maker on the interlocutory appeal does not constitute a final order of the Administrator for the purposes of judicial appellate review under 49 U.S.C. 46110.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interlocutory appeal for cause. If a party files a written request for an interlocutory appeal for cause with the ALJ, or orally requests an interlocutory appeal for cause, the proceedings are stayed until the ALJ issues a decision on the request. If the ALJ grants the request, the proceedings are stayed until the TSA decision maker issues a decision on the interlocutory appeal. The ALJ must grant an interlocutory appeal for cause if a party shows that delay of the appeal would be detrimental to the public interest or would result in undue prejudice to any party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interlocutory appeals of right. If a party notifies the ALJ of an interlocutory appeal of right, the proceedings are stayed until the TSA decision maker issues a decision on the interlocutory appeal. A party may file an interlocutory appeal, without the consent of the ALJ, before an initial decision has been entered in the following cases:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A ruling or order by the ALJ barring a person from the proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failure of the ALJ to dismiss the proceedings in accordance with Sec.  1503.623.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A ruling or order by the ALJ in violation of Sec.  1503.607(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A ruling or order by the ALJ regarding public access to a particular docket or documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedure. Not later than 10 days after the ALJ's decision forming the basis of an interlocutory appeal of right or not later than 10 days after the ALJ's decision granting an interlocutory appeal for cause, a party must file a notice of interlocutory appeal, with supporting documents, and the party must serve a copy of the notice and supporting documents on each party. Not later than 10 days after service of the appeal brief, a party must file a

reply brief, if any, and the party must serve a copy of the reply brief on each party. The TSA decision maker must render a decision on the interlocutory appeal, on the record and as a part of the decision in the proceedings, within a reasonable time after receipt of the interlocutory appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Frivolous appeals. The TSA decision maker may reject frivolous, repetitive, or dilatory appeals, and may issue an order precluding one or more parties from making further interlocutory appeals in a proceeding in which there have been frivolous, repetitive, or dilatory interlocutory appeals.
