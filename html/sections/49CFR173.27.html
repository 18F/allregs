                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The requirements of this section are in addition to requirements prescribed elsewhere under this part and apply to packages offered or intended for transportation aboard aircraft. Except for materials not subject to performance packaging requirements in subpart E of this part, a packaging

containing a Packing Group III material with a primary or subsidiary risk of Division 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1, or Class 8 must meet the Packing Group II performance level when offered for transportation by aircraft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Packages authorized onboard aircraft.

(1) Packagings must be designed and constructed to prevent leakage that may be caused by changes in altitude and temperature during transportation aboard aircraft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Packagings must be designed and constructed to prevent leakage that may be caused by changes in altitude and temperature during transportation aboard aircraft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Packagings for which retention of liquid is a basic function must be capable of withstanding without leakage the greater of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An internal pressure which produces a gauge pressure of not less than 75 kPa (11 psig) for liquids in Packing Group III of Class 3 or Division 6.1; or 95 kPa (14 psig) for other liquids; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A pressure related to the vapor pressure of the liquid to be conveyed, determined by one of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The total gauge pressure measured in the receptacle (i.e., the vapor pressure of the material and the partial pressure of air or other inert gases, less 100 kPa (15 psia)) at 55 C (131 F), multiplied by a safety factor of 1.5; determined on the basis of a filling temperature of 15 C (59 F) and a degree of filling such that the receptacle is not completely liquid full at a temperature of 55 C (131 F) or less;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> 1.75 times the vapor pressure at 50 C (122 F) less 100 kPa (15 psia); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> 1.5 times the vapor pressure at 55 C (131 ) less 100 kPa (15 psia).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Hazardous materials may be contained in an inner packaging which does not itself meet the pressure requirement provided that the inner packaging is packed within a supplementary packaging which does meet the pressure requirement and other applicable packaging requirements of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Packagings which are subject to the hydrostatic pressure test and marking requirements of Secs. 178.605 and 178.503(a)(5), respectively, of this subchapter must have a marked test pressure of not less than 250 kPa (36 psig) for liquids in Packing Group I, 80 kPa (12 psig) for liquids in Packing Group III of Class 3 or Division 6.1, and 100 kPa (15 psig) for other liquids.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Closures. The body and closure of any packaging must be constructed to be able to adequately resist the effects of temperature and vibration occurring in conditions normally incident to air transportation. Inner packaging or receptacle closures of combination packages containing liquids must be held securely, tightly and effectively in place by secondary means. Examples of such secondary methods include: Adhesive tape, friction sleeves, welding or soldering, locking wires, locking rings, induction heat seals, and child-resistant closures. The closure device must be designed so that it is unlikely that it can be incorrectly or incompletely closed. Closures must be as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Packing Group I. An inner packaging containing liquids of Packing Group I must have a secondary means of closure applied and packed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Packing Groups II and III. When a secondary means of closure cannot be applied or is impracticable to apply to an inner packaging containing liquids

of Packing Groups II and III, this requirement may be satisfied by securely closing the inner packaging and placing it in a leakproof liner or bag before placing the inner packaging in its outer packaging.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Absorbent materials. Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, Packing Group I liquid hazardous materials of Classes 3, 4, or 8, or Divisions 5.1 or 6.1 that are packaged in combination packagings and offered for air transport in glass, earthenware, plastic, or metal inner packagings must be packed using absorbent material as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Inner packagings must be packed in a rigid and leakproof receptacle or intermediate packaging containing sufficient absorbent material to absorb the entire contents of the inner packaging before packing the inner packaging in its outer package.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Absorbent material must not react dangerously with the liquid (see Secs. 173.24 and 173.24a.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Combination packagings--(1) Excepted quantities. For authorized materials and inner and outer package quantity limits for combination packages of excepted quantities intended for transportation by aircraft, see Sec. 173.4a of this part. Unless otherwise specified in this part, or in Subpart C of part 171 of this subchapter, when combination packagings are intended for transportation aboard an aircraft, inner packagings must conform to the quantity limitations set forth in table 1 of this paragraph for transport aboard passenger-carrying aircraft and table 2 of this paragraph for transport aboard cargo-only aircraft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Excepted quantities.

(i) Unless otherwise specified in this part, or in subpart C of part 171 of this subchapter, when a limited quantity of hazardous material packaged in a combination packaging is intended for transportation aboard an aircraft, the inner and outer packagings must conform to the quantity limitations set forth in Table 3 of this paragraph. Substances and articles must be authorized for transportation aboard a passenger-carrying aircraft (see Column (9A) of the Sec. 172.101 Hazardous Materials Table of this subchapter). As such, not all unauthorized substances or articles may be indicated in this section.
