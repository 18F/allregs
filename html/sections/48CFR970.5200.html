                            <p class="depth0">This subpart prescribes some of the solicitation provisions and  contract clauses for use in management and operating contracts. The  provisions and clauses contained in this subpart supplement the  provisions and clauses prescribed in the FAR and in other parts of the  DEAR (48 CFR 901 through 48 CFR 952), and, pursuant to the individual  provision or clause prescription, are to be used in addition to or in  place of such clauses. Management and operating contracts are hybrid  contracts, in some cases including aspects of several FAR contract  types, for example, supplies and construction. For some FAR solicitation  provisions and contract clauses, this subpart prescribes their use  despite the hybrid nature of the work required. To assist Departmental  contracting personnel in determining the applicability of FAR and DEAR  clauses to management and operating contracts, additional guidance is  published and made available by the Office of Procurement and Assistance  Policy, within the Headquarters procurement organization.</p>
