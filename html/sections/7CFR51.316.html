                            <p class="depth0">``Injury'' means any specific defect defined in this section or an  equally objectionable variation of any one of these defects, any other  defect, or any combination of defects, which more than slightly detract  from the appearance or the edible or shipping quality of the apple. In  addition, specific defect measurements are based on an apple three  inches in diameter. Corresponding smaller or larger areas would be  allowed on smaller or larger fruit. Any reference to ``inch'' or  ``inches in diameter'' refers to that of a circle of the specified  diameter. Any reference to ``aggregate area,'' ``total area,'' or  ``aggregate affected area'' means the gathering together of separate  areas into one mass for the purpose of comparison to determine the  extent affected. The following specific defects shall be considered as  injury:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Russeting in the stem cavity or calyx basin which cannot be seen  when the apple is placed stem end or calyx end down on a flat surface  shall not be considered in determining whether an apple is injured by  russeting. Smooth net-like russeting outside of the stem cavity or calyx  basin shall be considered as injury when an aggregate area of more than  10 percent of the surface is covered, and the color of the russeting  shows no very pronounced contrast with the background color of the  apple, or lesser amounts of more conspicuous net-like russeting when the  appearance is affected to a greater extent than the amount permitted  above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Sunburn or sprayburn, when the discolored area does not blend  into the normal color of the fruit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Dark brown or black limb rubs which affect a total area of more  than one-fourth inch in diameter, except that light brown limb rubs of a  russet character shall be considered under the definition of injury by  russeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Hail marks, drought spots, other similar depressions or scars:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When the skin is broken, whether healed or unhealed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When there is appreciable discoloration of the surface;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When any surface indentation exceeds one-sixteenth inch in  depth;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When any surface indentation exceeds one-eighth inch in  diameter; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> When the aggregate affected area of such spots exceeds one-half  inch in diameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Bruises which are not slight and incident to proper handling and  packing, and which are greater than:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> \1/8\ inch in depth;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> \5/8\ inch in diameter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> any combination of lesser bruises which detract from the  appearance or edible quality of the apple to an extent   greater than any one bruise described in paragraphs (e)(1) or (2) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Brown surface discoloration when caused by delayed sunburn,  surface scald, or any other means and affects an area greater than \1/4\  inch in diameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Disease: (1) Cedar rust infection which affects a total area of  more than three-sixteenths inch in diameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sooty blotch or fly speck which is thinly scattered over more  than 5 percent of the surface, or dark, heavily concentrated spots which  affect an area of more than one-fourth inch in diameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Red skin spots which are thinly scattered over more than one- tenth of the surface, or dark, heavily concentrated spots which affect  an area of more than one-fourth inch in diameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Insects: (1) Any healed sting or healed stings which affect a  total area of more than one-eighth inch in diameter including any  encircling discolored rings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Worm holes.
