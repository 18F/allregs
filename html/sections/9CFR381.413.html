                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section applies to poultry products that are intended for  human consumption and that are offered for sale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A claim which, expressly or by implication, characterizes the  level of a nutrient (nutrient content claim) of the type required in  nutrition labeling pursuant to Sec. 381.409, may not be made on a label  or in labeling of that product unless the claim is made in accordance  with the applicable provisions in this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An expressed nutrient content claim is any direct statement  about the level (or range) of a nutrient in the product, e.g., ``low  sodium'' or ``contains 100 calories.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An implied nutrient content claim is any claim that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Describes the product or an ingredient therein in a manner that  suggests that a nutrient is absent or present in a certain amount (e.g.,  ``high in oat bran''); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Suggests that the product, because of its nutrient content, may  be useful in maintaining healthy dietary practices and is made in  association with an explicit claim or statement about a nutrient (e.g.,  ``healthy, contains 3 grams (g) of fat'').</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section, no nutrient content claims may be made  on products intended specifically for use by infants and children less  than 2 years of age unless the claim is specifically provided for in  subpart Y of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reasonable variations in the spelling of the terms defined in  applicable provisions in this subpart and their synonyms are permitted  provided these variations are not misleading (e.g., ``hi'' or ``lo'').</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Information that is required or permitted by Sec. 381.409 to be  declared in nutrition labeling, and that appears as part of the  nutrition label, is not a nutrient content claim and is not subject to  the requirements of this section. If such information is declared  elsewhere on the label or in labeling, it is a nutrient content claim  and is subject to the requirements for nutrient content claims.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A ``substitute'' product is one that may be used interchangeably  with another product that it resembles, i.e., that it is  organoleptically, physically, and functionally (including shelf life)  similar to, and that it is not nutritionally inferior to unless it is  labeled as an ``imitation.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If there is a difference in performance characteristics that  materially limits the use of the product, the product may still be  considered a substitute if the label includes a disclaimer adjacent to  the most prominent claim as defined in paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this  section, informing the consumer of such difference (e.g., ``not  recommended for frying'').</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Because the use of a ``free'' or ``low'' claim before the  name of a product implies that the product differs from other products  of the same type by virtue of its having a lower amount of the nutrient,  only products that have been specially processed, altered, formulated,  or reformulated so as to lower the amount of the nutrient in the  product, remove the nutrient from the product, or not include the  nutrient in the product, may bear such a claim (e.g., ``low sodium  chicken noodle soup'').</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any claim for the absence of a nutrient in a product, or that a  product is low in a nutrient when the product has not been specially  processed, altered,   formulated, or reformulated to qualify for that claim shall indicate  that the product inherently meets the criteria and shall clearly refer  to all products of that type and not merely to the particular brand to  which the labeling attaches (e.g., ``chicken breast meat, a low sodium  food'').</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A nutrient content claim shall be in type size and style no  larger than two times that of the statement of identity and shall not be  unduly prominent in type style compared to the statement of identity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Labeling information required in Sec. Sec. 381.413, 381.454,  381.456, 381.460, 381.461, 381.462, and 381.480, whose type size is not  otherwise specified, is required to be in letters and/or numbers no less  than \1/16\ inch in height, except as permitted by Sec. 381.500(d)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 381.409 or in paragraph (q)(3) of  this section, the label or labeling of a product may contain a statement  about the amount or percentage of a nutrient if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The use of the statement on the product implicitly characterizes  the level of the nutrient in the product and is consistent with a  definition for a claim, as provided in subpart Y of this part, for the  nutrient that the label addresses. Such a claim might be, ``less than 10  g of fat per serving;''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The statement does not in any way implicitly characterize the  level of the nutrient in the product and it is not false or misleading  in any respect (e.g., ``100 calories'' or ``5 grams of fat''), in which  case no disclaimer is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> ``Percent fat free'' claims are not authorized by this  paragraph. Such claims shall comply with Sec. 381.462(b)(6).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A product may bear a statement that compares the level of a  nutrient in the product with the level of a nutrient in a reference  product. These statements shall be known as ``relative claims'' and  include ``light,'' ``reduced,'' ``less'' (or ``fewer''), and ``more''  claims.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To bear a relative claim about the level of a nutrient, the  amount of that nutrient in the product must be compared to an amount of  nutrient in an appropriate reference product as specified in this  paragraph (j).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For ``less'' (or ``fewer'') and ``more'' claims, the  reference product may be a dissimilar product within a product category  that can generally be substituted for one another in the diet or a  similar product.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For ``light,'' ``reduced,'' and ``added'' claims, the reference  product shall be a similar product, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For ``light'' claims, the reference product shall be  representative of the type of product that includes the product that  bears the claim. The nutrient value for the reference product shall be  representative of a broad base of products of that type; e.g., a value  in a representative, valid data base; an average value determined from  the top three national (or regional) brands, a market basket norm; or,  where its nutrient value is representative of the product type, a market  leader. Firms using such a reference nutrient value as a basis for a  claim, are required to provide specific information upon which the  nutrient value was derived, on request, to consumers and appropriate  regulatory officials.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For relative claims other than ``light,'' including ``less'' and  ``more'' claims, the reference product may be the same as that provided  for ``light'' in paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(A) of this section or it may be  the manufacturer's regular product, or that of another manufacturer,  that has been offered for sale to the public on a regular basis for a   substantial period of time in the same geographic area by the same  business entity or by one entitled to use its trade name, provided the  name of the competitor is not used on the labeling of the product. The  nutrient values used to determine the claim when comparing a single  manufacturer's product to the labeled product shall be either the values  declared in nutrition labeling or the actual nutrient values, provided  that the resulting labeling is internally consistent (i.e., that the  values stated in the nutrition information, the nutrient values in the  accompanying information, and the declaration of the percentage of  nutrient by which the product has been modified are consistent and will  not cause consumer confusion when compared), and that the actual  modification is at least equal to the percentage specified in the  definition of the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For products bearing relative claims:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The label or labeling must state the identity of the reference  product and the percent (or fraction) of the amount of the nutrient in  the reference product by which the nutrient has been modified, (e.g.,  ``50 percent less fat than `reference product' '' or ``\1/3\ fewer  calories than `reference product' ''); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> This information shall be immediately adjacent to the most  prominent claim in easily legible boldface print or type, in distinct  contrast to other printed or graphic matter, that is no less than that  required by Sec. 381.121(c) for net quantity of contents, except where  the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the  net quantity of contents statement, in which case the referral statement  shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim, but no smaller  than \1/16\-inch minimum height, except as permitted by Sec.  381.500(d)(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The determination of which use of the claim is in the most  prominent location on the label or labeling will be made based on the  following factors, considered in order:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A claim on the principal display panel adjacent to the statement  of identity;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A claim elsewhere on the principal display panel;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A claim on the information panel; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> A claim elsewhere on the label or labeling.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The label or labeling must also bear:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Clear and concise quantitative information comparing the amount  of the subject nutrient in the product per labeled serving size with  that in the reference product; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> This statement shall appear adjacent to the most prominent claim  or to the nutrition information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A relative claim for decreased levels of a nutrient may not be  made on the label or in labeling of a product if the nutrient content of  the reference product meets the requirement for a ``low'' claim for that  nutrient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The term ``modified'' may be used in the statement of identity  of a product that bears a relative claim that complies with the  requirements of this part, followed immediately by the name of the  nutrient whose content has been altered (e.g., ``modified fat `product'  ''). This statement of identity must be immediately followed by the  comparative statement such as ``contains 35 percent less fat than  `reference product' '' The label or labeling must also bear the  information required by paragraph (j)(2) of this section in the manner  prescribed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> For purposes of making a claim, a ``meal-type'' product will be  defined as a product that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Makes a major contribution to the diet by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Weighing at least 10 ounces per labeled serving; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(E)</em> of this section:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Bread, cereal, rice, and pasta;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Fruits and vegetables;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Milk, yogurt, and cheese;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts; except that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> These foods will not be sauces (except for foods in the four  food groups in paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section, that  are in   the sauces), gravies, condiments, relishes, pickles, olives, jams,  jellies, syrups, breadings, or garnishes; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is represented as, or is in the form commonly understood to be,  a breakfast, lunch, dinner, meal, or entr[egrave]e.
