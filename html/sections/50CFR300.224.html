Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d), bigeye tuna landed in American Samoa, Guam, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands will be attributed to the longline fishery of the territory in which it is landed and will not be counted against the limit established under paragraph (a) of this section, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The bigeye tuna were not caught in the portion of the EEZ surrounding the Hawaiian Archipelago; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The bigeye tuna were landed by a fishing vessel operated in compliance with a valid permit issued under Sec. 660.707 or Sec. 665.801 of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exception for bigeye tuna caught by vessels with American Samoa Longline Limited Access Permits. Except as provided in paragraph (d), bigeye tuna caught by a vessel registered for use under a valid American Samoa Longline Limited Access Permit issued under Sec. 665.801(c) of this title will be attributed to the longline fishery of American Samoa and will not be counted against the limit established under paragraph (a) of this section, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The bigeye tuna were not caught in the portion of the EEZ surrounding the Hawaiian Archipelago; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The bigeye tuna were landed by a fishing vessel operated in compliance with a valid permit issued under Sec. 660.707 or Sec. 665.801 of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exception for bigeye tuna caught by vessels included in specified fishing agreements under Sec. 665.819(c) of this title. Bigeye tuna caught by a vessel that is included in a specified fishing agreement under Sec. 665.819(c) of this title will be attributed to the longline fishery of American Samoa, Guam, or the Northern Mariana Islands, according to the terms of the agreement to the extent the agreement is consistent with Sec. 665.819(c) of this title and other applicable laws, and will not be counted against the limit, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The start date specified in Sec. 665.819(c)(9)(i) of this title has occurred or passed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> NMFS has not made a determination under Sec. 665.819(c)(9)(iii) of this title that the catch of bigeye tuna exceeds the limit allocated to the territory that is a party to the agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Announcement of catch limit being reached and fishing prohibitions.

they are landed within 14 days after the prohibitions become effective. This prohibition does not apply to a vessel that catches bigeye tuna that is to be attributed to the longline fishery of American Samoa, Guam, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section, or to a vessel for which a declaration has been made to NMFS, pursuant to Sec. 665.803(a) of this title, that the current trip type is shallow-setting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a fishing vessel of the United States, other than a vessel that catches bigeye tuna that is to be attributed to the longline fishery of American Samoa, Guam, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, or a vessel for which a declaration has been made to NMFS, pursuant to Sec. 665.803(a) of this title, that the current trip type is shallow-setting, is used to fish in the Pacific Ocean using longline gear outside the Convention Area and the vessel enters the Convention Area at any time during the same fishing trip, the longline gear on the fishing vessel must, while it is in the Convention Area, be stowed in a manner so as not to be readily available for fishing; specifically, the hooks, branch or dropper lines, and floats used to buoy the mainline must be stowed and not available for immediate use, and any power-operated mainline hauler on deck must be covered in such a manner that it is not readily available for use.
