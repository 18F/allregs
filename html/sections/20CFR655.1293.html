This subpart provides procedures for the  processing of applications from agricultural employers and associations  of employers for the certification of employment of nonimmigrant workers  in agricultural employment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Establishment of special procedures. To provide for a limited  degree of flexibility in carrying out the Secretary's responsibilities  under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), while not deviating  from statutory requirements, the Administrator, OFLC has the authority  to establish or to devise, continue, revise, or revoke special  procedures in the form of variances for processing certain H-2A  applications when employers can demonstrate upon written application to  the Administrator, OFLC that special procedures are necessary. These  include special procedures in effect for the handling of applications  for sheepherders in the Western States (and adaptation of such  procedures to occupations in the range production of other livestock),  and for custom combine crews. In a like manner, for work in occupations  characterized by other than a reasonably regular workday or workweek,  such as the range production of sheep or other livestock, the  Administrator, OFLC has the authority to establish monthly, weekly, or  bi-weekly adverse effect wage rates (AEWR) for those occupations for a  statewide or other geographical area. Prior to making determinations  under this section, the Administrator, OFLC will consult with employer  and worker representatives.</p>
