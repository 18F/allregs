Under exceptional circumstances, such as when the individual who made the unauthorized commitment is no longer available to attest to the circumstances of the unauthorized commitment, the ratifying official may waive these requirements; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Decide whether ratification is proper and proceed as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If ratification is not justifiable, provide the cognizant program office, contracting office, and the unauthorized contractor with an explanation of the decision not to ratify.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If ratification appears adequately justified, ratify the action and retain or assign the contract to a successor contracting officer if necessary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Maintain related approval, decisional, and background documents in the contract file for audit purposes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Notify the cognizant program supervisor or line officer about the final disposition of the case; the notification may include a recommendation that the unauthorized commitment should be further considered a violation of USDA's employee conduct regulations.</p>
