                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application for reinstatement. A contractor debarred from  further contracts for an indefinite period under the Act may request  reinstatement in a letter filed with the Director at any time after the  effective date of the debarment; a contractor debarred for a fixed  period may make such a request following the expiration of six months  from the effective date of the debarment. In connection with the  reinstatement proceedings, all debarred contractors shall be required to  show that they have established and will carry out employment policies  and practices in compliance with the Act and this part. Additionally, in  determining whether reinstatement is appropriate for a contractor  debarred for a fixed period, the Director also shall consider, among  other factors, the severity of the violation which resulted in the  debarment, the contractor's attitude towards compliance, the  contractor's past compliance history, and whether the contractor's  reinstatement would   impede the effective enforcement of the Act or this part. Before  reaching a decision, the Director may conduct a compliance evaluation of  the contractor and may require the contractor to supply additional  information regarding the request for reinstatement. The Director shall  issue a written decision on the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Petition for review. Within 30 days of its receipt of a decision  denying a request for reinstatement, the contractor may file a petition  for review of the decision with the Secretary. The petition shall set  forth the grounds for the contractor's objections to the Director's  decision. The petition shall be served on the Director and the Associate  Solicitor for Civil Rights and Labor-Management and shall include the  decision as an appendix. The Director may file a response within 14 days  to the petition. The Secretary shall issue the final agency decision  denying or granting the request for reinstatement. Before reaching a  final decision, the Secretary may issue such additional orders  respecting procedure as he or she finds appropriate in the  circumstances, including an order referring the matter to the Office of  Administrative Law Judges for an evidentiary hearing where there is a  material factual dispute that cannot be resolved on the record before  the Secretary.</p>
