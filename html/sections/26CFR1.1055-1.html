                                Sec. 1.1055-1  General rule with respect to redeemable ground rents.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and  this paragraph, the transfer of property subject to a redeemable ground  rent has the same effect as the transfer of property subject to a  mortgage, the acquisition of property subject to a redeemable ground  rent is to be treated the same as the acquisition of property subject   to a mortgage, and the holding of property subject to a redeemable  ground rent is to be treated in the same manner as the holding of  property subject to a mortgage. See section 163(c) for the treatment of  any annual or periodic rental payment under a redeemable ground rent as  interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definition of redeemable ground rent. For purposes of subtitle A  of the Code, the term redeemable ground rent means only a ground rent  with respect to which all the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There is a lease of land which is assignable by the lessee  without the consent of the lessor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term of the lease is for a period in excess of 15 years,  taking into account all periods for which the lease may be renewed at  the option of the lessee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The lessee has a present or future right to terminate the lease  and to acquire the lessor's interest in the land (i.e., to redeem the  ground rent) by the payment of a determined or determinable amount,  which amount is referred to in Sec. Sec. 1.1055-2, 1.1055-3, and  1.1055-4 as a redemption price. Such right must exist by virtue of State  or local law. If the lessee's right to terminate the lease and to  acquire the lessor's interest is not granted by State or local law but  exists solely by virtue of a private agreement or privately created  condition, the ground rent is not a redeemable ground rent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The lessor's interest in the land subject to the lease is  primarily a security interest to protect the payment to him of the  annual or periodic rental payments due under the lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effective date. In general, the provisions of section 1055 and  paragraph (a) of this section take effect on April 11, 1963, and apply  with respect to taxable years ending on or after such date. See Sec.  1.1055-3 for rules for determining the basis of real property acquired  subject to liabilities under a redeemable ground rent regardless of when  such property was acquired. See also Sec. 1.1055-4 for rules for  determining the basis of a redeemable ground rent in the hands of a  holder who reserved or created such ground rent in connection with a  transfer, occurring before April 11, 1963, of the right to hold real  property subject to liabilities under such ground rent.  [T.D. 6821, 30 FR 6216, May 4, 1965]</p>
