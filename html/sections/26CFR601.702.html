                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Publication in the Federal Register--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Requirement. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Subject to the application of the exemptions and exclusions described in  the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and (c), and subject to  the limitations provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the IRS is  required under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1), to state separately and publish  currently in the Federal Register for the guidance of the public the  following information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Descriptions of its central and field organization and the  established places at which, the persons from whom, and the methods  whereby, the public may obtain information, make submittals or requests,  or obtain decisions, from the IRS;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Statement of the general course and method by which its  functions are channeled and determined, including the nature and  requirements of all formal and informal procedures which are available;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Rules of procedure, descriptions of forms available or the  places at which forms may be obtained, and instructions as to the scope  and contents of all papers, reports, or examinations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Substantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized  by law, and statements of general policy or interpretations of general  applicability formulated and adopted by the IRS; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Each amendment, revision, or repeal of matters referred to in  paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) through (D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pursuant to the foregoing requirements, the Commissioner  publishes in the Federal Register from time to time a statement, which  is not codified in this chapter, on the organization and functions of  the IRS, and such amendments as are needed to keep the statement on a  current basis. In addition, there are published in the Federal Register  the rules set forth in this part 601 (Statement of Procedural Rules),  such as those in paragraph E of this section, relating to conference and  practice requirements of the IRS; the regulations in part 301 of this  chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations); and the various  substantive regulations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, such as  the regulations in part 1 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations), in  part 20 of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations), and in part 31 of this  chapter (Employment Tax Regulations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Incorporation by reference in the Federal  Register. Matter which is reasonably available to the class of persons  affected thereby, whether in a private or public publication, shall be  deemed published in the Federal Register for purposes of paragraph  (a)(1) of this section when it is incorporated by reference therein with  the approval of the Director of the Office of the Federal Register. The  matter which is incorporated by reference must be set forth in the  private or public publication substantially in its entirety and not  merely summarized or printed as a synopsis. Matter, the location and  scope of which are familiar to only a few persons having a special  working knowledge of the activities of the IRS, may not be incorporated  in the Federal Register by reference. Matter may be incorporated by  reference in the Federal Register only pursuant to the provisions of 5  U.S.C. 552(a)(1) and 1 CFR part 20.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Effect of failure to publish. Except to the extent that a  person has actual and timely notice of the terms of any matter referred  to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section which is required to be published  in the Federal Register, such person is not required in any manner to  resort to, or be adversely affected by, such matter if it is not so  published or is not incorporated by reference therein pursuant to  paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. Thus, for example, any such matter  which imposes an obligation and which is not so published or  incorporated by reference shall not adversely change or affect a  person's rights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Public inspection and copying--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Subject to  the application of the exemptions described in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and the  exclusions described in 5 U.S.C. 552(c), the IRS is required under 5  U.S.C. 552(a)(2) to make available for public inspection and copying or,  in the alternative, to   promptly publish and offer for sale the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions,  and orders, if such opinions and orders are made in the adjudication of  cases;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Those statements of policy and interpretations which have been  adopted by the IRS but are not published in the Federal Register;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Its administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that  affect a member of the public; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, which have  been released to any person under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) and which, because  of the nature of their subject matter, the IRS determines have become or  are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for  substantially the same records. The determination that records have  become or may become the subject of subsequent requests shall be based  on the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The subject matter is clearly of interest to the public at large  or to special interest groups from which more than one request is  expected to be received; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When more than four requests for substantially the same records  have already been received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The IRS is also required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) to maintain and  make available for public inspection and copying current indexes  identifying any matter described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) through (C)  of this section which is issued, adopted, or promulgated after July 4,  1967, and which is required to be made available for public inspection  or published. In addition, the IRS shall also promptly publish,  quarterly or more frequently, and distribute (by sale or otherwise)  copies of each index or supplements thereto unless it determines by  order published in the Federal Register that the publication would be  unnecessary and impracticable, in which case the IRS shall nonetheless  provide copies of such indexes on request at a cost not to exceed the  direct cost of duplication. No matter described in paragraphs  (b)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section which is required by this  section to be made available for public inspection or published may be  relied upon, used, or cited as precedent by the IRS against a party  other than an agency unless such party has actual and timely notice of  the terms of such matter or unless the matter has been indexed and  either made available for inspection or published, as provided by this  paragraph (b). This paragraph (b) applies only to matters which have  precedential significance. It does not apply, for example, to any ruling  or advisory interpretation issued to a taxpayer or to a particular  transaction or set of facts which applies only to that transaction or  set of facts. Rulings, determination letters, technical advice  memorandums, and Chief Counsel advice are open to public inspection and  copying pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6110. This paragraph (b) does not apply to  matters which have been made available pursuant to paragraph (a) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For records required to be made available for public  inspection and copying pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) and paragraphs  (b)(1)(i)(A) through (D) of this section, which are created on or after  November 1, 1996, the IRS shall make such records available on the  Internet within one year after such records are created.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The IRS shall make the index referred to in paragraph  (b)(1)(ii) of this section available on the Internet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, delete identifying details contained in any  matter described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) through (D) of this section  before making such matter available for inspection or publication. Such  matters shall also be subject to any applicable exemption set forth in 5  U.S.C. 552(b). In every case where identifying details or other matters  are so deleted, the justification for the deletion shall be explained in  writing. The extent of such deletion shall be indicated on the portion  of the record which is made available or published, unless including  that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption in 5  U.S.C. 552(b) under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible,  the extent of the deletion shall be indicated at the place in the record  where the deletion was made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Freedom of Information Reading Room--(i) In general. The  Headquarters Disclosure Office of the IRS shall provide a reading room  where the matters described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) through (D) of  this section which are required to be made available for public  inspection, and the current indexes to such matters, shall be made  available to the public for inspection and copying. The Freedom of  Information Reading Room shall contain other matters determined to be  helpful for the guidance of the public, including a complete set of  rules and regulations (except those pertaining to alcohol, tobacco,  firearms, and explosives) contained in this title, any Internal Revenue  matters which may be incorporated by reference in the Federal Register  (but not a copy of the Federal Register so doing) pursuant to paragraph  (a)(2)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section, a set of Cumulative Bulletins, and copies of  various IRS publications. The public shall not be allowed to remove any  record from the Freedom of Information Reading Room.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Location of Freedom of Information Reading Room. The location  of the Headquarters Disclosure Office Freedom of Information Reading  Room is: IRS, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW., Room 1621, Washington, DC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Copying facilities. The Headquarters Disclosure Office shall  provide facilities whereby a person may obtain copies of material  located on the shelves of the Freedom of Information Reading Room.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Specific requests for other records--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Subject  to the application of the exemptions described in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and  the exclusions described in 5 U.S.C. 552(c), the IRS shall, in  conformance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3), make reasonably described records  available to a person making a request for such records which conforms  in every respect with the rules and procedures set forth in this  section. Any request or any appeal from the initial denial of a request  that does not comply with the requirements set forth in this section  shall not be considered subject to the time constraints of paragraphs  (c)(9), (10), and (11) of this section, unless and until the request or  appeal is amended to comply. The IRS shall promptly advise the requester  in what respect the request or appeal is deficient so that it may be  resubmitted or amended for consideration in accordance with this  section. If a requester does not resubmit a perfected request or appeal  within 35 days from the date of a communication from the IRS, the  request or appeal file shall be closed. When the resubmitted request or  appeal conforms with the requirements of this section, the time  constraints of paragraphs (c)(9), (10), and (11) of this section shall  begin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Requests for the continuing production of records created or  for records created after the date of receipt of the request shall not  be honored.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Specific requests under paragraph (a)(3) for material  described in paragraph (a)(2)(A)through(C) and which is in the Freedom  of Information Reading Room shall not be honored.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Electronic format records. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The IRS shall provide the  responsive record or records in the form or format requested if the  record or records are readily reproducible by the IRS in that form or  format. The IRS shall make reasonable efforts to maintain its records in  forms or formats that are reproducible for the purpose of disclosure.  For purposes of this paragraph, the term readily reproducible means,  with respect to electronic format, a record or records that can be  downloaded or transferred intact to a floppy disk, computer disk (CD),  tape, or other electronic medium using equipment currently in use by the  office or offices processing the request. Even though some records may  initially be readily reproducible, the need to segregate exempt from  nonexempt records may cause the releasable material to be not readily  reproducible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In responding to a request for records, the IRS shall make  reasonable efforts to search for the records in electronic form or  format, except where such efforts would significantly interfere with the  operation of the agency's automated information system(s). For purposes  of this paragraph (c), the term search means to locate, manually or by  automated means, agency records for the purpose of identifying those   records which are responsive to a request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Searches for records maintained in electronic form or format  may require the application of codes, queries, or other minor forms of  programming to retrieve the requested records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Requests for records not in control of the IRS. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Where the  request is for a record which is determined to be in the possession or  under the control of a constituent unit of the Department of the  Treasury other than the IRS, the request for such record shall  immediately be transferred to the appropriate constituent unit and the  requester notified to that effect. Such referral shall not be deemed a  denial of access within the meaning of these regulations. The  constituent unit of the Department to which such referral is made shall  treat such request as a new request addressed to it and the time limits  for response set forth in paragraphs (c)(9) and (c)(10) of this section  shall commence when the referral is received by the designated office or  officer of the constituent unit. Where the request is for a record which  is of a type that is not maintained by any constituent unit of the  Department of the Treasury, the requester shall be so advised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where the record requested was created by another agency or  constituent unit of the Department of the Treasury and a copy thereof is  in the possession of the IRS, the IRS official to whom the request is  delivered shall refer the request to the agency or constituent unit  which originated the record for direct reply to the requester. The  requester shall be informed of such referral. This referral shall not be  considered a denial of access within the meaning of these regulations.  Where the record is determined to be exempt from disclosure under 5  U.S.C. 552, the referral need not be made, but the IRS shall inform the  originating agency or constituent unit of its determination. Where  notifying the requester of its referral may cause a harm to the  originating agency or constituent unit which would enable the  originating agency or constituent unit to withhold the record under 5  U.S.C. 552, then such referral need not be made. In both of these  circumstances, the IRS official to whom the request is delivered shall  process the request in accordance with the procedures set forth in this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When a request is received for a record created by the IRS  (i.e., in its possession and control) that includes information  originated by another agency or constituent unit of the Department of  the Treasury, the record shall be referred to the originating agency or  constituent unit for review, coordination, and concurrence prior to  being released to a requester. The IRS official to whom the request is  delivered may withhold the record without prior consultation with the  originating agency or constituent unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Form of request. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Requesters are advised that only requests  for records which fully comply with the requirements of this section can  be processed in accordance with this section. Requesters shall be  notified promptly in writing of any requirements which have not been met  or any additional requirements to be met. Every effort shall be made to  comply with the requests as written. The initial request for records  must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Be made in writing and signed by the individual making the  request;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> State that it is made pursuant to the Freedom of Information  Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or regulations thereunder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Be addressed to and mailed to the office of the IRS official who  is responsible for the control of the records requested (see paragraph  (h) of this section for the responsible officials and their addresses),  regardless of where such records are maintained. Generally, requests for  records pertaining to the requester, or other matters of local interest,  should be directed to the office servicing the requester's geographic  area of residence. Requests for records maintained in the Headquarters  of the IRS and its National Office of Chief Counsel, concerning matters  of nationwide applicability, such as published guidance (regulations and  revenue rulings), program management, operations, or policies, should be  directed to the Headquarters Disclosure Office. If the person making the  request does not know the official responsible for the control of the  records being requested, the person making the request may contact, by  telephone or   in writing, the disclosure office servicing the requester's geographic  area of residence to ascertain the identity of the official having  control of the records being requested so that the request can be  addressed, and delivered, to the appropriate responsible official.  Misdirected requests that otherwise satisfy the requirements of this  section shall be immediately transferred to the appropriate responsible  IRS official and the requester notified to that effect. Such transfer  shall not be deemed a denial of access within the meaning of these  regulations. The IRS official to whom the request is redirected shall  treat such request as a new request addressed to it and the time limits  for response set forth in paragraphs (c)(9) and (c)(11) of this section  shall commence when the transfer is received by the designated office;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Reasonably describe the records in accordance with paragraph  (c)(5)(i) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> In the case of a request for records the disclosure of which is  limited by statute or regulations (as, for example, the Privacy Act of  1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) or section 6103 and the regulations thereunder),  establish the identity and the right of the person making the request to  the disclosure of the records in accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(iii)  of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Set forth the address where the person making the request  desires to be notified of the determination as to whether the request  shall be granted;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> State whether the requester wishes to inspect the records or  desires to have a copy made and furnished without first inspecting them;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> State the firm agreement of the requester to pay the fees for  search, duplication, and review ultimately determined in accordance with  paragraph (f) of this section, or, in accordance with paragraph  (c)(4)(ii) of this section, place an upper limit for such fees that the  requester is willing to pay, or request that such fees be reduced or  waived and state the justification for such request; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Identify the category of the requester and, with the exception  of ``other requesters,'' state how the records shall be used, as  required by paragraph (f)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As provided in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(H) of this section, rather  than stating a firm agreement to pay the fee ultimately determined in  accordance with paragraph (f) of this section or requesting that such  fees be reduced or waived, the requester may place an upper limit on the  amount the requester agrees to pay. If the requester chooses to place an  upper limit and the estimated fee is deemed to be greater than the upper  limit, or where the requester asks for an estimate of the fee to be  charged, the requester shall be promptly advised of the estimate of the  fee and asked to agree to pay such amount. Where the initial request  includes a request for reduction or waiver of the fee, the IRS officials  responsible for the control of the requested records (or their  delegates) shall determine whether to grant the request for reduction or  waiver in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section and notify the  requester of their decisions and, if their decisions result in the  requester being liable for all or part of the fee normally due, ask the  requester to agree to pay the amount so determined. The requirements of  this paragraph shall not be deemed met until the requester has  explicitly agreed to pay the fee applicable to the request for records,  if any, or has made payment in advance of the fee estimated to be due.  If the requester has any outstanding balance of search, review, or  duplication fees, the requirements of this paragraph shall not be deemed  met until the requester has remitted the outstanding balance due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Reasonable description of records; identity and right of the  requester. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The request for records must describe the records in  reasonably sufficient detail to enable the IRS employees who are  familiar with the subject matter of the request to locate the records  without placing an unreasonable burden upon the IRS. While no specific  formula for a reasonable description of a record can be established, the  requirement shall generally be satisfied if the requester gives the  name, taxpayer identification number (e.g., social security number or  employer identification number), subject matter, location, and years at  issue, of the requested records. If the request seeks records pertaining  to   pending litigation, the request shall indicate the title of the case,  the court in which the case was filed, and the nature of the case. It is  suggested that the person making the request furnish any additional  information which shall more clearly identify the requested records.  Where the requester does not reasonably describe the records being  sought, the requester shall be afforded an opportunity to refine the  request. Such opportunity may involve a conference with knowledgeable  IRS personnel at the discretion of the disclosure officer. The  reasonable description requirement shall not be used by officers or  employees of the Internal Revenue as a device for improperly withholding  records from the public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The IRS shall make a reasonable effort to comply fully with all  requests for access to records subject only to any applicable exemption  set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) or any exclusion described in 5 U.S.C.  552(c). In any situation in which it is determined that a request for  voluminous records would unduly burden and interfere with the operations  of the IRS, the person making the request shall be asked to be more  specific and to narrow the request, or to agree on an orderly procedure  for the production of the requested records, in order to satisfy the  request without disproportionate adverse effect on IRS operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Statutory or regulatory restrictions. (A) In the case of  records containing information with respect to particular persons the  disclosure of which is limited by statute or regulations, persons making  requests shall establish their identity and right to access to such  records. Persons requesting access to such records which pertain to  themselves may establish their identity by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The presentation of a single document bearing a photograph (such  as a passport or identification badge), or the presentation of two items  of identification which do not bear a photograph but do bear both a name  and signature (such as a credit card or organization membership card),  in the case of a request made in person,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The submission of the requester's signature, address, and one  other identifier (such as a photocopy of a driver's license) bearing the  requester's signature, in the case of a request by mail, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The presentation in person or the submission by mail of a  notarized statement, or a statement made under penalty of perjury in  accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1746, swearing to or affirming such person's  identity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Additional proof of a person's identity shall be required before  the requests shall be deemed to have met the requirement of paragraph  (c)(4)(i)(E) of this section if it is determined that additional proof  is necessary to protect against unauthorized disclosure of information  in a particular case. Persons who have identified themselves to the  satisfaction of IRS officials pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall be  deemed to have established their right to access records pertaining to  themselves. Persons requesting records on behalf of or pertaining to  another person must provide adequate proof of the legal relationship  under which they assert the right to access the requested records before  the requirement of paragraph (c)(4)(i)(E) of this section shall be  deemed met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In the case of an attorney-in-fact, or other person requesting  records on behalf of or pertaining to other persons, the requester shall  furnish a properly executed power of attorney, Privacy Act consent, or  tax information authorization, as appropriate. In the case of a  corporation, if the requester has the authority to legally bind the  corporation under applicable state law, such as its corporate president  or chief executive officer, then a written statement or tax information  authorization certifying as to that person's authority to make a request  on behalf of the corporation shall be sufficient. If the requester is  any other officer or employee of the corporation, then such requester  shall furnish a written statement certifying as to that person's  authority to make a request on behalf of the corporation by any  principal officer and attested to by the secretary or other officer  (other than the requester) that the person making the request on behalf  of the corporation is properly authorized to make such a request. If the  requester is other than one of the above, then such person   may furnish a resolution by the corporation's board of directors or  other governing body which provides that the person making the request  on behalf of the corporation is properly authorized to make such a  request, or shall otherwise satisfy the requirements set forth in  section 6103(e). A person requesting access to records of a partnership  or a subchapter S Corporation shall provide a notarized statement, or a  statement made under penalty of perjury in accordance with 28 U.S.C.  1746, that the requester was a member of the partnership or subchapter S  corporation for a part of each of the years included in the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Requests for expedited processing. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When a requester  demonstrates compelling need, a request shall be taken out of order and  given expedited treatment. A compelling need involves--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could  reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or  physical safety of an individual;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> of this section, must establish that  he or she is a person whose main professional activity or occupation is  information dissemination, though it need not be his or her sole  occupation. A person primarily engaged in disseminating information does  not include individuals who are engaged only incidentally in the  dissemination of information. The standard of urgency to inform requires  that the records requested pertain to a matter of current exigency to  the American public, beyond the public's right to know about government  activity generally, and that delaying a response to a request for  records would compromise a significant recognized interest to and  throughout the American general public;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The loss of substantial due process rights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a  statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of his or her  knowledge and belief, explaining in detail why there is a compelling  need for expedited processing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of  the initial request for records or at any later time. For a prompt  determination, requests for expedited processing must be submitted to  the responsible official of the IRS who maintains the records requested  except that a request for expedited processing under paragraph  (c)(6)(i)(B) of this section shall be submitted directly to the  Director, Communications Division, whose address is Office of Media  Relations, CL:C:M, Internal Revenue Service, Room 7032, 1111  Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20224.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Upon receipt by the responsible official in the IRS, a request  for expedited processing shall be considered and a determination as to  whether to grant or deny the request shall be made, and the requester  notified, within ten days of the date of the request, provided that in  no event shall the IRS have less than five days (excluding Saturdays,  Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date of the responsible  official's receipt of the request for such processing. The determination  to grant or deny a request for expedited processing shall be made solely  on the information initially provided by the requester.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> An appeal of an initial determination to deny expedited  processing must be made within ten days of the date of the initial  determination to deny expedited processing, and must otherwise comply  with the requirements of paragraph (c)(10) of this section. Both the  envelope and the appeal itself shall be clearly marked, ``Appeal for  Expedited Processing.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> IRS action to deny or affirm denial of a request for expedited  processing pursuant to this paragraph, and IRS failure to respond in a  timely manner to such a request shall be subject to judicial review,  except that judicial review shall be based on the record before the IRS  at the time of the determination. A district court of the   United States shall not have jurisdiction to review the IRS's denial of  expedited processing of a request for records after the IRS has provided  a complete response to the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Date of receipt of request. (i) Requests for records and any  separate agreement to pay, final notification of waiver of fees, or  letter transmitting payment, shall be promptly stamped with the date of  delivery to or dispatch by the office of the IRS official responsible  for the control of the records requested. A request for records shall be  considered to have been received on the date on which a complete request  containing the information required by paragraphs (c)(4)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(A)</em> through  (I) has been received by the IRS official responsible for the control of  the records requested. A determination that a request is deficient in  any respect is not a denial of access, and such determinations are not  subject to administrative appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The latest of such stamped dates shall be deemed for purposes  of this section to be the date of receipt of the request, provided that  the requirements of paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(A) through (I) of this section  have been satisfied, and, where applicable--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The requester has agreed in writing, by executing a separate  contract or otherwise, to pay the fees for search, duplication, and  review determined due in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section,  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The fees have been waived in accordance with paragraph (f) of  this section, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Payment in advance has been received from the requester.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Search for records requested. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Upon the receipt of a request,  search services shall be performed by IRS personnel to identify and  locate the requested records. Search time includes any and all time  spent looking for material responsive to the request, including page-by- page or line-by-line identification of material within records. Where  duplication of an entire record would be less costly than a line-by-line  identification, duplication should be substituted for this kind of  search. With respect to records maintained in computerized form, a  search shall include services functionally analogous to a search for  records which are maintained on paper.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In determining which records are responsive to a request, the  IRS official responsible for the control of the records requested shall  include only those records within the official's possession and control  as of the date of the receipt of the request by the appropriate  disclosure officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Initial determination--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Responsible official.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The  Associate Director, Personnel Security or delegate shall have the sole  authority to make initial determinations with respect to requests for  records under that office's control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Director of the Office of Governmental Liaison and  Disclosure or delegate shall have the sole authority to make initial  determinations with respect to all other requests for records of the IRS  maintained in the Headquarters and its National Office of the Chief  Counsel. For all other records within the control of the IRS, the  initial determination with respect to requests for records may be made  either by the Director, Office of Governmental Liaison and Disclosure,  or by the IRS officials responsible for the control of the records  requested, or their delegates (see paragraph (h) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Processing of request. The appropriate responsible official or  delegate shall respond in the approximate order of receipt of the  requests, to the extent consistent with sound administrative practice.  In any event, the initial determination shall be made and notification  thereof mailed within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal  public holidays) after the date of receipt of the request, as determined  in accordance with paragraph (c)(7) of this section, unless the  responsible official invokes an extension pursuant to paragraph (c)(11)  of this section, the requester otherwise agrees to an extension of the  20 day time limitation, or the request is an expedited request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Granting of request. If the request is granted in full or in  part, and if the requester wants a copy of the records, a statement of  the applicable fees, if there are any, shall be mailed to the requester  either at the time of the determination or shortly thereafter. In   the case of a request for inspection, the records shall be made  available promptly for inspection, at the time and place stated,  normally at the appropriate office where the records requested are  controlled. If the person making the request has expressed a desire to  inspect the records at another office of the IRS, a reasonable effort  shall be made to comply with the request. Records shall be made  available for inspection at such reasonable and proper times so as not  to interfere with their use by the IRS or to exclude other persons from  making inspections. In addition, reasonable limitations may be placed on  the number of records which may be inspected by a person on any given  date. The person making the request shall not be allowed to remove the  records from the office where inspection is made. If, after making  inspection, the person making the request desires copies of all or a  portion of the requested records, copies shall be furnished upon payment  of the established fees prescribed by paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Denial of request. If it is determined that some records shall  be denied, the person making the request shall be so notified by mail.  The letter of notification shall specify the city or other location  where the requested records are situated, contain a brief statement of  the grounds for not granting the request in full including the  exemption(s) relied upon, the name and any title or position of the  official responsible for the denial, and advise the person making the  request of the right to appeal to the Commissioner in accordance with  paragraph (c)(10) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In denying a request for records, in whole or in part, the IRS  shall include the date that the request was received in the appropriate  disclosure office, and shall provide an estimate of the volume of the  denied matter to the person making the request, unless providing such  estimate would harm an interest protected by an exemption in 5 U.S.C.  552(b) or (c) pursuant to which the denial is made; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount of information deleted shall be indicated on the  released portion of the record, unless including that indication would  harm an interest protected by an exemption in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) under  which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the amount of the  information deleted and the asserted exemption shall be indicated at the  place in the record where such deletion is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Inability to locate and evaluate within time limits. Where the  records requested cannot be located and evaluated within the initial  twenty day period or any extension thereof in accordance with paragraph  (c)(11) of this section, the search for the records or evaluation shall  continue, but the requester shall be notified, and advised that the  requester may consider such notification a denial of the request for  records. The requester shall be provided with a statement of judicial  rights along with the notification letter. The requester may also be  invited, in the alternative, to agree to a voluntary extension of time  in which to locate and evaluate the records. Such voluntary extension of  time shall not constitute a waiver of the requester's right to appeal or  seek judicial review of any denial of access ultimately made or the  requester's right to seek judicial review in the event of failure to  comply with the time extension granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Administrative appeal. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The requester may submit an  administrative appeal to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue by letter  that is postmarked within 35 days after the later of the date of any  letter of notification described in paragraph (c)(9)(iv) of this  section, the date of any letter of notification of an adverse  determination of the requester's category described in paragraph (f)(3)  of this section, the date of any letter of notification of an adverse  determination of the requester's fee waiver or reduction request  described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the date of any letter  determining that no responsive records exist, or the date of the last  transmission of the last records released. An administrative appeal for  denial of a request for expedited processing must be made to the  Commissioner of Internal Revenue by letter that is postmarked within 10  days after the date of any letter of notification discussed in paragraph  (c)(6)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The letter of appeal shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Be made in writing and signed by the requester;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Be addressed to the Commissioner and mailed to IRS Appeals,  6377A Riverside Avenue, Suite 110, Riverside, California 92506-FOIA  Appeal;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Reasonably describe the records requested to which the appeal  pertains in accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Set forth the address where the appellant desires to be notified  of the determination on appeal;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Specify the date of the request, the office to which the request  was submitted, and where possible, enclose a copy of the initial request  and the initial determination being appealed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Ask the Commissioner to grant the request for records, fee  waiver, expedited processing, or favorable fee category, as applicable,  or verify that an appropriate search was conducted and the responsive  records were either produced or an appropriate exemption asserted. The  person submitting the appeal may submit any argument in support of the  appeal in the letter of appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Appeals shall be stamped promptly with the date of their  receipt in the Office of Appeals, and the later of this stamped date or  the stamped date of a document submitted subsequently which supplements  the original appeal so that the appeal satisfies the requirements set  forth in paragraphs (c)(10)(ii)(A) through (F) of this section shall be  deemed by the IRS to be the date of receipt of the appeal for all  purposes of this section. The Commissioner or a delegate shall  acknowledge receipt of the appeal and advise the requester of the date  of receipt and the date a response is due in accordance with this  paragraph. If an appeal fails to satisfy any of the requirements of  paragraph (c)(10)(ii)(A) through (F) of this section, the person making  the request shall be advised promptly in writing of the additional  requirements to be met. Except for appeals of denials of expedited  processing, the determination to affirm the initial denial (in whole or  in part) or to grant the request for records shall be made and  notification of the determination shall be mailed within twenty days  (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the  date of receipt of the appeal unless extended pursuant to paragraph  (c)(11)(i) of this section. Appeals of initial determinations to deny  expedited processing must be made within 10 calendar days of the  determination to deny the expedited processing. If it is determined that  the appeal from the initial denial is to be denied (in whole or in  part), the requester shall be notified in writing of the denial, the  reasons therefor, the name and title or position of the official  responsible for the denial on appeal, and the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552(a)(4) for judicial review of that determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Time extensions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Unusual circumstances. (A) In unusual  circumstances, the time limitations specified in paragraphs (c)(9) and  (10) of this section may be extended by written notice from the official  charged with the duty of making the determinations to the person making  the request or appeal setting forth the reasons for this extension and  the date on which the determination is expected to be sent. As used in  this paragraph, the term unusual circumstances means, but only to the  extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular  request:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The need to search for and collect the requested records from  field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the  office processing the request;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a  voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in  a single request;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all  practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in  the determination of the request or among two or more constituent units  of the Department of the Treasury having substantial subject matter  interest therein; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The need for consultation with business submitters to determine  the nature and extent of proprietary information in accordance with this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any extension or extensions of time for unusual circumstances  shall not cumulatively total more than ten   days (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday and legal public holidays). If  additional time is needed to process the request, the IRS shall notify  the requester and provide the requester an opportunity to limit the  scope of the request or arrange for an alternative time frame for  processing the request or a modified request. The requester shall retain  the right to define the desired scope of the request, as long as it  meets the requirements contained in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Aggregation of requests. If more than one request is received  from the same requester, or from a group of requesters acting in  concert, and the IRS believes that such requests constitute a single  request which would otherwise satisfy the unusual circumstances  specified in subparagraph (c)(11)(i) of this section, and the requests  involve clearly related matters, the IRS may aggregate these requests  for processing purposes. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters  shall not be aggregated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Failure to comply. If the IRS fails to comply with the time  limitations specified in paragraphs (c)(9), (10), or paragraph  (c)(11)(i) of this section, any person making a request for records  satisfying the requirements of paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(A) through (I) of  this section, shall be deemed to have exhausted administrative remedies  with respect to such request. Accordingly, this person may initiate suit  in accordance with paragraph (c)(13) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Judicial review. If an administrative appeal pursuant to  paragraph (c)(10) of this section for records or fee waiver or reduction  is denied, or if a request for expedited processing is denied and there  has been no determination as to the release of records, or if a request  for a favorable fee category under paragraph (f)(3) of this section is  denied, or a determination is made that there are no responsive records,  or if no determination is made within the twenty day periods specified  in paragraphs (c)(9) and (10) of this section, or the period of any  extension pursuant to paragraph (c)(11)(i) of this section, or by grant  of the requester, respectively, the person making the request may  commence an action in a United States district court in the district in  which the requester resides, in which the requester's principal place of  business is located, in which the records are situated, or in the  District of Columbia, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B). The statute  authorizes an action only against the agency. With respect to records of  the IRS, the agency is the IRS, not an officer or an employee thereof.  Service of process in such an action shall be in accordance with the  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. App.) applicable to actions  against an agency of the United States. Delivery of process upon the IRS  shall be directed to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Attention:  CC:PA, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20224. The IRS  shall serve an answer or otherwise plead to any complaint made under  this paragraph within 30 days after service upon it, unless the court  otherwise directs for good cause shown. The district court shall  determine the matter de novo, and may examine the contents of the IRS  records in question in camera to determine whether such records or any  part thereof shall be withheld under any of the exemptions described in  5 U.S.C. 552(b) and the exclusions described in 5 U.S.C. 552(c). The  burden shall be upon the IRS to sustain its action in not making the  requested records available. The court may assess against the United  States reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably  incurred by the person making the request in any case in which the  complainant has substantially prevailed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Preservation of records. All correspondence relating to the  requests received by the IRS under this chapter, and all records  processed pursuant to such requests, shall be preserved, until such time  as the destruction of such correspondence and records is authorized  pursuant to title 44 of the United States Code. Under no circumstances  shall records be destroyed while they are the subject of a pending  request, appeal, or lawsuit under 5 U.S.C. 552.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Rules for disclosure of certain specified matters. Requests for  certain specified categories of records shall be processed by the IRS in  accordance with other established procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Inspection of tax returns and attachments or transcripts.

A fee shall not be  charged for monitoring a requester's inspection of records which  contains exempt matter. The IRS may recover the applicable fees even if  there is ultimately no disclosure of records.

Appeals from denials of requests for waiver or reduction of  fees shall be decided by the Commissioner's delegate in accordance with  the criteria set forth in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section. Appeals  shall be received by the Commissioner's delegate within 35 days of the  date of the letter of notification denying the initial request for  waiver or reduction and shall be decided promptly.

A request for records  under this section shall include an attestation as to the status of the  requester for use by the IRS official to whose office the request is  delivered in determining the appropriate fees to be assessed. No  attestation is required for a requester who falls within paragraph  (f)(3)(ii)(E)(an ``other requester'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Categories--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Commercial use requester. Any person who seeks  information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or  profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the  request is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> News media requester. Any person actively gathering news for an  entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news  (i.e., information about current events or of current interest to the  public) to the public. News media entities include, but are not limited  to, television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large,  publishers of periodicals, to the extent they disseminate news, who make  their periodicals available for purchase or subscription by the general  public, computerized news services and   telecommunications. Free lance journalists shall be included as media  requesters if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting  publication through a qualifying news entity (e.g., publication  contract, past publication record).

Any person who, on behalf of  a preschool, public or private elementary or secondary school,  institution of undergraduate or graduate higher education, institution  of professional or vocational education, which operates a program or  programs of scholarly research, seeks records in furtherance of the  institution's scholarly research and is not for a commercial use.

Where the IRS has reasonable  cause to doubt the use to which a requester shall put the records  sought, or where that use is not clear from the record itself, the IRS  shall seek additional clarification from the requester before assigning  the request to a specific category. In any event, a determination of the  proper category of requester shall be based upon a review of the  requester's submission and may also be based upon the IRS' own records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Allowable charges--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Commercial use requesters. Records shall  be provided to commercial use requesters for the cost of search,  duplication, and review (including doing all that is necessary to excise  and otherwise prepare records for release) of records.

Records shall be provided to news  media, educational institution, and noncommercial scientific institution  requesters for the cost of duplication alone, excluding fees for the  first 100 pages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Other requesters. Requesters who do not fit into any of the  above categories shall be charged fees that shall cover the full actual  direct cost of searching for and duplicating records, except that the  first two hours of search time and first 100 pages of duplication shall  be furnished without charge. Requests from individuals for records about  themselves maintained in the IRS's systems of records shall continue to  be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, which  permits fees only for duplication after the first 100 pages are  furnished free of charge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Avoidance of unexpected fees. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In order to protect requesters  from unexpected fees, all requests for records shall state the agreement  of the requesters to pay the fees determined in accordance with  paragraph (f)(5) of this section or state the upper limit they are  willing to pay to cover the costs of processing their requests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When the fees for processing requests are estimated by the IRS  to exceed the upper limit agreed to by a requester, or when a requester  has failed to state a limit and the costs are estimated to exceed $250,  and the IRS has not then determined to waive or reduce the fees, a  notice shall be sent to the requester. This notice shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Inform the requester of the estimated costs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Extend an offer to the requester to confer with agency personnel  in an attempt to reformulate the request in a manner which shall reduce  the fees and still meet the needs of the requester;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the requester is not amenable to reformulation, which would  reduce fees to under $250, then advance payment of the estimated fees  shall be required; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Inform the requester that the time period, within which the IRS  is obliged to make a determination on the request, shall not begin to  run, pending a reformulation of the request or the receipt of advance  payment from the requester, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Fees for services. The fees for services performed by the IRS  shall be imposed and collected as set forth in this paragraph. No fees  shall be charged if the costs of routine collecting and processing the  fees allowable under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A) are likely to equal or exceed  the amount of the fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Search services. Fees charged for search services are as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Searches for records other than computerized records. The IRS  shall charge for search services at the salary rate(s) (i.e., basic pay  plus 16 percent) of the employee(s) making the search. An average rate  for the range of grades typically involved may be established. Fees may  be charged for search time as prescribed in this section even if the  time spent searching does not yield any records, or if records are  denied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Searches for computerized records. Actual direct cost of the  search, including computer search time, runs, and the operator's salary.  The fee for computer output shall be actual direct costs. For requesters  in the ``other requester'' category, the charge for the computer search  shall begin when the cost of the search (including the operator time and  the cost of operating the computer) equals the equivalent dollar amount  of two hours of the salary of the person performing the search.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Searches requiring travel or transportation. Shipping charges to  transport records from one location to another, or for the  transportation of an employee to the site of requested records when it  is necessary to locate rather than examine the records, shall be at the  rate of the actual cost of such shipping or transportation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Review Services--(A) Review defined. Review is the process of  examining records in response to a commercial use requester, as that  term is defined in paragraph (f)(3)(i)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>, upon initial consideration of  the applicability of an exemption described in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) or an  exclusion described in 5 U.S.C. 552(c) to the requested records, be it  at the initial request or administrative appeal level, to determine  whether any portion of any record responsive to the request is permitted  to be withheld. Review includes doing all that is necessary to excise  and otherwise prepare the records for release. Review does not include  the time spent on resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the  applicability of exemptions to the requested records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Fees charged for review services. The IRS shall charge  commercial use requesters for review of records at the initial  determination stage at the salary rate(s) (i.e., basic pay plus 16  percent) of the employee(s) making the review. An average rate for the  range of grades typically involved may be established by the  Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Duplication other than for tax returns and attachments. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  Duplication fees charged for copies of paper records shall be a  reasonable fee, as the Commissioner may from time to time establish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The actual direct cost of duplication for photographs, films,  videotapes, audiotapes, compact disks, and other materials shall be  charged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Records may be provided to a private contractor for copying and  the requester shall be charged for the actual cost of duplication  charged by the private contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> When other duplication processes not specifically identified  above are requested and provided pursuant to the Freedom of Information  Act, their actual direct cost to the IRS shall be charged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Where the condition of the record does not enable the IRS to  make legible copies, the IRS shall not attempt to reconstruct it. The  official having jurisdiction over the record shall furnish the best copy  that is available and advise the requester of this fact.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Charges for copies of tax returns and attachments, and  transcripts of tax returns. A charge shall be made for each copy of a  tax return and its attachments, and transcripts of tax returns, supplied  in response to a form 4506, ``Request for Copy of Tax Form.'' The amount  of the charge shall be a reasonable fee as computed by the Commissioner  from time to time, and as set forth on form 4506.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Other services. Other services and materials requested (e.g.,  certification, express mailing) which are not specifically covered by  this part and/or not required by the Freedom of Information Act are  provided at the discretion of the IRS and are chargeable at the actual  direct cost to the IRS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Printed material. Certain relevant government publications which  shall be placed on the shelves of the Freedom of Information Reading  Room shall not be sold at that location. Copies of pages of these  publications may be duplicated on the premises and a fee for such  service may be charged in accordance with paragraph (f)(5)(iii) of this  section. A person desiring to purchase the complete publication, for  example, an Internal Revenue Bulletin, should contact the Superintendent  of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Search, duplication, and deletion services with respect to  records open to public inspection pursuant to section 6110. Fees charged  for searching for, making deletions in, and copies of records subject to  public inspection pursuant to section 6110 only upon written request  shall be at the actual cost, as the Commissioner may from time to time  establish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Form of payment. Payment shall be made by check or money order,  payable to the order of the Treasury of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Advance payments. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If previous fees have not been paid in a  timely fashion, as defined in paragraph (f)(10) of this section, or  where the estimated fees exceed $250, the IRS shall require payment in  full of any outstanding fees and all estimated fees prior to processing  a request. Additionally, the IRS reserves the right to require payment  of fees after a request is processed and before any records are released  to a requester. For purposes of this paragraph, a requester is the  individual in whose name a request is made; however, where a request is  made on behalf of another individual, and previous fees have not been  paid within the designated time period by either the requester or the  individual on whose behalf the request is made, then the IRS shall  require payment in full of all outstanding fees and all estimated fees  before processing the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When the IRS acts pursuant to paragraph (f)(9)(i) of this  section, the administrative time limits prescribed in paragraphs (c)(9)  and (10) of this section, plus permissible extensions of these time  limits as prescribed in paragraph (c)(11)(i) of this section, shall  begin only after the IRS official to whom the request is delivered has  received the fees described above in paragraph (f)(9)(i) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Interest. Interest shall be charged to requesters who fail to  pay the fees in a timely fashion; that is, within 30 days following the  day on which the statement of fees as set forth in paragraph (c)(9)(i)  of this section was sent by the IRS official to whom the request was  delivered. Whenever interest is charged, the IRS shall begin assessing  interest on the 31st day following the date the statement of fees was  mailed to the requester. Interest shall be at the rate prescribed in 31  U.S.C. 3717. In addition, the IRS shall take all steps authorized by the  Debt Collection Act of 1982, including administrative offset, disclosure  to consumer reporting agencies, and use of collection agencies, as  otherwise authorized by law to effect payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Aggregating requests. When the IRS official to whom a request  is delivered reasonably believes that a requester or group of requesters  is attempting to break down a request into a series of requests for the  purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the IRS shall aggregate such  requests and charge accordingly, upon notification to the requester and/ or requesters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Business information and contractor proposal procedures--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. Business information provided to the IRS by a business  submitter shall not be disclosed pursuant to a Freedom of Information  Act request except in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition. Business information is any trade secret or other  confidential financial or commercial (including research) information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Notice to business submitters. Except where it is determined  that the information is covered by paragraph (g)(9), the official having  control over the requested records, which includes   business information, shall provide a business submitter with prompt  written notice of a request encompassing its business information  whenever required in accordance with paragraph (g)(4) of this section.  Such written notice shall either describe the exact nature of the  business information requested or provide copies of the records or  portions thereof containing the business information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When notice is required. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For business information submitted  to the IRS prior to October 13, 1987, the official having control over  the requested records shall provide a business submitter with notice of  a request whenever--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The business information was submitted to the IRS upon a  commitment of confidentiality; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The business information was voluntarily submitted and it is of  a kind that would customarily not be released to the public by the  person from whom it was obtained; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The official has reason to believe that disclosure of the  information may result in commercial or financial injury to the business  submitter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For business information submitted to the IRS on or after  October 13, 1987, the IRS shall provide a business submitter with notice  of a request whenever--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The business submitter has designated the information as  commercially or financially sensitive information; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The official has reason to believe that disclosure of the  information may result in commercial or financial injury to the business  submitter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The business submitter's designation that the information is  commercially or financially sensitive information should be supported by  a statement or certification by an officer or authorized representative  of the business providing specific justification that the information in  question is, in fact, confidential commercial or financial information  and has not been disclosed to the public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Notice of a request for business information falling within  paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(A) of this section shall be required for a period  of not more than ten years after the date of submission unless the  business submitter requests, and provides acceptable justification for,  a specific notice period of greater duration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Opportunity to object to disclosure. Through the notice  described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, the official having  control over the requested records shall afford a business submitter ten  days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) within  which to provide the official with a detailed statement of any objection  to disclosure. Such statement shall specify all grounds for withholding  any of the information, with particular attention to why the information  is claimed to be trade secret or commercial or financial information  that is privileged and confidential. Information provided by a business  submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure  under 5 U.S.C. 552.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Notice of intent to disclose. The IRS shall consider a business  submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to  determining whether to disclose business information. Whenever the  official having control over the requested records decides to disclose  business information over the objection of a business submitter, the  official shall forward to the business submitter a written notice which  shall include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A statement of the reasons for which the business submitter's  disclosure objections were not sustained;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A description of the business information to be disclosed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A specified disclosure date, which is ten days (excepting  Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) after the notice of the  final decision to release the requested records has been mailed to the  submitter. Except as otherwise prohibited by law, a copy of the  disclosure notice shall be forwarded to the requester at the same time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Judicial review--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The IRS' disposition of the  request and the submitter's objections shall be subject to judicial  review under paragraph (c)(14) of this section. A requester is not  required to exhaust administrative remedies if a complaint has been  filed   under this paragraph by a business submitter of the information  contained in the requested records. Likewise, a business submitter is  not required to exhaust administrative remedies if a complaint has been  filed by the requester of these records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester brings suit  seeking to compel disclosure of business information covered by  paragraph (g)(4) of this section, the official having control over the  requested records shall promptly provide the business submitter with  written notice thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exception to notice requirement. The notice requirements of  this paragraph shall not apply if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The official having control over the records determines that the  business information shall not be disclosed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The information lawfully has been published or otherwise made  available to the public; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5  U.S.C. 552).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Appeals. Procedures for administrative appeals from denials of  requests for business information are to be processed in accordance with  paragraph (c)(10) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Contractor Proposals. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253b(m), the IRS  shall not release under the Freedom of Information Act any proposal  submitted by a contractor in response to the requirements of a  solicitation for a competitive proposal, unless that proposal is set  forth or incorporated by reference in a contract entered into between  the IRS and the contractor that submitted the proposal. For purposes of  this paragraph, the term proposal means any proposal, including a  technical, management, or cost proposal, submitted by a contractor in  response to the requirements of a solicitation for a competitive  proposal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A copy of the FOIA request for information protected from  disclosure under this paragraph shall be furnished to the contractor who  submitted the proposal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Responsible officials and their addresses.
