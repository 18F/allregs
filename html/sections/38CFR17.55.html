                            <p class="depth0">Except as otherwise provided in this section, payment for public or  private hospital care authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1703 and 38 CFR 17.52  of this part or under 38 U.S.C. 1728 and 38 CFR 17.120 of this part  shall be based on a prospective payment system similar to that used in  the Medicare program for paying for similar inpatient hospital services  in the community. Payment shall be made using the Health Care Financing  Administration (HCFA) PRICER for each diagnosis-related group (DRG)  applicable to the episode of care.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Payment shall be made of the full prospective payment amount per  discharge, as determined according to the methodology in subparts D and  G of 42 CFR part 412, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a veteran who was transferred to another  facility before completion of care, VA shall pay the transferring  hospital an amount calculated by the HCFA PRICER for each patient day of  care, not to exceed the full DRG rate as provided in paragraph (a) of  this section. The hospital that ultimately discharges the patient will  receive the full DRG payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a veteran who has transferred from a hospital  and/or distinct part unit excluded by Medicare from the DRG-based  prospective payment system or from a hospital that does not participate  in Medicare, the transferring hospital will receive a payment for each  patient day of care not to exceed the amount provided in paragraph (i)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> VA shall pay the providing facility the full DRG-based rate or  reasonable cost, without regard to any copayments or deductible required  by any Federal law that is not applicable to VA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the cost or length of a veteran's care exceeds an applicable  threshold amount, as determined by the HCFA PRICER program, VA shall  pay, in addition to the amount payable under paragraph (a) of this  section, an outlier payment calculated by the HCFA PRICER program, in  accordance with subpart F of 42 CFR part 412.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In addition to the amount payable under paragraph (a) of this  section, VA shall pay, for each discharge, an amount to cover the non- Federal hospital's capital-related costs, kidney, heart and liver  acquisition costs incurred by hospitals with approved transplantation  centers, direct costs of medical education, and the costs of qualified  nonphysician anesthetists in small rural hospitals. These amounts will  be determined by the Under Secretary for Health on an annual basis and  published in the ``Notices'' section of the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Payment shall be made only for those services authorized by VA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Payments made in accordance with this section shall constitute  payment in full and the provider or agent for the provider may not  impose any additional charge on a veteran or his or her health care  insurer for any inpatient services for which payment is made by the VA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Hospitals of distinct part hospital units excluded from the  prospective   payment system by Medicare and hospitals that do not participate in  Medicare will be paid at the national cost-to-charge ratio times the  billed charges that are reasonable, usual, customary, and not in excess  of rates or fees the hospital charges the general public for similar  services in the community.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> A hospital participating in an alternative payment system that  has been granted a Federal waiver from the prospective payment system  under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. section 1395f(b)(3) or 42 U.S.C.  section 1395ww(c) for the purposes of Medicare payment shall not be  subject to the payment methodology set forth in this section so long as  such Federal waiver remains in effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Payments for episodes of hospital care furnished in Alaska that  begin during the period starting on the effective date of this section  through the 364th day thereafter will be in the amount determined by the  HCFA PRICER plus 50 percent of the difference between the amount billed  by the hospital and the amount determined by the PRICER. Claims for  services provided during that period will be accepted for payment by VA  under this paragraph (k) until December 31 of the year following the  year in which this section became effective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, VA, for public  or private hospital care covered by this section, will pay the lesser of  the amount determined under paragraphs (a) through (j) of this section  or the amount negotiated with the hospital or its agent.
