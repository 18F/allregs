                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Additional applicability provisions for South Atlantic snapper-grouper. Section 622.11(a) provides the general applicability for bag and possession limits. However, Sec. 622.11(a) notwithstanding:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The bag and other limits specified in Sec. 622.182(b) apply for South Atlantic snapper-grouper in or from the EEZ to a person aboard a vessel for which a commercial permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper has been issued that has on board a longline in the longline closed area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A person aboard a vessel for which a commercial permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper has been issued must comply with the bag limits specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for South Atlantic snapper-grouper taken with a powerhead, regardless of where taken, when such snapper-grouper are possessed in an SMZ specified in Sec. 622.182(a)(1)(xii) through (a)(1)(xviii) or (a)(1)(xl) through (a)(1)(li).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Bag limits--(1) Greater amberjack--1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Grouper and tilefish, combined--3. Within the 3-fish aggregate bag limit:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No more than one fish may be gag or black grouper, combined;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No more than one fish per vessel may be a snowy grouper;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> No more than one fish may be a golden tilefish;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> No more than one fish per vessel may be a blueline tilefish; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> No goliath grouper or Nassau grouper may be retained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Hogfish in the South Atlantic off Florida--5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Snappers, combined--10. However, excluded from this 10-fish bag limit are cubera snapper, measuring 30 inches (76.2 cm), TL, or larger, in the South Atlantic off Florida, and red snapper and vermilion snapper. (See Sec. 622.181(b)(2) for the prohibitions on harvest or possession of red snapper, except during a limited recreational fishing season, and Sec. 622.181(c)(1) for limitations on cubera snapper measuring 30 inches (76.2 cm), TL, or larger, in or from the South Atlantic EEZ off Florida.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Vermilion snapper--5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Red porgy--3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Black sea bass--5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> South Atlantic snapper-grouper, combined--20. However, excluded from this 20-fish bag limit are tomtate, South Atlantic snapper-grouper ecosystem component species (specified in Table 4 of Appendix A to part 622), and those specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) and paragraphs (b)(9) and (10) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Red snapper--0, except during a limited recreational fishing season, as specified in Sec. 622.183(b)(5), during which time the bag limit is 1 fish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> No more than one fish per vessel may be a wreckfish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Longline bag limits. Other provisions of this paragraph (b) notwithstanding, a person on a trip aboard a vessel for which the bag limits apply that has a longline on board is limited on that trip to the bag limit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper for which a bag limit is specified in this paragraph (b), and to zero for all other South Atlantic snapper-grouper. For the purposes of this paragraph (b)(11), a vessel is considered to have a longline on board when a power-operated longline hauler, a cable or monofilament of diameter and length suitable for use in the longline fishery, and gangions are on board. Removal of any one of these elements constitutes removal of a longline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Possession limits. (1) Provided each passenger is issued and has in possession a receipt issued on behalf of the vessel that verifies the duration of the trip--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A person aboard a charter vessel or headboat on a trip that spans more than 24 hours may possess no more than two daily bag limits of species other than red porgy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A person aboard a headboat on a trip that spans more than 48 hours and who can document that fishing was conducted on at least 3 days may possess no more than three daily bag limits of species other than red porgy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A person aboard a vessel may not possess red porgy in or from the EEZ in excess of three per day or three per trip, whichever is more restrictive.
