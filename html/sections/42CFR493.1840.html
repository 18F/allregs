                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Adverse action based on actions of the laboratory's owner, operator or employees. CMS may initiate adverse action to suspend, limit or revoke any CLIA certificate if CMS finds that a laboratory's owner or operator or one of its employees has--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Been guilty of misrepresentation in obtaining a CLIA certificate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Performed, or represented the laboratory as entitled to perform, a laboratory examination or other procedure that is not within a category of laboratory examinations or other procedures authorized by its CLIA certificate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Failed to comply with the certificate requirements and performance standards;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Failed to comply with reasonable requests by CMS for any information or work on materials that CMS concludes is necessary to determine the laboratory's continued eligibility for its CLIA certificate or continued compliance with performance standards set by CMS;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Refused a reasonable request by CMS or its agent for permission to inspect the laboratory and its operation and pertinent records during the hours that the laboratory is in operation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Violated or aided and abetted in the violation of any provisions of CLIA and its implementing regulations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Failed to comply with an alternative sanction imposed under this subpart; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Within the preceding two-year period, owned or operated a laboratory that had its CLIA certificate revoked. (This provision applies only to the owner or operator, not to all of the laboratory's employees.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Adverse action based on improper referrals in proficiency testing. If CMS determines that a laboratory has intentionally referred its proficiency testing samples to another laboratory for analysis, CMS does one of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> Revokes the laboratory's CLIA certificate for at least 1 year, prohibits the owner and operator from owning or operating a CLIA-certified laboratory for at least 1 year, and may impose a civil money penalty in accordance with Sec. 493.1834(d), if CMS determines that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Revokes the laboratory's CLIA certificate for at least 1 year, prohibits the owner and operator from owning or operating a CLIA-certified laboratory for at least 1 year, and may impose a civil money penalty in accordance with Sec. 493.1834(d), if CMS determines that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A proficiency testing referral is a repeat proficiency testing referral as defined at Sec. 493.2; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> On or before the proficiency testing event close date, a laboratory reported proficiency testing results obtained from another laboratory to the proficiency testing program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Following the revocation of a CLIA certificate in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, CMS may exempt a laboratory owner from the generally applicable prohibition on owning or operating a CLIA-certified laboratory under paragraph (a)(8) of this section on a laboratory-by-laboratory basis if CMS finds, after review of the relevant facts and circumstances, that there is no evidence that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Patients would be put at risk as a result of the owner being exempted from the ban on a laboratory-by-laboratory basis;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The laboratory for which the owner is to be exempted from the general ownership ban participated in or was otherwise complicit in the PT referral of the laboratory that resulted in the revocation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The laboratory for which the owner is to be exempted from the general ownership ban received a PT sample from another laboratory in the prior two survey cycles, and failed to immediately report such receipt to CMS or to the appropriate CMS-approved accrediting organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Suspends or limits the CLIA certificate for less than 1 year based on the criteria in Sec. 493.1804(d) and imposes alternative sanctions as appropriate, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 493.1804(c) and (d), 493.1806(c), 493.1807(b), 493.1809 and, in the case of civil money penalties, Sec. 493.1834(d), when CMS determines that paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section does not apply but that the laboratory obtained test results for the proficiency testing samples from another laboratory on or before the proficiency testing event close date. Among other possibilities, alternative sanctions will always include a civil money penalty and a directed plan of correction that includes required training of staff.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Imposes alternative sanctions in accordance with Sec. Sec. 493.1804(c) and (d), 493.1806(c), 493.1807(b), 493.1809 and, in the case of civil money penalties, Sec. 493.1834(d), when CMS determines that paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (2) of this section do not apply, and a PT referral has occurred, but no test results are received prior to the event close date by the referring laboratory from the laboratory that received the referral. Among other possibilities, alternative sanctions will always include a civil money penalty and a directed plan of correction that includes required training of staff.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Adverse action based on exclusion from Medicare. If the OIG excludes a laboratory from participation in Medicare, CMS suspends the laboratory's CLIA certificate for the period during which the laboratory is excluded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Procedures for suspension or limitation--(1) Basic rule. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, CMS does not suspend or limit a CLIA certificate until after an ALJ hearing decision (as provided in Sec. 493.1844) that upholds suspension or limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. CMS may suspend or limit a CLIA certificate before the ALJ hearing in any of the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The laboratory's deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The laboratory has refused a reasonable request for information or work on materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The laboratory has refused permission for CMS or a CMS agent to inspect the laboratory or its operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Procedures for revocation. (1) CMS does not revoke any type of CLIA certificate until after an ALJ hearing that upholds revocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> CMS may revoke a CLIA certificate after the hearing decision even if it had not previously suspended or limited that certificate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Notice to the OIG. CMS notifies the OIG of any violations under paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(6), and (b) of this section within 30 days of the determination of the violation.
