                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. This section sets forth general policies and procedures that are the basis for the CHAMPUS cost-sharing of medical services and supplies provided by institutions, individuals, or other types of providers. Providers seeking payment from the Federal Government through programs such as CHAMPUS have a duty to familiarize themselves with, and comply with, the program requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Listing of provider does not guarantee payment of benefits. The fact that a type of provider is listed in this section is not to be construed to mean that CHAMPUS will automatically pay a claim for services or supplies provided by such a provider. The provider who actually furnishes the service(s) must, in fact, meet all licensing and other requirements established by this part to be an authorized provider; the provider must not be the subject of sanction under Sec. 199.9; and, cost-sharing of the services must not otherwise be prohibited by this part. In addition, the patient must in fact be an eligible beneficiary and the services or supplies billed must be authorized and medically necessary, regardless of the standing of the provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Outside the United States or emergency situations within the United States. Outside the United States or within the United States and Puerto Rico in emergency situations, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, after review of the facts, may provide payment to or on behalf of a beneficiary who receives otherwise covered services or supplies from a provider of service that does not meet the standards described in this part.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Only the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or the Secretary of Transportation, or their designees, may authorize (in emergency situations) payment to civilian facilities in the United States that are not in compliance with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. For the purpose of the Civil Rights Act only, the United States includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, Wake Island, Canal Zone, and the territories and possessions of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Dual compensation/Conflict of interest. Title 5, United States Code, section 5536 prohibits medical personnel who are active duty Uniformed Service members or civilian employees of the Government from receiving additional Government compensation above their normal pay and allowances for medical care furnished. In addition, Uniformed Service members and civilian employees of the Government are generally prohibited by law and agency regulations and policies from participating in apparent or actual conflict of interest situations in which a potential for personal gain exists or in which there is an appearance of impropriety or incompatibility with the performance of their official duties or responsibilities. The Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, and Transportation have a responsibility, when disbursing appropriated funds in the payment of CHAMPUS benefits, to ensure that the laws and regulations are not violated. Therefore, active duty Uniformed Service members (including a reserve member while on active duty and civilian employees of the United States Government shall not be authorized to be CHAMPUS providers. While individual employees of the Government may be able to demonstrate that the furnishing of care to CHAMPUS beneficiaries may not be incompatible with their official duties and responsibilities, the processing of millions of CHAMPUS claims each year does not enable Program administrators to efficiently review the status of the provider on each claim to ensure that no conflict of interest or dual compensation situation exists. The problem is further complicated given the numerous interagency agreements (for example, resource sharing arrangements between the Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration in the provision of health care) and other unique arrangements which exist at individual treatment facilities around the country. While an individual provider may be prevented from being an authorized CHAMPUS provider even though no conflict of interest or dual compensation situation exists, it is essential for CHAMPUS to have an easily administered, uniform rule which will ensure compliance with

the existing laws and regulations. Therefore, a provider who is an active duty Uniformed Service member or civilian employee of the Government shall not be an authorized CHAMPUS provider. In addition, a provider shall certify on each CHAMPUS claim that he/she is not an active duty Uniformed Service member or civilian employee of the Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Utilization review and quality assurance. Providers approved as authorized CHAMPUS providers have certain obligations to provide services and supplies under CHAMPUS which are (i) furnished at the appropriate level and only when and to the extent medically necessary under the criteria of this part; (ii) of a quality that meets professionally recognized standards of health care; and, (iii) supported by adequate medical documentation as may be reasonably required under this part by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, to evidence the medical necessity and quality of services furnished, as well as the appropriateness of the level of care. Therefore, the authorization of CHAMPUS benefits is contingent upon the services and supplies furnished by any provider being subject to pre-payment or post-payment utilization and quality assurance review under professionally recognized standards, norms, and criteria, as well as any standards or criteria issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, pursuant to this part. (Refer to Secs. 199.4, 199.5, and 199.7 of this part.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Exclusion of beneficiary liability. In connection with certain utilization review, quality assurance and preauthorization requirements of section 199.4 of this part, providers may not hold patients liable for payment for certain services for which CHAMPUS payment is disallowed. With respect to such services, providers may not seek payment from the patient or the patient's family. Any such effort to seek payment is a basis for termination of the provider's authorized status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Provider required. In order to be considered for benefits, all services and supplies shall be rendered by, prescribed by, or furnished at the direction of, or on the order of a CHAMPUS-authorized provider practicing within the scope of his or her license.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Participating providers. A CHAMPUS-authorized provider is a participating provider, as defined in Sec. 199.2 under the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Mandatory participation. (A) An institutional provider in Sec. 199.6(b), in order to be an authorized provider under TRICARE, must be a participating provider for all claims.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An institutional provider in Sec. 199.6(b), in order to be an authorized provider under TRICARE, must be a participating provider for all claims.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A SNF or a HHA, in order to be an authorized provider under TRICARE, must enter into a participation agreement with TRICARE for all claims.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Corporate services providers authorized as CHAMPUS providers under the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section must enter into a participation agreement as provided by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Voluntary participation--(A) Total claims participation: The participating provider program. A CHAMPUS-authorized provider that is not required to participate by this part may become a participating provider by entering into an agreement or memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, which includes, but is not limited to, the provisions of paragraph (a)(13) of this section. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may include in a participating provider agreement/MOU provisions that establish between CHAMPUS and a class, category, type, or specific provider, uniform procedures and conditions which encourage provider participation while improving beneficiary access to benefits and contributing to CHAMPUS efficiency. Such provisions shall be otherwise allowed by this part or by DoD Directive or DoD Instruction specifically pertaining to CHAMPUS claims participation. Participating provider program provisions may be incorporated into an agreement/MOU to establish a specific CHAMPUS-provider relationship, such as a preferred provider arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Total claims participation: The participating provider program. A CHAMPUS-authorized provider that is not required to participate by this part may become a participating provider by entering into an agreement or memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, which includes, but is not limited to, the provisions of paragraph (a)(13) of this section. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may include in a participating provider agreement/MOU provisions that establish between CHAMPUS and a class, category, type, or specific provider, uniform procedures and conditions which encourage provider participation while improving beneficiary access to benefits and contributing to CHAMPUS efficiency. Such provisions shall be otherwise allowed by this part or by DoD Directive or DoD Instruction specifically pertaining to CHAMPUS claims participation. Participating provider program provisions may be incorporated into an agreement/MOU to establish a specific CHAMPUS-provider relationship, such as a preferred provider arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Claim-specific participation. A CHAMPUS-authorized provider that is not required to participate and that has not entered into a participation agreement pursuant to paragraph (a)(8)(ii)(A) of this section may elect to

be a participating provider on a claim-by-claim basis by indicating ``accept assignment'' on each claim form for which participation is elected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Claim-by-claim participation. Individual providers that are not participating providers pursuant to paragraph (a)(8)(ii) of this section may elect to participate on a claim-by-claim basis. They may do so by signing the appropriate space on the claims form and submitting it to the appropriate TRICARE contractor on behalf of the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Limitation to authorized institutional provider designation. Authorized institutional provider status granted to a specific institutional provider applicant does not extend to any institution-affiliated provider, as defined in Sec. 199.2, of that specific applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Authorized provider. A hospital or institutional provider, physician, or other individual professional provider, or other provider of services or supplies specifically authorized in this chapter to provide benefits under CHAMPUS. In addition, to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider, any hospital which is a CHAMPUS participating provider under paragraph (a)(7) of this section, shall be a participating provider for all care, services, or supplies furnished to an active duty member of the uniformed services for which the active duty member is entitled under 10 U.S.C. 1074(c). As a participating provider for active duty members, the CHAMPUS authorized hospital shall provide such care, services, and supplies in accordance with the payment rules of Sec. 199.16 of this part. The failure of any CHAMPUS participating hospital to be a participating provider for any active duty member subjects the hospital to termination of the hospital's status as a CHAMPUS authorized provider for failure to meet the qualifications established by this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Balance billing limits--(i) In general. Individual providers including providers salaried or under contract by an institutional provider and other providers who are not participating providers may not balance bill a beneficiary an amount that exceeds the applicable balance billing limit. The balance billing limit shall be the same percentage as the Medicare limiting charge percentage for nonparticipating practitioners and suppliers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Individual providers including providers salaried or under contract by an institutional provider and other providers who are not participating providers may not balance bill a beneficiary an amount that exceeds the applicable balance billing limit. The balance billing limit shall be the same percentage as the Medicare limiting charge percentage for nonparticipating practitioners and suppliers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Waiver. The balance billing limit may be waived by the Director, OCHAMPUS on a case-by-case basis if requested by a CHAMPUS beneficiary. A decision by the Director, OCHAMPUS to waive or not waive the limit in any particular case is not subject to the appeal and hearing procedures of Sec. 199.10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Compliance. Failure to comply with the balance billing limit shall be considered abuse and/or fraud and grounds of exclusion or suspension of the provider under Sec. 199.9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Medical records. CHAMPUS-authorized provider organizations and individuals providing clinical services shall maintain adequate clinical records to substantiate that specific care was actually furnished, was medically necessary, and appropriate, and identify(ies) the individual(s) who provided the care. This applies whether the care is inpatient or outpatient. The minimum requirements for medical record documentation are set forth by all of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The cognizant state licensing authority;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, or the appropriate Qualified Accreditation Organization as defined in Sec. 199.2;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Standards of practice established by national medical organizations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> This part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Participation agreements. A participation agreement otherwise required by this part shall include, in part, all of the following provisions requiring that the provider shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Not charge a beneficiary for the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Services for which the provider is entitled to payment from CHAMPUS;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Services for which the beneficiary would be entitled to have CHAMPUS payment made had the provider complied with certain procedural requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Services not medically necessary and appropriate for the clinical management of the presenting illness, injury, disorder or maternity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Services for which a beneficiary would be entitled to payment but for a

reduction or denial in payment as a result of quality review; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Services rendered during a period in which the provider was not in compliance with one or more conditions of authorization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Comply with the applicable provisions of this part and related CHAMPUS administrative policy;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Accept the CHAMPUS determined allowable payment combined with the cost-share, deductible, and other health insurance amounts payable by, or on behalf of, the beneficiary, as full payment for CHAMPUS allowed services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Collect from the CHAMPUS beneficiary those amounts that the beneficiary has a liability to pay for the CHAMPUS deductible and cost-share;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Permit access by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, to the clinical record of any CHAMPUS beneficiary, to the financial and organizational records of the provider, and to reports of evaluations and inspections conducted by state, private agencies or organizations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Provide the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, prompt written notification of the provider's employment of an individual who, at any time during the twelve months preceding such employment, was employed in a managerial, accounting, auditing, or similar capacity by an agency or organization which is responsible, directly or indirectly for decisions regarding Department of Defense payments to the provider;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Cooperate fully with a designated utilization and clinical quality management organization which has a contract with the Department of Defense for the geographic area in which the provider renders services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Obtain written authorization before rendering designated services or items for which CHAMPUS cost-share may be expected;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Maintain clinical and other records related to individuals for whom CHAMPUS payment was made for services rendered by the provider, or otherwise under arrangement, for a period of 60 months from the date of service;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Maintain contemporaneous clinical records that substantiate the clinical rationale for each course of treatment, periodic evaluation of the efficacy of treatment, and the outcome at completion or discontinuation of treatment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Refer CHAMPUS beneficiaries only to providers with which the referring provider does not have an economic interest, as defined in Sec. 199.2; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Limit services furnished under arrangement to those for which receipt of payment by the CHAMPUS authorized provider discharges the payment liability of the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Implementing instructions. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall issue CHAMPUS policies, instructions, procedures, and guidelines, as may be necessary to implement the intent of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Exclusion. Regardless of any provision in this section, a provider who is suspended, excluded, or terminated under Sec. 199.9 of this part is specifically excluded as an authorized CHAMPUS provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Institutional providers--(1) General. Institutional providers are those providers who bill for services in the name of an organizational entity (such as hospital and skilled nursing facility), rather than in the name of a person. The term ``institutional provider'' does not include professional corporations or associations qualifying as a domestic corporation under Sec. 301.7701-5 of the Internal Revenue Service Regulations nor does it include other corporations that provide principally professional services. Institutional providers may provide medical services and supplies on either an inpatient or outpatient basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. Institutional providers are those providers who bill for services in the name of an organizational entity (such as hospital and skilled nursing facility), rather than in the name of a person. The term ``institutional provider'' does not include professional corporations or associations qualifying as a domestic corporation under Sec. 301.7701-5 of the Internal Revenue Service Regulations nor does it include other corporations that provide principally professional services. Institutional providers may provide medical services and supplies on either an inpatient or outpatient basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Preauthorization. Preauthorization may be required by the Director, OCHAMPUS for any health care service for which payment is sought under CHAMPUS. (See Secs. 199.4 and 199.15 for further information on preauthorization requirements.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Billing practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Each institutional billing, including those institutions subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based reimbursement method or a CHAMPUS-determined all-inclusive rate reimbursement method, must be itemized fully and sufficiently descriptive for the CHAMPUS to make a determination of benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Institutional claims subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based reimbursement method or a CHAMPUS-determined all-inclusive rate reimbursement method, may be submitted only after the beneficiary has been discharged or transferred from the institutional provider's facility or program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Institutional claims for Residential Treatment Centers and all other institutional providers, except those listed in (B) above, should be submitted to the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary at least every 30 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Nondiscrimination policy. Except as provided below, payment may not be made for inpatient or outpatient care provided and billed by an institutional provider found by the Federal Government to practice discrimination in the admission of patients to its services on the basis of race, color, or national origin. Reimbursement may not be made to a beneficiary who pays for care provided by such a facility and submits a claim for reimbursement. In the following circumstances, the Secretary of Defense, or a designee, may authorize payment for care obtained in an ineligible facility:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Emergency care. Emergency inpatient or outpatient care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Care rendered before finding of a violation. Care initiated before a finding of a violation and which continues after such violation when it is determined that a change in the treatment facility would be detrimental to the health of the patient, and the attending physician so certifies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other facility not available. Care provided in an ineligible facility because an eligible facility is not available within a reasonable distance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Procedures for qualifying as a CHAMPUS-approved institutional provider. General and special hospitals otherwise meeting the qualifications outlined in paragraphs (b)(4) (i), (ii), and (iii), of this section are not required to request CHAMPUS approval formally.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> JCAH accreditation status. Each CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary shall keep informed as to the current JCAH accreditation status of all hospitals and skilled nursing facilities in its area; and the provider's status under Medicare, particularly with regard to compliance with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d(1)). The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall specifically approve all other authorized institutional providers providing services to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. At the discretion of the Director, OCHAMPUS, any facility that is certified and participating as a provider of services under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare), may be deemed to meet CHAMPUS requirements. The facility must be providing a type and level of service that is authorized by this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Required to comply with criteria. Facilities seeking CHAMPUS approval will be expected to comply with appropriate criteria set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. They also are required to complete and submit CHAMPUS Form 200, ``Required Information, Facility Determination Instructions,'' and provide such additional information as may be requested by OCHAMPUS. An onsite evaluation, either scheduled or unscheduled, may be conducted at the discretion of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. The final determination regarding approval, reapproval, or disapproval of a facility will be provided in writing to the facility and the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Notice of peer review rights. All health care facilities subject to the DRG-based payment system shall provide CHAMPUS beneficiaries, upon admission, with information about peer review including their appeal rights. The notices shall be in a form specified by the Director, OCHAMPUS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Surveying of facilities. The surveying of newly established institutional providers and the periodic resurveying of all authorized institutional providers is a continuing process conducted by OCHAMPUS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Institutions not in compliance with CHAMPUS standards. If a determination is made that an institution is not in compliance with one or more of the standards applicable to its specific category of institution, CHAMPUS shall take immediate steps to bring about compliance or terminate the approval as an authorized institution in accordance with Sec. 199.9(f)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Participation agreements required for some hospitals which are not Medicare-participating. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (B)(3), a hospital which is subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system but which is not a Medicare-participating hospital must request and sign an agreement with OCHAMPUS. By signing the agreement, the hospital agrees to participate on all CHAMPUS inpatient claims and accept the requirements for a participating provider as contained in paragraph (a)(8) of Sec. 199.6. Failure to sign such an agreement shall disqualify such hospital as a CHAMPUS-approved institutional provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Categories of institutional providers. The following categories of institutional providers may be reimbursed by CHAMPUS for services provided CHAMPUS beneficiaries subject to any and all definitions, conditions, limitation, and exclusions specified or enumerated in this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Hospitals, acute care, general and special. An institution that provides inpatient services, that also may provide outpatient services (including clinical and ambulatory surgical services), and that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is engaged primarily in providing to inpatients, by or under the supervision of physicians, diagnostic and therapeutic services for the medical or surgical diagnosis and treatment of illness, injury, or bodily malfunction (including maternity).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Maintains clinical records on all inpatients (and outpatients if the facility operates an outpatient department or emergency room).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Has bylaws in effect with respect to its operations and medical staff.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Has a requirement that every patient be under the care of a physician.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Provides 24-hour nursing service rendered or supervised by a registered professional nurse, and has a licensed practical nurse or registered professional nurse on duty at all times.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Has in effect a hospital utilization review plan that is operational and functioning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> In the case of an institution in a state in which state or applicable local law provides for the licensing of hospitals, the hospital:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is licensed pursuant to such law, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is approved by the agency of such state or locality responsible for licensing hospitals as meeting the standards established for such licensing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Has in effect an operating plan and budget.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Is accredited by the JCAH or meets such other requirements as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Transportation, or the Secretary of Defense finds necessary in the interest of the health and safety of patients who are admitted to and furnished services in the institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Organ transplant centers. To obtain TRICARE approval as an organ transplant center, the center must be a Medicare approved transplant center or meet the criteria as established by the Executive Director, TMA, or a designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Organ transplant consortia. TRICARE shall approve individual pediatric organ transplant centers that meet the criteria established by the Executive Director, TMA, or a designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Hospitals, psychiatric. A psychiatric hospital is an institution which is engaged primarily in providing services to inpatients for the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> There are two major categories of psychiatric hospitals:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The private psychiatric hospital category includes both proprietary and the not-for-profit nongovernmental institutions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The second category is those psychiatric hospitals that are controlled, financed, and operated by departments or agencies of the local, state, or Federal Government and always are operated on a not-for-profit basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In order for the services of a psychiatric hospital to be covered, the hospital shall comply with the provisions outlined in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. All psychiatric hospitals shall be accredited under the JCAHO Accreditation Manual for Hospitals (AMH) standards in order for their services to be cost-shared under CHAMPUS. In the case of those psychiatric hospitals that are not JCAHO-

accredited because they have not been in operation a sufficient period of time to be eligible to request an accreditation survey by the JCAHO, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may grant temporary approval if the hospital is certified and participating under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare, Part A). This temporary approval expires 12 months from the date on which the psychiatric hospital first becomes eligible to request an accreditation survey by the JCAHO.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Factors to be considered in determining whether CHAMPUS will cost-share care provided in a psychiatric hospital include, but are not limited to, the following considerations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is the prognosis of the patient such that care provided will lead to resolution or remission of the mental illness to the degree that the patient is of no danger to others, can perform routine daily activities, and can be expected to function reasonably outside the inpatient setting?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Can the services being provided be provided more economically in another facility or on an outpatient basis?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Are the charges reasonable?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Is the care primarily custodial or domiciliary? (Custodial or domiciliary care of the permanently mentally ill or retarded is not a benefit under the Basic Program.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Although psychiatric hospitals are accredited under the JCAHO AMH standards, their medical records must be maintained in accordance with the JCAHO Consolidated Standard Manual for Child, Adolescent, and Adult Psychiatric, Alcoholism, and Drug Abuse Facilities and Facilities Serving the Mentally Retarded, along with the requirements set forth in Sec. 199.7(b)(3). The hospital is responsible for assuring that patient services and all treatment are accurately documented and completed in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Hospitals, long-term (tuberculosis, chronic care, or rehabilitation). To be considered a long-term hospital, an institution for patients that have tuberculosis or chronic diseases must be an institution (or distinct part of an institution) primarily engaged in providing by or under the supervision of a physician appropriate medical or surgical services for the diagnosis and active treatment of the illness or condition in which the institution specializes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In order for the service of long-term hospitals to be covered, the hospital must comply with the provisions outlined in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section.

Written contemporaneous documentation of the referring physician's basis for referral and ongoing communication between the referring and treating provider regarding the oversight of the treatment rendered as a result of the referral must meet all requirements for medical records established by this part. Referring physician supervision does not require physical location on the premises of the treating provider or at the site of treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Subject to section 1079(a) of title 10, U.S.C., chapter 55, a physician or other health care practitioner who is eligible to receive reimbursement for services provided under Medicare (as defined in section 1086(d)(3)(C) of title 10 U.S.C., chapter 55) shall be considered approved to provide medical care authorized under section 1079 and section 1086 of title 10, U.S.C., chapter 55 unless the administering Secretaries have information indicating Medicare, TRICARE, or other Federal health care program integrity violations by the physician or other health care practitioner.

For the purposes of CHAMPUS, a pastoral counselor is an individual who meets the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Recognized graduate professional education with the minimum of an earned master's degree from a regionally accredited educational institution in an appropriate behavioral science field, mental health discipline; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The following experience:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Either 200 hours of approved supervision in the practice of pastoral counseling, ordinarily to be completed in a 2- to 3-year period, of which at least 100 hours must be in individual supervision.

Such communication will be made at the end of the treatment, or more frequently, as required by the referring physician (refer to Sec. 199.7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Because of the similarity of the requirements for licensure, certification, experience, and education, a pastoral counselor may elect to be authorized under CHAMPUS as a certified marriage and family therapist, and as such, be subject to all previously defined criteria for the certified marriage

and family therapist category, to include acceptance of the CHAMPUS determined allowable charge as payment in full, except for applicable deductibles and cost-shares (i.e., balance billing of a beneficiary above the allowable charge is prohibited; may not bill beneficiary for noncovered care). The pastoral counselor must also agree to enter into the same participation agreement as a certified marriage and family therapist with the Office of CHAMPUS within which the pastoral counselor agrees to all provisions including licensure, national association membership and conditions upon termination, outlined above for certified marriage and family therapist.</p><p class="depth0">Note: No dual status will be recognized by the Office of CHAMPUS. Pastoral counselors must elect to become one of the categories of extramedical CHAMPUS provides specified above. Once authorized as either a pastoral counselor, or a certified marriage and family therapist, claims review and reimbursement will be in accordance with the criteria established for the elected provider category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Supervised mental health counselor. For the purposes of TRICARE, a supervised mental health counselor is an individual who does not meet the requirements of a TRICARE certified mental health counselor in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(N) of this section, but meets all of the following requirements and conditions of practice:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Minimum of a master's degree in mental health counseling or allied mental health field from a regionally accredited institution; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Two years of post-masters experience which includes 3,000 hours of clinical work and 100 hours of face-to-face supervision; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Is licensed or certified to practice as a mental health counselor by the jurisdiction where practicing (see paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(D) of this section for more specific information); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> May only be reimbursed when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The TRICARE beneficiary is referred for therapy by a physician; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A physician is providing ongoing oversight and supervision of the therapy being provided; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The mental health counselor certifies on each claim for reimbursement that a written communication has been made or will be made to the referring physician of the results of the treatment. Such communication will be made at the end of the treatment, or more frequently, as required by the referring physician (refer to Sec. 199.7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The following additional information applies to each of the above categories of extramedical individual providers:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> These providers must also be licensed or certified to practice as a certified marriage and family therapist, pastoral counselor or mental health counselor by the jurisdiction where practicing. In jurisdictions that do not provide for licensure or certification, the provider must be certified by or eligible for full clinical membership in the appropriate national professional association that sets standards for the specific profession.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Grace period for therapists or counselors in states where licensure/certification is optional. CHAMPUS is providing a grace period for those therapists or counselors who did not obtain optional licensure/certification in their jurisdiction, not realizing it was a CHAMPUS requirement for authorization. The exemption by state law for pastoral counselors may have misled this group into thinking licensure was not required. The same situation may have occurred with the other therapist or counselor categories where licensure was either not mandated by the state or was provided under a more general category such as ``professional counselors.'' This grace period pertains only to the licensure/certification requirement, applies only to therapists or counselors who are already approved as of October 29, 1990, and only in those areas where the licensure/certification is optional. Any therapist or counselor who is not licensed/certified in the state in which he/she is practicing by August 1, 1991, will be terminated under the provisions of Sec. 199.9. This grace period does not change any of the other existing requirements which remain in effect. During this grace period, membership or proof of eligibility for full clinical membership in a recognized professional association is required for those therapists or counselors who are not licensed or certified by the state. The following organizations are recognized for therapists or

counselors at the level indicated: Full clinical member of the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy; membership at the fellow or diplomate level of the American Association of Pastoral Counselors; and membership in the National Academy of Certified Clinical Mental Health Counselors. Acceptable proof of eligibility for membership is a letter from the appropriate certifying organization. This opportunity for delayed certification/licensure is limited to the counselor or therapist category only as the language in all of the other provider categories has been consistent and unmodified from the time each of the other provider categories were added. The grace period does not apply in those states where licensure is mandatory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Christian Science practitioners and Christian Science nurses. CHAMPUS cost-shares the services of Christian Science practitioners and nurses. In order to bill as such, practitioners or nurses must be listed or be eligible for listing in the Christian Science Journal \1\ at the time the service is provided.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Copies of this journal can be obtained through the Christian Science Publishing Company, 1 Norway Street, Boston, MA 02115-3122 or the Christian Science Publishing Society, P.O.
