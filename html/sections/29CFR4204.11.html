                                Sec. 4204.11  Variance of the bond/escrow and sale-contract
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>  is satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requests after posting of bond or establishment of escrow. A  request for a variance may be submitted at any time. If, after a  purchaser has posted a bond or placed money in escrow pursuant to  section 4204(a)(1)(B) of ERISA, the purchaser demonstrates to the  satisfaction of the plan that the criterion in either Sec. 4204.13  (a)(1) or (a)(2) is satisfied, then the bond shall be cancelled or the  amount in escrow shall be refunded. For purposes of considering a  request after the bond or escrow is in   place, the words ``the year preceding the date of the variance request''  shall be substituted for ``the date of determination'' for the first  mention of that term in both Sec. 4204.13 (a)(1) and (a)(2). In  addition, in determining the purchaser's average net income after taxes  under Sec. 4204.13(a)(1), for any year included in the average for which  the net income figure does not reflect the interest expense incurred  with respect to the sale, the purchaser's net income shall be reduced by  the amount of interest paid with respect to the sale in the fiscal year  following the date of determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Information required. A request for a variance shall contain  financial or other information that is sufficient to establish that one  of the criteria in Sec. 4204.12 or Sec. 4204.13(a) is satisfied. A  request on the basis of either Sec. 4204.13 (a)(1) or (a)(2) shall also  include a copy of the purchaser's audited (if available) or (if not)  unaudited financial statements for the specified time period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limited exemption during pendency of request. Provided that all  of the information required to be submitted is submitted before the  first day of the first plan year beginning after the sale, a plan may  not, pending its decision on the variance, require a purchaser to post a  bond or place an amount in escrow pursuant to section 4204(a)(1)(B). In  the event a bond or escrow is not in place pursuant to the preceding  sentence, and the plan determines that the request does not qualify for  a variance, the purchaser shall comply with section 4204(a)(1)(B) within  30 days after the date on which it receives notice of the plan's  decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Method and date of issuance. The PBGC applies the rules in  subpart B of part 4000 of this chapter to determine permissible methods  of issuance under this subpart. The PBGC applies the rules in subpart C  of part 4000 of this chapter to determine the date that an issuance  under this subpart was provided.
