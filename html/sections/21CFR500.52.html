                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The use of terms such as tonic, tone, toner, and similar terms in the labeling of a product intended for use in or on animals implies that such product is capable of a therapeutic effect(s) and causes such a product to be a drug within the meaning of section 201(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The unqualified use of such terms in a product's labeling fails to provide adequate directions and indications for use of such product and causes it to be misbranded within the meaning of section 502(a) and (f)(1) of the act. The terms tonic, tone, toner, and similar terms may be used in labeling only when appropriately qualified so as to fully inform the user regarding the intended use(s) of the product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The unqualified use of the term conditioner and similar terms in the labeling of a product intended for use in or on animals implies that such product is capable of a therapeutic effect(s) and causes such a product to be a drug within the meaning of section 201(g) of the act. The unqualified use of such terms in a product's labeling fails to provide adequate directions and indications for use of such product and causes it to be misbranded within the meaning of section 502(a) and (f)(1) of the act. The term conditioner and similar terms may be used in labeling only when appropriately qualified so as to fully inform the user regarding the intended use(s) of the product. A product labeled as a ``conditioner'' or with a similar term can be either a food or drug depending upon the manner in which the term is qualified in the labeling to reflect the product's intended use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An article so qualified as to be represented as a drug must be the subject of an approved new animal drug application unless the use of the article under the conditions set forth in its labeling is generally recognized as safe and effective among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs.</p>
