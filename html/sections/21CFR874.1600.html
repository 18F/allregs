                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. An olfactory test device is used to determine  whether an olfactory loss is present. The device includes one or more  odorants that are presented to the patient's nose to subjectively assess  the patient's ability to perceive odors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II (special controls). The special control  for these devices is the FDA guidance document entitled ``Class II  Special Controls Guidance Document: Olfactory Test Device.'' For the  availability of this guidance document, see Sec. 874.1(e). The device  is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of  part 807 of this chapter subject to the limitations in Sec. 874.9. When  indicated for the screening or diagnosis of diseases or conditions other  than the loss of olfactory function, the device is not exempt from  premarket notification procedures.
