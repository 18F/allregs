                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office  to which a potential applicant would go to seek program information and  request application materials will notify the applicant of the major  environmental requirements applicable to the type of assistance being  sought. Emphasis should be placed on describing FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354's natural resource management policies,  the nature and purpose of the environmental impact assessment process,  and the permissible actions of the applicant during this process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a preapplication is either filed by the applicant or  required by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for a  project not categorically excluded, the prospective applicant will be  requested to complete Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 1940-20 at the time of the issuance of Form AD-622, ``Notice of  Preapplication Review Action,'' or other notice inviting an application.  Form AD-622 will clearly inform the applicant that during the period of  application review, the applicant is to take no actions or incur any  obligations which would either limit the range of alternatives to be  considered or which would have an adverse effect on the environment, and  that satisfactory completion of the environmental review process must  occur prior to the issuance of the letter of conditions for Community  Programs and prior to loan approval for all other programs where a  preapplication is used. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 must make its environmental reviews simultaneously with other  loan processing actions so that they are an integral part of the loan  process. Whenever the potential for a major adverse environmental impact  is recognized, such as issues pertaining to floodplains, wetlands,  endangered species, or the need for an EIS, priority consideration will  be given to resolving this issue by appropriate FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 staff. Loan processing need not cease  during this resolution period, but loan processing actions will not be  taken that might limit alternatives to be considered or whose outcome  may be affected by the environmental review. The environmental impact  review (whether a categorical exclusion, environmental assessment or  EIS) must be completed prior to the issuance of the letter of conditions  for Community Programs, prior to issuance of a conditional commitment  for the Business and Industry and Farmer Program Guaranteed Loan  Programs, and either prior to loan approval or obligation of funds,  whichever occurs first, for all other programs where a preapplication is  used. As an exception, however, whenever an application must be  submitted to the National Office for concurrence or approval, the  environmental review must be completed prior to and included in the  submission to the National Office. The environmental impact review is  not completed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  until all applicable public notices and associated review periods have  been completed and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  has taken any necessary action(s) to address comments received. The  exception to the provisions of this paragraph is contained in  Sec. 1940.332 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of this subpart.) FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will not consider the  application to be complete, until FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 staff have completed the environmental impact review,  whether an assessment or EIS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For those applications that meet the requirements of a  categorical exclusion, Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 1940-22 will be completed by FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 as early as possible after receipt of the  application. The application will not be considered complete until  either the checklist is successfully completed or the need for any  further environmental review is identified and completed.</p>
