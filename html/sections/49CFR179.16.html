coupler-to-tank-head impacts at relative car speeds of 29 km/hour (18 mph) when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The weight of the impact car is at least 119,295 kg (263,000 pounds);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The impacted tank car is coupled to one or more backup cars that have a total weight of at least 217,724 kg (480,000 pounds) and the hand brake is applied on the last ``backup'' car; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The impacted tank car is pressurized to at least 6.9 Bar (100 psig).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Verification by testing. Compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall be verified by full-scale testing according to appendix A of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Alternative compliance by other than testing. As an alternative to requirements prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section may be met by installing full-head protection (shields) or full tank-head jackets on each end of the tank car conforming to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The full-head protection (shields) or full tank-head jackets must be at least 1.27 cm (0.5 inch) thick, shaped to the contour of the tank head and made from steel having a tensile strength greater than 379.21 N/mm\2\ (55,000 psi).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The design and test requirements of the full-head protection (shields) or full tank-head jackets must meet the impact test requirements in Section 5.3 of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The workmanship must meet the requirements in Section C, Part II, Chapter 5, of the AAR Specifications for Design, Fabrication, and Construction of Freight Cars (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).
