Each  battery and battery connection must be accessible so as to permit  removal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All connections must be made to battery terminals with permanent  type connectors. Spring clips or other temporary type clamps may not be  used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each battery must be located in a tray of lead or other suitable  material resistant to deteriorating action by the electrolyte.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each battery charger intended for connection to a commercial  supply voltage must employ a transformer of the isolating type. An  ammeter that is readily visible must be included in the battery charger  circuit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A voltage dropping resistor, provided for charging a battery,  must be mounted in a ventilated noncombustible enclosure that prevents  hazardous temperatures at adjacent combustible materials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The main supply conductor from the battery must have an  emergency switch, located as close as practicable to the battery, that  opens all ungrounded conductors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> If a storage battery is not in the same compartment and adjacent  to the panel or box that distributes power to the various lighting,  motor and appliance branch circuits, the storage battery lead must be  fused at the battery.</p>
