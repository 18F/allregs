                            <p class="depth0">The following conditions shall be applicable to offers and sales made under Regulation D (Sec. 230.500 et seq. of this chapter):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Integration. All sales that are part of the same Regulation D offering must meet all of the terms and conditions of Regulation D. Offers and sales that are made more than six months before the start of a Regulation D offering or are made more than six months after completion of a Regulation D offering will not be considered part of that Regulation D offering, so long as during those six month periods there are no offers or sales of securities by or for the issuer that are of the same or a similar class as those offered or sold under Regulation D, other than those offers or sales of securities under an employee benefit plan as defined in rule 405 under the Act (17 CFR 230.405).</p><p class="depth0">Note: The term offering is not defined in the Act or in Regulation D. If the issuer offers or sells securities for which the safe harbor rule in paragraph (a) of this Sec. 230.502 is unavailable, the determination as to whether separate sales of securities are part of the same offering (i.e., are considered integrated) depends on the particular facts and circumstances. Generally, transactions otherwise meeting the requirements of an exemption will not be integrated with simultaneous offerings being made outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S. See Release No. 33-6863.</p><p class="depth0">The following factors should be considered in determining whether offers and sales should be integrated for purposes of the exemptions under Regulation D:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Whether the sales are part of a single plan of financing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Whether the sales involve issuance of the same class of securities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Whether the sales have been made at or about the same time;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Whether the same type of consideration is being received; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Whether the sales are made for the same general purpose.
See Release 33-4552 (November 6, 1962) [27 FR 11316].</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Information requirements--(1) When information must be furnished. If the issuer sells securities under Sec. 230.505 or Sec. 230.506(b) to any purchaser that is not an accredited investor, the issuer shall furnish the information specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to such purchaser a reasonable time prior to sale. The issuer is not required to furnish the specified information to purchasers when it sells securities under Sec. 230.504, or to any accredited investor.</p><p class="depth0">Note: When an issuer provides information to investors pursuant to paragraph (b)(1), it should consider providing such information to accredited investors as well, in view of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Type of information to be furnished. (i) If the issuer is not subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, at a reasonable time prior to the sale of securities the issuer shall furnish to the purchaser, to the extent material to an understanding of the issuer, its business and the securities being offered:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the issuer is not subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, at a reasonable time prior to the sale of securities the issuer shall furnish to the purchaser, to the extent material to an understanding of the issuer, its business and the securities being offered:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Non-financial statement information. If the issuer is eligible to use Regulation A (Sec. 230.251-263), the same kind of information as would be required in Part II of Form 1-A (Sec. 239.90 of this chapter). If the issuer is not eligible to use Regulation A, the same kind of information as required in Part I of a registration statement filed under the Securities Act on the form that the issuer would be entitled to use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Financial statement information--(1) Offerings up to $2,000,000. The information required in Article 8 of Regulation S-X (Sec. 210.8 of this chapter), except that only the issuer's balance sheet, which shall be dated within 120 days of the start of the offering, must be audited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Offerings up to $7,500,000. The financial statement information required in Form S-1 (Sec. 239.10 of this

chapter) for smaller reporting companies. If an issuer, other than a limited partnership, cannot obtain audited financial statements without unreasonable effort or expense, then only the issuer's balance sheet, which shall be dated within 120 days of the start of the offering, must be audited. If the issuer is a limited partnership and cannot obtain the required financial statements without unreasonable effort or expense, it may furnish financial statements that have been prepared on the basis of Federal income tax requirements and examined and reported on in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by an independent public or certified accountant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Offerings over $7,500,000. The financial statement as would be required in a registration statement filed under the Act on the form that the issuer would be entitled to use. If an issuer, other than a limited partnership, cannot obtain audited financial statements without unreasonable effort or expense, then only the issuer's balance sheet, which shall be dated within 120 days of the start of the offering, must be audited. If the issuer is a limited partnership and cannot obtain the required financial statements without unreasonable effort or expense, it may furnish financial statements that have been prepared on the basis of Federal income tax requirements and examined and reported on in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by an independent public or certified accountant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the issuer is a foreign private issuer eligible to use Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this chapter), the issuer shall disclose the same kind of information required to be included in a registration statement filed under the Act on the form that the issuer would be entitled to use. The financial statements need be certified only to the extent required by paragraph (b)(2)(i) (B) (1), (2) or (3) of this section, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the issuer is subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, at a reasonable time prior to the sale of securities the issuer shall furnish to the purchaser the information specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, and in either event the information specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The issuer's annual report to shareholders for the most recent fiscal year, if such annual report meets the requirements of Rules 14a-3 or 14c-3 under the Exchange Act (Sec. 240.14a-3 or Sec. 240.14c-3 of this chapter), the definitive proxy statement filed in connection with that annual report, and if requested by the purchaser in writing, a copy of the issuer's most recent Form 10-K (Sec. 249.310 of this chapter) under the Exchange Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The information contained in an annual report on Form 10-K (Sec. 249.310 of this chapter) under the Exchange Act or in a registration statement on Form S-1 (Sec. 239.11 of this chapter) or S-11 (Sec. 239.18 of this chapter) under the Act or on Form 10 (Sec. 249.210 of this chapter) under the Exchange Act, whichever filing is the most recent required to be filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The information contained in any reports or documents required to be filed by the issuer under sections 13(a), 14(a), 14(c), and 15(d) of the Exchange Act since the distribution or filing of the report or registration statement specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) (A) or (B), and a brief description of the securities being offered, the use of the proceeds from the offering, and any material changes in the issuer's affairs that are not disclosed in the documents furnished.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If the issuer is a foreign private issuer, the issuer may provide in lieu of the information specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) (A) or (B) of this section, the information contained in its most recent filing on Form 20-F or Form F-1 (Sec. 239.31 of the chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exhibits required to be filed with the Commission as part of a registration statement or report, other than an annual report to shareholders or parts of that report incorporated by reference in a Form 10-K report, need not be furnished to each purchaser that is not an accredited investor if the contents of material exhibits are identified and such exhibits are made available to a purchaser, upon his or her written request, a reasonable time before his or her purchase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> At a reasonable time prior to the sale of securities to any purchaser that is not an accredited investor in a transaction under Sec. 230.505 or Sec. 230.506(b), the issuer shall furnish to the purchaser a brief description in writing of any material written information concerning the offering that has been provided by the issuer to any accredited investor but not previously delivered to such unaccredited purchaser. The issuer shall furnish any portion or all of this information to the purchaser, upon his written request a reasonable time prior to his purchase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The issuer shall also make available to each purchaser at a reasonable time prior to his purchase of securities in a transaction under Sec. 230.505 or Sec. 230.506(b) the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers concerning the terms and conditions of the offering and to obtain any additional information which the issuer possesses or can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense that is necessary to verify the accuracy of information furnished under paragraph (b)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> For business combinations or exchange offers, in addition to information required by Form S-4 (17 CFR 239.25), the issuer shall provide to each purchaser at the time the plan is submitted to security holders, or, with an exchange, during the course of the transaction and prior to sale, written information about any terms or arrangements of the proposed transactions that are materially different from those for all other security holders. For purposes of this subsection, an issuer which is not subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act may satisfy the requirements of Part I.B. or C. of Form S-4 by compliance with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this Sec. 230.502.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> At a reasonable time prior to the sale of securities to any purchaser that is not an accredited investor in a transaction under Sec. 230.505 or Sec. 230.506(b), the issuer shall advise the purchaser of the limitations on resale in the manner contained in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Such disclosure may be contained in other materials required to be provided by this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Limitation on manner of offering. Except as provided in Sec. 230.504(b)(1) or Sec. 230.506(c), neither the issuer nor any person acting on its behalf shall offer or sell the securities by any form of general solicitation or general advertising, including, but not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any advertisement, article, notice or other communication published in any newspaper, magazine, or similar media or broadcast over television or radio; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any seminar or meeting whose attendees have been invited by any general solicitation or general advertising; Provided, however, that publication by an issuer of a notice in accordance with Sec. 230.135c or filing with the Commission by an issuer of a notice of sales on Form D (17 CFR 239.500) in which the issuer has made a good faith and reasonable attempt to comply with the requirements of such form, shall not be deemed to constitute general solicitation or general advertising for purposes of this section; Provided further, that, if the requirements of Sec. 230.135e are satisfied, providing any journalist with access to press conferences held outside of the United States, to meetings with issuer or selling security holder representatives conducted outside of the United States, or to written press-related materials released outside the United States, at or in which a present or proposed offering of securities is discussed, will not be deemed to constitute general solicitation or general advertising for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Limitations on resale. Except as provided in Sec. 230.504(b)(1), securities acquired in a transaction under Regulation D shall have the status of securities acquired in a transaction under section 4(a)(2) of the Act and cannot be resold without registration under the Act or an exemption therefrom. The issuer shall exercise reasonable care to assure that the purchasers of the securities are not underwriters within the meaning of section 2(a)(11) of the Act, which reasonable care may be demonstrated by the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reasonable inquiry to determine if the purchaser is acquiring the securities for himself or for other persons;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Written disclosure to each purchaser prior to sale that the securities have not been registered under the Act and, therefore, cannot be resold unless they are registered under the Act or unless an exemption from registration is available; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Placement of a legend on the certificate or other document that evidences the securities stating that the securities have not been registered under the Act and setting forth or referring to the restrictions on transferability and sale of the securities.
While taking these actions will establish the requisite reasonable care, it is not the exclusive method to demonstrate such care. Other actions by the issuer may satisfy this provision. In addition, Sec. 230.502(b)(2)(vii) requires the delivery of written disclosure of the limitations on resale to investors in certain instances.
