(If such a child suffers a disabling illness or injury and is unable to return to school, the child remains eligible for benefits until 6 months after the disability is removed, or until the 23rd birthday is reached, whichever comes first.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An unmarried illegitimate child or illegitimate step-child who is, or was at the time of sponsor's death, dependent on the sponsor for more than one-half of his or her support; residing with or in a home provided by the sponsor or the sponsor's spouse, as applicable, and is--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Under 21 years of age; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Twenty-one years of age or older but incapable of self-support because of a mental or physical incapacity that existed prior to the individual's 21st birthday; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Twenty-one or 22 years of age and pursuing a full-time course of education that is approved per Sec. 728.31(b)(4)(iii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A parent or parent-in-law, who is, or was at the time of the member's or former member's death, in fact dependent on the member for over one-half of such parent's support and residing in the sponsor's household.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> An unremarried former spouse of a member or former member who does not have medical coverage under an employer-sponsored health plan, and who:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> On the date of the final decree of divorce, dissolution, or annulment, had been married to the member or former member at least 20 years during which period the member of former member performed at least 20 years of service creditable in determining that member's or former member's eligibility for retired or retainer pay, or equivalent pay.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Had been married to the member of former member at least 20 years, at least 15 of which were during the period the member of former member performed service creditable in determining the member's eligibility for retired or retainer pay, or equivalent pay.

Care that may be rendered to all dependents in this subpart D is subject to the availability of space and facilities, capabilities of

the professional staff, and priorities in Sec. 728.3. Additionally:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Members of the uniformed services must be serving under orders specifying active duty for more than 30 days before their dependents are authorized benefits delineated in Sec. 728.31(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A dependent's eligibility begins on the date the member enters on active duty and ends as of midnight of the date the sponsor's period of active duty ends for any reason other than retirement or death. Dependents lose eligibility as of midnight of the date a member is officially place in a deserter status. Eligibility is restored on the date a deserter is returned to military control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A dependent (other than a former spouse) of a member or former member who died before attaining age 60 and at the time of death--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Would have been eligible for retired pay under chapter 67 of title 10 U.S.C. but for the fact that the member of former member was under 60 years of age, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Had elected to participate in the Survivor Benefit Plan, may not be rendered medical or dental care under the sponsor's entitlement until the date on which such member of former member would have attained age 60.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A spouse, not qualifying as a former spouse, who is divorced from a member loses eligibility for benefits as of midnight of the date the divorce becomes final. This includes loss of maternity care benefits for wives who are pregnant at the time a divorce becomes final. A spouse does not lose eligibility through issuance of an interlocutory decree of divorce even when a property settlement has been approved which releases the member from responsibility for the spouse's support. A spouse's eligibility depends upon the relationship of the spouse to the member; so long as the relationship of husband and wife is not terminated by a final divorce or annulment decree, eligibility continues.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Eligibility of children is not affected by the divorce of parents except that a stepchild relationship ceases upon divorce or annulment of natural parent and step-parent. A child's eligibility for health benefits is not affected by the remarriage of the divorced spouse maintaining custody unless the marriage is to an eligible service member.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A stepchild relationship does not cease upon death of the member step-parent but does cease if the natural parent subsequently remarries.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A child of an active duty or retired member, adopted after that member's death, retains eligibility for health benefits. However, the adoption of a child of a living member (other than by a person whose dependents are eligible for health benefits at USMTFs) terminates the child's eligibility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If a member's child is married before reaching age 21 to a person whose dependents are not eligible for health benefits in USMTFs, eligibility ceases as of midnight on the date of marriage. Should the marriage be terminated, the child again becomes eligible for benefits as a dependent child if otherwise eligible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Health benefits authorized. (1) Inpatient care including services and supplies normally furnished by the MTF.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inpatient care including services and supplies normally furnished by the MTF.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Outpatient care and services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Drugs (see chapter 21, MANMED).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prescriptions written by officers of the Medical and Dental Corps, civilian physicians and dentists employed by the Navy, designated officers of the Medical Service Corps and Nurse Corps, independent duty hospital corpsmen, and others designated to write prescriptions will be filled subject to the availability of pharmaceuticals, and consistent with control procedures and applicable laws.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Prescriptions written by civilian physicians and dentists (non-Navy employed) for eligible beneficiaries may be filled if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The commanding officer or CO's designee determines that pharmacy personnel and funds are available.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The items requested are routinely stocked.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The prescribed quantity is within limitations established by the command.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The prescriber is in the local area (limits designated by the commanding officer).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The provisions of chapter 21, MANMED are followed when such services include the dispensing of controlled substances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Treatment on an inpatient or outpatient basis of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Medical and surgical conditions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contagious diseases.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Nervous, mental, and chronic conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Physical examinations, including eye examinations and hearing evaluations, and all other tests and procedures necessary for a complete physical examination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Immunizations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Maternity (obstetrical) and infant care, routine care and examination of the newborn infant, and well-baby care for mothers and infants meeting the eligibility requirements of Sec. 728.31(b). If a newborn infant of an unmarried dependent minor daughter becomes a patient in his or her own right after discharge of the mother, classify the infant as civilian humanitarian nonindigent inasmuch as Sec. 728.31(b) does not define the infant as a dependent of the active duty or retired service member. Therefore, the minor daughter's sponsor (parent) should be counseled concerning the possibility of Secretarial designee status for the infant (see Sec. 728.77).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Diagnostic tests and services, including laboratory and x-ray examinations. Physical therapy, laboratory, x-ray, and other ambulatory diagnostic or therapeutic measures requeted by non-Navy employed physicians may be provided upon approval of the commanding officer or designated department heads. Rendering of such srvices is subordinate to and will not unduly interfere with providing inpatient and outpatient care to active duty personnel and others whose priority to receive care is equal to or greater than such dependents. Ensure that the release of any information to non-Navy employed physicians is in consonance with applicable provisions of SECNAVINST 5211.5C.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Family planning services as delineated in SECNAVINST 6300.2A.

These items, however, may be sold to dependents at cost to the Government at facilities outside the United States and at specific installations within the United States where adequate civilian facilities are unavailable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Special lenses (including intraocular lenses) or contact lenses for those eye conditions which require these items for complete medical or surgical management of the condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> One wig if the individual has alopecia resulting from treatment of a malignant disease: Provided the individual has not previously received a wig at the expense of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Dependents of reserves.
