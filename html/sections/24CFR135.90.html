Where the program providing  the section 3 covered assistance requires submission of an annual  performance report, the section 3 report will be submitted with that  annual performance report. If the program providing the section 3  covered assistance does not require an annual performance report, the  section 3 report is to be submitted by January 10 of each year or within  10 days of project completion, whichever is earlier. All reports  submitted to HUD in accordance with the requirements of this part will  be made available to the public.
