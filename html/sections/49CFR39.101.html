                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As a PVO, you must designate one or more Complaints Resolution Officials (CROs).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must make a CRO available for contact on each vessel and at each terminal that you serve. The CRO may be made available in person or via telephone, if at no cost to the passenger. If a telephone link to the CRO is used, TTY or TRS service must be available so that persons with hearing impairments may readily communicate with the CRO. You must make CRO service available in the language(s) in which you make your other services available to the general public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must make passengers with a disability aware of the availability of a CRO and how to contact the CRO in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In any situation in which any person complains or raises a concern with your personnel about discrimination, policies, or services with respect to passengers with a disability, and your personnel do not immediately resolve the issue to the customer's satisfaction or provide a requested accommodation, your personnel must immediately inform the passenger of the right to contact a CRO and the location and/or phone number of the CRO available on the vessel or at the terminal. Your personnel must provide this information to the passenger in a format he or she can use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Your reservation agents, contractors, and Web sites must provide information equivalent to that required by

paragraph (c)(1) of this section to passengers with a disability using those services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each CRO must be thoroughly familiar with the requirements of this Part and the PVO's procedures with respect to passengers with a disability. The CRO is intended to be the PVO's ``expert'' in compliance with the requirements of this Part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must ensure that each of your CROs has the authority to make dispositive resolution of complaints on behalf of the PVO. This means that the CRO must have the power to overrule the decision of any other personnel, except that the CRO may not be given authority to countermand a decision of the master of a vessel with respect to safety matters.</p>
