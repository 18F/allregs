                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The amount awarded with regard to any item of personal property will not exceed its depreciated replacement cost at the time of loss. Unless proven to be otherwise, replacement cost will

be based on the price paid in cash for the property or, if not acquired by purchase or exchange, the value at the time of acquisition. The amount normally payable on property damaged beyond economical repair is found by determining its depreciated value immediately before it was damaged or lost, less any salvage value. If the cost of repair is less than the depreciated value of the property, then it is economically repairable, and the cost of repair is the amount payable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Depreciation in value of an item of personal property is determined by considering the type of article involved, its cost, condition when lost or damaged beyond economical repair, and the time elapsed between the date of acquisition and the date of accrual of the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Allowance for articles acquired by barter will not exceed the cost of the articles tendered in barter.</p>
