                            <p class="depth0">Once an attestation has been received from an employer, a  determination shall be made by the Certifying Officer whether to accept  the attestation for filing or return it. The Certifying Officer may  request additional explanation and/or documentation from the employer in  making this determination. An attestation which is properly filled out  and which includes accompanying documentation for the requirement set  forth at Sec. 655.537 of this part shall be accepted for filing by ETA  on the date it is signed by the Certifying Officer unless it falls  within one of the categories set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.  Once an attestation is accepted for filing, ETA shall then follow the  procedures set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Upon  acceptance of the employer's attestation by ETA, the attestation and  accompanying documentation shall be forwarded to and be available for  public examination at the ETA national office in a timely manner. ETA  shall not consider information contesting an attestation received by ETA  prior to the determination to accept or return the attestation for  filing. Such information shall not be made a part of ETA's  administrative record on the attestation, but shall be referred to ESA  to be processed as a complaint pursuant to subpart G of this part if the  attestation is accepted by ETA for filing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Acceptance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the attestation is properly filled out and  includes accompanying documentation for the requirement set forth at  Sec. 655.537, and does not fall within one of the categories set forth  at paragraph (b) of this section, ETA shall accept the attestation for  filing, provide notification to the DHS office having jurisdiction over  the location where longshore work will be performed, and return to the  employer, or the employer's agent or representative at a U.S. address,  one copy of the attestation form submitted by the employer, with ETA's  acceptance indicated thereon. Before using alien crewmembers to perform  the longshore work attested to on Form ETA 9033-A, the employer shall  make a bona fide request for and employ United States longshore workers  who are qualified and available in sufficient numbers pursuant to  Sec. Sec. 655.534 and 655.535. Where such a request for dispatch of  United States longshore workers is unsuccessful, either in whole or in  part, any use of alien crewmembers to perform longshore activity shall  be in accordance with DHS regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> DOL is not the guarantor of the accuracy, truthfulness or  adequacy of an attestation accepted for filing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unacceptable attestations. ETA shall not accept an attestation  for filing and shall return such attestation to the employer, or the  employer's agent or representative at a U.S. address, when any one of  the following conditions exists:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the Form ETA 9033-A is not properly filled out. Examples of  improperly filled out Form ETA 9033-A's include instances where the  employer has neglected to check all the necessary boxes, where the  employer has   failed to include the name of any port, city, or other geographical  reference point where longshore work is to be performed, or where the  employer has failed to sign the attestation or to designate an agent in  the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the Form ETA 9033-A with accompanying documentation is not  received by ETA at least 30 days prior to the first performance of the  longshore activity, unless the employer is claiming that it could not  have reasonably anticipated the need to file the attestation for that  location at that time, and has included documentation which supports  this contention, and ETA has found the claim to be valid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the Form ETA 9033-A does not include accompanying  documentation for the requirement set forth at Sec. 655.537.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the accompanying documentation submitted by the employer  and required by Sec. 655.537, on its face, is inconsistent with that  section. Examples of such a situation include an instance where the Form  ETA 9033-A indicates that the longshore work will be performed at a  particular private dock and the documentation required under the notice  attestation element indicates that notice was provided to an operator of  a different private dock, or where the longshore work is to be performed  at a particular time and location in the State of Alaska and the notice  of filing provided to qualified labor organizations and contract  stevedoring companies indicates that the longshore work is to be  performed at a different time and/or location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, has notified  ETA, in writing, after an investigation pursuant to subpart G of this  part, that a cease and desist order has been issued pursuant to subpart  G of this part, with respect to the attesting employer's performance of  longshore work at a particular location in the State of Alaska, in  violation of a previously accepted attestation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, has notified  ETA, in writing, after an investigation pursuant to subpart G of this  part, that the particular employer has misrepresented or failed to  comply with an attestation previously submitted and accepted for filing,  but in no case for a period of more than one year after the date of the  Administrator's notice and provided that DHS has not advised ETA that  the prohibition is in effect for a lesser period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> When the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, has notified  ETA, in writing, that the employer has failed to comply with any  penalty, sanction, or other remedy assessed in a final agency action  following an investigation by the Wage and Hour Division pursuant to  subpart G of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Resubmission. If the attestation is not accepted for filing  pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, ETA shall return to the  employer, or the employer's agent or representative, at a U.S. address,  the attestation form and accompanying documentation submitted by the  employer. ETA shall notify the employer, in writing, of the reason(s)  that the attestation is unacceptable. When an attestation is found to be  unacceptable pursuant to paragraph (b) (1), (2), (3), or (4) of this  section, the employer may resubmit the corrected attestation with the  proper documentation. When an attestation is found to be unacceptable  pursuant to paragraph (b) (5), (6), or (7) of this section and returned,  such action shall be the final decision of the Secretary of Labor.</p>
