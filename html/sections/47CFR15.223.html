                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The field strength of any emission within the band 1.705-10.0  MHz shall not exceed 100 microvolts/meter at a distance of 30 meters.  However, if the bandwidth of the emission is less than 10% of the center  frequency, the field strength shall not exceed 15 microvolts/meter or  (the bandwidth of the device in kHz) divided by (the center frequency of  the device in MHz) microvolts/meter at a distance of 30 meters,  whichever is the higher level. For the purposes of this section,  bandwidth is determined at the points 6 dB down from the modulated  carrier. The emission limits in this paragraph are based on measurement  instrumentation employing an average detector. The provisions in  Sec. 15.35(b) for limiting peak emissions apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The field strength of emissions outside of the band 1.705-10.0  MHz shall not exceed the general radiated emission limits in  Sec. 15.209.</p>
