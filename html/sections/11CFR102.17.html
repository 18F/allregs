                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Nothing in this section shall supersede 11 CFR part  300, which prohibits any person from soliciting, receiving, directing,  transferring, or spending any non-Federal funds, or from transferring  Federal funds for Federal election activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Political committees may engage in joint fundraising with  other political committees or with unregistered committees or  organizations. The participants in a joint fundraising effort under this  section shall either establish a separate committee or select a  participating committee, to act as fundraising representative for all  participants. The fundraising representative shall be a reporting  political committee and an authorized committee of each candidate for  federal office participating in the joint fundraising activity. If the  participants establish a separate committee to act as the fundraising  representative, the separate committee shall not be a participant in any  other joint fundraising effort, but the separate committee may conduct  more than one joint fundraising effort for the participants.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The participants may hire a commercial fundraising firm or  other agent to assist in conducting the joint fundraising activity. In  that case, however, the fundraising representative shall still be  responsible for ensuring that the recordkeeping and reporting  requirements set forth in this section are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The procedures in 11 CFR 102.17(c) will govern all joint  fundraising activity conducted under this section. The participants in  joint fundraising activity may include political party committees  (whether or not they are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5),  candidate committees, multicandidate committees, and unregistered  organizations which do not qualify as collecting agents under 11 CFR  102.6(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A fundraising representative conducting joint fundraising under  this section is distinguished from an unregistered organization acting  as a collecting agent under 11 CFR 102.6(b). If a separate segregated  fund or an unregistered organization qualifies and acts as a collecting  agent under 11 CFR 102.6(b), the provisions of 11 CFR 102.17 will not  apply to that fundraising activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fundraising representatives--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Separate fundraising committee  as fundraising representative. Participating committees may establish a  separate political committee to act as fundraising representative for  all participants. This separate committee shall be a reporting political  committee and shall collect contributions, pay fundraising costs from  gross proceeds and from funds advanced by participants, and disburse net  proceeds to each participant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Participating committee as fundraising representative. All  participating committees may select one participant to act as  fundraising representative for all participants. The fundraising  representative must be a political committee as defined in 11 CFR 100.5.  The fundraising representative and any other participating committees  may collect contributions; however, all contributions received by other  participants shall be forwarded to the fundraising representative as  required by 11 CFR 102.8. The fundraising representative shall pay  fundraising costs from gross proceeds and from funds advanced by  participants and shall disburse net proceeds to each participant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Funds advanced for fundraising costs. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in  11 CFR 102.17(b) (3)(ii) and (iii), the amount of funds advanced by each  participant for fundraising costs shall be in proportion to the  allocation formula agreed upon under 11 CFR 102.17 (c)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A participant may advance more than its proportionate share of  the fundraising costs, however, the amount advanced which is in excess  of the participant's proportionate share shall not exceed the amount  that participant could legally contribute to the remaining participants.  See 11 CFR 102.12(c)(2) and part 110.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If all the participants are affiliated under 11 CFR 110.3 or  if the participants are all party committees of the same political  party, there is no limit on the amount a participant may advance for  fundraising costs on behalf of the other participants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (8) shall govern joint fundraising activity  conducted under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Written agreement. The participants in a joint fundraising  activity shall enter into a written agreement, whether or not all  participants are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5. The written  agreement shall identify the fundraising representative and shall state  a formula for the allocation of fundraising proceeds. The formula shall  be stated as the amount or percentage of each contribution received to  be allocated to each participant. The fundraising representative shall  retain the written agreement for a period of three years and shall make  it available to the Commission on request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fundraising notice. In addition to any notice required under 11  CFR 110.11, a joint fundraising notice shall be included with every  solicitation for contributions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> This notice shall include the following information:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The names of all committees participating in the joint  fundraising activity whether or not such committees are political  committees under 11 CFR 100.5; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The allocation formula to be used for distributing joint  fundraising proceeds; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A statement informing contributors that, notwithstanding the  stated allocation formula, they may designate their contributions for a  particular participant or participants; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> A statement informing contributors that the allocation formula  may change if a contributor makes a contribution which would exceed the  amount that contributor may give to any participant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the following situations, the notice shall include the  following additional information:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If one or more participants engage in the joint fundraising  activity solely to satisfy outstanding debts, a statement informing  contributors that the allocation formula may change if a participant  receives sufficient funds to pay its outstanding debts; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If one or more participants can lawfully accept contributions  that are prohibited under the Act, a statement informing contributors  that contributions from prohibited sources will be distributed only to  those participants that can accept them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Separate depository account. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The participants or the  fundraising representative shall establish a separate depository account  to be used solely for the receipt and disbursement of the joint  fundraising proceeds. All contributions deposited into the separate  depository account must be permissible under the Act. Each political  committee shall amend its Statement of Organization to reflect the  account as an additional depository. If one or more participants can  lawfully accept contributions that are prohibited under the Act, the  participants may either establish a second depository account for  contributions received from prohibited sources or they may forward such  contributions directly to the nonfederal participants.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The fundraising representative shall deposit all joint  fundraising proceeds in the separate depository account within ten days  of receipt as required by 11 CFR 103.3. The fundraising representative  may delay distribution of the fundraising proceeds to the participants  until all contributions are received and all expenses are paid.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For contribution reporting and limitation purposes, the date  of receipt of a contribution by a participating political committee is  the date that the contribution is received by the fundraising  representative. The fundraising representative shall report  contributions in the reporting period in which they are received.  Participating political committees shall report joint fundraising  proceeds in accordance with 11 CFR 102.17(c)(8) when such funds are  received from the fundraising representative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Recordkeeping requirements. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The fundraising representative  and participating committees shall screen all contributions received to  insure that the prohibitions and limitations of 11 CFR parts 110 and 114  are observed. Participating political committees shall make their  contributor records available to the fundraising representative to  enable the fundraising representative to carry out its duty to screen  contributions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The fundraising representative shall collect and retain  contributor information with regard to gross proceeds as required under  11 CFR 102.8 and shall also forward such information to participating  political committees. The fundraising representative shall also keep a  record of the total amount of contributions received from prohibited  sources, if any, and of all transfers of prohibited contributions to  participants that can accept them.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The fundraising representative shall retain the records  required under 11 CFR 102.9 regarding fundraising disbursements for a  period of three years. Commercial fundraising firms or agents shall  forward such information to the fundraising representative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Contribution limitations. Except to the extent that the  contributor has previously contributed to any of the participants, a  contributor may make a contribution to the joint fundraising effort  which contribution represents the total amount that the contributor  could contribute to all of the participants under the applicable limits  of 11 CFR 110.1 and 110.2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Allocation of gross proceeds. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The fundraising representative  shall allocate proceeds according to the formula stated in the  fundraising agreement. If distribution according to the allocation  formula extinguishes the debts of one or more participants and results  in a surplus for those participants or if distribution under the formula  results in a violation of the contribution limits of 11 CFR 110.1(a),  the fundraising   representative may reallocate the excess funds. Reallocation shall be  based upon the remaining participants' proportionate shares under the  allocation formula. If reallocation results in a violation of a  contributor's limit under 11 CFR 110.1, the fundraising representative  shall return to the contributor the amount of the contribution that  exceeds the limit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Designated contributions which exceed the contributor's limit  to the designated participant under 11 CFR part 110 may not be  reallocated by the fundraising representative absent the prior written  permission of the contributor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If any participants can lawfully accept contributions from  sources prohibited under the Act, any such contributions that are  received are not required to be distributed according to the allocation  formula.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Allocation of expenses and distribution of net proceeds. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If  participating committees are not affiliated as defined in 11 CFR 110.3  prior to the joint fundraising activity and are not committees of the  same political party;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> After gross contributions are allocated among the participants  under 11 CFR 102.17(c)(6), the fundraising representative shall  calculate each participant's share of expenses based on the percentage  of the total receipts each participant had been allocated. If  contributions from sources prohibited under the Act have been received  and distributed under 11 CFR 102.17(c)(6)(iii), those contributions need  not be included in the total receipts for the purpose of allocating  expenses under this section. To calculate each participant's net  proceeds, the fundraising representative shall subtract the  participant's share of expenses from the amount that participant has  been allocated from gross proceeds.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A participant may only pay expenses on behalf of another  participant subject to the contribution limits of 11 CFR part 110.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The expenses from a series of fundraising events or activities  shall be allocated among the participants on a per-event basis  regardless of whether the participants change or remain the same  throughout the series.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If participating committees are affiliated as defined in 11 CFR  110.3 prior to the joint fundraising activity or if participants are  party committees of the same political party, expenses need not be  allocated among those participants. Payment of such expenses by an  unregistered committee or organization on behalf of an affiliated  political committee may cause the unregistered organization to become a  political committee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Payment of expenses may be made from gross proceeds by the  fundraising representative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Reporting of receipts and disbursements--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reporting receipts.  </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The fundraising representative shall report all funds received in  the reporting period in which they are received. The fundraising  representative shall report the total amount of contributions received  from prohibited sources during the reporting period, if any, as a memo  entry. Each Schedule A filed by the fundraising representative under  this section shall clearly indicate that the contributions reported on  that schedule represent joint fundraising proceeds.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> After distribution of net proceeds, each participating political  committee shall report its share of net proceeds received as a transfer- in from the fundraising representative. Each participating political  committee shall also file a memo Schedule A itemizing its share of gross  receipts as contributions from original contributors to the extent  required under 11 CFR 104.3(a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reporting disbursements. The fundraising representative shall  report all disbursements in the reporting period in which they are made.
