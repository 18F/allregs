                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Manufacturer testing. (1) Upon completion of service accumulation, the manufacturer must test each test engine using the specified test procedures, except as provided in Sec. 89.114. The procedures to be used are set forth in:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon completion of service accumulation, the manufacturer must test each test engine using the specified test procedures, except as provided in Sec. 89.114. The procedures to be used are set forth in:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Subpart E of this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The California Regulations for New 1996 and Later Heavy-Duty Off-Road Diesel Cycle Engines. This procedure has been incorporated by reference. See Sec. 89.6; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Part 86, subpart I of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each test engine must be configured to be representative of actual in-use operation. The Administrator may specify the adjustment of any adjustable parameter. All test results must be reported to the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Confirmatory testing. The Administrator may conduct confirmatory testing or other testing on any test engine. The manufacturer must deliver test engines as directed by the Administrator. When the Administrator conducts confirmatory testing or other testing, those test results are used to determine compliance with emission standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use of carryover test data. In lieu of testing to certify an engine family for a given model year, the manufacturer may submit, with the Administrator's approval, emission test data used to certify that engine family in previous years. This ``carryover'' data is only allowable if the submitted test data show that the test engine would comply with the emission standard(s) for the model year for which certification is being sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The provisions of this paragraph (d) apply only to Tier 1 nonroad engines without exhaust aftertreatment rated at or above 37 kW.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Particulate emission measurements from Tier 1 nonroad engines without exhaust aftertreatment rated at or above 37 kW may be adjusted to a sulfur content of 0.05 weight percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adjustments to the particulate measurement shall be made using the following equation:
PMadj=PM-[BSFC x 0.0917 x (FSF-0.0005)]
Where:



PMadj=adjusted measured PM level [g/Kw-hr].PM=measured weighted PM level [g/Kw-hr].BSFC=measured brake specific fuel consumption [G/Kw-hr].FSF=fuel sulfur weight fraction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where a manufacturer certifies using test fuel with a sulfur content less than or equal to 0.050 weight percent, EPA shall not use emission data collected using test fuel with a sulfur content greater than 0.050 weight percent to determine compliance with the Tier 1 PM standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where a manufacturer certifies using test fuel with a sulfur content greater than 0.050 weight percent, EPA shall not use emission data collected using test fuel with a sulfur content greater than 0.050 weight percent to determine compliance with the Tier 1 PM standards, unless EPA adjusts the PM measurement using the equation specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
