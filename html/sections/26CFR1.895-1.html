                                Sec. 1.895-1  Income derived by a foreign central bank of issue,  United States or from bank  deposits.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Income derived by a foreign central bank of issue  from obligations of the United States or of any agency or  instrumentality thereof, or from interest on deposits with persons  carrying on the banking business, is excluded from the gross income of  such bank and is exempt from income tax if the bank is the owner of the  obligations or deposits and does not hold the obligations or deposits  for, or use them in connection with, the conduct of a commercial banking  function or other commercial activity by such bank. For purposes of this  section and paragraph (i) of Sec. 1.1441-4, obligations of the United  States or of any agency or instrumentality thereof include beneficial  interests, participations, and other instruments issued under section  302(c) of the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act (12  U.S.C. 1717). See 24 CFR part 1600 et seq.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Foreign central bank of issue. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A foreign central bank of  issue is a bank which is by law or government sanction the principal  authority, other than the government itself, issuing instruments  intended to circulate as currency. Such a bank is generally the  custodian of the banking reserves of the country under whose law it is  organized. See also paragraph (b)(5) of Sec. 1.861-2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The exclusion granted by section 895 applies to an  instrumentality that is separate from a foreign government, whether or  not owned in whole or in part by a foreign government. For example,  foreign banks organized along the lines of, and performing functions  similar to, the Federal Reserve System qualify as foreign central banks  of issue for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Bank for International Settlements shall be treated as  though it were a foreign central bank of issue for purposes of obtaining  the exclusion granted by section 895.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ownership of United States obligations or bank deposits. The  exclusion does not apply if the obligations or bank deposits from which  the income is derived are not owned by the foreign central bank of  issue. Obligations held, or deposits made, by a foreign central bank of  issue as agent, custodian, trustee, or in any other fiduciary capacity,  shall be considered as not owned by such bank for purposes of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Commercial banking function or other commercial activity. The  exclusion applies only to obligations of the United States or of any  agency or instrumentality thereof, or to bank deposits, held for, or  used in connection with, the conduct of a central banking function and  not to obligations or deposits held for, or used in connection with, the  conduct of commercial banking functions or other commercial activities  by the foreign central bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Other exclusions. See section 861(a)(1) (A) and (E) and Sec.  1.861-2(b) (1) and (4), for special rules relating to interest paid or  credited before January 1, 1977, on deposits and on similar amounts and  for rules on interest derived from bankers' acceptances. For   exemption from withholding under Sec. 1.1441-1 on income derived by a  foreign central bank of issue, or by the Bank of International  Settlements, from obligations of the United States or of any agency or  instrumentality thereof, or from bank deposits, see Sec. 1.1441-4(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective date. This section shall apply with respect to taxable  years beginning after December 31, 1966. For corresponding rules  applicable to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, see 26 CFR  1.85-1 (Revised as of January 1, 1972).  [T.D. 7378, 40 FR 45435, Oct. 2, 1975; 40 FR 48508, Oct. 16, 1975]</p>
