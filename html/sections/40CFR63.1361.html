                            <p class="depth0">Terms used in this subpart are defined in the CAA, in subpart A of this part, or in this section. If the same term is defined in subpart A of this part and in this section, it shall have the meaning given in this section for the purposes of this subpart MMM.</p><p class="depth0">Affirmative defense means, in the context of an enforcement proceeding, a response or defense put forward by a defendant, regarding which the defendant has the burden of proof, and the merits of which are independently and objectively evaluated in a judicial or administrative proceeding.</p><p class="depth0">Air pollution control device or control device means equipment installed on a process vent, storage vessel, wastewater treatment exhaust stack, or combination thereof that reduces the mass of HAP emitted to the air. The equipment may consist of an individual device or a series of devices. Examples include incinerators, carbon adsorption units, condensers, flares, boilers, process heaters, and gas absorbers. Process condensers are not considered air pollution control devices or control devices.</p><p class="depth0">Bag dump means equipment into which bags or other containers containing a powdered, granular, or other solid feedstock material are emptied. A bag dump is part of the process.</p><p class="depth0">Batch emission episode means a discrete venting episode that is associated with a single unit operation. A unit operation may have more than one batch emission episode. For example, a batch distillation unit operation may consist of batch emission episodes associated with charging and heating. Charging the vessel with HAP will result in one discrete batch emission episode that will last through the duration of the charge and will have an average flowrate equal to the rate of the charge. Another discrete batch emission episode will result from the expulsion of expanded vapor as the contents of the vessel are heated.</p><p class="depth0">Batch operation means a noncontinuous operation involving intermittent or discontinuous feed into PAI or integral intermediate manufacturing equipment, and, in general, involves the emptying of the equipment after the batch operation ceases and prior to beginning a new operation. Addition of raw material and withdrawal of product do not occur simultaneously in a batch operation. A batch process consists of a series of batch operations.</p><p class="depth0">Bench-scale batch process means a batch process (other than a research and development facility) that is capable of being located on a laboratory bench top. This bench-scale equipment will typically include reagent feed vessels, a small reactor and associated product separator, recovery and holding equipment.

Addition of new equipment to an affected source does not constitute construction, provided the new equipment is not a dedicated PAI process unit with the potential to emit 10 tons/yr of any one HAP or 25 tons/yr of combined HAP, but it may constitute reconstruction of the affected source or PAI process unit if it satisfies the definition of reconstruction in this section. At an affected source, changing raw materials processed and reconfiguring non-dedicated equipment to create a non-dedicated PAI process unit do not constitute construction.</p><p class="depth0">Consumption means the quantity of all HAP raw materials entering a process in excess of the theoretical amount used as reactant, assuming 100 percent stoichiometric conversion. The raw materials include reactants, solvents, and any other additives. If HAP are generated in the process as well as added as raw material, consumption includes the quantity generated in the process.</p><p class="depth0">Container, as used in the wastewater provisions, means any portable waste management unit that has a capacity greater than or equal to 0.1 m\3\ in which a material is stored, transported, treated, or otherwise handled. Examples of containers are drums, barrels, tank trucks, barges, dumpsters, tank cars, dump trucks, and ships.</p><p class="depth0">Continuous process means a process where the inputs and outputs flow continuously throughout the duration of the process. Continuous processes typically approach steady state.</p><p class="depth0">Continuous seal means a seal that forms a continuous closure that completely covers the space between the wall of the storage vessel and the edge of the floating roof. A continuous seal may be a vapor-mounted, liquid-mounted, or metallic shoe seal.</p><p class="depth0">Controlled HAP emissions means the quantity of HAP components discharged to the atmosphere from an air pollution control device.</p><p class="depth0">Cover, as used in the wastewater provisions, means a device or system which is placed on or over a waste management unit containing wastewater or residuals so that the entire surface area is enclosed to minimize air emissions. A cover may have openings necessary for operation, inspection, and maintenance of the waste management unit such as access hatches, sampling ports, and gauge wells provided that each opening is closed when not in use. Examples of covers include a fixed roof installed on a wastewater tank, a lid installed on a container, and an air-supported enclosure installed over a waste management unit.</p><p class="depth0">Dedicated PAI process unit means a PAI process unit constructed from equipment that is fixed in place and designed and operated to produce only a single product or co-products.

The term includes: hard piping; all process drains and junction boxes; and associated sewer lines, other junction boxes, manholes, sumps, and lift stations conveying wastewater streams or residuals. A segregated stormwater sewer system, which is a drain and collection system designed and operated for the sole purpose of collecting rainfall-runoff at a facility, and which is segregated from all other individual drain systems, is excluded from this definition.</p><p class="depth0">Instrumentation system means a group of equipment components used to condition and convey a sample of the process fluid to analyzers and instruments for the purpose of determining process operating conditions (e.g., composition, pressure, flow, etc.). Valves and connectors are the predominant type of equipment used in instrumentation systems; however, other types of equipment may also be included in these systems. Only valves nominally 0.5 inches and smaller and connectors nominally 0.75 inches and smaller in diameter are considered instrumentation systems for the purposes of this subpart. Valves greater than nominally 0.5 inches and connectors greater than nominally 0.75 inches associated with instrumentation systems are not considered part of instrumentation systems and must be monitored individually.</p><p class="depth0">Integral intermediate means an intermediate for which 50 percent or more of the annual production is used in on-site production of any PAI(s) and that is not stored before being used in the

production of another integral intermediate or the PAI(s). For the purposes of this definition, an intermediate is stored if it is discharged to a storage vessel and at least one of the following conditions is met: the processing equipment that discharges to the storage vessel is shutdown before the processing equipment that withdraws from the storage vessel is started up; during an annual period, the material must be stored in the vessel for at least 30 days before being used to make a PAI; or the processing equipment that discharges to the storage vessel is located in a separate building (or processing area) of the plant than the processing equipment that uses material from the storage vessel as a feedstock, and control equipment is not shared by the two processing areas.

These materials are typically described by North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Codes 325199 and 32532 (i.e., previously known as Standard Industrial Classification System Codes 2869 and 2879). These materials are identified by product classification codes 01, 21, 02, 04, 44, 07, 08, and 16 in block 19 on the 1999 version of EPA form 3540-16, the Pesticides Report for Pesticide-Producing Establishments. The materials represented by these codes are: insecticides; insecticide-fungicides; fungicides; herbicides; herbicide-fungicides; plant regulators; defoliants, desiccants; or multi-use active ingredients.</p><p class="depth0">Pesticide active ingredient manufacturing process unit (PAI process unit) means a process unit that is used to produce a material that is primarily used as a PAI or integral intermediate. A PAI process unit consists of: the process, as defined in this subpart; associated storage vessels, as determined by the procedures in Sec.  63.1360(f); equipment identified in Sec.  63.1362(k); connected piping and ducts; and components such as pumps, compressors, agitators, pressure relief devices, sampling connection systems, open-ended valves or lines, valves, connectors, and instrumentation systems. A material is primarily used as a PAI or integral intermediate if more than 50 percent of the projected annual production from a process unit in the 3 years after June 23, 1999 or startup, whichever is later, is used as a PAI or integral intermediate; recordkeeping is required if the material is used as a PAI or integral intermediate, but not as the primary use. If the primary use changes to a PAI or integral intermediate, the process unit becomes a PAI process unit unless it is already subject to the HON. If the primary use changes from a PAI or integral intermediate to another use, the process unit remains a PAI process unit. Any process tank containing an integral intermediate is part of the PAI process unit used to produce the integral intermediate. A process unit that produces an intermediate that is not an integral intermediate may be designated as a PAI process unit according to the procedures of Sec.  63.1360(g). Formulation of pesticide products is not considered

part of a PAI process unit. Quality assurance and quality control laboratories are not considered part of a PAI process unit.</p><p class="depth0">Plant site means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under common control, including properties that are separated only by a road or other public right-of-way. Common control includes properties that are owned, leased, or operated by the same entity, parent entity, subsidiary, or any combination thereof.</p><p class="depth0">Point of determination (POD) means each point where a wastewater stream exits the PAI process unit.</p><p class="depth0">Note to definition of ``point of determination'': The regulation allows determination of the characteristics of a wastewater stream: at the point of determination; or downstream of the point of determination if corrections are made for changes in flow rate and annual average concentration of Table 9 compounds as determined in Sec.  63.144 of subpart G of this part. Such changes include: losses by air emissions, reduction of annual average concentration or changes in flow rate by mixing with other water or wastewater streams, and reduction in flow rate or annual average concentration by treating or otherwise handling the wastewater stream to remove or destroy HAP.</p><p class="depth0">Pressure release means the emission of materials resulting from the system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the pressure relief device. This release can be one release or a series of releases over a short time period due to a malfunction in the process.</p><p class="depth0">Pressure relief device or valve means a safety device used to prevent operating pressures from exceeding the maximum allowable working pressure of the process equipment. A common pressure relief device is a spring-loaded pressure relief valve. Devices that are actuated either by a pressure of less than or equal to 2.5 pounds per square inch gauge or by a vacuum are not pressure relief devices.</p><p class="depth0">Process means a logical grouping of processing equipment which collectively function to produce a product. For the purpose of this subpart, a PAI process includes all, or a combination of, reaction, recovery, separation, purification, treatment, cleaning, and other activities or unit operations which are used to produce a PAI or integral intermediate. Ancillary activities are not considered a PAI process or any part of a PAI process. Ancillary activities include boilers and incinerators (not used to comply with the provisions of Sec.  63.1362), chillers or refrigeration systems, and other equipment and activities that are not directly involved (i.e., they operate within a closed system and materials are not combined with process fluids) in the processing of raw materials or the manufacturing of a PAI. A PAI process and all integral intermediate processes for which 100 percent of the annual production is used in the production of the PAI may be linked together and defined as a single PAI process unit.</p><p class="depth0">Process condenser means a condenser whose primary purpose is to recover material as an integral part of a unit operation. The condenser must cause a vapor-to-liquid phase change for periods during which the temperature of liquid in the process equipment is at or above its boiling or bubble point. Examples of process condensers include distillation condensers, reflux condensers, and condensers used in stripping or flashing operation. In a series of condensers, all condensers up to and including the first condenser with an exit gas temperature below the boiling or bubble point of the liquid in the process equipment are considered to be process condensers. All condensers in line prior to the vacuum source are included in this definition.</p><p class="depth0">Process shutdown means a work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process or part of a process during which it is technically feasible to clear process material from a process or part of a process consistent with safety constraints and during which repairs can be effected. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process or part of a process for less than 24 hours is not a process shutdown. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that would stop production from a process or part of a process for a shorter period of time than would be required to clear the process or part of the process of materials and start up the process, and would result in greater emissions than delay of repair of leaking components

until the next scheduled process shutdown, is not a process shutdown. The use of spare equipment and technically feasible bypassing of equipment without stopping production are not process shutdowns.</p><p class="depth0">Process tank means a tank that is used within a process to collect material discharged from a feedstock storage vessel or equipment within the process before the material is transferred to other equipment within the process or a product storage vessel. In many process tanks, unit operations such as reactions and blending are conducted. Other process tanks, such as surge control vessels and bottom receivers, however, may not involve unit operations.</p><p class="depth0">Process unit means the equipment assembled and connected by pipes or ducts to process raw materials and to manufacture an intended product.</p><p class="depth0">Process unit group means a group of process units that manufacture PAI and products other than PAI by alternating raw materials or operating conditions, or by reconfiguring process equipment. A process unit group is determined according to the procedures specified in Sec.  63.1360(g).</p><p class="depth0">Process vent means a point of emission from processing equipment to the atmosphere or a control device. The vent may be the release point for an emission stream associated with an individual unit operation, or it may be the release point for emission streams from multiple unit operations that have been manifolded together into a common header. Examples of process vents include, but are not limited to, vents on condensers used for product recovery, bottom receivers, surge control vessels, reactors, filters, centrifuges, process tanks, and product dryers. A vent is not considered to be a process vent for a given emission episode if the undiluted and uncontrolled emission stream that is released through the vent contains less than 50 ppmv HAP, as determined through process knowledge that no HAP are present in the emission stream; using an engineering assessment as discussed in Sec.  63.1365(c)(2)(ii); from test data collected using Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A; or from test data collected using any other test method that has been validated according to the procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of this part. Process vents do not include vents on storage vessels regulated under Sec.  63.1362(c), vents on wastewater emission sources regulated under Sec.  63.1362(d), or pieces of equipment regulated under Sec.  63.1363.</p><p class="depth0">Process wastewater means wastewater which, during manufacturing or processing, comes into direct contact with, or results from, the production or use of any raw material, intermediate product, finished product, by-product, or waste product.
