                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Certification Requirements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. To comply with section  111(b)(4) of EESA, the PEO and the PFO of the TARP recipient must  provide the following certifications with respect to the compliance of  the TARP recipient with section 111 of EESA as implemented under this  part:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> First Fiscal Year Certification. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Within ninety days of the  completion of the first annual fiscal year of the TARP recipient any  portion of which is a TARP period, the PEO and the PFO of the TARP  recipient must provide   certifications similar to the model provided in appendix A to this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the first annual fiscal year of a TARP recipient any portion  of which is a TARP period ends within thirty days after the closing date  of the applicable agreement between the TARP recipient and Treasury, the  TARP recipient shall have an additional sixty days beginning on the day  after the end of the fiscal year during which it can establish the  compensation committee, if not already established, and during which the  compensation committee shall meet with senior risk officers to discuss,  review, and evaluate the SEO compensation plans and employee  compensation plans in accordance with Sec. 30.4 (Q-4) of this part. The  certifications of the PEO and the PFO of the TARP recipient must be  amended to reflect the timing of the establishment and reviews of the  compensation committee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Years Following First Fiscal Year Certification. Within ninety  days of the completion of each TARP fiscal year of the TARP recipient  after the first TARP fiscal year, the PEO and the PFO of the TARP  recipient must provide a certification similar to the model provided in  Appendix B to this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Location. A TARP recipient with securities registered with the  SEC pursuant to the Federal securities law must provide these  certifications as an exhibit (pursuant to Item 601(b)(99)(i) of  Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR  229.601(b)(99)(i)) to the TARP recipient's annual report on Form 10-K  and to Treasury. To the extent that the PEO or the PFO of the TARP  recipient is unable to provide any of these certifications in a timely  manner, the PEO or the PFO must provide Treasury an explanation of the  reason such certification has not been provided. These certifications  are in addition to the compensation committee certifications required by  Sec. 30.5 (Q-5) of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Application to private TARP recipients. The rules provided in  this section are also applicable to TARP recipients that do not have  securities registered with the SEC pursuant to the Federal securities  laws, except that the certifications under Appendix A, paragraph (x) and  Appendix B, paragraph (x) of this section are not required for such TARP  recipients. A private TARP recipient must provide these certifications  to its primary regulatory agency and to Treasury.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Application to TARP recipients that have never had an  obligation. For those TARP recipients that have never had an obligation,  the PEO and PFO must provide the certifications pursuant to this  paragraph (a) only with respect to the requirements applicable to a TARP  recipient that has never had an obligation (generally certain  compensation committee reviews of employee compensation plans and the  issuance of, and compliance with, an excessive or luxury expenses  policy).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of this section that are requested by any representative  of Treasury.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Penalties for making or providing false or fraudulent  Statements. Any individual or entity that provides information or makes  a certification to Treasury pursuant to the Interim Final Rule or as  required pursuant to 31 CFR Part 30 may be subject to 18 U.S.C. 1001,  which generally prohibits the making of any false or fraudulent  statement in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Federal government.  Upon receipt of information indicating that any individual or entity has  violated any provision of title 18 of the U.S. Code or other provision  of Federal law, Treasury shall refer such information to the Department  of Justice and the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset  Relief Program.</p><p class="depth2">Appendix A to Sec. 30.15--Model Certification for First Fiscal Year</p><p class="depth2">Certification</p><p class="depth2">``I, [identify certifying individual], certify, based on my  knowledge, that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The compensation committee of [identify TARP recipient] has  discussed, reviewed, and evaluated with senior risk officers at least  every six months during the period beginning on the later of September  14, 2009, or ninety days after the closing date of the agreement between  the TARP recipient and Treasury and ending with the last day of the TARP  recipient's fiscal year containing that date (the applicable period),  the senior executive officer (SEO) compensation plans and the employee  compensation plans and the risks these plans pose to [identify TARP  recipient];</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The compensation committee of [identify TARP recipient] has  identified and limited during the applicable period any features of the  SEO compensation plans that could lead SEOs to take unnecessary and  excessive risks that could threaten the value of [identify TARP  recipient], and during that same applicable period has identified any  features of the employee compensation plans that pose risks to [identify  TARP recipient] and has limited those features to ensure that [identify  TARP recipient] is not unnecessarily exposed to risks;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The compensation committee has reviewed, at least every six  months during the applicable period, the terms of each employee  compensation plan and identified any features of the plan that could  encourage the manipulation of reported earnings of [identify TARP  recipient] to enhance the compensation of an employee, and has limited  any such features;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The compensation committee of [identify TARP recipient] will  certify to the reviews of the SEO compensation plans and employee  compensation plans required under (i) and (iii) above;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The compensation committee of [identify TARP recipient] will  provide a narrative description of how it limited during any part of the  most recently completed fiscal year that included a TARP period the  features in</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> SEO compensation plans that could lead SEOs to take unnecessary  and excessive risks that could threaten the value of [identify TARP  recipient];</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Employee compensation plans that unnecessarily expose [identify  TARP recipient] to risks;
