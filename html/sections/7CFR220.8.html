                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. This section contains the meal  requirements applicable to school breakfasts for students in grades K to  12. With the exception of the milk component, the meal requirements must  be implemented beginning July 1, 2013 or as otherwise specified. School  food authorities wishing to adopt the provisions of this section prior  to the required date of compliance may do so with the approval of the  State agency. In general, school food authorities must ensure that  participating schools provide nutritious, well-balanced, and age- appropriate breakfasts to all the children they serve to improve their  diet and safeguard their health.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General nutrition requirements. School breakfasts offered to  children age 5 and older must meet, at a minimum, the meal requirements  in paragraph (b) of this section. Schools must follow a food-based menu  planning approach and produce enough food to offer each child the  quantities specified in the meal pattern established in paragraph (c) of  this section for each age/grade group served in the school. In addition,  school breakfasts must meet the dietary specifications in paragraph (f)  of this section. Schools offering breakfasts to children ages 1 to 4 and  infants must meet the meal pattern requirements in paragraph (o) of this  section. When breakfast is served in the cafeteria, schools must make  potable water available and accessible without restriction to children  at no charge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Unit pricing. Schools must price each meal as a unit. The price  of a reimbursable lunch does not change if the student does not take a  food item   or requests smaller portions. Schools must identify, near or at the  beginning of the serving line(s), the food items that constitute the  unit-priced reimbursable school meal(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Production and menu records. Schools or school food authorities,  as applicable, must keep production and menu records for the meals they  produce. These records must show how the meals offered contribute to the  required food components and food quantities for each age/grade group  every day. Labels or manufacturer specifications for food products and  ingredients used to prepare school meals must indicate zero grams of  trans fat per serving (less than 0.5 grams). Schools or school food  authorities must maintain records of the latest nutritional analysis of  the school menus conducted by the State agency. Production and menu  records must be maintained in accordance with FNS guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Meal requirements for school breakfasts. School breakfasts for  children ages 5 and older must reflect food and nutrition requirements  specified by the Secretary. Compliance with these requirements, once  fully implemented as specified in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (f), (h),  (i), and (j) of this section, is measured as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> On a daily basis:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Meals offered to each age/grade group must include the food  components and food quantities specified in the meal pattern in  paragraph (c) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Food products or ingredients used to prepare meals must contain  zero grams of trans fat per serving or a minimal amount of naturally  occurring trans fat as specified in paragraph (f) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Meal selected by each student must have the number of food  components required for a reimbursable meal and include at least one  fruit or vegetable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Over a 5-day school week:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Average calorie content of the meals offered to each age/grade  group must be within the minimum and maximum calorie levels specified in  paragraph (f) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Average saturated fat content of the meals offered to each age/ grade group must be less than 10 percent of total calories as specified  in paragraph (f) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Average sodium content of the meals offered to each age/grade  group must not exceed the maximum level specified in paragraph (f) of  this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Meal pattern for school breakfasts.

All juice must</p><p class="depth0">be 100% full-strength.</p><p class="depth0">\c\ Beginning July 1, 2014 (SY 2014-2015) schools must offer 1 cup of fruit daily and 5 cups of fruit weekly.</p><p class="depth0">Vegetables may be substituted for fruits, but the first two cups per week of any such substitution must be</p><p class="depth0">from the dark green, red/orange, beans and peas (legumes) or ``Other vegetables'' subgroups, as defined in</p><p class="depth0">210.10(c)(2)(iii). \d\ Beginning July 1, 2013 (SY 2013-2014), at least half of grains offered must be whole-grain-rich and schools</p><p class="depth0">must meet the grain ranges. Schools may substitute 1 oz. eq. of meat/meat alternate for 1 oz. eq. of grains</p><p class="depth0">after the minimum daily grains requirement is met. By July 1, 2014 (SY 2014-15) all grains must be whole-grain-</p><p class="depth0">rich. \e\ There is no meat/meat alternate requirement. \f\ Beginning July 1, 2012 (SY 2012-2013) all fluid milk must be low-fat (1 percent milk fat or less,</p><p class="depth0">unflavored) or fat-free (unflavored or flavored). \g\ Beginning July 1, 2013 (SY 2013-2014), the average daily calories for a 5-day school week must be within the</p><p class="depth0">range (at least the minimum and no more than the maximum values). \h\ Discretionary sources of calories (solid fats and added sugars) may be added to the meal pattern if within</p><p class="depth0">the specifications for calories, saturated fat, trans fat, and sodium. Foods of minimal nutritional value and</p><p class="depth0">fluid milk with fat content greater than 1 percent milk fat are not allowed. \i\ Final sodium targets must be met no later than July 1, 2022 (SY 2022-2023). The first intermediate targets</p><p class="depth0">must be met no later than July 1, 2014 (SY 2014-2015) and the second intermediate targets must be met no later</p><p class="depth0">than July 1, 2017 (SY 2017-2018). \j\ Trans fat restrictions must be implemented on July 1, 2013 (SY 2013-14).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Age/grade groups. Effective July 1, 2013 (SY 2013-2014), schools  must plan menus for students using the following age/grade groups:  Grades K-5 (ages 5-10), grades 6-8 (ages 11-13), and grades 9-12 (ages  14-18). If an unusual grade configuration in a school prevents the use  of the established age/grade groups, students in grades K-5 and grades  6-8 may be offered the same food quantities at breakfast provided that  the calorie and sodium standards for each age/grade group are met. No  customization of the established age/grade groups is allowed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Food components. Schools must offer students in each age/grade  group the food components specified in meal pattern in paragraph (c).  Food component descriptions in Sec. 210.10 of this chapter apply to this  Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Meats/meat alternates component. Schools are not required to  offer meats/meat alternates as part of the breakfast menu. Effective  July 1, 2013 (SY 2013-2014), schools may substitute meats/meat  alternates for grains, after the daily grains requirement is met, to  meet the weekly grains requirement. One ounce equivalent of meat/meat  alternate is equivalent to one ounce equivalent of grains.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Enriched macaroni. Enriched macaroni with fortified protein as  defined in appendix A to part 210 may be used to meet part of the meats/ meat alternates requirement when used as specified in appendix A to part  210. An enriched macaroni product with fortified protein as defined in  appendix A to part 210 may be used to meet part of the meats/meat  alternates component or the grains component but may not meet both food  components in the same lunch.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Nuts and seeds. Nuts and seeds and their butters are allowed as  meat alternates in accordance with program guidance. Acorns, chestnuts,  and coconuts may not be used because of their low protein and iron  content. Nut and seed meals or flours may be used only if they meet the  requirements for Alternate Protein Products established in appendix A to  part 220. Nuts or seeds may be used to meet no more than one-half (50  percent) of the meats/meat alternates component with another meats/meat  alternates to meet the full requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Yogurt. Yogurt may be used to meet all or part of the meats/meat  alternates component. Yogurt may be plain or flavored, unsweetened or  sweetened. Noncommercial and/or non-standardized yogurt products, such  as frozen yogurt, drinkable yogurt products, homemade yogurt, yogurt  flavored products, yogurt bars, yogurt covered fruits and/or nuts or  similar products are not creditable. Four ounces (weight) or \1/2\ cup  (volume) of yogurt equals one ounce of the meats/meat alternates  requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Tofu and soy products. Commercial tofu and soy products may be  used to meet all or part of the meats/meat alternates component in  accordance with FNS guidance. Noncommercial and/or non-standardized tofu  and products are not creditable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Beans and peas (legumes). Cooked dry beans and peas (legumes)  may be used to meet all or part of the meats/meat alternates component.  Beans and peas (legumes) are identified in this section and include  foods such as black beans, garbanzo beans, lentils, kidney beans, mature  lima beans, navy beans, pinto beans, and split peas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Other meat alternates. Other meat alternates, such as cheese and  eggs, may be used to meet all or part of the meats/meat alternates  component in accordance with FNS guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fruits component. Effective July 1, 2014 (SY 2014-2015),  schools must offer daily the fruit quantities specified in the breakfast  meal pattern in paragraph (c) of this section. Fruits that are fresh;  frozen without added sugar; canned in light syrup, water or fruit juice;  or dried may be offered to meet the fruits component requirements.  Vegetables may be offered in place of all or part of the required fruits  at breakfast, but the first two cups per week of any such substitution  must be from the dark green, red/orange, beans and peas (legumes) or  other vegetable subgroups, as defined in this section. All fruits are  credited based on their volume as served, except that \1/4\ cup of dried  fruit counts as \1/2\ cup of fruit. Only pasteurized, full-strength  fruit juice may be used, and may be credited to meet no more than one- half of the fruit component.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Vegetables component. Schools are not required to offer  vegetables as part of the breakfast menu but may, effective July 1, 2014  (SY 2014-2015), offer vegetables to meet part or all of the fruit  requirement. Fresh, frozen, or canned vegetables and dry beans and peas  (legumes) may be offered to meet the fruit requirement. All vegetables  are credited based on their volume as served, except that 1 cup of leafy  greens counts as \1/2\ cup of vegetables and tomato paste and tomato  puree are credited based on calculated volume of the whole food  equivalency. Pasteurized, full-strength vegetable juice may be used to  meet no more than one-half of the vegetable component. Cooked dry beans  or peas (legumes) may be counted as either a vegetable or as a meat  alternate but not as both in the same meal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Grains component. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Enriched and whole grains. All grains  must be made with enriched and whole grain meal or flour, in accordance  with the most recent FNS guidance on grains. Whole grain-rich products  must contain at least 50 percent whole grains and the remaining grains  in the product must be enriched. Effective July 1, 2013 (SY 2013-2014),  schools may substitute meats/meat alternates for grains, after the daily  grains requirement is met, to meet the weekly grains requirement. One  ounce equivalent of meat/meat alternate is equivalent to one ounce  equivalent of grains.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Daily and weekly servings. Effective July 1, 2013 (SY 2013- 2014), the grains component is based on minimum daily servings plus  total servings over a five-day school week. Beginning July 1, 2013 (SY  2013-2014), half of the grains offered during the school week must meet  the whole grain-rich criteria specified in FNS guidance. Beginning July  1, 2014 (SY 2014-2015), all grains must meet the whole grain-rich  criteria specified in FNS guidance. The whole grain-rich criteria  provided in FNS guidance may be updated to reflect additional  information provided voluntarily by industry on the food label or a  whole grains definition by the Food and Drug Administration. Schools  serving breakfast 6 or 7 days per week must increase the weekly grains  quantity by approximately 20 percent (\1/5\) for each additional day.  When schools operate less than 5 days per week, they may decrease the  weekly quantity by approximately 20 percent (\1/5\) for each day less  than five. The servings for biscuits, rolls, muffins, and other grain/ bread varieties are specified in FNS guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Food components in outlying areas. Schools in American Samoa,  Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands may serve a vegetable such as yams,  plantains, or sweet potatoes to meet the grains component.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(1)</em>  through (4) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Offer versus serve. School breakfast must offer daily at least  the three food components required in the meal pattern in paragraph (c)  of this section. To exercise the offer versus serve option at breakfast,  a school food authority or school must offer a minimum of four food  items daily as part of the required components. Under offer versus  serve, students are allowed to decline one of the four food items,  provided that students select at least \1/2\ cup of the fruit component  for a reimbursable meal beginning July 1, 2014 (SY 2014-2015). If only  three food items are offered at breakfast, school food authorities or  schools may not exercise the offer versus serve option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Dietary specifications. (1) Calories. Effective July 1, 2013 (SY  2013-2014), school breakfasts offered to each age/grade group must meet,  on average over the school week, the minimum and maximum calorie levels  specified in the following table:</p><p class="depth0">Calorie Ranges for Breakfast--Effective SY 2013-2014 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Grades K-5         Grades 6-8        Grades 9-12 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Minimum-maximum calories (kcal) \a b\..................           350-500            400-550            450-600 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \a\ The average daily amount for a 5-day school must fall within the minimum and maximum levels. \b\ Discretionary sources of calories (solid fats and added sugars) may be added to the meal pattern if within</p><p class="depth0">the specifications for calories, saturated fat, trans fat, and sodium.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Saturated fat. Effective July 1, 2012 (SY 2012-2013), school  breakfasts offered to all age/grade groups must, on average over the  school week, provide less than 10 percent of total calories from  saturated fat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Sodium.

Effective July 1, 2013 (SY 2013-2014), food products  and ingredients used to prepare school meals must contain zero grams of  trans fat (less than 0.5 grams) per serving. Schools must add the trans  fat specification and request the required documentation (nutrition  label or manufacturer specifications) in their procurement contracts.  Documentation for food products and food ingredients must indicate zero  grams of trans fat per serving. Meats that contain a minimal amount of  naturally-occurring trans fats are allowed in the school meal programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Compliance assistance. The State agency and school food  authority must provide technical assistance and training to assist  schools in planning breakfasts that meet the meal pattern in paragraph  (c) of this section and the dietary specifications for calorie,  saturated fat, sodium, and trans fat established in paragraph (f) of  this section. Compliance assistance may be offered during training,  onsite visits, and/or administrative reviews.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> State agency responsibilities for monitoring dietary  specifications. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Calories, saturated fat, and sodium. Effective July  1, 2013 (SY 2013-2014), as part of the administrative review authorized  under Sec. 210.18 of this chapter, State   agencies must conduct a weighted nutrient analysis for the school(s)  selected for review to evaluate the average levels of calories,  saturated fat, and sodium of the breakfasts offered during one week  within the review period. The nutrient analysis must be conducted in  accordance with the procedures established in Sec. 210.10(i) of this  chapter. If the results of the review indicate that the school  breakfasts are not meeting the standards for calories, saturated fat, or  sodium specified in paragraph (f) of this section, the State agency or  school food authority must provide technical assistance and require the  reviewed school to take corrective action to meet the requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Trans fat. Effective SY 2013-2014, State agencies conducting an  administrative review must review product labels of manufacturer  specifications to verify that the food products or ingredients used by  the reviewed school(s) contain zero grams of trans fat (less than 0.5  grams) per serving.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> State agency's responsibilities for compliance monitoring.

As  part of the administrative review authorized under Sec. 210.18(g)(2) of  this chapter, State agencies must evaluate compliance with the meal  pattern requirements (food components and quantities) in paragraph  (o)(3) of this section. If the meals do not meet the requirements of  this section, the State agency or school food authority must provide  technical assistance and require the reviewed school to take corrective  action. In addition, the State agency must take fiscal action as  authorized in Sec. Sec. 210.18(m) and 210.19(c) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Requirements for the infant breakfast pattern. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Feeding  breakfasts to infants. Breakfasts served to infants ages birth through  11 months must meet the requirements described in paragraph (o)(11)(iv)  of this section. Foods included in the breakfast must be of a texture  and a consistency that are appropriate for the age of the infant being  served. The foods must be served during a span of time consistent with  the infant's eating habits. For those infants whose dietary needs are  more individualized, exceptions to the meal pattern must be made in  accordance with the requirements found in Sec. 210.10(m) of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Breastmilk and iron-fortified formula. Either breastmilk or  iron-fortified infant formula, or portions of both, must be served for  the entire first year. Meals containing breastmilk and meals containing  iron-fortified infant formula supplied by the school are eligible for  reimbursement. However, infant formula provided by a parent (or  guardian) and breastmilk fed directly by the infant's mother, during a  visit to the school, contribute to a reimbursable breakfast only when  the school supplies at least one component of the infant's meal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Solid foods. For infants ages 4 through 7 months, solid foods  of an appropriate texture and consistency are required only when the  infant is developmentally ready to accept them. The school should  consult with the infant's parent (or guardian) in making the decision to  introduce solid foods. Solid foods should be introduced one at a time,  on a gradual basis, with the intent of ensuring the infant's health and  nutritional well-being.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Infant meal pattern. Infant breakfasts must have, at a minimum,  each of the food components indicated, in the   amount that is appropriate for the infant's age. For some breastfed  infants who regularly consume less than the minimum amount of breastmilk  per feeding, a serving of less than the minimum amount of breastmilk may  be offered. In these situations, additional breastmilk must be offered  if the infant is still hungry. Breakfasts may include portions of  breastmilk and iron-fortified infant formula as long as the total number  of ounces meets, or exceeds, the minimum amount required of this food  component. Similarly, to meet the component requirement for vegetables  and fruit, portions of both may be served.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Birth through 3 months. 4 to 6 fluid ounces of breastmilk or  iron-fortified infant formula--only breastmilk or iron-fortified formula  is required to meet the infant's nutritional needs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> 4 through 7 months. Breastmilk or iron-fortified formula is  required. Some infants may be developmentally ready for solid foods of  an appropriate texture and consistency. Breakfasts are reimbursable when  schools provide all of the components in the meal pattern that the  infant is developmentally ready to accept.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 4 to 8 fluid ounces of breastmilk or iron-fortified infant  formula; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 0 to 3 tablespoons of iron-fortified dry infant cereal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> 8 through 11 months. Breastmilk or iron-fortified formula and  solid foods of an appropriate texture and consistency are required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 6 to 8 fluid ounces of breastmilk or iron-fortified infant  formula; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 2 to 4 tablespoons of iron-fortified dry infant cereal; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> 1 to 4 tablespoons of fruit or vegetable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Infant meal pattern table. The minimum amounts of food  components to serve to infants, as described in paragraph (o)(11)(iv) of  this section, are:</p><p class="depth0">Breakfast Pattern for Infants ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Birth through 3 months                  4 through 7 months                    8 through 11 months ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4-6 fluid ounces of formula \1\ or    4-8 fluid ounces of formula \1\ or    6-8 fluid ounces of formula \1\ or</p><p class="depth0">breastmilk \2 3\                      breastmilk; \2 3\ and                 breastmilk; \2 3\ and</p><p class="depth0">0-3 tablespoons of infant cereal \1   2-4 tablespoons of infant cereal;</p><p class="depth0">4\                                    \1\ and</p><p class="depth0">1-4 tablespoons of fruit or</p><p class="depth0">vegetable or both. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ Infant formula and dry infant cereal must be iron-fortified. \2\ Breastmilk or formula, or portions of both, may be served; however, it is recommended that breastmilk be</p><p class="depth0">served from birth through 11 months. \3\ For some breastfed infants who regularly consume less than the minimum amount of breastmilk per feeding, a</p><p class="depth0">serving of less than the minimum amount of breastmilk may be offered, with additional breastmilk offered if</p><p class="depth0">the infant is still hungry. \4\ A serving of this component is required only when the infant is developmentally ready to accept it.
