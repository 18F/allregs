If, after his or her review, the Chairman also refuses to correct or to amend the record in accordance with the request, the Individual may file with the Commission a concise statement setting forth the reasons for his or her disagreement with the refusal of the Commission and may seek judicial review of the Chairman's determination under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(A).
