                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must determine the weight fraction of total CaO and total  MgO in CKD not recycled to the kiln from each kiln using ASTM C114-09,  Standard Test Methods for Chemical Analysis of Hydraulic Cement  (incoporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7). The monitoring must be  conducted quarterly for each kiln from a CKD sample drawn either as CKD  is exiting the kiln or from bulk CKD storage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must determine the weight fraction of total CaO and total  MgO in clinker from each kiln using ASTM C114-09 Standard Test Methods  for Chemical Analysis of Hydraulic Cement (incorporated by reference,  see Sec. 98.7). The monitoring must be conducted monthly for each kiln  from a monthly clinker sample drawn from bulk clinker storage if storage  is dedicated to the specific kiln, or from a monthly arithmetic average  of daily clinker samples drawn from the clinker conveying systems  exiting each kiln.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The total organic carbon content (dry basis) of raw materials  must be determined annually using ASTM C114-09 Standard Test Methods for  Chemical Analysis of Hydraulic Cement (incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 98.7) or a similar industry standard practice or method approved  for total organic carbon determination in raw mineral materials. The  analysis must be conducted either on sample material drawn from bulk raw  kiln feed storage or on sample material drawn from bulk raw material  storage for each category of raw material (i.e., limestone, sand, shale,  iron oxide, and alumina). Facilities that opt to use the default total  organic carbon factor provided in Sec. 98.83(d)(3), are not required to  monitor for TOC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The quantity of clinker produced monthly by each kiln must be  determined by direct weight measurement of clinker using the same plant  techniques used for accounting purposes, such as reconciling weigh  hopper or belt weigh feeder measurements against inventory measurements.  As an alternative, facilities may also determine clinker production by  direct measurement of raw kiln feed and application of a kiln-specific  feed-to-clinker factor. Facilities that opt to use a feed-to-clinker  factor must verify the accuracy of this factor on a monthly basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The quantity of CKD not recycled to the kiln generated by each  kiln must be determined quarterly using the same plant techniques used  for accounting purposes, such as direct weight measurement using weigh  hoppers, truck weigh scales, or belt weigh feeders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The annual quantity of raw kiln feed or annual quantity of each  category of raw materials consumed by the facility (e.g., limestone,  sand, shale, iron oxide, and alumina) must be determined monthly by  direct weight measurement using the same plant instruments used for  accounting purposes, such as weigh hoppers, truck weigh scales, or belt  weigh feeders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The monthly non-calcined CaO and MgO that remains in the clinker  in the form of CaCO3 or that enters the kiln as a non- carbonate species may be assumed to be a default value of 0.0 or may be  determined monthly by careful chemical analysis of feed material and  clinker material from each kiln using well documented analytical and  calculational methods or the appropriate industry standard practice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The quarterly non-calcined CaO and MgO that remains in the CKD  in the form of CaCO3 or that enters the kiln as a non- carbonate species may be assumed to be a default value of 0.0 or may be  determined quarterly by careful chemical analysis of feed material and  CKD material from each kiln using well documented analytical and  calculational methods or the appropriate industry standard practice.
