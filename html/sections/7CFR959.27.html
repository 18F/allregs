In the event a person is engaged in producing or handling onions in more than one district, such person shall elect the district within which he may participate as aforesaid in designating nominees;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Regardless of the number of districts in which a person produces or handles onions, each such person is entitled to cast only one vote on behalf of himself, his agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and representatives in designating nominees for committee members and alternates. An eligible voter's privilege of casting only one vote as aforesaid shall be construed to permit a voter to cast one vote for each position to be filled in the respective district in which he elects to vote.
