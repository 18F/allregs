In this case  the allowable charge for the procedure will be set individually based on  consideration of a detailed medical report and other evidence. At its  discretion, OWCP may set fees without regard to schedule limits for  specially authorized consultant examinations, for examinations performed  under 5 U.S.C. 8123, and for other specially authorized services.</p>
