                            <p class="depth0">The following ratings may be assigned, in lieu of ratings prescribed  elsewhere, under the conditions stated for disability from any disease  or injury. The prestabilization rating is not to be assigned in any case  in which a total rating is immediately assignable under the regular  provisions of the schedule or on the basis of individual  unemployability. The prestabilization 50-percent rating is not to be  used in any case in which a rating of 50 percent or more is immediately  assignable under the regular provisions.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Rating ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Unstabilized condition with severe disability--</p><p class="depth0">Substantially gainful employment is not feasible or                100</p><p class="depth0">advisable................................................

Prestabilization ratings  are for assignment in the immediate postdischarge period. They will  continue for a 12-month period following discharge from service.  However, prestabilization ratings may be changed to a regular schedular  total rating or one authorizing a greater benefit at any time. In each  prestabilization rating an examination will be requested to be  accomplished not earlier than 6 months nor more than 12 months following  discharge. In those prestabilization ratings in which following  examination reduction in evaluation is found to be warranted, the higher  evaluation will be continued to the end of the 12th month following  discharge or to the end of the period provided under Sec.  3.105(e) of  this chapter, whichever is later. Special monthly compensation should be  assigned concurrently in these cases whenever records are adequate to  establish entitlement.</p><p class="depth0">Note (2): Diagnosis of disease, injury, or residuals will be cited,  with diagnostic code number assigned from this rating schedule for  conditions listed therein.
