                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The DON follows the uniform fee schedule developed by DoD and  established to conform with the Office of Management and Budget's  (OMB's) Uniform Freedom of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fees reflect direct costs for search; review (in the case of  commercial requesters); and duplication of documents, collection of  which is permitted by the FOIA. They are neither intended to imply that  fees must be charged in connection with providing information to the  public in the routine course of business, nor are they meant as a  substitute for any other schedule of fees, which does not supersede the  collection of fees under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> FOIA fees do not supersede fees chargeable under a statute  specifically providing for setting the level of fees for particular  types of records. For example, 5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(4)(A)(vi) enables a  Government agency such as the Government Printing Office (GPO) or the  National Technical Information Service (NTIS), to set and collect fees.  DON activities should ensure that when documents that would be  responsive to a request are maintained for distribution by agencies  operating statutory-based fee schedule programs, such as GPO or NTIS,  they inform requesters of the steps necessary to obtain records from  those sources.</p>
