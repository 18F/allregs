                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Identity. The color additive FD&C; Yellow No. 5 is principally the trisodium salt of 4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-(1-4-sulfophenyl)-4-[(4-sulfophenyl)azo]-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (CAS Reg. No. 1934-21-0). To manufacture the additive, 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid is diazotized using hydrochloric acid and sodium nitrite. The diazo compound is coupled with 4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1-(4-sulfophenyl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid or with the methyl ester, the ethyl ester, or a salt of this carboxylic

acid. The resulting dye is purified and isolated as the sodium salt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Specifications. (1) FD&C; Yellow No. 5 shall conform to the following specifications and shall be free from impurities other than those named to the extent that such other impurities may be avoided by good manufacturing practice:
Sum of volatile matter at 135 [deg]C (275 [deg]F) and chlorides and sulfates (calculated as sodium salts), not more than 13 percent.Water-insoluble matter, not more than 0.2 percent.4,4'-[4,5-Dihydro-5-oxo-4-[(4-sulfophenyl)hydrazono]-1H-pyrazol-1,3-diyl]bis[benzenesulfonic acid], trisodium salt, not more than 1 percent.4-[(4',5-Disulfo[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-yl)hydrazono]-4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1-(4-sulfophenyl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid, tetrasodium salt, not more than 1 percent.Ethyl or methyl 4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1-(4-sulfophenyl)-4-[(4-sulfophenyl)hydrazono]-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylate, disodium salt, not more than 1 percent.Sum of 4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1-phenyl-4-[(4-sulfophenyl)azo]-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid, disodium salt, and 4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-4-(phenylazo)-1-(4-sulfophenyl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid, disodium salt, not more than 0.5 percent.4-Aminobenzenesulfonic acid, sodium salt, not more than 0.2 percent.4,5-Dihydro-5-oxo-1-(4-sulfophenyl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid, disodium salt, not more than 0.2 percent.Ethyl or methyl 4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1-(4-sulfophenyl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylate, sodium salt, not more than 0.1 percent.4,4'-(1-Triazene-1,3-diyl)bis[benzenesulfonic acid], disodium salt, not more than 0.05 percent.4-Aminoazobenzene, not more than 75 parts per billion.4-Aminobiphenyl, not more than 5 parts per billion.Aniline, not more than 100 parts per billion.Azobenzene, not more than 40 parts per billion.Benzidine, not more than 1 part per billion.1,3-Diphenyltriazene, not more than 40 parts per billion.Lead (as Pb), not more than 10 parts per million.Arsenic (as As), not more than 3 parts per million.Mercury (as Hg), not more than 1 part per million.Total color, not less than 87 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> FD&C; Yellow No. 5 Aluminum Lake shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of Sec.  82.51 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Uses and restrictions. (1) FD&C; Yellow No. 5 may be safely used for coloring cosmetics generally, including cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye, in amounts consistent with current good manufacturing practice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> FD&C; Yellow No. 5 Aluminum Lake may be safely used for coloring cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye, subject to the restrictions on use of color additives in Sec.  70.5(b) and (c) of this chapter, in amounts consistent with current good manufacturing practice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Labeling. The label of the color additive shall conform to the requirements of Sec.  70.25 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Certification. All batches of FD&C; Yellow No. 5 shall be certified in accordance with regulations in part 80 of this chapter.
