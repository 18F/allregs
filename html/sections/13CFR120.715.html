                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> SBA may guarantee not less than 90 percent of loans made by for-profit or nonprofit entities (or an alliance of such entities) to no more than 10 Intermediaries in urban areas and 10 Intermediaries in Rural Areas (as defined in Sec. 120.10).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any loan guaranteed by SBA under this section will have a term of 10 years. If an Intermediary receives such a loan, it will not need to repay any principal or interest during the first year, although the interest will accrue. During the second through fifth years, the Intermediary will pay interest only. During the sixth through tenth years, it will pay interest and fully amortize the principal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The interest rate on any loan under this section shall be calculated as described in Sec. 120.706.
