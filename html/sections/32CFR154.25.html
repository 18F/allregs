A check of the DCII should be conducted to accomplish this task.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whenever a valid DoD security clearance or Special Access authorization (including one pertaining to SCI) is on record, Components shall not request DIS or other DoD investigative organizations to forward prior investigative files for review unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Significant derogatory information or investigation completed subsequent to the date of last clearance or Special Access authorization, is known to the requester; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The individual concerned is being considered for a higher level clearance (e.g., Secret or Top Secret) or the individual does not have a Special Access authorization and is being considered for one; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There has been a break in the individual's military service/civilian employment of greater than 12 months subsequent to the issuance of a prior clearance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The most recent SCI access authorization of the individual concerned was based on a waiver.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requests for prior investigative files authorized by this part shall be made in writing, shall cite the specific justification for the request (i.e., upgrade of clearance, issue Special Access

authorization, etc.), and shall include the date, level, and issuing organization of the individual's current or most recent security clearance or Special Access authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All requests for non-DoD investigative files, authorized under the criteria prescribed by paragraphs (a), (b) (1), (2), (3), and (4) and (c) of this section shall be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submitted on DD Form 398-2 to DIS;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Annotated as a ``Single Agency Check'' of whichever agency or agency developed the investigative file or to obtain the check of a single national agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When further investigation is desired, in addition to an existing non-DoD investigative file, a DD Form 1879 will be submitted to DIS with the appropriate security forms attached.

In such instances the clearance shall not be reissued until the questionable information has been adjudicated.</p>
