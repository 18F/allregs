                            <p class="depth0">During the performance test required by Sec. 63.9310, you must  establish the operating limits required by Sec. 63.9302 according to  this section, unless you have received approval for alternative  monitoring and operating limits under Sec. 63.8(f) as specified in  Sec. 63.9302.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em>  and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the performance test, you must monitor and record the  combustion temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the  three test runs. You must monitor the temperature in the firebox of the  thermal oxidizer or immediately downstream of the firebox before any  substantial heat exchange occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate  and record the average combustion temperature maintained during the  performance test. This average combustion temperature is the minimum  operating limit for your thermal oxidizer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)</em> and (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the performance test, you must monitor and record the  temperature just before the catalyst bed and the temperature difference  across the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of  the three test runs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate  and record the average temperature just before the catalyst bed and the  average temperature difference across the catalyst bed maintained during  the performance test. These are the minimum operating limits for your  catalytic oxidizer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As an alternative to monitoring the temperature difference  across the catalyst bed, you may monitor the temperature at the inlet to  the catalyst bed and implement a site-specific inspection and  maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer as specified in paragraph  (b)(4) of this section. During the performance test, you must monitor  and record the temperature just before the catalyst bed at least once  every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. Use the data  collected during the performance test to calculate and record the  average temperature just before the catalyst bed during the performance  test. This is the minimum operating limit for your catalytic oxidizer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em> through (iii)  of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Annual sampling and analysis of the catalyst activity (i.e.,  conversion   efficiency) following the manufacturer's or catalyst supplier's  recommended procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Monthly inspection of the oxidizer system, including the burner  assembly and fuel supply lines for problems and, as necessary, adjust  the equipment to assure proper air-to-fuel mixtures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Annual internal and monthly external visual inspection of the  catalyst bed to check for channeling, abrasion, and settling. If  problems are found, you must take corrective action consistent with the  manufacturer's recommendation and conduct a new performance test to  determine destruction efficiency according to Sec. 63.9323.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> and (2) of this section. The  operating limit for a PTE is specified in Table 3 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the capture efficiency determination required by  Sec. 63.9310, you must monitor and record either the gas volumetric flow  rate or the duct static pressure for each separate capture device in  your emission capture system at least once every 15 minutes during each  of the three test runs at a point in the duct between the capture device  and the add-on control device inlet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Calculate and record the average gas volumetric flow rate or  duct static pressure for the three test runs for each capture device.  This average gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure is the  minimum operating limit for that specific capture device.</p>
