The notice of appeal shall specify the portion of the decision  from which the appeal is taken, and   the reasons why the decision is erroneous. A statement of fact and  argument in the form of a brief in support of the appeal may be  submitted with the notice of appeal or, if the appellant prefers, may be  filed with the Commission within fifteen (15) days after the filing of  the notice of appeal. If a statement of fact and argument in the form of  a brief in support of the appeal is not submitted with the notice, the  appellant shall state in the notice whether such a statement of fact and  argument in the form of a brief in support of the appeal will be filed.</p>
