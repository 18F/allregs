Steam check valves on direct  steam type cookers shall be mounted flush with cooker wall, be  constructed of stainless steel and designed to prevent the backup of  product into the steam line, or the steam line shall be constructed of  stainless steel pipes and fittings which can be readily cleaned. If  direct steam is applied to the product only culinary steam shall be used  (see Sec. 58.127(d)).</p>
