                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This rule applies to all Head Start and Early Head Start agencies, and their delegate agencies (hereafter, agency or agencies), including those that provide transportation services, with the exceptions provided in this section, regardless of whether such transportation is provided directly on agency owned or leased vehicles or through arrangement with a private or public transportation provider. Transportation services to children served under the home-based Option for Head Start and Early Head Start services are excluded from the requirements of 45 CFR 1310.12, 1310.15(c), and 1310.16. Except when there is an applicable State or local requirement that sets a higher standard on a matter covered by this part, agencies must comply with requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> Sections 1310.12(a) and 1310.22(a) of this part are effective December 20, 2006.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sections 1310.12(a) and 1310.22(a) of this part are effective December 20, 2006.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This paragraph and paragraph (c) of this section, the definition of child restraint systems in Sec. 1310.3 of this part, and Sec. 1310.15(a) are effective November 1, 2006. Sections 1310.11 and 1310.15(c) of this part are effective June 21, 2004. Section 1310.12(b) of this part is effective February 20, 2001. All other provisions of this part are effective January 18, 2002.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effective November 1, 2006, an agency may request a waiver of specific requirements of this part, except for the requirements of this paragraph. Requests for waivers must be made in writing to the responsible Health and Human Services (HHS) official, as part of an agency's annual application for financial assistance or amendment thereto, based on good cause. ``Good cause'' for a waiver will exist when adherence to a requirement of this part would itself create a safety hazard in the circumstances faced by the agency,

or when compliance with requirements related to child restraint systems (Secs. 1310.11, 1310.15(a)) or bus monitors (Sec. 1310.15(c)) will result in a significant disruption to the program and the agency demonstrates that waiving such requirements is in the best interest of the children involved. In addition, the responsible HHS official shall have the authority to grant waivers of the requirements related to child restraint systems (Sec. 1310.11, 1310.15(a)) or bus monitors (Sec. 1310.15(c)) that are retroactive to October 1, 2006 during the period from November 1, 2006 to October 30, 2007. The responsible HHS official is not authorized to waive any requirements of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) made applicable to any class of vehicle under 49 CFR part 571. The responsible HHS official shall have the right to require such documentation as the official deems necessary in support of a request for a waiver. Approvals of waiver requests must be in writing, be signed by the responsible HHS official, and be based on good cause.
