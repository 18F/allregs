                                Sec.  1.58-6  Regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em> and  Sec.  1.57-1(b)) are treated as items of tax preference of the  shareholders, or holders of beneficial interest, in the same proportion  that the dividends (other than capital gains dividends) paid to each  such shareholder, or holder of beneficial interest, bear to the taxable  income of such company or such trust determined without regard to the  deduction for dividends paid. In no case, however, is such proportion to  be considered in excess of 100 percent. For example, if a regulated  investment company has items of tax preference of $500,000 for the  taxable year, none of which resulted from capital gains, and distributes  dividends in an amount equal to 90 percent of its taxable income, each  shareholder treats his share of 90 percent of the company's items of tax  preference, or (a proportionate share of) $450,000, as items of tax  preference of the shareholder. The remaining $50,000 constitutes items  of tax preference of the company. Amounts treated under this paragraph  as items of tax preference of the shareholders, or holders of beneficial  interest, are deemed to be derived proportionately from each item of tax  preference of the company or trust, other than the capital gains item of  tax preference and, in the case of a real estate investment trust,  accelerated depreciation on section 1250 property. Such amounts are  taken into account by the shareholders, or holders of beneficial  interest, in the same taxable year in which the dividends on which the  apportionment is based are includible in income. The minimum tax  exemption of the trust or company shall not be reduced   because a portion of the trust's or company's items of tax preference  are allocated to the shareholders or holders of beneficial interests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)</em> as long-term capital gains of  shareholders, or holders of beneficial interest, are automatically  included, pursuant to sections 57(a)(9) and 1.57-1(i), in the  computation of the capital gains item of tax preference of the  shareholders, or holders of beneficial interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Accelerated depreciation on section 1250 property. In the case  of a real estate investment trust, all of the items of tax preference  resulting from accelerated depreciation on section 1250 property held by  the trust (section 57(a)(2) and Sec.  1.57-1(b)) are treated as items of  tax preference of the trust, and, thus, none are treated as items of tax  preference of the shareholder, or holder of beneficial interest.
