                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, (b), or (c) should make a  submission when concept plans for the project are ready but before  detailed plans and specifications or working drawings are prepared. In  order to assure that a submission will be considered at the next  scheduled meeting of the Commission, it should be delivered to the  Commissions offices not later than ten (10) working days before the  meeting; if it is a project subject to review first by the Georgetown  Board, not later than ten (10) working days before the Georgetown Board  meeting. The Commission will attempt to consider a submission which is  not made in conformity with this schedule, but it reserves the right to  postpone consideration until its next subsequent meeting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each submission should state or disclose:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The nature, location, and justification of the project,  including any relevant historical information about the building or  other structure to be altered or razed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The identity of the owner or developer (or for public  buildings, the governmental unit with authority to approve or act upon  the plans) and of the architect;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The functions, uses, and purpose of the project; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Other information to the extent it is relevant, such as area  studies, site plans, building and landscape schematics, renderings,  models, depictions or samples of exterior materials and   components, and photographs of existing conditions to be affected by the  project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Alternative proposals may be included within one submission. The  information submitted shall be sufficiently complete, detailed, and  accurate as will enable the Commission to judge the ultimate character,  siting, height, bulk, and appearance of the project, in its entirety,  including the grounds within the scope of the project, its setting and  environs, and its effect upon existing conditions and upon historical  and prevailing architectural values. Record drawings and photographs  will be submitted by the applicant for a permanent Commission record of  the submission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a project consists of a first or intermediate phase of a  contemplated larger program of construction, similar information about  the eventual plans should accompany the submission. Even though a  submission relates only to approval for razing or removal of a building  or other structure, the project will be regarded as part of phased  development, and the submission is subject to such requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the project involves a statue, fountain or a monument within  the purview of the Commission under Sec. 2101.1 (a)(2), partial  submissions should be made as appropriate to permit the Commission to  advise on each aspect of the project as prescribed by the Commemorative  Works Act (Pub. L. 99-652, H.R. 4378, 40 U.S.C. 1001).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Commission staff will advise owners and architects  concerning the scope and content of particular submissions. Material  relevant to the functions and policies of the Commission varies greatly  depending upon the nature, size, and importance of the project to be  reviewed by the Commission. Also, it is the policy of the Commission not  to impose unnecessary burdens or delays on persons who make submissions  to the Commission. However, the Commission at any meeting may decline to  reach a conclusion about a proposed project if it deems the submission  materials inadequate for its purposes, or it may condition its  conclusions on the submission of further information to it at a later  meeting or, in its discretion, may delegate final action to the staff.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Commission staff, members of the Georgetown Board,  interested members of the public, or the submitting party may augment  any submission by additional relevant information made available to the  Commission before or at the meeting where the submission is considered.  The staff should also make information available concerning prior  considerations or conclusions of the Commission regarding the same  project or earlier versions of it.</p>
