                            <p class="depth0">All fittings, utensils and equipment, unless new, to be used in the loading, stowing, or other handling of animals aboard surface vessels under the provisions of this part, shall first be cleaned and disinfected under the supervision of an inspector before being used for, or in connection with, the transportation of animals from any United States port. Such disinfection of halters, ropes, and similar equipment used in handling and tying of animals shall be by immersion in an approved disinfectant. When the surface vessel has last been used to carry livestock to or from a foot-and-mouth disease infected country, the approved disinfectant shall be a freshly prepared solution of:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sodium carbonate (4 percent) in the proportion of 1 pound to 3 gallons of water.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> 4 percent sodium carbonate plus 0.1 percent sodium silicate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sodium hydroxide (Lye) prepared in a fresh solution in the proportion of not less than 1 pound avoirdupois of sodium hydroxide of not less than 95 percent purity to 6 gallons of water, or one 13\1/2\-ounce can to 5 gallons of water. \7\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\7\Due to the extreme caustic nature of sodium hydroxide solution, precautionary measures such as the wearing of rubber gloves, boots, raincoat, and goggles should be observed. An acid solution such as vinegar shall be kept readily available in case any of the sodium hydroxide solution should come in contact with the body.
For carriers returning from other foreign countries, the approved disinfectant shall be a disinfectant permitted for use under Sec. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------71.10, part 71 of this chapter.
