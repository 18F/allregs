This subpart describes the criteria States must address in developing  and implementing coastal zone enhancement objectives, the procedures for  allocating section 309 funds between weighted formula and individual  review of proposals of special merit, how the amount of section 309  weighted formula grants will be determined, the criteria NOAA will use  to evaluate and rank individual proposals of special merit, and the  procedures for applying for financial assistance under section 309. This  subpart also allows use of section 309 funds for implementation of  program changes for up to 2 fiscal years following the fiscal year in  which a program change was approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A coastal State with an approved program under section 306 of  the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1455), is  eligible for grants under this subpart if the State meets the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State must have a NOAA approved Assessment and Strategy,  submitted in accordance with NOAA guidance and 923.128;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State must be found to be adhering to its approved program  and must be making satisfactory progress in performing grant tasks under  section 306, as indicated by not being under interim or final sanctions;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State must be making satisfactory progress in carrying out  its previous year's award under section 309.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the Assistant Administrator finds that a State is not  undertaking the actions committed to under the terms of a section 309  grant, the Assistant Administrator shall suspend the State's eligibility  for future funding under this section for at least one year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A State's eligibility for future funding under this section will  be restored after the State demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the  Assistant Administrator, that it will conform with the requirements  under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Funds awarded to States under section 309 are for the  enhancement of existing coastal zone management programs. A State which  reduces overall State financial support for its CZM program as a result  of having been awarded section 309 funding may lose eligibility for  funding under section 309 in subsequent years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> All applications for funding under section 309 of the CZMA, as  amended, including proposed work programs, funding priorities and  funding awards, are subject to the administrative discretion of the  Assistant Administrator and any additional NOAA guidance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Grants awarded under section 309 may be used:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To support up to 100 percent of the allowable costs of approved  projects   under section 309 of the CZMA, as amended; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To implement program changes approved by the Secretary for up to  two fiscal years following the fiscal year in which a program change was  approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> All application forms are to be requested from and submitted to:  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Office of Ocean and  Coastal Resource Management, Coastal Programs Division, 1305 East-West  Highway (N/ORM3), Silver Spring, MD 20910.
