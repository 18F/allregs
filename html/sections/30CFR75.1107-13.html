                            <p class="depth0">Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. Sec. 75.1107-1 through  75.1107-12 the District Manager for the District in which the mine is  located may approve any other fire suppression system or device which  provides substantially equivalent protection as would be achieved  through compliance with those sections: Provided, That no such system or  device shall be approved which does not meet the following minimum  criteria:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Components shall be approved by the Secretary, or where  appropriate be listed as approved by a nationally recognized agency  approved by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The fire suppression equipment shall be designed to withstand  the rigors of the mine environment. Where used, pressure vessels shall  conform with the requirements of section 3603, 3606, 3607, 3707, and  3708 of National Fire Code No. 22 ``Water Tanks for Private Fire  Protection'' (NFPA No. 22-1971).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The cover of hose of fire suppression devices, if used on the  protected equipment, shall meet the flame-resistant requirements of Part  18 of this chapter (Bureau of Mines Schedule 2G).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Extinguishing agents shall not create a serious toxic or other  hazard to the miners.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The electrical components of the fire suppression device shall  meet the requirements for electrical components of the mining machine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where used, manual actuators for initiating the operation of the  fire suppression device shall be readily accessible to the machine  operator. On unattended equipment, an automatic as well as a manual  actuator shall be provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> On unattended equipment the fire suppression device shall  operate independently of the power to the main motor (or equivalent) so  it will remain operative if the circuit breakers (or other protective  device) actuates. On attended equipment powered through a trailing cable  the fire suppression device shall operate independently of the  electrical power provided by the cable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> On unattended equipment, the sensor system shall have a means  for checking its operative condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The fire suppression agent shall be directed at locations where  the greatest potential fire hazard exists. Cable reel compartments shall  receive approximately twice the quantity of extinguishing agent as each  other hazardous location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The rate of application of the fire suppression agent shall  minimize the time for quenching and the total quantity applied shall be  sufficient to quench a fire in its incipient stage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The effectiveness of the quenching agent, together with the  total quantity of agent and its rate of application shall provide  equivalent protection to the water, dry powder, or foam   systems described in Sec. Sec. 75.1107-7, 75.1107-9, and 75.1107-10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> The fire suppression device shall be operable at all times  electrical power is connected to the mining machine, except during  tramming when the machine is in a ventilated passageway, the water hose  if used, may be switched from one hydrant to another in a reasonable  time and except in systems meeting the minimum special criteria set  forth in paragraph (m) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Systems for attended equipment which are not continuously  connected to a water supply shall not be approved unless they meet the  following minimum criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The machine shall be equipped with a firehose at least 50 feet  in length which is continuously connected to the machine-mounted portion  of the system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Hydrants in proximity to the area where the machine is to be  used shall be equipped with sufficient hose to reach the machine at any  time it is connected to a power source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The machine shall be used only where the operator (or other  person) will always be in ventilated air uncontaminated by smoke and hot  gases from the machine fire while extending the machine-mounted hose to  connect with the hydrant-mounted hose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The machine and hydrant hoses shall be readily accessible so  that the connection between the machine-mounted hose and the hydrant  hose can be made and water flow achieved in not more than 3 minutes  under actual mining conditions for any location of the machine while  electric power is connected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The rate of water flow at the machine shall provide a minimum of  0.12 gallon of water per minute per square foot of top surface area  (excluding conveyors, cutters, and gathering heads). The water shall  discharge to all hazardous locations on the machine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Hose, if used on the machine, in addition to meeting the flame  resistant requirements for the cover of a hose provided in Sec. Sec.  75.1107-3(b) and 75.1107-13(c) shall have a minimum burst pressure 4  times that of the static water pressure at the mining machine. Fabric  braid hose shall have at least two braids, and wire braid hose shall  have at least a single braid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> In addition to the hose located at the hydrant (which is  intended to be connected to the hose on the machine) the firefighting  equipment required by Sec. 75.1100-2(a) shall be maintained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A sufficient number of trained miners shall be kept on the  section when the machine is in use to connect the machine hose to the  hydrant hose and achieve water flow in not more than 3 minutes.
