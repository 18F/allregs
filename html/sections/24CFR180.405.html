Except for time periods required by statute, the ALJ may enlarge or reduce any time period required under this part where necessary to avoid prejudicing the public interest or the rights of the parties. Requests for extension of time should set forth the reasons for the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Entry of orders. In computing any time period involving the date of the ALJ's issuance of an order or decision, the date of issuance is the date of service by the Docket Clerk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Computation of time for delivery by mail. When documents are filed by mail, three days shall be added to the prescribed time period for filing any responsive pleading. Documents are not filed until received by the Docket Clerk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Untimely filing. The ALJ may refuse to consider any motion or other document that is not filed in a timely fashion.
