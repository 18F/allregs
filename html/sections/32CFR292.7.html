                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A requester may appeal an initial decision to withhold a record.  Further, if a requester determines a ``no record'' response in answer to  a request to be adverse, this determination may also be appealed.  Appeals should be addressed to: Defense Intelligence Agency, ATTN: DSP- 1A (FOIA), Washington, DC 20340-3299.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The requester shall be advised that the appellate authority must  receive an appeal no later than 60 calendar days after the date of the  initial denial letter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Final determination on appeals normally will be made within 20  working days of receipt of the appeal at the above address. If  additional time is needed to decide the appeal because of unusual  circumstances, the final determination may be delayed for the number of  working days, not to exceed 10, which were not utilized as additional  time for responding to the initial request. Appeals shall be processed  in order of receipt. However, this does not preclude DIA from completing  action on an appeal request which can easily be answered, regardless of  its ranking within the order of receipt. DIA may expedite action on an  appeal request regardless of its ranking within the order of receipt  upon a showing of exceptional need or urgency. Exceptional need or  urgency is determined at the discretion of DIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When an appeal is denied, the requester will be apprised of the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The basis for the refusal shall be explained to the requester,  in writing, identifying the applicable statutory exemption or exemptions  invoked under provisions of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the final refusal is based in whole or in part on a  security classification, the explanation shall include a determination  that the record meets the criteria and rationale of the governing  Executive Order, and that this determination is based on a  declassification review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The final denial shall include the name and title or position of  the official responsible for the denial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The response shall advise the requester with regard to denied  information whether or not any reasonably segregable portions were  found.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The response shall advise the requester of the right to judicial  review.</p>
