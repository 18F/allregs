This shall be accomplished by submitting a list of engine families with the associated evaporative/refueling families, and the corresponding assembly plants from which the manufacturer desires to have vehicles selected, to the Administrator. In order that a manufacturer's preferred location for issuance of a test order for a configuration of a particular engine family and/or evaporative/refueling family be considered, the list must be submitted prior to issuance of the test order. Notwithstanding the fact that a manufacturer has submitted the above list, the Administrator may, upon making the determination that evidence exists indicating noncompliance at other than the manufacturer's preferred plant, order selection at such other plant where vehicles of the configuration specified in the test order are assembled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.603-88.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In the event evidence exists indicating an engine family is in noncompliance, the Administrator may, in addition to other powers provided by this section, issue a test order specifying the engine family the manufacturer is required to test.
