                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Application. This section applies to  compressed air receivers, and other equipment used in providing and  utilizing compressed air for performing operations such as cleaning,  drilling, hoisting, and chipping. On the other hand, however, this  section does not deal with the special problems created by using  compressed air to convey materials nor the problems created when men  work in compressed air as in tunnels and caissons. This section is not  intended to apply to compressed air machinery and equipment used on  transportation vehicles such as steam railroad cars, electric railway  cars, and automotive equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> New and existing equipment. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All new air receivers installed  after the effective date of these regulations shall be constructed in  accordance with the 1968 edition of the A.S.M.E. Boiler and Pressure  Vessel Code Section VIII.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All safety valves used shall be constructed, installed, and  maintained in accordance with the A.S.M.E. Boiler and Pressure Vessel  Code, Section VIII Edition 1968.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Installation and equipment requirements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Installation. Air  receivers shall be so installed that all drains, handholes, and manholes  therein are easily accessible. Under no circumstances shall an air  receiver be buried underground or located in an inaccessible place.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Drains and traps. A drain pipe and valve shall be installed at  the lowest point of every air receiver to provide for the removal of  accumulated oil and water. Adequate automatic traps may be installed in  addition to drain valves. The drain valve on the air receiver shall be  opened and the receiver completely drained frequently and at such  intervals as to prevent the accumulation of excessive amounts of liquid  in the receiver.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Gages and valves. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Every air receiver shall be equipped with  an indicating pressure gage (so located as to be readily visible) and  with one or more spring-loaded safety valves. The total relieving  capacity of such safety valves shall be such as to prevent pressure in  the receiver from exceeding the maximum allowable working pressure of  the receiver by more than 10 percent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No valve of any type shall be placed between the air receiver  and its safety valve or valves.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Safety appliances, such as safety valves, indicating devices  and controlling devices, shall be constructed, located, and installed so  that they cannot be readily rendered inoperative by any means, including  the elements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> All safety valves shall be tested frequently and at regular  intervals to determine whether they are in good operating condition.
