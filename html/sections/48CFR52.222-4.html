                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 22.305, insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards--Overtime Compensation (MAY</p><p class="depth0">2014)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Overtime requirements. No Contractor or subcontractor employing  laborers or mechanics (see Federal Acquisition Regulation 22.300) shall  require or permit them to work over 40 hours in any workweek unless they  are paid at least 1 and \1/2\ times the basic rate of pay for each hour  worked over 40 hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Violation; liability for unpaid wages; liquidated damages. The  responsible Contractor and subcontractor are liable for unpaid wages if  they violate the terms in paragraph (a) of this clause. In addition, the  Contractor and subcontractor are liable for liquidated damages payable  to the Government. The Contracting Officer will assess liquidated  damages at the rate of $10 per affected employee for each calendar day  on which the employer required or permitted the employee to work in  excess of the standard workweek of 40 hours without paying overtime  wages required by the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards statute  (found at 40 U.S.C. chapter 37).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Withholding for unpaid wages and liquidated damages. The  Contracting Officer will withhold from payments due under the contract  sufficient funds required to satisfy any Contractor or subcontractor  liabilities for unpaid wages and liquidated damages. If amounts withheld  under the contract are insufficient to satisfy Contractor or  subcontractor liabilities, the Contracting Officer will withhold  payments from other Federal or Federally assisted contracts held by the  same Contractor that are subject to the Contract Work Hours and Safety  Standards statute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payrolls and basic records. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor and its  subcontractors shall maintain payrolls and basic payroll records for all  laborers and mechanics working on the contract during the contract and  shall make them available to the Government until 3 years after contract  completion. The records   shall contain the name and address of each employee, social security  number, labor classifications, hourly rates of wages paid, daily and  weekly number of hours worked, deductions made, and actual wages paid.  The records need not duplicate those required for construction work by  Department of Labor regulations at 29 CFR 5.5(a)(3) implementing the  Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Contractor and its subcontractors shall allow authorized  representatives of the Contracting Officer or the Department of Labor to  inspect, copy, or transcribe records maintained under paragraph (d)(1)  of this clause. The Contractor or subcontractor also shall allow  authorized representatives of the Contracting Officer or Department of  Labor to interview employees in the workplace during working hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Subcontracts. The Contractor shall insert the provisions set  forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this clause in subcontracts that  may require or involve the employment of laborers and mechanics and  require subcontractors to include these provisions in any such lower  tier subcontracts. The Contractor shall be responsible for compliance by  any subcontractor or lower-tier subcontractor with the provisions set  forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this clause.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)  [65 FR 46067, July 26, 2000, as amended at 70 FR 33667, June 8, 2005; 79  FR 24217, Apr. 29, 2014]</p>
