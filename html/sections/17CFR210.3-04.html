                            <p class="depth0">An analysis of the changes in each caption of stockholders' equity  and noncontrolling interests presented in the balance sheets shall be  given in a note or separate statement. This analysis shall be presented  in the form of a reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending  balance for each period for which an income statement is required to be  filed with all significant reconciling items described by appropriate  captions with contributions from and distribution to owners shown  separately. Also, state-separately the adjustments to the balance at the  beginning of the earliest period presented for items which were  retroactively applied to periods prior to that period. With respect to  any dividends, state the amount per share and in the aggregate for each  class of shares. Provide a separate schedule in the notes to the  financial statements that shows the effects of any changes in the  registrant's ownership interest in a subsidiary on the equity  attributable to the registrant.
