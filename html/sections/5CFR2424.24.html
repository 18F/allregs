                                Sec. 2424.24  Agency's statement of position; purpose; time limits;
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of an agency statement of position is to  inform the Authority and the exclusive representative why a proposal or  provision is not within the duty to bargain or contrary to law,  respectively. As more fully explained in paragraph (c) of this section,  the agency is required in the statement of position to, among other  things, set forth its understanding of the proposal or provision, state  any disagreement with the facts, arguments, or meaning of the proposal  or provision set forth in the exclusive representative's petition for  review, and supply all arguments and authorities in support of its  position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time limit for filing. Unless the time limit for filing has been  extended pursuant to Sec. 2424.23 or part 2429 of this subchapter, the  agency must file its statement of position within thirty (30) days after  the date the head of the agency receives a copy of the petition for  review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Content. You must file your statement of position on a form that  the Authority has provided for that purpose, or in a substantially  similar format. You meet this requirement if you file your statement  electronically through use of the eFiling system on the FLRA's Web site  at www.flra.gov. That Web site also provides copies of statement forms.  You must date your statement, unless you file it electronically through  use of the eFiling system. And, regardless of how you file your  statement, your statement must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Withdraw either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The allegation that the duty to bargain in good faith does not  extend to the exclusive representative's proposal, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The disapproval of the provision under 5 U.S.C. 7114(c); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Set forth in full your position on any matters relevant to the  petition that you want the Authority to consider in reaching its  decision, including: A statement of the arguments and authorities  supporting any bargaining obligation or negotiability claims; any  disagreement with claims that the exclusive representative made in the  petition for review; specific citation to any law, rule, regulation,  section of a collective bargaining agreement, or other authority that  you rely on; and a copy of any such material that the Authority may not  easily access (which you may upload as attachments if you file your  statement of position electronically through use of the FLRA's eFiling  system). Your statement of position must also include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If different from the exclusive representative's position, an  explanation of the meaning the agency attributes to the proposal or  provision and the reasons for disagreeing with the exclusive  representative's explanation of meaning;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If different from the exclusive representative's position, an  explanation of how the proposal or provision would work, and the reasons  for disagreeing with the exclusive representative's explanation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement as to whether the proposal or provision is also  involved in an unfair labor practice charge under part 2423 of this  subchapter, a grievance pursuant to the parties' negotiated grievance  procedure, or an impasse procedure under part 2470 of this subchapter,  and whether any other petition for review has been filed concerning a  proposal or provision arising from the same bargaining or the same  agency head review; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any request for a hearing before the Authority and the reasons  supporting such request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Severance. If the exclusive representative has requested  severance in the petition for review, and if the agency opposes the  exclusive representative's request for severance, then the agency must  explain with specificity why severance is not appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Service. A copy of the agency's statement of position, including  all attachments, must be served in accord with Sec. 2424.2(g).  [63 FR 66413, Dec. 2, 1998, as amended at 74 FR 51745, Oct. 8, 2009; 77  FR 26434, May 4, 2012]</p>
