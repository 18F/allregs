                                Sec. 904.118  Homeowners association--planned unit development
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">If the development is organized as a planned unit development:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ownership and maintenance of common property. The common areas,  sidewalks, parking lots, and other common property in the development  shall be owned and maintained as provided for   in the approved planned unit development (PUD) program except that the  LHA shall be responsible for maintenance until such time as the  homeowners association assumes such responsibility (see Sec.  904.112(d)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Title restrictions. The title ultimately conveyed to each  homebuyer shall be subject to restrictions and encumbrances to protect  the rights and property of all other owners. The homeowners association  shall have the right and obligation to enforce such restrictions and  encumbrances and to assess owners for the costs incurred in connection  with common areas and property and other responsibilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Votes in association. There shall be as many votes in the  association as there are homes in the development, and, at the outset,  all the voting rights shall be held by the LHA. As each home is conveyed  to the homebuyer, one vote shall automatically go to the homeowner so  that, when all the homes have been conveyed, the LHA shall no longer  have any interest in the homeowners association.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Voting control. The LHA shall not lose its majority voting  interest in the association as soon as a majority of the homes have been  conveyed, unless the law of the state requires control to be transferred  at a particular time, or the LHA so desires. If permitted by state law,  provision shall be made for each home owned by the LHA to carry three  votes, while each home owned by a homeowner shall carry one vote. Under  this weighted voting plan, the LHA shall continue to have voting control  until 75 percent of the homes have been acquired by homeowners. However,  at its discretion, the LHA may transfer voting control to the homeowners  when at least 50 percent of the homes have been acquired by the  homeowners.</p>
