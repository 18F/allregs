                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Evaluation components. An evaluation by the HRP management  official is required before an individual can be considered for initial  certification or recertification in the HRP. This evaluation must be  based on a careful review of the results of the supervisory review,  medical assessment, and drug and alcohol testing. If a safety concern is  identified, the HRP management official must require the supervisor to  temporarily reassign the individual to non-HRP duties and forward this  information to the HRP certifying official. If the management evaluation  reveals a security concern, the HRP management official must notify the  applicable DOE personnel security office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Drug testing. All HRP candidates and HRP-certified individuals  are subject to testing for the use of illegal drugs, as required by this  part. Testing must be conducted in accordance with 10 CFR part 707, the  workplace substance abuse program for DOE contractor employees, and DOE  Order   3792.3, ``Drug-Free Federal Workplace Testing Implementation Program,''  for DOE employees. The program must include an initial drug test, random  drug tests at least once every 12 months from the previous test, and  tests of HRP-certified individuals if they are involved in an incident,  unsafe practice, occurrence, or based on reasonable suspicion. Failure  to appear for unannounced testing within two hours of notification  constitutes a refusal to submit to a test. Sites may establish a shorter  time period between notification and testing but may not exceed the two- hour requirement. An HRP-certified individual who, based on a drug test,  has been determined to use illegal drugs must immediately be removed  from HRP duties, and DOE personnel security must be notified  immediately.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Alcohol testing. All HRP candidates and HRP-certified  individuals are subject to testing for the use of alcohol, as required  by this part. The alcohol testing program must include, as a minimum, an  initial alcohol test prior to performing HRP duties and random alcohol  tests at least once every 12 months from the previous test, and tests of  HRP-certified individuals if they are involved in an incident, unsafe  practice, occurrence, or based on reasonable suspicion. An HRP-certified  individual who has been determined to have an alcohol concentration of  0.02 percent or greater shall be sent home and not allowed to perform  HRP duties for 24 hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Breath alcohol testing must be conducted by a certified breath  alcohol technician and conform to the DOT procedures (49 CFR part 40,  Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing  Programs, subparts J through N) for use of an evidential-grade breath  analysis device approved for 0.02/0.04 cutoff levels, which conforms to  the DOT model specifications and the most recent ``Conforming Products  List'' issued by NHTSA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An individual required to undergo DOT alcohol testing is subject  to the regulations of the DOT. If such an individual's blood alcohol  level exceeds DOT standards, the individual's employer may take  appropriate disciplinary action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The following constitutes a refusal to submit to a test and  shall be considered as a positive alcohol concentration test of 0.02  percent, which requires the individual be sent home and not allowed to  perform HRP duties for 24 hours:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Failure to appear for unannounced testing within two hours of  notification (or established shorter time for the specific site);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Failure to provide an adequate volume of breath in two attempts  without a valid medical excuse; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Engaging in conduct that clearly obstructs the testing  process, including failure to cooperate with reasonable instructions  provided by the testing technician.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Occurrence testing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When an HRP-certified individual is  involved in, or associated with, an occurrence requiring immediate  reporting to the DOE, the following procedures must be implemented:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Testing for the use of illegal drugs in accordance with the  provisions of the DOE policies implementing Executive Order 12564, and  10 CFR part 707 or DOE Order 3792.3, which establish workplace substance  abuse programs for contractor and DOE employees, respectively.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Testing for use of alcohol in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Testing must be performed as soon as possible after an  occurrence that requires immediate notification or reporting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The supervisor must remove an HRP-certified individual from HRP  duties if the individual refuses to undergo the testing required by this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Testing for reasonable suspicion. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the behavior of an  individual in an HRP position creates the basis for reasonable suspicion  of the use of an illegal drug or alcohol, that individual must be tested  if two or more supervisory or management officials, at least one of whom  is in the direct chain of supervision of the individual or is the  Designated Physician, the Designated Psychologist, or the SOMD, agree  that such testing is appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reasonable suspicion must be based on an articulable belief,  drawn from facts and reasonable inferences from those particular facts,  that an   HRP-certified individual is in possession of, or under the influence of,  an illegal drug or alcohol. Such a belief may be based on, among other  things:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of the use or  possession of illegal drugs or alcohol, or the physical symptoms of  being under the influence of drugs or alcohol;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A pattern of abnormal conduct or erratic behavior;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Information provided by a reliable and credible source that is  independently corroborated; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Detection of alcohol odor on the breath.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Counterintelligence Evaluation. HRP candidates and, when  selected, HRP-certified individuals, must submit to and successfully  complete a counterintelligence evaluation, which includes a polygraph  examination in accordance with 10 CFR part 709, Polygraph Examination  Regulations and any subsequent revisions to that regulation.</p>
