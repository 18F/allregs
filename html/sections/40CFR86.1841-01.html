                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Certification levels of a test vehicle will be calculated for  each emission constituent applicable to the test group for both full and  intermediate useful life as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the durability demonstration procedure used by the  manufacturer under the provisions of Sec. 86.1823, Sec. 86.1824, or  Sec. 86.1825 requires a DF to be calculated, the DF shall be applied to  the official test results determined in Sec. 86.1835-01(c) for each  regulated emission constituent and for full and intermediate useful  life, as appropriate, using the following procedures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For additive DF's, the DF will be added to the emission result.  The sum will be rounded to the same level of precision as the standard  for the constituent at full and/or intermediate useful life, as  appropriate. This rounded sum is the certification level for that  emission constituent and for that useful life mileage.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For multiplicative DFs, the DF will be multiplied by the  emission result for each regulated constituent. The product will be  rounded to the same level of precision as the standard for the  constituent at full and intermediate useful life, as appropriate. This  rounded product is the certification level for that emission constituent  and for that useful life mileage.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For the SFTP composite standard of NMHC+NOX, the  measured results of NMHC and NOX must each be   adjusted by their corresponding deterioration factors before the  composite NMHC+NOX certification level is calculated. Where  the applicable FTP exhaust hydrocarbon emission standard is an NMOG  standard, the applicable NMOG deterioration factor must be used in place  of the NMHC deterioration factor, unless otherwise approved by the  Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the durability demonstration procedure used by the  manufacturer under the provisions of Sec. 86.1823, Sec. 86.1824, or  Sec. 86.1825, as applicable, requires testing of the EDV with aged  emission components, the official results of that testing determined  under the provisions of Sec. 86.1835-01(c) shall be rounded to the same  level of precision as the standard for each regulated constituent at  full and intermediate useful life, as appropriate. This rounded emission  value is the certification level for that emission constituent at that  useful life mileage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compliance with full useful life CO2 exhaust emission  standards shall be demonstrated at certification by the certification  levels on the FTP and HFET tests for carbon-related exhaust emissions  determined according to Sec. 600.113 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The rounding required in paragraph (a) of this section shall be  conducted in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 86.1837-01.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To be considered in compliance with the standards for the  purposes of certification, the certification levels for the test vehicle  calculated in paragraph (a) of this section shall be less than or equal  to the standards for all emission constituents to which the test group  is subject, at both full and intermediate useful life as appropriate for  that test group.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Every test vehicle of a test group must comply with all  applicable exhaust emission standards before that test group may be  certified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Every test vehicle of an evaporative/refueling family must  comply with all applicable evaporative and/or refueling emission  standards before that family may be certified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, manufacturers  must not use Reactivity Adjustment Factors (RAFs) in their calculation  of the certification level of any pollutant for any vehicle except for  LDVs and LLDTs participating in the National Low Emission Vehicle (NLEV)  program described in subpart R of this part, regardless of the fuel used  in the test vehicle.
