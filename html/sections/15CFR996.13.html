NOAA may decide at any time whether or not to offer certification for a product or class. However, it is most likely that a determination will be made only after a non-Federal entity has submitted a specific product for certification. NOAA's decision shall be based on the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The suitability of the adopted standards and tests for their intended purpose;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The availability of a qualified entity to perform the compliance tests;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Availability of resources; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other relevant criteria as they become apparent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> NOAA's decision as to whether certification for a hydrographic product or class is offered shall be publicly announced in the Federal Register or by other appropriate means.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any entity may request NOAA to reconsider its decision to offer or not offer certification by submitting its request in writing to the Quality Assurance Program address within 30 days of NOAA's announcement of its decision. NOAA shall have, if its other obligations permit, 60 calendar days after the receipt of a request for reconsideration to either deny the request, or to reconsider and announce its decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> NOAA's original decision if unappealed within 30 days, or its decision upon reconsideration, shall be considered final.</p>
