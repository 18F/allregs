                            <p class="depth0">Interim outleasing of excess real property is authorized to lessen  the economic impact on the local community, caused by an installation  inactivation, closure or realignment. These outleases may be granted to  State or local governmental bodies in consideration for care, custody,  management and routine maintenance. Income derived from the use of the  property in excess of the cost of care, custody, management and routine  maintenance will be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.  The outleasing will generally conform to an economic recovery plan  outlined by the Office of Economic Adjustment, OASD (I&L;), will require  coordination with the DASD (I&H;) and concurrence by the GSA. Leases are  limited to one year and must be revocable by the Government on 30 days  notice.</p>
