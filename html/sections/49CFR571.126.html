With the vehicle stationary and the  ignition locking system in the ``Lock'' or ``Off'' position, activate  the ignition locking system to the ``On'' (``Run'') position or, where  applicable, the appropriate position for the lamp check. The ESC  malfunction telltale must be activated as a check of lamp function, as  specified in S5.3.4, and if equipped, the ``ESC Off'' telltale must also  be activated as a check of lamp function, as specified in S5.5.6. The  telltale bulb check is not required for a telltale shown in a common  space as specified in S5.3.6 and S5.5.8.</p><p class="depth0">S7.3 ``ESC Off'' control check. For vehicles equipped with an ``ESC  Off'' control, with the vehicle stationary and the ignition locking  system in the ``Lock'' or ``Off'' position, activate the ignition  locking system to the ``On'' (``Run'') position. Activate the ``ESC  Off'' control and verify that the ``ESC Off'' telltale is illuminated,  as specified in S5.5.4. Turn the ignition locking system to the ``Lock''  or ``Off'' position. Again, activate the ignition locking system to the  ``On'' (``Run'') position and verify that the ``ESC Off'' telltale has  extinguished indicating that the ESC system has been reactivated as  specified in S5.4.1.</p><p class="depth0">S7.4 Brake Conditioning. Condition the vehicle brakes as follows:</p><p class="depth0">S7.4.1 Ten stops are performed from a speed of 56 km/h (35 mph),  with an average deceleration of approximately 0.5 g.</p><p class="depth0">S7.4.2 Immediately following the series of 56 km/h (35 mph) stops,  three additional stops are performed from 72 km/h (45 mph).</p><p class="depth0">S7.4.3 When executing the stops in S7.4.2, sufficient force is  applied to the brake pedal to activate the vehicle's antilock brake  system (ABS) for a majority of each braking event.</p><p class="depth0">S7.4.4 Following completion of the final stop in S7.4.2, the vehicle  is driven at a speed of 72 km/h (45 mph) for five minutes to cool the  brakes.</p><p class="depth0">S7.5 Tire Conditioning. Condition the tires using the following  procedure to wear away mold sheen and achieve operating temperature  immediately before beginning the test runs of S7.6 and S7.9.</p><p class="depth0">S7.5.1 The test vehicle is driven around a circle 30 meters (100  feet) in diameter at a speed that produces a lateral acceleration of  approximately 0.5 to 0.6 g for three clockwise laps followed by three  counterclockwise laps.</p><p class="depth0">S7.5.2 Using a sinusoidal steering pattern at a frequency of 1 Hz, a  peak steering wheel angle amplitude corresponding to a peak lateral  acceleration of 0.5-0.6 g, and a vehicle speed of 56 km/h (35 mph), the  vehicle is driven through four passes performing 10 cycles of sinusoidal  steering during each pass.</p><p class="depth0">S7.5.3 The steering wheel angle amplitude of the final cycle of the  final pass is twice that of the other cycles. The maximum time permitted  between all laps and passes is five minutes.</p><p class="depth0">S7.6 Slowly Increasing Steer Test. The vehicle is subjected to two  series of runs of the Slowly Increasing Steer Test using a constant  vehicle speed of 80 2 km/h (50 1 mph) and a steering pattern that increases by 13.5  degrees per second until a lateral acceleration of approximately 0.5 g  is obtained. Three repetitions are performed for each test series. One  series uses counterclockwise steering, and the other series uses  clockwise steering. The maximum time permitted between each test run is  five minutes.</p><p class="depth0">S7.6.1 From the Slowly Increasing Steer tests, the quantity ``A'' is  determined. ``A'' is the steering wheel angle in degrees that produces a  steady state lateral acceleration (corrected using the methods specified  in S7.11.3) of 0.3 g for the test vehicle. Utilizing linear regression,  A is calculated, to the nearest 0.1 degrees, from each of the six Slowly  Increasing Steer tests. The absolute value of the six A's calculated is  averaged and rounded to the nearest 0.1 degrees to produce the final  quantity, A, used below.</p><p class="depth0">S7.7 After the quantity A has been determined, without replacing the  tires, the tire conditioning procedure described in S7.5 is performed  immediately prior to conducting the Sine with Dwell Test of S7.9.  Initiation of the first Sine with Dwell test series shall begin within  two hours after completion of the Slowly Increasing Steer tests of S7.6.</p><p class="depth0">S7.8 Check that the ESC system is enabled by ensuring that the ESC  malfunction and ``ESC Off'' (if provided) telltales are not illuminated.</p><p class="depth0">S7.9 Sine with Dwell Test of Oversteer Intervention and  Responsiveness. The vehicle is subjected to two series of test runs  using a steering pattern of a sine wave at 0.7 Hz frequency with a 500  ms delay beginning at the second peak amplitude as shown in Figure 2  (the Sine with Dwell tests). One series uses counterclockwise steering  for the first half cycle, and the other series uses clockwise steering  for the first half cycle. The vehicle is provided a cool-down period  between each test run of 90 seconds to five minutes, with the vehicle  stationary.</p><p class="depth0">S7.9.1 The steering motion is initiated with the vehicle coasting in  high gear at 80 2 km/h (50 1  mph).</p><p class="depth0">S7.9.2 In each series of test runs, the steering amplitude is  increased from run to run, by 0.5A, provided that no such run will  result in a steering amplitude greater than that of the final run  specified in S7.9.4.</p><p class="depth0">S7.9.3 The steering amplitude for the initial run of each series is  1.5A where A is the steering wheel angle determined in S7.6.1.</p><p class="depth0">S7.9.4 The steering amplitude of the final run in each series is the  greater of 6.5A or 270 degrees, provided the calculated magnitude of  6.5A is less than or equal to 300 degrees. If any 0.5A increment, up to  6.5A, is greater than 300 degrees, the steering amplitude of the final  run shall be 300 degrees.</p><p class="depth0">S7.9.5 Upon completion of the two series of test runs, post  processing of yaw rate and lateral acceleration data is done as  specified in S7.11.</p><p class="depth0">S7.10 ESC Malfunction Detection.</p><p class="depth0">S7.10.1 Simulate one or more ESC malfunction(s) by disconnecting the  power source to any ESC component, or disconnecting any electrical  connection between ESC components (with the vehicle power off). When  simulating an ESC malfunction, the electrical connections for the  telltale lamp(s) are not to be disconnected.</p><p class="depth0">S7.10.2 With the vehicle initially stationary and the ignition  locking system in the ``Lock'' or ``Off'' position, activate the  ignition locking system to the ``Start'' position and start   the engine. Place the vehicle in a forward gear and obtain a vehicle  speed of 48 8 km/h (30 5  mph). Drive the vehicle for at least two minutes including at least one  left and one right turning maneuver and at least one application of the  service brake. Verify that within two minutes after obtaining this  vehicle speed the ESC malfunction indicator illuminates in accordance  with S5.3.</p><p class="depth0">S7.10.3 As of September 1, 2011, stop the vehicle, deactivate the  ignition locking system to the ``Off'' or ``Lock'' position. After a  five-minute period, activate the vehicle's ignition locking system to  the ``Start'' position and start the engine. Verify that the ESC  malfunction indicator again illuminates to signal a malfunction and  remains illuminated as long as the engine is running or until the fault  is corrected.</p><p class="depth0">S7.10.4 Deactivate the ignition locking system to the ``Off'' or  ``Lock'' position. Restore the ESC system to normal operation, activate  the ignition system to the ``Start'' position and start the engine.  Place the vehicle in a forward gear and obtain a vehicle speed of 48  8 km/h (30 5 mph). Drive the  vehicle for at least two minutes including at least one left and one  right turning maneuver and at least one application of the service  brake. Verify that within two minutes after obtaining this vehicle speed  that the ESC malfunction indicator has extinguished.</p><p class="depth0">S7.11 Post Data Processing--Calculations for Performance Metrics.  Yaw rate and lateral displacement measurements and calculations must be  processed utilizing the following techniques:</p><p class="depth0">S7.11.1 Raw steering wheel angle data is filtered with a 12-pole  phaseless Butterworth filter and a cutoff frequency of 10Hz. The  filtered data is then zeroed to remove sensor offset utilizing static  pretest data.</p><p class="depth0">S7.11.2 Raw yaw rate data is filtered with a 12-pole phaseless  Butterworth filter and a cutoff frequency of 6Hz. The filtered data is  then zeroed to remove sensor offset utilizing static pretest data.</p><p class="depth0">S7.11.3 Raw lateral acceleration data is filtered with a 12-pole  phaseless Butterworth filter and a cutoff frequency of 6Hz. The filtered  data is then zeroed to remove sensor offset utilizing static pretest  data. The lateral acceleration data at the vehicle center of gravity is  determined by removing the effects caused by vehicle body roll and by  correcting for sensor placement via use of coordinate transformation.  For data collection, the lateral accelerometer shall be located as close  as possible to the position of the vehicle's longitudinal and lateral  centers of gravity.</p><p class="depth0">S7.11.4 Steering wheel velocity is determined by differentiating the  filtered steering wheel angle data. The steering wheel velocity data is  then filtered with a moving 0.1 second running average filter.</p><p class="depth0">S7.11.5 Lateral acceleration, yaw rate and steering wheel angle data  channels are zeroed utilizing a defined ``zeroing range.'' The methods  used to establish the zeroing range are defined in S7.11.5.1 and  S7.11.5.2.</p><p class="depth0">S7.11.5.1 Using the steering wheel rate data calculated using the  methods described in S7.11.4, the first instant steering wheel rate  exceeds 75 deg/sec is identified. From this point, steering wheel rate  must remain greater than 75 deg/sec for at least 200 ms. If the second  condition is not met, the next instant steering wheel rate exceeds 75  deg/sec is identified and the 200 ms validity check applied. This  iterative process continues until both conditions are ultimately  satisfied.</p><p class="depth0">S7.11.5.2 The ``zeroing range'' is defined as the 1.0 second time  period prior to the instant the steering wheel rate exceeds 75 deg/sec  (i.e., the instant the steering wheel velocity exceeds 75 deg/sec  defines the end of the ``zeroing range'').</p><p class="depth0">S7.11.6 The Beginning of Steer (BOS) is defined as the first  instance filtered and zeroed steering wheel angle data reaches -5  degrees (when the initial steering input is counterclockwise) or + 5  degrees (when the initial steering input is clockwise) after time  defining the end of the ``zeroing range.'' The value for time at the BOS  is interpolated.</p><p class="depth0">S7.11.7 The Completion of Steer (COS) is defined as the time the  steering wheel angle returns to zero at the completion of the Sine with  Dwell   steering maneuver. The value for time at the zero degree steering wheel  angle is interpolated.</p><p class="depth0">S7.11.8 The second peak yaw rate is defined as the first local yaw  rate peak produced by the reversal of the steering wheel. The yaw rates  at 1.000 and 1.750 seconds after COS are determined by interpolation.</p><p class="depth0">S7.11.9 Determine lateral velocity by integrating corrected,  filtered and zeroed lateral acceleration data. Zero lateral velocity at  BOS event. Determine lateral displacement by integrating zeroed lateral  velocity. Zero lateral displacement at BOS event. Lateral displacement  at 1.07 seconds from BOS event is determined by interpolation.</p><p class="depth0">S8.
