                            <p class="depth0">The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504, establishes  procedures by which prevailing parties in certain administrative  proceedings may apply for reimbursement of fees and other expenses.  Eligible parties may receive awards when they prevail over SBA, unless  SBA's position in the proceeding was ``substantially justified'' or, as  provided in Sec. 134.605(b), special circumstances make an award unjust.  The rules of this subpart explain which OHA proceedings are covered, who  may be eligible for an award of fees and expenses, and how to apply for  such an award.  [61 FR 2683, Jan. 29, 1996.
