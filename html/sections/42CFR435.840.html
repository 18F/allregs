However, the amount of the more restrictive separate standard for aged, blind, or disabled individuals must be no lower than the higher of the lowest categorically needy resource standard currently applied under the State's more restrictive criteria under Sec.  435.121 or the medically needy resource standard in effect under the State's Medicaid plan on January 1, 1972.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The resource standard established under paragraph (a) of this section may not diminish by an increase in the number of persons in the assistance unit. For example, the resource standard for an assistance unit of three may not be less than that set for a unit of two.
