                            <p class="depth0">The contract shall contain a provision to the effect that if HUD determines that the owner is in default under the contract, HUD shall notify the owner of the actions required to be taken to cure the default and of the remedies to be applied by HUD including recovery of overpayments, where appropriate, and that if the owner fails to cure the default within a reasonable time as determined by HUD, HUD has the right to terminate the contract or to take other corrective action, including recission of the sale. When contract termination is under consideration by HUD, HUD shall give eligible families an opportunity to submit written and other comments. Where the project is sold under the arrangement that involves a regulatory agreement between HUD and the owner, a default under the regulatory agreement shall be treated as default under the contract.</p>
