                                Sec. 229.30  Paying bank's responsibility for return of checks.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Two-day/four-day test. A paying bank returns a check in an  expeditious manner if it sends the returned check in a manner such that  the check would normally be received by the depositary bank not later  than 4:00 p.m. (local time of the depositary bank) of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The second business day following the banking day on which the  check was presented to the paying bank, if the paying bank is located in  the same   check processing region as the depositary bank; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The fourth business day following the banking day on which the  check was presented to the paying bank, if the paying bank is not  located in the same check processing region as the depositary bank.  If the last business day on which the paying bank may deliver a returned  check to the depositary bank is not a banking day for the depositary  bank, the paying bank meets the two-day/four-day test if the returned  check is received by the depositary bank on or before the depositary  bank's next banking day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Forward collection test. A paying bank also returns a check in  an expeditious manner if it sends the returned check in a manner that a  similarly situated bank would normally handle a check--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Of similar amount as the returned check;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Drawn on the depositary bank; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Deposited for forward collection in the similarly situated  bank by noon on the banking day following the banking day on which the  check was presented to the paying bank.  Subject to the requirement for expeditious return, a paying bank may  send a returned check to the depositary bank, or to any other bank  agreeing to handle the returned check expeditiously under  Sec. 229.31(a). A paying bank may convert a check to a qualified  returned check. A qualified returned check shall be encoded in magnetic  ink with the routing number of the depositary bank, the amount of the  returned check, and a ``2'' in the case of an original check (or a ``5''  in the case of a substitute check) in position 44 of the qualified  return MICR line as a return identifier. A qualified returned original  check shall be encoded in accordance with ANS X9.13, and a qualified  returned substitute check shall be encoded in accordance with ANS  X9.100-140. This paragraph does not affect a paying bank's  responsibility to return a check within the deadlines required by the  U.C.C., Regulation J (12 CFR part 210), or Sec. 229.30(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unidentifiable depositary bank. A paying bank that is unable to  identify the depositary bank with respect to a check may send the  returned check to any bank that handled the check for forward collection  even if that bank does not agree to handle the check expeditiously under  Sec. 229.31(a). A paying bank sending a returned check under this  paragraph to a bank that handled the check for forward collection must  advise the bank to which the check is sent that the paying bank is  unable to identify the depositary bank. The expeditious return  requirements in Sec. 229.30(a) do not apply to the paying bank's return  of a check under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Extension of deadline. The deadline for return or notice of  nonpayment under the U.C.C. or Regulation J (12 CFR part 210), or  Sec. 229.36(f)(2) is extended to the time of dispatch of such return or  notice of nonpayment where a paying bank uses a means of delivery that  would ordinarily result in receipt by the bank to which it is sent--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On or before the receiving bank's next banking day following the  otherwise applicable deadline by the earlier of the close of that  banking day or a cutoff hour of 2 p.m. or later set by the receiving  bank under U.C.C. 4-108, for all deadlines other than those described in  paragraph (c)(2) of this section; this deadline is extended further if a  paying bank uses a highly expeditious means of transportation, even if  this means of transportation would ordinarily result in delivery after  the receiving bank's next cutoff hour or banking day referred to above;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to the cut-off hour for the next processing cycle (if sent  to a returning bank), or on the next banking day (if sent to the  depositary bank), for a deadline falling on a Saturday that is a banking  day (as defined in the applicable U.C.C.) for the paying bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Identification of returned check. A paying bank returning a  check shall clearly indicate on the front of the check that it is a  returned check and the reason for return. If the check is a substitute  check, the paying bank shall place this information within the image of  the original check that appears on the front of the substitute check.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Depositary bank without accounts. The expeditious return  requirements of   paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to checks deposited in a  depositary bank that does not maintain accounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notice in lieu of return. If a check is unavailable for return,  the paying bank may send in its place a copy of the front and back of  the returned check, or, if no such copy is available, a written notice  of nonpayment containing the information specified in Sec. 229.33(b).  The copy or notice shall clearly state that it constitutes a notice in  lieu of return. A notice in lieu of return is considered a returned  check subject to the expeditious return requirements of this section and  to the other requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reliance on routing number. A paying bank may return a returned  check based on any routing number designating the depositary bank  appearing on the returned check in the depositary bank's indorsement.
