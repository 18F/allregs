Owners and operators who elect to comply with Sec. 65.145(b)(1)(i) or (b)(3)(i) by submitting a design evaluation shall submit the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section. Owners and operators who elect to comply with Sec. 65.145(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(3)(ii) by submitting performance test results shall submit the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (2), (4), and (5) of this section. Owners and operators who elect to comply with Sec. 65.145(b)(1)(iii) or (b)(3)(iii) by submitting performance test results for a shared control device or halogen reduction device shall submit the information specified in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the parameter or parameters to be monitored to ensure that the control device or halogen reduction device is being properly operated and maintained, an explanation of the criteria used for selection of that parameter (or parameters), and the frequency with which monitoring will be performed (for example, when the liquid level in the storage vessel is being raised). If continuous records are specified, indicate whether the provisions of Sec. 65.166(f) apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The operating range for each monitoring parameter identified in the monitoring plan required by Sec. 65.145(c)(1). The specified operating

range shall represent the conditions for which the control device or halogen reduction device is being properly operated and maintained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The documentation specified in Sec. 65.145(b)(1)(i), if the owner or operator elects to prepare a design evaluation; and the documentation specified in Sec. 65.145(b)(3)(i), if the owner or operator elects to prepare a design evaluation for a halogen reduction device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The provisions of Sec. 65.166(f) do not apply to any low-throughput transfer rack for which the owner or operator has elected to comply with Sec. 65.145 or to any storage vessel for which the owner or operator is not required to keep continuous records, as specified by the applicable monitoring plan established under Sec. 65.145(c)(1) and (2). If continuous records are required, the owner or operator shall specify in the monitoring plan whether the provisions of Sec. 65.166(f) apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A summary of the results of the performance test described in Sec. 65.145(b)(1)(ii), (1)(iii), (3)(ii), and/or (3)(iii), as applicable. If a performance test is conducted as provided in Sec. 65.145(b)(1)(ii) and/or (b)(3)(ii), submit the results of the performance test, including the information specified in Sec. 65.164(a)(1) and (2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Identification of the storage vessel or low-throughput transfer rack and control device and/or halogen reduction device for which the performance test will be submitted, and identification of the emission point(s), if any, that share the control device and/or halogen reduction device with the storage vessel or low-throughput transfer rack and for which the performance test will be conducted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The owner or operator shall submit as part of the Initial Compliance Status Report the operating range for each monitoring parameter identified for each control, recovery, or halogen reduction device as determined in Sec. Sec. 65.148(c)(2), 65.149(c)(2), 65.150(c)(2), 65.151(c)(2), 65.152(c)(2), 65.153(c)(5), 65.154(c)(3), and 65.155(c)(2). The specified operating range shall represent the conditions for which the control, recovery, or halogen reduction device is being properly operated and maintained. This report shall include the information in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, as applicable, unless the range and the operating day definition have been established in the operating permit:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The specific range of the monitored parameter(s) for each emission point.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The rationale for the specific range for each parameter for each emission point, including any data and calculations used to develop the range and a description of why the range indicates proper operation of the control, recovery, or halogen reduction device, as specified in the following, as applicable:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a performance test or TRE index value determination is required by this subpart or another subpart of this part for a control, recovery or halogen removal device, the range shall be based on the parameter values measured during the TRE index value determination or performance test and may be supplemented by engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. The TRE index value determinations and performance testing is not required to be conducted over the entire range of permitted parameter values.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a performance test or TRE index value determination is not required by this subpart or other subparts of this part for a control, recovery, or halogen reduction device, the range may be based solely on engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The range may be based on ranges or limits previously established under a referencing subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A definition of the source's operating day for purposes of determining daily average values of monitored parameters. The definition shall specify the times at which an operating day begins and ends.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Halogen reduction device. The owner or operator shall submit as part of the Initial Compliance Status Report the information recorded pursuant to Sec. 65.160(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Alternative recordkeeping.

The owner or operator shall identify in the Initial Compliance Status Report whether an exemption from performance testing or conducting a design evaluation, as provided in Sec. 65.145(b)(2), Sec. 65.148(b)(2), or Sec. 65.149(b)(2), is being invoked, and which of the provisions of Sec. 65.145(b)(2), Sec. 65.148(b)(2), or Sec. 65.149(b)(2) apply.</p>
