However, any safety management audit for the purpose of verifying a vessel's safety management system will not be scheduled or conducted for a company's U.S. vessel unless the company first has undergone a safety management audit of the company's safety management system, and has received its Document of Compliance certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Requests for all safety management audits for a company and its U.S. vessel(s) must be communicated--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By a responsible person directly to a recognized organization authorized by the U.S.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By a responsible person within the time limits for an annual verification audit, described in Sec.  96.330(f) of this part, and for an intermediate verification audit, described in Sec.  96.340(e)(2) of this part. If he or she does not make a request for a safety management annual or verification audit for a valid Document of Compliance certificate issued to a company or a valid Safety Management Certificate issued to a vessel, this is cause for the Coast Guard to revoke the certificate as described in Sec. Sec.  96.330 and 96.340 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If a non-conformity with a safety management system is found during an audit, it must be reported in writing by the auditor:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a company's safety management system audit, to the company's owner; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a vessel's safety management system audit, to the company's owner and vessel's Master.</p>
