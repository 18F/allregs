                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Earth-to-space transmissions carrying video information with  analog modulation must be identified through use of an Automatic  Transmitter Identification System (ATIS) with an analog identifier or a  direct sequence spread spectrum signal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use of an analog identifier must be in accordance with the  following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The ATIS signal must be a separate subcarrier that is  automatically activated whenever any radio frequency signal is  transmitted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The ATIS message must continuously repeat.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The ATIS subcarrier signal must be generated at a frequency of  7.1 MHz 25 kHz and modulate the uplink radio  frequency carrier at a level no less than -26 dB (referenced to the  unmodulated carrier).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> ATIS subcarrier deviation must not exceed 25 kHz.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The ATIS message protocol must be International Morse Code keyed  by a 1200 Hz 800 Hz tone representing a mark and a  message rate of 15 to 25 words per minute. The tone must frequency- modulate the subcarrier signal with the ATIS message.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The ATIS message must include the FCC-assigned call sign of the  transmitting earth station, a telephone number providing immediate  access to personnel capable of resolving interference or coordination  problems, and a unique serial number of ten or more digits programmed  into the ATIS message in a permanent manner so that it cannot be readily  changed by the operator on duty. Additional information may be included  in the ATIS data stream provided the total ATIS message length does not  exceed 30 seconds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As of June 1, 2016, transmissions of fixed-frequency, digitally  modulated video signals with a symbol rate of 128,000/s or more from  Satellite News Gathering vehicles or other temporary-fixed earth  stations must be identified through use of an ATIS in accordance with  the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The ATIS message must be modulated onto a direct sequence spread  spectrum signal in accordance with the DVB-CID standard, ETSI TS 103 129  (2013-05), ``Technical Specification, Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB);  Framing structure, channel coding and   modulation of a carrier identification system (DVB-CID) for satellite  transmission.''
