motion for temporary relief.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At the time the Commission determines to institute an investigation and provisionally accepts a motion for temporary relief pursuant to Sec. 210.58, or at any time thereafter, the Commission may designate the temporary relief phase of an investigation ``more complicated'' pursuant to Sec. 210.60(b) for the purpose of obtaining up to 60 additional days to adjudicate the motion for temporary relief. In the alternative, after the motion for temporary relief is referred to the administrative law judge for an initial determination under Sec. 210.66(a), the administrative law judge may issue an order, sua sponte or on motion, designating the temporary relief phase of the investigation ``more complicated'' for the purpose of obtaining additional time to adjudicate the motion for temporary relief. Such order shall constitute a final determination of the Commission, and notice of the order shall be published in the Federal Register. As required by section 337(e)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930, the notice shall state the reasons that the temporary relief phase of the investigation was designated ``more complicated.'' The ``more complicated'' designation may be conferred by the Commission or the presiding administrative law judge pursuant to this paragraph on the basis of the complexity of the issues raised in the motion for temporary relief or the responses thereto, or for other good cause shown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A temporary relief phase is designated more complicated owing to the subject matter, difficulty in obtaining information, the large number of parties involved, or other significant factors.
