                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where an applicant for a combined license under part 52 of this chapter requests an early review and hearing and an early partial decision on issues of site suitability pursuant to Sec. 2.101(a-2), the provisions in the notice of hearing setting forth the matters of fact and law to be considered, as required by Sec. 2.104, shall be modified so as to relate only to the site suitability issue or issues under review. The notice

will provide appropriate opportunities for participation by a representative of an interested State under Sec. 2.315(c) and for limited appearances under Sec. 2.315(a), limited however, to the issues of site suitability for which early review has been requested by the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After docketing of part two of the application, as provided in Secs. 2.101(a-1) and 2.603, a supplementary notice of hearing will be published under Sec. 2.104 with respect to the remaining unresolved issues in the proceeding within the scope of Sec. 2.104. This supplementary notice of hearing will provide that any person whose interest may be affected by the proceeding and who desires to participate as a party in the resolution of the remaining issues shall file a petition for leave to intervene pursuant to Sec. 2.309 within the time prescribed in the notice. This supplementary notice will also provide appropriate opportunities for participation by a representative of an interested State under Sec. 2.315(c) and for limited appearances under Sec. 2.315(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any person who was permitted to intervene as a party under the initial notice of hearing on site suitability issues and who was not dismissed or did not withdraw as a party may continue to participate as a party to the proceeding without having to demonstrate standing under Sec. 2.309(d), provided, however, that within the time prescribed for filing of petitions for leave to intervene in the supplementary notice of hearing, the party files a notice of intent to continue as a party. The notice must include the information required by Sec. 2.309(f). A party who files a non-timely notice of intent to continue as a party may be dismissed from the proceeding, absent a determination that the party has made a substantial showing of good cause for failure to file on time, and with particular reference to the factors specified in Secs. 2.309(c)(1)(i) through (iv) and 2.309(d). The notice will be ruled upon by the Commission or presiding officer designated to rule on petitions for leave to intervene.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To the maximum extent practicable, the presiding officer (as applicable, the membership of the licensing board) designated to preside in the proceeding on the remaining unresolved issues pursuant to the supplemental notice of hearing will be the same as the presiding officer (as applicable, the membership of the licensing board) designated to preside in the initial notice of hearing on site suitability issues.</p>
