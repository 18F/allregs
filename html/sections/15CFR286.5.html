                            <p class="depth0">NIST provides and maintains documented generic requirements to be  applied in evaluations related to accreditation and recognition within  the scope of the program. Available documentation is provided on request  to prospective program participants and other interested parties.  Generic requirements are developed with public input and are based on  guides for the acceptance of conformity assessment activities issued by  such international organizations as the International Organization for  Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission. NIST  also provides and maintains documented criteria provided in response to  requests for evaluations specific to mandated foreign technical  requirements. Criteria are developed with public input derived from the  application and interpretation of generic program requirements in  relation to specified mandated requirements. Both documented generic  requirements and specific criteria are developed and maintained with  input from the public.</p>
