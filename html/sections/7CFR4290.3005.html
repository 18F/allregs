In addition to complying with the applicable provisions of Sec. 4290.100 not otherwise modified by this section, paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For RBICs applying for non-leveraged status, the types of investors eligible to invest in a RBIC must have been approved by the Secretary. Investors seeking approval must submit a request to the Secretary with sufficient documentation to support their request. The USDA will announce such approved categories and types of investors in a public notice published in the Federal Register from time to time. Subsequent notices that modify the types of investors eligible to invest in a RBIC will not be applied retroactively.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In lieu of complying with Sec. 4290.100(d)(1)(i), you must have a minimum duration of 10 years. After 10 years, the Partnership RBIC may be terminated by a vote of your partners.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In lieu of complying with Sec. 4290.100(d)(2), if you are a LLC RBIC,

you must have a minimum duration of 10 years.

A Non-leveraged RBIC is subject to the provisions of Sec. 4290.150 unless it is exempted from these provisions by the Secretary. Exemptions will only be granted when the applicant establishes, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that granting the exemption will not unduly impair the integrity and soundness of the Non-leveraged RBIC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special rules for Partnership RBICs and LLC RBICs. Paragraph (c) of Sec. 4290.160 does not apply to Non-leveraged RBICs.
