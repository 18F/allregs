corporation to the surviving corporation is accomplished by operation of law, no transfer of any affected lease interest is required. A notification of the merger shall be furnished with a list, by serial number, of all lease interests affected. Include the processing fee for corporate merger found in the fee schedule in Sec. 3000.12 of this chapter with your notification of a corporate merger. A bond rider or replacement bond conditioned to cover the obligations of all affected corporations may be required by the authorized officer as a prerequisite to recognition of the merger.
