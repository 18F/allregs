                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, the quantity of inedible  kernels in each variety of almonds received by a handler, including  almonds of his own production, shall be determined and disposed of in  accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sampling. Each handler shall cause a representative sample of  almonds to be drawn from each lot of any variety received. The sample  shall be drawn before inedible kernels are removed from the lot, or the  lot is processed or stored by the handler. For receipts at premises with  mechanical sampling equipment and under contracts providing for payment  by the handler to the producer for sound meat content, samples shall be  drawn by the handler in a manner acceptable to the Board and the  inspection agency. The inspection agency shall make periodic checks of  the mechanical sampling procedures. For all other receipts, including  but not limited to field examination and purchase receipts,  accumulations purchased for cash at the handler's door or from an  accumulator, or almonds of the handler's own production, sampling shall  be conducted or monitored by the inspection agency in a manner  acceptable to the Board. All samples shall be bagged and identified in a  manner acceptable to the Board and the inspection agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Variety. For the purpose of classifying receipts by variety to  determine a handler's disposition obligation, ``variety'' shall mean  that variety of almonds which constitutes at least 90 percent of the  lot: Provided, That lots containing a combination of Butte and Padre  varieties only, shall be classified as ``Butte-Padre'', regardless of  the percentage of each variety in the lot. If no variety constitutes at  least 90 percent of the almonds in a lot, the lot shall be classified as  ``mixed'': Provided further, That if the variety or varieties of almonds  in a lot are not identified, the lot shall be classified as ``mixed'',  regardless of the percentage of each variety in a lot.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Analysis of sample. Each sample shall be analyzed by or under  the surveillance of the inspection agency to determine the kernel  content and the proportion of inedible kernels in the sample. The  inspection agency shall prepare a report for each handler showing, by  variety, the total adjusted kernel weight received by handler, the  inedible kernel weight and any other information as the Board may  prescribe. The report shall cover the handler's daily receipt or the  handler's total receipts during a period not exceeding one week, and  shall be submitted by the inspection agency to the Board and the  handler.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Disposition obligation. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Beginning August 1, 2006, the weight  of inedible kernels in excess of 0.50 percent of kernel weight reported  to the Board of any variety received by a handler shall constitute that  handler's disposition obligation. For any almonds sold inshell, the  weight may be reported to the Board and the disposition obligation for  that variety reduced proportionately.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a sufficient sample is not available for any lot of almonds,  the handler may establish and substantiate, to the satisfaction of the  Board, the received weight, the edible and inedible kernel weights, and  the adjusted kernel weight by providing sufficient information as the  Board may prescribe. If the handler is only able to establish and  substantiate the approximate received weight, an inedible disposition  obligation of 10 percent of such received weight may be applied, upon  agreement between the Board and the handler.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Meeting the disposition obligation. Each handler shall meet its  disposition obligation by delivering packer pickouts, kernels rejected  in blanching, pieces of kernels, meal accumulated in manufacturing, or  other material, to crushers, feed manufacturers, feeders, or dealers in  nut wastes on record with the Board as accepted users. Handlers shall  notify the Board at least 72 hours prior to delivery: Provided, That the  Board or its employees may lessen this notification time whenever it  determines that the 72 hour requirement is impracticable. The Board may  supervise deliveries at its option. In the case of a handler having an  annual total obligation of less than 1,000 pounds, delivery may be to  the Board in lieu of an accepted user, in which case the Board would  certify the disposition lot and report the results to the USDA. For  dispositions by handlers with mechanical sampling equipment, samples may  be drawn by the handler in a manner acceptable to the Board and the  inspection agency. For all other dispositions, samples shall be drawn by  or under supervision of the inspection agency. Upon approval by the  Board and the inspection agency, sampling may be accomplished at the  accepted user's destination. The edible and inedible almond meat content  of each delivery shall be determined by the inspection agency and  reported by the inspection agency to the Board and the handler. The  handler's disposition obligation will be credited upon satisfactory  completion of ABC Form 8. ABC Form 8, Part A, is filled out by the  handler, and Part B by the accepted user. Beginning August 1, 2006, at  least 50 percent of a handler's total crop year inedible disposition  obligation shall be satisfied with dispositions consisting of inedible  kernels as defined in Sec. 981.408: Provided, That this 50 percent  requirement shall not apply to handlers with total annual obligations of  less than 1,000 pounds. Each handler's disposition obligation shall be  satisfied when the almond meat content of the material delivered to  accepted users equals the disposition obligation, but no later than  September 30 succeeding the crop year in which the obligation was  incurred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Inedible almonds unfit for processing. All lots received from  growers as ``inedible almonds unfit for processing,'' shall be exempt  from the requirements of paragraphs (a) (1) and (3) of this section, but  shall be disposed of in their entirety (other than as pickouts), as  provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Disposition of these lots  shall not be credited toward the disposition obligation of paragraph  (a)(4) of this section. If a grower sells or ships inedible almonds to a  person other than a handler, the grower thereby becomes a handler and  subject to all the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Accepted Users. An accepted user's eligibility shall be subject  to the following criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Completion of an application with the Board for accepted user  status;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Submission of a business data sheet to the Board; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The accurate and prompt submission of ABC Form 8 Part B to the  Board for each lot of almonds received, supported by a public  weighmaster weight certificate issued at the request of the accepted  user at the time of receipt.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The Board may deny or revoke accepted user status at any time  if the applicant or accepted user fails to meet the terms and conditions  of Sec. 981.442, or if the applicant or accepted user fails to meet the  terms and conditions set forth in the accepted user application (ABC  Form 34).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The eligibility of accepted users shall be reviewed annually by  the Board. Handlers will not receive credit towards their disposition  obligations pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section for lots where  the difference between the weight of the lot reported by the inspection  agency on ABC Form 8 and the weight of the lot reported on the public  weighmaster weight certificate exceeds 2.0 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(6)</em> of  this section, handlers shall subject their almonds to a treatment  process or processes prior to shipment to reduce potential Salmonella  bacteria contamination in accordance with the provisions of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Treatment process. Treatment processes shall utilize  technologies that have been determined to achieve in total a minimum 4- log reduction of Salmonella bacteria in almonds, pursuant to a letter of  determination issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or  acceptance by a scientific review panel as identified by the Board  (Technical Expert Review Panel or ``TERP''). Such panel shall be  approved at least annually by the Board prior to the beginning of each  crop year, or as needed during the crop year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On-site versus off-site treatment. Handlers shall subject  almonds to a treatment process or processes prior to shipment either at  their handling facility (on-site), or at an off-site treatment facility  located within the production area. Transportation of almonds by a  handler to an off-site treatment facility shall not be deemed a  shipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Validation by process authorities. Handlers shall only use, or  transport their almonds to off-site treatment facilities that use  treatment processes that have been validated by a Board-approved process  authority. Treatment technology and equipment that have been modified to  a point where operating parameters such as time, temperature, or volume  change, shall be revalidated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Validation means that the treatment technology and equipment  have been demonstrated to achieve in total a minimum 4-log reduction of  Salmonella bacteria in almonds. Validation data prepared by a Board- approved process authority must be submitted to and accepted by the TERP  for each piece of equipment used to treat almonds prior to its use under  the program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A process authority is a person that has expert knowledge of  appropriate processes for the treatment of almonds as defined in  paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and meets the following criteria:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Knowledge about the equipment used for the treatment process;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Experience in conducting appropriate studies to determine the  ability of the equipment to deliver the appropriate treatment (such as  heat penetration or heat distribution); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Able to determine that sufficient data has been gathered to  identify the critical factors needed to ensure the quality of the final  product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Process authorities may be employees of the entity for which  they are conducting validation. The Board shall provide process  authorities specific protocols and parameters for treatment processes  that are FDA determined or TERP accepted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Process authorities must submit an initial application to the  Board on ABC Form No. 51, ``Application for Process Authority for  Almonds,'' and be approved by the TERP. Should the applicant disagree  with the TERP's decision concerning approval, the applicant may appeal  the decision in writing to the Board, and ultimately to USDA. For  subsequent crop years, approved applicants with no changes to their  initial application must send the Board a letter, signed and dated,  indicating that there are no changes to the application the Board has on  file.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The TERP may revoke any approval for cause. The TERP shall  notify the process authority in writing of the reasons for revoking the  approval. Should the process authority disagree with the TERP's  decision, he/she may appeal the decision in writing to the Board, and  ultimately to USDA. A process authority whose approval has been revoked  must submit a new application to the TERP and await approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Compliance and verification. In accordance with the requirements  of this paragraph, handlers shall utilize either an on-site verification  program (traditional), or an audit-based verification program to ensure  that their almonds have been subjected to a treatment process to reduce  Salmonella bacteria prior to shipment. Each handler may decide which  verification program would be the most cost-effective for his or her  operation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By May 31, each handler shall submit to the Board a Treatment  Plan for the upcoming crop year. A Treatment Plan shall describe how a  handler plans to treat his or her almonds, and must address specific  parameters as outlined by the Board for the handler to ship almonds.  Such plan shall be reviewed by   the Board, in conjunction with the inspection agency, to ensure it is  complete and can be verified, and be approved by the Board. Almonds sent  by a handler for treatment to an off-site facility affiliated with  another handler shall be subject to the approved Treatment Plan utilized  at that facility. Handlers shall follow their own approved Treatment  Plans for almonds sent to an off-site facility that is not affiliated  with another handler.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Handlers utilizing an on-site verification program shall cause  the inspection agency to verify that their Treatment Plans have been  followed, and that their almonds have been subjected to a treatment  process that has been validated by a Board-approved process authority.  Such handlers shall submit, or cause to be submitted, a verification  report to the Board. The inspection agency must physically observe the  treatment process to issue such report.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Handlers utilizing an audit-based verification program shall  be subject to periodic audits conducted by the inspection agency. The  inspection agency shall provide copies of the audit report to the Board.  Handlers who do not comply with an audit-based verification program  shall be required to revert to an on-site verification program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Interhandler transfers of almonds may or may not be treated  prior to transfer. Handlers receiving untreated almonds from another  handler shall be responsible for treating the product. Handlers  receiving treated almonds from another handler must have procedures  outlined in their Treatment Plan addressing how the integrity of the  treated almonds will be maintained. In all instances involving  interhandler transfers, the receiving handler shall be responsible for  ensuring that the almonds are treated prior to shipment and maintaining  documentation to that effect.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> An off-site treatment facility that does not handle almonds,  pursuant to Sec. 981.16, shall provide access to the inspection agency  and Board staff for verification of treatment and review of treatment  records. A treatment process at an off-site treatment facility that has  been validated by a Board approved process authority is deemed to be  approved by the Board for handler use. The Board may revoke any such  approval for cause. The Board shall notify the off-site treatment  facility of the reasons for revoking the approval. Should the off-site  facility disagree with the Board's decision, it may appeal the decision  in writing to USDA. Handlers may treat their almonds only at off-site  treatment facilities that have been deemed to be approved by the Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Records. Handlers shall maintain records and documentation that  will be subject to audit by the Board for the purpose of verifying  compliance with this section. Records must be maintained for two full  years following the end of the crop year, and must identify lots from  the point of treatment forward to the point of shipment by the handler.  Lot identification shall also provide the ability to differentiate  treated from untreated product. Off-site treatment facilities that do  not handle almonds pursuant to Sec. 981.16, shall maintain treatment  records for 2 full years following the end of a crop year and make such  records available to the Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Exemptions. Handlers may ship untreated almonds under the  following conditions. For purposes of this section, container means a  box, bin, bag, carton, or any other type of receptacle used in the  packaging of bulk almonds.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Handlers may ship untreated almonds for further processing  directly to manufacturers located within the U.S., Canada or Mexico.  This program shall be termed the Direct Verifiable (DV) program.  Handlers may only ship untreated almonds to manufacturers who have  submitted ABC Form No. 52, ``Application for Direct Verifiable (DV)  Program for Further Processing of Untreated Almonds,'' and have been  approved by the TERP. Such almonds must be shipped directly to approved  manufacturing locations, as specified on Form No. 52. Such manufacturers  DV users must submit an initial Form No. 52 to the Board and be approved  by the TERP. Should the applicant disagree with the TERP's decision  concerning approval, it may appeal the decision in writing to the Board,  and ultimately to USDA. For subsequent crop   years, approved applicants with no changes to their initial application  must send the Board a letter, signed and dated, indicating that there  are no changes to the application the Board has on file. The TERP may  revoke any approval for cause. The TERP shall notify the manufacturer in  writing of the reasons for revoking the approval. Should the  manufacturer disagree with the TERP's decision, it may appeal the  decision in writing to the Board, and ultimately to USDA. A manufacturer  whose approval has been revoked must submit a new application to the  TERP and await approval. The Board shall issue a DV User code to an  approved manufacturer. Handlers must reference such code in all  documentation accompanying the lot and identify each container of such  almonds with the term ``unpasteurized.'' Such lettering shall be on one  outside principal display panel, at least \1/2\ inch in height, clear  and legible. If a third party is involved in the transaction, the  handler must provide sufficient documentation to the Board to track the  shipment from the handler's facility to the approved DV user. While a  third party may be involved in such transactions, shipments to a third  party and then to a manufacturing location are not permitted under the  DV program. Approved DV Users shall:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Subject such almonds to a treatment process or processes using  technologies that achieve in total a minimum 4-log reduction of  Salmonella bacteria as determined by the FDA, accepted by the TERP, or  established by a process authority approved in accordance with and  subject to the provisions and procedures of paragraph (b)(3) of this  section. Establish means that the treatment process and protocol have  been evaluated to ensure the technology's ability to deliver a lethal  treatment for Salmonella bacteria in almonds to achieve a minimum 4-log  reduction;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Identify the manufacturing locations where treatment will occur;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Have their treatment technology and equipment validated by a  Board-approved process authority, and provide documentation with their  DV application to verify that their treatment technology and equipment  have been validated by a Board-approved process authority. Such  documentation may include, but not be limited to, a letter from such  process authority certifying the validation. Such documentation shall be  sufficient to demonstrate that the treatment processes and equipment  achieve a 4-log reduction in Salmonella bacteria. Treatment technology  and equipment that have been modified to a point where operating  parameters such as time, temperature, or volume change, shall be  revalidated;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Have their technology and procedures verified by a Board- approved DV auditor to ensure they are being applied appropriately. A DV  auditor may not be an employee of the manufacturer that he/she is  auditing. DV auditors must submit a report to the Board after conducting  each audit. DV auditors must submit an initial application to the Board  on ABC Form No. 53, ``Application for Direct Verifiable (DV) Program  Auditors,'' and be approved by the TERP. Should the applicant disagree  with the TERP's decision concerning approval, it may appeal the decision  in writing to the Board, and ultimately to USDA. For subsequent crop  years, approved DV auditors with no changes to their initial application  must send the Board a letter, signed and dated, indicating that there  are no changes to the application the Board has on file. The TERP may  revoke any approval for cause. The TERP shall notify the DV auditor in  writing of the reasons for revoking the approval. Should the DV auditor  disagree with the TERP's decision, it may appeal the decision in writing  to the Board, and ultimately to USDA. A DV auditor whose approval has  been revoked must submit a new application to the TERP and await  approval;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Maintain all records regarding validation and verification of  treatment methods, processing, and product traceability. Such records  shall be retained for two years and shall be made available for review  by the Board; and,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Ship any almonds which will not be treated to a handler, to  another approved DV user, to locations outside the U.S., Canada, and  Mexico (containers must remain identified with the term  ``unpasteurized''), as specified   in Sec. 981.442(b)(6)(i), or dispose of such almonds in non-edible  channels.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Handlers may ship untreated almonds directly or through a third  party to locations outside the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, provided that  each container of such almonds is identified with the term  ``unpasteurized.'' Such lettering shall be on one outside principal  display panel, at least \1/2\ inch in height, clear and legible. If a  third party is involved in the transaction, the handler must provide  sufficient documentation to the Board to track the shipment from the  handler's facility to the importer in the foreign country.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Other restrictions. The provisions of this section do not  supersede any restrictions or prohibitions regarding almonds grown in  California under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or any other  applicable laws or regulations or the need to comply with applicable  food and sanitary regulations of city, county, State or Federal  agencies.
