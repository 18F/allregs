                            <p class="depth0">For each kind of Cooperator, there is a set of Federal principles  for determining allowable costs. Allowability of costs shall be  determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the  entity incurring the costs. Thus, allowability of costs incurred by  State, local or federally recognized Indian tribal governments is  determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-87,  ``Cost Principles for State, Local, and Indian Tribal Governments''  codified at 2 CFR part 225. The allowability of costs incurred by non- profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions of  OMB Circular A-122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations''  codified at 2 CFR part 230. The allowability of costs incurred by  institutions of higher education is determined in accordance with the  provisions of OMB Circular A-21, ``Cost Principles for Educational  Institutions'' codified at 2 CFR 220. The allowability of costs incurred  by hospitals is determined in accordance with the provisions of subpart  E of 45 CFR part 74. The allowability of costs incurred by commercial  organizations and those non-profit organizations listed in appendix C to  Circular A-122 (2 CFR part 230) is determined in accordance with the  contract cost principles and procedures of the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31.</p><p class="depth0">Program Management</p>
