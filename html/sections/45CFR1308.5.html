In that case children who have a disability and non-disabled children would compete for the available enrollment opportunities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The grantee must access resources and plan for placement options, such as dual placement, use of resource staff and training so that a child with a disability for whom Head Start is an appropriate placement according to the IEP is not denied enrollment because of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Staff attitudes and/or apprehensions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inaccessibility of facilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Need to access additional resources to serve a specific child;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Unfamiliarity with a disabling condition or special equipment, such as a prosthesis; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Need for personalized special services such as feeding, suctioning, and assistance with toileting, including catheterization, diapering, and toilet training.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The same policies governing Head Start program eligibility for other children, such as priority for those most in need of the services, apply to children with disabilities.

Grantees must observe applicable State laws which usually require that children entering State preschool programs complete immunizations prior to or within thirty days after entering to reduce the spread of communicable diseases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The recruitment effort of a Head Start grantee must include recruiting children who have severe disabilities, including children who have been previously identified as having disabilities.</p>
