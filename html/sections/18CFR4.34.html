                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Trial-type hearing. The Commission may order a trial-type hearing on an application for a preliminary permit, a license, or an exemption from licensing upon either its own motion or the motion of any interested party of record. Any trial-type hearing will be limited to the issues prescribed by order of the Commission. In all other cases the hearings will be conducted by notice and comment procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice and comment hearings. All comments (including mandatory and recommended terms and conditions or prescriptions) on an application for exemption or license must be filed with the Commission no later than 60 days after issuance by the Commission of public notice declaring that the application is ready for environmental analysis. All reply comments must be filed within 105 days of that notice. All comments and reply comments and all other filings described in this section must be served on all persons listed in the service list prepared by the Commission, in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 385.2010 of this chapter. If a party or interceder (as defined in Sec. 385.2201 of this Chapter) submits any written material to the Commission relating to the merits of an issue that may affect the responsibilities of a particular resource agency, the party or interceder must also serve a copy of the submission on this resource agency. The Commission may allow for longer comment or reply comment periods if appropriate. A commenter or reply commenter may obtain an extension of time from the Commission only upon a showing of good cause or extraordinary circumstances in accordance with Sec. 385.2008 of this chapter. Late-filed fish and wildlife recommendations will not be subject to the requirements of paragraphs (e), (f)(1)(ii), and (f)(3) of this section, and late-filed terms and conditions or prescriptions will not be subject to the requirements of paragraphs (f)(1)(iv), (f)(1)(v), and (f)(2) of this section. Late-filed fish and wildlife recommendations, terms and conditions, or prescriptions will be considered by the Commission under section 10(a) of the Federal Power Act if such consideration would not delay or disrupt the proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Agencies responsible for mandatory terms and conditions and presentations. Any agency responsible for mandatory terms and conditions or prescriptions for licenses or exemptions, pursuant to sections 4(e), 18, and 30(c) of the Federal Power Act and section 405(d) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act

of l978, as amended, must provide these terms and conditions or prescriptions in its initial comments filed with the Commission pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. In those comments, the agency must specifically identify and explain the mandatory terms and conditions or prescriptions and their evidentiary and legal basis.

If a certifying agency denies certification, the applicant must file a copy of the denial within 30 days after the applicant received it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additional procedures. If necessary or appropriate the Commission may require additional procedures (e.g., a pre-hearing conference, further notice and comment on specific issues or oral argument). A party may request additional procedures in a motion that clearly and specifically sets forth the procedures requested and the basis for the request. Replies to such requests may be filed within 15 days of the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Consultation procedures. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act and the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended, the Commission will coordinate as appropriate with other government agencies responsible for mandatory terms and conditions for exemptions and licenses for hydropower projects. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act and the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Commission will consult with fish and wildlife agencies concerning the impact of a hydropower proposal on fish and wildlife and appropriate terms and conditions for license to adequately and equitably protect, mitigate damages to, and enhance fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat). Pursuant to the Federal Power Act and the Endangered Species Act, the Commission will consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service, as appropriate, concerning the impact of a hydropower proposal on endangered or threatened species and their critical habitat.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Consultation on recommended fish and wildlife conditions; Section 10(j) process. (1) In connection with its environmental review of an application for license, the Commission will analyze all terms and conditions timely recommended by fish and wildlife agencies pursuant to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act for the protection, mitigation of damages to, and enhancement of fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat) affected by the development, operation, and management of the proposed project. Submission of such recommendations marks the beginning of the process under section 10(j) of the Federal Power Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In connection with its environmental review of an application for license, the Commission will analyze all terms and conditions timely recommended by fish and wildlife agencies pursuant to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act for the protection, mitigation of damages to, and enhancement of fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat) affected by the development, operation, and management of the proposed project. Submission of such recommendations marks the beginning of the process under section 10(j) of the Federal Power Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agency must specifically identify and explain the recommendations and the relevant resource goals and objectives and their evidentiary or legal basis. The Commission may seek clarification of any recommendation from the appropriate fish and wildlife agency. If the Commission's request for clarification is communicated in writing, copies of the request will be sent by the Commission to all parties, affected resource agencies, and Indian tribes, which may file a response to the request for clarification within the time period specified by the Commission. If the Commission believes any fish and wildlife recommendation may be inconsistent with the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, the Commission will make a preliminary determination of inconsistency in the draft environmental document or, if none, the environmental assessment. The preliminary determination, for any recommendations believed to be inconsistent, shall include an explanation why the Commission believes the recommendation is inconsistent with the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, including any supporting analysis and conclusions, and an explanation of how the measures recommended in the environmental document would adequately and equitably protect, mitigate damages to, and enhance, fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat) affected by the development, operation, and management of the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any party, affected resource agency, or Indian tribe may file comments in response to the preliminary determination of inconsistency, including any modified recommendations, within the time frame allotted for comments

on the draft environmental document or, if none, the time frame for comments on the environmental analysis. In this filing, the fish and wildlife agency concerned may also request a meeting, telephone or video conference, or other additional procedure to attempt to resolve any preliminary determination of inconsistency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Commission shall attempt, with the agencies, to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of any such inconsistency, giving due weight to the recommendations, expertise, and statutory responsibilities of the fish and wildlife agency. If the Commission decides, or an affected resource agency requests, the Commission will conduct a meeting, telephone, or video conference, or other procedures to address issues raised by its preliminary determination of inconsistency and comments thereon. The Commission will give at least 15 days' advance notice to each party, affected resource agency, or Indian tribe, which may participate in the meeting or conference. Any meeting, conference, or additional procedure to address these issues will be scheduled to take place within 90 days of the date the Commission issues a preliminary determination of inconsistency. The Commission will prepare a written summary of any meeting held under this subsection to discuss section 10(j) issues, including any proposed resolutions and supporting analysis, and a copy of the summary will be sent to all parties, affected resource agencies, and Indian tribes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The section 10(j) process ends when the Commission issues an order granting or denying the license application in question. If, after attempting to resolve inconsistencies between the fish and wildlife recommendations of a fish and wildlife agency and the purposes and requirements of the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, the Commission does not adopt in whole or in part a fish and wildlife recommendation of a fish and wildlife agency, the Commission will publish the findings and statements required by section 10(j)(2) of the Federal Power Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Licenses and exemption conditions and required findings--(1) License conditions.

Commission to resolve a dispute concerning the alternative process (including a dispute over required studies), but only after reasonable efforts have been made to resolve the dispute with other participants in the process. No such request shall be accepted for filing unless the entity submitting it certifies that it has been served on all other participants. The request must document what efforts have been made to resolve the dispute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the potential applicant or any resource agency, Indian tribe, citizens' group, or other entity participating in the alternative pre-filing consultation process can show that it has cooperated in the process but a consensus supporting the use of the process no longer exists and that continued use of the alternative process will not be productive, the participant may petition the Commission for an order directing the use by the potential applicant of appropriate procedures to complete its application. No such request shall be accepted for filing unless the entity submitting it certifies that it has been served on all other participants. The request must recommend specific procedures that are appropriate under the circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The Commission may participate in the pre-filing consultation process and assist in the integration of this process and the environmental review process in any case, including appropriate cases where the applicant, contractor, or consultant funded by the applicant is not preparing a preliminary draft environmental assessment or preliminary draft environmental impact statement, but where staff assistance is available and could expedite the proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> If this section requires an applicant to reveal Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (CEII), as defined by Sec. 388.113(c) of this chapter, to any person, the applicant shall follow the procedures set out in Sec. 4.32(k).
