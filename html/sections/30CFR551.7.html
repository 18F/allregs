You must submit copies of the  drilling plan and environmental report to the BOEM Regional Director for  transmittal to the Governor of each affected coastal State and the  coastal zone management agency of each affected coastal State that has  an approved program under the Coastal Zone Management Act. (BOEM  Regional Director will make the drilling plan and environmental report  available to appropriate Federal agencies and the public according to  the Department of the Interior's policies and procedures).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Certification of coastal zone management program consistency and  State concurrence. When required under an approved coastal zone  management program of an affected State, your drilling plan must include  a certification that the proposed activities described in the plan  comply with enforceable policies of, and will be conducted in a manner  consistent with such State's program. BOEM Regional Director may not  approve any of the activities described in the drilling plan unless the  State concurs with the consistency certification or the Secretary of  Commerce makes the finding authorized by section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of  the Coastal Zone Management Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Protecting archaeological resources. If the Regional Director  believes that an archaeological resource may exist in the area that may  be affected by drilling, the Regional Director will notify you of the  need to prepare an archaeological report.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the evidence suggests that an archaeological resource may be  present, you must:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Locate the site of the drilling so as to not adversely affect  the area where the archaeological resources may be, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Establish to the satisfaction of the BOEM Regional Director that  an archaeological resource does not exist   or will not be adversely affected by drilling. This must be done by  further archaeological investigation, conducted by an archaeologist and  a geophysicist, using survey equipment and techniques deemed necessary  by the Regional Director. A report on the investigation must be  submitted to the BOEM Regional Director for review.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the BOEM Regional Director determines that an archaeological  resource is likely to be present in the area that may be affected by  drilling, and may be adversely affected by drilling, the BOEM Regional  Director will notify you immediately.

Before you revise an  approved drilling plan, you must obtain the BOEM Regional Director's  approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Deadline for completing a deep stratigraphic test. If your deep  stratigraphic test well is within 50 geographic miles of a tract that  BOEM has identified for a future lease sale, as listed on the currently  approved OCS leasing schedule, you must complete all drilling activities  and submit the data and information to the BOEM Regional Director at  least 60 days before the first day of the month in which BOEM schedules  the lease sale. However, the BOEM Regional Director may extend your  permit duration to allow you to complete drilling activities and submit  data and information if the extension is in the National interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Group participation in test drilling. BOEM encourages group  participation for deep stratigraphic tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Purpose of group participation. The purpose is to minimize  duplicative G&G; activities involving drilling into the seabed of the  OCS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Providing opportunity for participation in a deep stratigraphic  test. When you propose to drill a deep stratigraphic test, you must give  all interested persons an opportunity to participate in the test  drilling through a signed agreement on a cost-sharing basis. You may  include a penalty for late participation of not more than 100 percent of  the cost to each original participant in addition to the original share  cost.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The participants must assess and distribute late participation  penalties in accordance with the terms of the agreement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For a significant hydrocarbon occurrence that the Regional  Director announces to the public, the penalty for subsequent late  participants may be raised to not more than 300 percent of the cost of  each original participant in addition to the original share cost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Providing opportunity for participation in a shallow test  drilling project. When you apply to conduct shallow test drilling  activities, you must, if ordered by the Regional Director or required by  the permit, give all interested persons an opportunity to participate in  the test activity on a cost-sharing basis.
