See Sec. 1.907(c)-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> FOGEI tax limitation. Section 907(a) limits the foreign tax  credit for taxes paid or accrued on FOGEI. See Sec. 1.907(a)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Reduction of creditable FORI taxes. Section 907(b)  recharacterizes FORI taxes as non-creditable deductible expenses to the  extent that the foreign law imposing the FORI taxes is structured, or in  fact operates, so that the amount of tax imposed with respect to FORI  will be materially greater, over a reasonable period of time, than the  amount generally imposed on income that is neither FOGEI nor FORI. See  Sec. 1.907(b)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> FOGEI and FORI. FOGEI includes the taxable income from the  extraction of minerals from oil or gas wells by a taxpayer (or another  person) and from the sale or exchange of assets used in the extraction  business. FORI includes taxable income from the activities of processing  oil and gas into their primary products, transporting or distributing  oil and gas and their primary products, and from the disposition of  assets used in these activities. For this purpose, a disposition  includes only a sale or exchange. FOGEI and FORI may also include  taxable income from the performance of related services or from the  lease of related property and certain dividends, interest, or amounts  described in section 951(a). See Sec. Sec. 1.907(c)-1 through 1.907(c)- 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Posted prices. Certain sales prices are disregarded when  computing FOGEI for purposes of chapter 1 of the Code. See Sec.  1.907(d)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Transitional rules. Section 907(e) provides rules for the  carryover of unused FOGEI taxes from taxable years beginning before  January 1, 1983, and carryback of FOGEI taxes arising in   taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982. See Sec. 1.907(e)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Section 907(f) carrybacks and carryovers. FOGEI taxes disallowed  under section 907(a) may be carried back or forward to other taxable  years. These FOGEI taxes may be absorbed in another taxable year to the  extent of the lesser of the separate excess extraction limitation or the  excess limitation in the general limitation category (section  904(d)(1)(I)) for the carryback or carryover year. See Sec. 1.907(f)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Statutes covered. The regulations under section 907 are issued  as a result of the enactment of section 601 of the Tax Reduction Act of  1975, of section 1035 of the Tax Reform Act of 1976, of section  301(b)(14) of the Revenue Act of 1978, of section 211 of the Tax Equity  and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 and of section 1012(g)(6) (A)-(B)  of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988.  [T.D. 8338, 56 FR 11065, Mar. 15, 1991]    Sec. 1.907(a)-1  Reduction in taxes paid on FOGEI (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Amount of reduction. FOGEI taxes are reduced by the amount by  which they exceed a limitation level (as defined in paragraph (c) of  this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Foreign taxes paid or accrued. For purposes of the regulations  under section 907--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Foreign taxes. The term ``foreign taxes'' means income, war  profits, or excess profits taxes of foreign countries or possessions of  the United States otherwise creditable under section 901 (including  those creditable by reason of section 903).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Foreign taxes paid or accrued. The terms ``foreign taxes paid or  accrued,'' ``FOGEI taxes paid or accrued,'' and ``FORI taxes paid or  accrued'' include foreign taxes deemed paid under sections 902 and 960.  Unless otherwise expressly provided, these terms do not include foreign  taxes deemed paid by reason of sections 904(c) and 907(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Limitation level--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The limitation level is FOGEI  for the taxable year multiplied by the limitation percentage for that  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitation percentage for corporations. A corporation's  limitation percentage is the highest rate of tax specified in section  11(b) for the particular year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitation percentage for individuals. Section 907(a)(2)(B)  provides that the limitation percentage for individual taxpayers is the  effective rate of tax for those taxpayers. The effective rate of tax is  computed by dividing the entire tax, before the credit under section  901(a) is taken, by the taxpayer's entire taxable income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Losses. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of determining whether income is FOGEI,  a taxpayer's FOGEI will be recharacterized as foreign source non-FOGEI  to the extent that FOGEI losses for preceding taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1982, exceed the amount of FOGEI already  recharacterized. See Sec. 1.907(c)-1(c). However, taxes that were paid  or accrued on the recharacterized FOGEI will remain FOGEI taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Taxes paid or accrued by a person to a foreign country may be  FOGEI taxes even though that person has under U.S. law a net operating  loss from sources within that country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of determining whether income is FOGEI, a  taxpayer's income will be treated as income from sources outside the  United States even though all or a portion of that income may be  resourced as income from sources within the United States under section  904(f) (1) and (4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Priority. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 907(a) applies before section 908,  relating to reduction of credit for participation in or cooperation with  an international boycott.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 901(f) (relating to certain payments with respect to  oil and gas not considered as taxes) applies before section 907.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Illustrations. Paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section are  illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. M, a U.S. corporation, uses the accrual method of  accounting and the calendar year as its taxable year. For 1984, M has  $20,000 of FOGEI, derived from operations in foreign countries X and Y,  and has accrued $11,500 of foreign taxes with respect to FOGEI. The  highest tax rate specified in section 11(b) for M's 1984 taxable year is  46 percent. Pursuant to section 907(a), M's FOGEI taxes limitation level  for 1984 is $9,200 (46%x$20,000). The foreign taxes in excess of this  limitation level ($2,300) may be carried   back or forward. See section 907(f) and Sec. 1.907(f)-1 and section  907(e) and Sec. 1.907(e)-1.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that M is a  partnership owned equally by U.S. citizens A and B who each file as  unmarried individuals and do not itemize deductions. Pursuant to section  905(a), A and B have elected to credit foreign taxes in the year  accrued. The total amount of foreign taxes accrued by A and B with  respect to their distributive shares of M's FOGEI is $11,500 ($5,750  accrued by A and $5,750 accrued by B). A and B have no other FOGEI. A's  only taxable income for 1984 is his 50% distributive share ($10,000) of  M's FOGEI and A has a preliminary U.S. tax liability of $1,079. B has  $112,130 of taxable income for 1984 (including his 50% distributive  share ($10,000) of M's FOGEI) and has a preliminary U.S. tax liability  of $44,000. Pursuant to section 907(a), A's FOGEI taxes limitation level  for 1984 is $1,079 (($1,079/$10,000)x$10,000) and B's FOGEI taxes  limitation level for 1984 is $3,924 (($44,000/$112,130)x$10,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effect on other provisions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Deduction denied. If a credit is  claimed under section 901, no deduction under section 164(a)(3) is  allowed for the amount of the FOGEI taxes that exceed a taxpayer's  limitation level for the taxable year. See section 275(a)(4)(A). Thus,  FOGEI taxes disallowed under section 907(a) are not added to the cost or  inventory amount of oil or gas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reduction inapplicable. The reduction under section 907(a) does  not apply to a taxpayer that deducts foreign taxes and does not claim  the benefits of section 901 for a taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Section 78 dividend. The reduction under section 907(a) has no  effect on the amount of foreign taxes that are treated as dividends  under section 78.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Section 904 limitation. FOGEI taxes as reduced under section  907(a) are creditable only to the extent permitted by the general  limitation of section 904(d)(1)(I).  [T.D. 8338, 56 FR 11066, Mar. 15, 1991]    Sec. 1.907(b)-1  Reduction of creditable FORI taxes (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982).</p><p class="depth0">If the foreign law imposing a FORI tax (as defined in Sec.  1.907(c)-3) is either structured in a manner, or operates in a manner,  so that the amount of tax imposed on FORI is generally materially  greater than the tax imposed by the foreign law on income that is  neither FORI nor FOGEI (``described manner''), section 907(b) provides a  special rule which limits the amount of FORI taxes paid or accrued by a  person to a foreign country which will be considered income, war  profits, or excess profits taxes. Section 907(b) will apply to a person  regardless of whether that person is a dual capacity taxpayer as defined  in Sec. 1.901-2(a)(2)(ii)(A). (In general, a dual capacity taxpayer is  a person who pays an amount to a foreign country part of which is  attributable to an income tax and the remainder of which is a payment  for a specific economic benefit derived from that country.) Foreign law  imposing a tax on FORI will be considered either to be structured in or  to operate in the described manner only if, under the facts and  circumstances, there has been a shifting of tax by the foreign country  from a tax on FOGEI to a tax on FORI.  [T.D. 8338, 56 FR 11066, Mar. 15, 1991]    Sec. 1.907(c)-1  Definitions relating to FOGEI and FORI (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)-0(b)</em> and 1.907(c)-2 for further definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(2)</em> of this section. For definition of the  phrase ``assets used by the taxpayer in the trade or business'' and for  rules relating to that type of FOGEI, see paragraph (e)(1) of this  section. The   term ``minerals'' is defined in paragraph (f)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section. For  determination of taxable income, see paragraph (f)(2) of this section.  FOGEI includes, in addition, items listed in section 907(c)(3) (relating  to dividends, interest, partnership distributions, etc.) and explained  in Sec. 1.907(c)-2. For the reduction of what would otherwise be FOGEI  by losses incurred in a prior year, see section 907(c)(4) and paragraph  (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amount. The gross income from extraction is determined by  reference to the fair market value of the minerals in the immediate  vicinity of the well. Fair market value is determined under paragraph  (b)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other circumstances. Gross income from extraction or the sale or  exchange of assets described in section 907(c)(1)(B) includes income  from any arrangement, or a combination of arrangements or transactions,  to the extent the income is in substance attributable to the extraction  of minerals or such a sale or exchange. For instance, a person may have  gross income from such a sale or exchange if the person purchased  minerals from a foreign government at a discount and the discount  reflects an arm's-length amount in consideration for the government's  nationalization of assets that person owned and used in the extraction  of minerals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Income directly related to extraction. Gross income from  extraction includes directly related income under paragraph (g) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Income not included. FOGEI as otherwise determined under this  paragraph (b), nevertheless, does not include income to the extent  attributable to marketing, distributing, processing or transporting  minerals or primary products. Income from the purchase and sale of  minerals is not ordinarily FOGEI. If the foreign taxes paid or accrued  in connection with income from a purchase and sale are not creditable by  reason of section 901(f), that income is not FOGEI. A taxpayer to whom  section 901(f) applies is not a producer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Fair market value. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the fair  market value of oil or gas in the immediate vicinity of the well depends  on all of the facts and circumstances as they exist relative to a party  in any particular case. The facts and circumstances that may be taken  into account include, but are not limited to, the following--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts and circumstances pertaining to an independent market  value (if any) in the immediate vicinity of the well,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The facts and circumstances pertaining to the relationships  between the taxpayer and the foreign government. If an independent fair  market value in the immediate vicinity of the well cannot be determined  but fair market value at the port, or a similar point, in the foreign  country can be determined (port price), an analysis of the arrangement  between the taxpayer and the foreign government that retains a share of  production could be evidence of the appropriate, arm's-length difference  between the port price and the field price, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The other facts and circumstances pertaining to any difference  in the producing country between the field and port prices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Economic interest. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the term  ``economic interest'' means an economic interest as defined in Sec.  1.611-1(b)(1), whether or not a deduction for depletion is allowable  under section 611.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Carryover of foreign oil extraction losses--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.  Pursuant to section 907(c)(4), the determination of FOGEI for a  particular taxable year takes into account a foreign oil extraction loss  incurred in prior taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982. There  is no time limitation on this carryover of foreign oil extraction  losses. Section 907(c)(4) does not provide for any carryback of these  losses. Section 907(c)(4) operates solely for purposes of determining  FOGEI and thus operates independently of section 904(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reduction.

For  purposes of this paragraph (c), the term ``foreign oil extraction loss''  means the amount by which the gross income for the taxable year that is  taken into account in determining FOGEI for that year is exceeded by the  sum of the deductions properly allocated and apportioned to that gross  income as determined under paragraph (f)(2) of this section). A person  can have a foreign oil extraction loss for a taxable year even if the  person has not chosen the benefits of section 901 for that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Items not taken into account.

The foreign oil extraction loss of an  affiliated group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1504(a))  that files a consolidated return is determined on a group basis. If the  group does not have a foreign oil extraction loss, the foreign oil  extraction loss of a member of that group will not reduce on a separate  basis that member's FOGEI for a later taxable year.

Because X's FOGEI for 1983 is a loss of $(700), X's  section 907(a) limitation for 1983 is $0 (.46x$0). Thus, none of the  FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1983 ($10) can be credited in 1983. They  can, however, be carried back to 1981 or 1982 pursuant to the provisions  of section 907(e)(2) and Sec. 1.907(e)-1 and carried forward pursuant  to the provisions of section 907(f) and Sec. 1.907(f)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 1984. X's FOGEI for 1984, prior to the application of this  paragraph (c), is $100. X has a foreign oil extraction loss for 1983 of  $(500). This loss must be applied against X's preliminary FOGEI of $100  for 1984. Thus, X's FOGEI for 1984 is $0 and X has $(400) ($500-$100) of  foreign oil extraction loss from 1983 to be carried to 1985. Since X's  FOGEI for 1984 is $0, its section 907(a) limitation is $0 (.46x$0).  Therefore, none of the FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1984 ($60) can be  credited in 1984. They can, however, be carried back pursuant to the  provisions of section 907(e)(2) and Sec. 1.907(e)-1 and carried forward  pursuant to the provisions of section 907(f) and Sec. 1.907(f)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> 1985. X's FOGEI for 1985, prior to the application of this  paragraph (c), is $450. X's remaining foreign oil extraction loss  carryover from 1983 is $(400) and this must be applied against X's  preliminary FOGEI of $450 for 1985. Thus, X's FOGEI for 1984 is $50  ($450-$400). X's section 907 (a) limitation is $23 (.46x$50). Therefore,  $23 of the FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1985, together with the other  $230 of general limitation taxes, can be credited in 1985, subject to  the general limitation of section 904(d)(1)(E) (as in effect prior to  1987). The excess of FOGEI taxes, $177 ($200-$23), can be carried back  pursuant to the provisions of section 907(e)(2) and Sec. 1.907(e)-1 and  carried forward pursuant to   the provisions of section 907(f) and Sec. 1.907(f)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except  that X's paragraph (c)(3)(ii) items for 1983 allocable to FOGEI are  $(800) instead of $(200). FOGEI remains a loss of $(700). Thus, X does  not have a foreign oil extraction loss for 1983 because it has $100 of  FOGEI when its paragraph (c)(3)(ii) items are not taken into account  ($(700)+$800).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 1983. The results are the same as in Example 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 1984. Although X had FOGEI loss of $(700) in 1983, there is  not a loss that can be carried forward after adjustment for paragraph  (c)(3)(ii) items. Thus, X's FOGEI for 1984 is not reduced by the 1983  loss. X's section 907(a) limitation for 1984 is $46 (.46x$100).  Therefore, $46 of the FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1984, together with  the other $90 of general limitation taxes, can be credited in 1984,  subject to the general limitation of section 904(d)(1)(E) (as in effect  prior to 1987). The excess of $14 ($60-$46) can be carried back to 1982  pursuant to the provisions of section 907(e)(2) and Sec. 1.907(e)-1 and  carried forward pursuant to the provisions of section 907(f) and Sec.  1.907(f)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> 1985. Since there is no foreign oil extraction loss for either  1983 or 1984 to be applied in 1985, X's FOGEI for 1985 is $450. Thus,  its section 907(a) limitation for 1985 is $207 (.46x$450) and all of its  FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1985 ($200), together with the other $230  of general limitation taxes, can be credited in 1985, subject to the  general limitation of section 904(d)(1)(E) (as in effect prior to 1987).  FOGEI taxes in the amount of $10 from 1983 and $14 from 1984 may be  carried forward to 1985 if they have not been used in carryback years.  However, because the excess section 907(a) limitation for 1985 is only  $7, that is the maximum potential FOGEI taxes from 1983 or 1984 that may  be used in 1985.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Y, a U.S. corporation using the accrual method  of accounting and the calendar year as its taxable year, is engaged in  extraction activities in three foreign countries. Y's only foreign  taxable income is income subject to the general limitation of section  904(d)(1)(E) (as in effect prior to 1987). Y has no paragraph (c)(3)(ii)  items.

Because Y's FOGEI for 1984 is $0, its section 907(a) limitation is also  $0. Thus, none of the FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1984 ($180) can be  credited in 1984. They can, however, be carried back to 1982 pursuant to  the provisions of section 907(e)(2) and Sec. 1.907(e)-1 and carried  forward pursuant to the provisions of section 907(f) and Sec. 1.907(f)- 1.

Because Y's FOGEI for 1984 is a loss of $(100), Y's  section 907(a) limitation for 1984 is $0. Thus, none of the FOGEI taxes  paid or accrued in 1984 ($10) can be credited in 1984. They can,  however, be carried back under the provisions of section 907(e)(2) and  Sec. 1.907(e)-1 and carried forward under the provisions of section  907(f) and Sec. 1.907(f)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> 1985. Y's FOGEI loss of $(100) for 1984 is carried forward to  1985 and offsets FOGEI income in that amount in 1985. The entire section  904(d)(1)(E) overall foreign loss account of $50 is recaptured in 1985;  therefore, Y has $75 of foreign source income and $50 of U.S. source  income. However, Y has $125 of FOGEI since, for purposes of section  907(a), the $50 resourced by section 904(f) will be treated as income  from sources outside the United States; see Sec. 1.907(a)-1(c)(4)(iii).  Accordingly, Y's section 907(a) limitation is $57.50 (.46x$125). Y's  section 904(d)(1)(E) limitation is, however, only $34.50 (.46x$75).  Thus, Y may claim a foreign tax credit of $34.50 in 1985. Y may carry  back or carry forward $23 ($57.50-$34.50) and that amount is not subject  to the section 907(a) limitation in the carry to year. In addition,  $67.50 ($125-$57.50) may be carried back pursuant to the provisions of  section 907(e)(2) and Sec. 1.907(e)-1 and carried forward pursuant to  the provisions of section 907(f) and Sec. 1.907(f)-1. This amount is  subject to the section 907(a) limitation in the carry to year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> FORI--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 907(c)(2) defines FORI to include  taxable income from the processing of oil and gas into their primary  products, from the transportation or distribution and sale of oil and  gas and their primary products, from the disposition of assets used in  these activities and from the performance of any other related service.  FORI may also include, under section 907(c)(3), certain dividends,  interest, or amounts described in section 951(a). This paragraph (d)  defines certain terms and items applicable to FORI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transportation. Gross income from transportation of minerals or  primary products (``gross transportation income'') is gross income  arising from carrying minerals or primary products between two places  (including time or voyage charter hires) by any means of transportation,  such as a vessel, pipeline, truck, railroad, or aircraft. Except for  directly related income under paragraphs (d)(7) and (g) of this section,  gross transportation income does not include gross income received by a  lessor from a bareboat charter hire of a means of transportation,  certain other rental income, or income from the performance of certain  services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Distribution or sale. The term ``distribution or sale'' means  the sale or exchange of minerals or primary products to processors,  users who purchase, store, or use in bulk quantities, other persons for  further distribution, retailers, or consumers. Gross income from  distribution or sale includes interest income attributable to the  distribution of minerals or primary products on credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Processing. The term ``processing'' means the destructive  distillation, or a process similar in effect to destructive  distillation, of crude oil and the processing of natural gas into their  primary products including processes used to remove pollutants from  crude oil or natural gas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Primary product from oil. The term ``primary product'' (in the  case of oil) means all products derived from the processing of crude  oil, including volatile products, light oils (such as motor fuel and  kerosene), distillates (such as naphtha), lubricating oils, greases and  waxes, and residues (such as fuel oil).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Primary product from gas. The term ``primary product'' (in the  case of gas) means all gas and associated hydrocarbon components from  gas wells or oil wells, whether recovered at the lease or upon further  processing, including natural gas, condensates, liquefiable petroleum  gases (such as ethane, propane, and butane), and liquid products (such  as natural gasoline).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Directly related income. FORI also includes directly related  income under paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Assets used in a trade or business--(1) In general. The term  ``assets used by the taxpayer in the trade or business'' in section  907(c) </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(B)</em> and (2)(D) means property primarily used in one or more of  the trades or businesses that are section 907(c) activities. For  purposes of this paragraph (e), assets used in a trade or business are  assets described in section 1231(b) (applied without regard to any  holding period or the character of the asset as being subject to the  allowance for depreciation under section 167).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> (A) through (C)  (for FORI). If an asset is used primarily in one or more section 907(c)  activities, then the entire gain (or loss) will be considered  attributable to those activities. For example, if a person uses a  service station primarily to distribute primary products   from oil, then all of the gain (or loss) on the sale of the station is  FORI even though the person uses the station to distribute products that  are not primary products (such as tires or batteries). If an asset is  not primarily used in one or more section 907(c) activities, then the  entire gain or loss will not be FOGEI or FORI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Stock. Stock of any corporation (whether foreign or domestic)  will not be treated as an asset used by a person in section 907(c)  activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Losses on sale of stock. If, under Sec. 1.861-8(e)(7), a loss  on the sale, exchange, or disposition of stock is considered a deduction  which is definitely related and allocable to FOGEI or FORI, then  notwithstanding Sec. 1.861-8 (e)(7) and paragraph (f)(2) of this  section, this loss shall be allocated and apportioned to the same class  of income that would have been produced if there were capital gain from  the sale, exchange or disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Character of gain or loss. Except in the case of stock, gain or  loss from the sale, exchange or disposition of assets used in the trade  or business may be FORI or FOGEI to the extent taken into account in  computing taxable income for the taxable year, whether or not the gain  or loss is ordinary income or ordinary loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Allocation of amount realized. The amount realized from the  sale, exchange or disposition of several assets in one transaction is  allocated among them in proportion to their respective fair market  values. This allocation is made under the principles set forth in Sec.  1.1245-1(a)(5) (relating to allocation between section 1245 property and  non-section 1245 property).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Interest. Gross income from the sale, exchange or disposition of  an asset used in a section 907(c) activity includes interest income from  such a sale, exchange or disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Terms and items common to FORI and FOGEI--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Minerals. The term  ``minerals'' means hydrocarbon minerals extracted from oil and gas  wells, including crude oil or natural gas (as defined in section  613A(e)). The term includes incidental impurities from these wells, such  as sulphur, nitrogen, or helium. The term does not include hydrocarbon  minerals derived from shale oil or tar sands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Taxable income. Deductions to be taken into account in computing  taxable income or net operating loss attributable to FOGEI or FORI are  determined under the principles of Sec. 1.861-8. For an exception with  regard to losses, see paragraph (e)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Interest on working capital. FORI and FOGEI may include interest  on bank deposits or on any other temporary investment which is not in  excess of funds reasonably necessary to meet the working capital  requirements and the specifically anticipated business needs of the  person that is engaged in the conduct of the activities described in  section 907(c) (1) or (2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Exchange gain or loss. Exchange gain (and loss) may be FORI and  FOGEI. For taxable years beginning after 1986, exchange gain or loss  from a section 988 transaction may be FORI or FOGEI only if directly  related to the business needs (under the principles of section  954(c)(1)(D)) attributable to the conduct of the section 907(c)  activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Allocation. Interest income and exchange gain (or loss)  described, respectively, in paragraph (f) (3) and (4) of this section  are allocated among FORI, FOGEI, and any other class of income relevant  for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitations under any reasonable  method which is consistently applied from year-to-year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Facts and circumstances. Income not described elsewhere in this  section may be FOGEI or FORI if, under the facts and circumstances in  the particular case, the income is in substance directly attributable to  the activities described in section 907(c) (1) or (2). For example,  assume that a producer in the North Sea suffers a casualty caused by an  explosion, fire, and resulting destruction of a drilling platform.  Insurance proceeds received for the platform's destruction in excess of  the producer's basis is extraction income if the excess constitutes  income from sources outside the United States. In addition, income from  an insurance policy for business interruption may be extraction income  to the extent the payments under the policy are geared directly to the  loss of income from production and are treated as income from   sources outside the United States. Also, if an oil company's oil  concession or assets used in extraction activities described in section  907(c)(1)(A) and located outside the United States are nationalized or  expropriated by a foreign government, or instrumentality thereof, income  derived from that nationalization or expropriation (including interest  on the income paid pursuant to the nationalization or expropriation) is  FOGEI. Likewise, if a company's assets used in the activities described  in section 907(c)(2) (A) through (C) and located outside the United  States are nationalized or expropriated by a foreign government, or  instrumentality thereof, income (including interest on the income paid  pursuant to the nationalization or expropriation) derived from the  nationalization or expropriation will be FORI. Nationalization or  expropriation is deemed to be a sale or exchange for purposes of section  907(c)(1)(B) and a disposition for purposes of section 907(c)(2)(D). In  further example, assume that an oil company has an exclusive right to  buy all the oil in country X from Y, an instrumentality of the foreign  sovereign which owns all of the oil in X. The oil company does not have  an economic interest in any oil in country X. Y has a temporary cash- flow problem and demands that the oil company make advance deposits for  the purchase of oil not yet delivered. In return, Y grants the oil  company a discount on the price of the oil when delivered. Income  represented by the discount on the later disposition of the oil is FORI  described in section 907(c)(2)(C). The result would be the same if Y  credited the oil company with interest on the advance deposits, which  had to be used to purchase oil (the interest income would be FORI).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Directly related income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 907(c)(2)(E)  and this paragraph (g) include in FORI, and this paragraph (g) includes  in FOGEI, income from the performance of directly related services (as  defined in paragraph (g)(2) of this section). This paragraph (g) also  includes in FORI and FOGEI income from the lease or license of related  property (as defined in paragraph (g)(3) of this section).

A person described in paragraph (g)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section will,  however, have directly related services income which is FOGEI if the  income is so classified by reason of the income based on output test set  forth in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Directly related services--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> FOGEI. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Income from directly  related services will be FOGEI, as that term is defined in paragraph (b)  (1) and (3) of this section, if those services are directly related to  the active conduct of extraction (including exploration) of minerals  from oil and gas wells. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section provides that,  in order to have extraction income, a person must have an economic  interest in the minerals in place. However, paragraph (b)(3) of this  section recognizes that income arising from ``other circumstances'' is  extraction income if that income is in substance attributable to the  extraction of minerals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An example of ``other circumstances'' under paragraph (b)(3) of  this section is the ``income based on output test.'' This income based  on output test provides that, if the   amount of compensation paid or credited to a person for services is  dependent on the amount of minerals discovered or extracted, the income  of the person from the performance of the services will be directly  related services income which is FOGEI. This test will apply whether or  not the person performing the services has, or had, an economic interest  in the minerals discovered or extracted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> FORI. With regard to the determination of directly related  services income which is FORI, directly related services are those  services directly related to the active conduct of the operations  described in section 907(c)(2) (A) through (C). Those services include,  for example, services performed in relation to the distribution of  minerals or primary products or in connection with the operation of a  refinery, or the types of services described in Sec. 1.954-6(d) (other  than Sec. 1.954-6(d)(4) which relate to foreign base company shipping  income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Recipient of the services. Directly related services described  in paragraph (g)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section may be performed for  any person without regard to whether that person is a related person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Excluded services--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> FOGEI. Directly related services which  produce FOGEI do not include insurance, accounting or managerial  services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> FORI. Directly related services which produce FORI do not,  generally, include insurance, accounting or managerial services. These  services will, however, produce FORI if they are performed by the person  performing the operations described in section 907(c)(2) (A) through  (C). For these purposes, insurance income which is FORI means taxable  income as defined in section 832(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> applies without regard to whether the parties are related  persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Related person. A person will be treated as a related person for  purposes of this paragraph (g) if that person would be so treated within  the meaning of section 954(d)(3) (as applied by substituting the word  ``corporation'' for the word ``controlled foreign corporation'') or that  person is a partnership or partner described in section 707(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Gross income. A foreign corporation shall be treated as a  domestic corporation for the purpose of applying the gross-income rules  in paragraph (g)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Coordination with other provisions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Certain adjustments. The  character of income as FOGEI or FORI is determined before making any  adjustment under section 482 or section 907(d). For example, assume that  X and Y are related parties, Y's only income is from the sale of oil  that Y purchased from X, and FOGEI from X is diverted to Y through an  arrangement described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Accordingly,  Y has FOGEI. If under section 482 the Commissioner reallocates the FOGEI  from Y to X, then Y's remaining income represents only a profit from  distributing the oil, and thus is FORI. If the foreign taxes paid by Y  on this income are otherwise creditable under section 901, the foreign  taxes that are not refunded to Y retain their characterization as FOGEI  taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 901(f). Section 901(f) (relating to certain payments  with respect to oil and gas not considered as taxes) applies before  section 907. Taxes disallowed by section 901(f) are added to the cost or  inventory amount of oil or gas.

This section provides rules relating to certain items  listed in section 907(c)(3). The rules of this section   are expressed in terms of FORI but apply for determining FOGEI by  substituting ``FOGEI'' for ``FORI'' whenever appropriate. FOGEI does not  include interest described in section 907(c)(3)(A). Dividends paid prior  to January 1, 1987, and described in section 907(c)(3)(B), as in effect  prior to amendment by the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of  1988, are included in FORI and not FOGEI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>, gain (or loss) from the disposition  of stock in any corporation is not FOGEI or FORI.

Items described in  section 907(c)(3) (A) or (C) are FORI only if a deemed-paid-tax test is  met under the criteria of section 902 or 960. The purpose of this test  is to require minimum direct or indirect ownership by a domestic  corporation in the voting stock of a foreign corporation as a  prerequisite for the item to qualify as FORI in the hands of the  domestic corporation. The test is whether a domestic corporation would  be deemed to pay any taxes of a foreign corporation when a dividend or  an amount described in section 907(c)(3) (A) or (C), respectively, is  included in the domestic corporation's gross income. In the case of  interest described in section 907(c)(3)(A), the test is whether any  taxes would be deemed paid if there were a hypothetical dividend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Dividends and interest. For purposes of section 907(c)(3)(A), a  domestic corporation is deemed under section 902 to pay taxes in respect  of dividends and interest received from a foreign corporation whether or  not the foreign corporation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Actually pays or is deemed to pay taxes, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of interest, actually pays dividends.  This paragraph (c)(2) also applies to dividends received by a foreign  corporation from a second-tier or third-tier foreign corporation (as  defined in Sec. 1.902-1(a) (3)(i) and (4), respectively). In the case  of interest received by a foreign corporation from another foreign  corporation, this paragraph (c)(2) applies if the taxes of both foreign  corporations would be deemed paid under section 902 (a) or (b) for  purposes of applying section 902(a) to the same taxpayer which is a  domestic corporation. In the case of interest received by any  corporation (whether foreign or domestic), all members of an affiliated  group filing a consolidated return will be treated as the same taxpayer  under section 907(c)(3)(A) if the foreign taxes of the payor and (if the  recipient is a foreign corporation) the foreign taxes of the recipient  would be deemed paid under section 902 by at least one member. The term  ``member'' is defined in Sec. 1.1502-1(b). Thus, for example, assume  that P owns all of the stock of D1 and D2 and P. D1, and D2 are members  of an affiliated group filing a consolidated return. Assume further that  D1 owns all of the stock of F1 and D2 owns all of the stock of F2, where  F1 and F2 are foreign corporations. Interest paid by F1 to P, D2, or F2  may be FORI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(C)</em>, a domestic corporation is deemed under section 960 to pay  taxes in respect of a foreign corporation, whether or not the foreign  corporation actually pays taxes on the amounts included in gross income  under section 951(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Amount attributable to certain items--(1) Certain dividends--(i)  General rule.

In a taxable year in which a foreign corporation described in section  907(c)(3)(A) pays a dividend or has income that is subject to inclusion  under section 951, if the foreign corporation has positive post--1986  undistributed earnings in a separate category but within that separate  category there is a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings  attributable to earnings other than FOGEI and FORI, that deficit shall  be allocated ratably between the FOGEI and FORI post-1986   undistributed earnings within that separate category. Any deficit in  post-1986 undistributed earnings attributable to either FOGEI or FORI  shall be allocated first to FOGEI or FORI post-1986 undistributed  earnings (as the case may be) to the extent thereof. Post-1986  undistributed FORI earnings are the post-1986 undistributed earnings (as  defined in section 902 and the regulations under that section)  attributable to FORI as defined in section 907(c) (2) and (3). Post-1986  undistributed FOGEI earnings are the post-1986 undistributed earnings  (as defined in section 902 and the regulations under that section)  attributable to FOGEI as defined in section 907(c) (1) and (3).</p><p class="depth0">Example.

The application of this paragraph (d) is  illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of Y, a  foreign corporation organized in country S. Y owns all of the stock of  Z, a foreign corporation also organized in country S. Each corporation  uses the calendar year as its taxable year. In 1983, Z has $150 of FOGEI  earnings and profits and $250 of earnings and profits other than FOGEI  or FORI. Assume that Z paid no taxes to S and X must include $100 in its  gross income under section 951(a) with respect to Z. Under paragraph  (d)(4)(i) of this section, $37.50 of the amount described in section  951(a) is FOGEI ($100x$150/$400). the remaining $62.50 of the section  951(a) amount represents other income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that the  taxable year in question is 1988. In addition, under the facts and  circumstances, it is determined that of the $100 section 951(a) amount  included in X's gross income, $30 is directly attributable to Z's FOGEI  activity, $60 is directly attributable to Z's FORI activity and $10 is  directly attributable to Z's other activity. Accordingly, under  paragraph (d)(4)(i), $30 will be FOGEI and $60 will be FORI to X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assume the same facts as in Example 1. Assume further  that, in 1983, Z distributes its entire earnings and profits ($400) to Y  which consists of a dividend of $300 and a section 959(a)(1)  distribution of $100. Y has no other earnings and profits during 1983.  Assume that the dividend and distribution are not foreign personal  holding company income under section 954(c). Y pays no taxes to S. In  1983, Y distributes its entire earnings and profits to X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section does not apply  since X does not include any amount in its gross income under section  951(a) with respect to Y. If Y paid taxes to S, this paragraph (d) would  apply to characterize those taxes as FOGEI taxes or other taxes. See  Sec. 1.907(c)-3(a)(8) and Example 2 (iii) under Sec. 1.907(c)-3(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The distribution from Y to X is a dividend to the extent of  $300, i.e., the amount of the distribution ($400) minus the amount  excluded from X's gross income under section 959(a)(1) ($100). Under  paragraphs (d) (1)(i) and (6)(i) of this section, $112.50 of the  dividend is FOGEI, i.e., the amount of the dividend ($300) multiplied by  a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is $112.50, i.e., the FOGEI  accumulated profits of Y in excess of FOGEI taxes paid ($150) minus the  FOGEI accumulated profits of Y in excess of FOGEI taxes paid excluded  from X's gross income under section 959(a)(1) ($37.50). The denominator  of the fraction is $300, i.e., the total accumulated profits of Y in  excess of taxes paid ($400) minus the amount excluded from X's gross  income under section 959(a)(1) ($100).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 with the following  modifications: In 1983, Z's only earnings and profits are FORI earnings  and profits which are included in X's gross income under section 951(a).  Z distributes its entire earnings and profits to Y. In 1983, Y has total  earnings and profits of $100 without regard to the dividend from Z, $60  of which are FORI earnings and profits. Y also has $40 which is included  in X's gross income under section 951(a). Under paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of  this section, the dividend from Z is disregarded for purposes of  applying paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section to the $40 included in X's  gross income under section 951(a) with respect to Y. Accordingly, $24 of  the amount described in section 951(a) is FORI ($40x$60/$100). Had these  circumstances existed in 1988, and if the $40 included in X's gross  income under section 951(a) was directly attributable to FORI activity,  all of that income would be FORI to X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Dividends, interest, and other amounts from sources within a  possession. FORI includes the items listed in (A) and (C) to the extent  attributable to FORI of a corporation that is created or organized in or  under the laws of a possession of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Income from partnerships, trusts, etc. FORI and FOGEI include a  person's distributive share (determined under the principles of section  704) of the income of any partnership and amounts included in income  under subchapter J of chapter 1 of the Code (relating to the taxation of  trusts, estates, and beneficiaries) to the extent the income and amounts  are attributable to FORI and FOGEI. For taxable years beginning after  1986, the principles of Sec. 1.904-5 (h) and (i) shall be applied to  determine whether (and to what extent) a person's distributive share is  FORI and FOGEI. Thus, for example, a less-than-10 percent corporate  partner's share of income of the partnership would generally be treated  as passive income to the partner, and not as FORI or FOGEI, unless an  exception under Sec. 1.904-5 (h) and (i) applies.

Paragraphs (a) (2) through (6) of this section provides rules for the  characterization, allocation, and apportionment of the income taxes  (other than withholding taxes) paid or accrued to a foreign country  among FOGEI, FORI, and other income relevant for purposes of sections  907 and 904. Some of the rules in this section are expressed in terms of  FOGEI taxes but they apply to FORI taxes by substituting ``FORI taxes''  for ``FOGEI taxes'' whenever appropriate. For the treatment of  withholding taxes, see paragraph (a)(8) of this section. FOGEI taxes are  determined without any reduction under section 907(a). In addition,  determination of FOGEI taxes will not be affected by recharacterization  of FOGEI by section 907(c)(4). See Sec. 1.907(c)-1(c)(5). Foreign taxes  will not be characterized as creditable FORI taxes if section 907(b) and  Sec. 1.907(b)-1 apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Three classes of income. There are three classes of income:  FOGEI, FORI, and other income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> More than one class in a foreign tax base. If more than one  class of income is taxed under one tax base under the law of a foreign  country, the amount of pre-credit foreign tax for each base must be  determined. This amount is the foreign taxes paid or accrued to that  country for the base as increased   by the tax credits (if any) which reduced those taxes and were allowed  in the country for that tax. More than one class of income is taxed  under the same base, if, under a foreign country's law, deductions from  one class of income may reduce the income of any other class and the  classes are subject to foreign tax at the same rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Allocation of tax within a base. If more than one class of  income is taxed under the same base under a foreign country's law, the  pre-credit foreign tax for the base is apportioned to each class of  income in proportion to the income of each class. Tax credits are than  allocated (under paragraph (a)(6) of this section) to the apportioned  pre-credit tax. Income of a class over the deductions allowed under  foreign law for, and which are attributable to, that class.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Modified gross income. Modified gross income is not necessarily  the same as gross income as defined for purposes of chapter 1 of the  Internal Revenue Code. Modified gross income is determined with  reference to the foreign tax base for gross income (or its equivalent).  However, the characterization of the base as a particular class of  income is governed by general principles of U.S. tax law. Thus, for  example--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Gross income from extraction is the fair market value of oil or  gas in the immediate vicinity of the well (as determined under Sec.  1.907(c)-1(b)(6) (without any deductions)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whether cost of goods sold (or any other deduction) is a  deduction from modified gross income and the amount of such a deduction  is determined under foreign law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Modified gross income includes items that are part of the  foreign tax base even though they are not gross income under U.S. law so  long as the foreign taxes paid on the base constitute creditable taxes  under section 901 (including taxes described in section 903). For  example, if a foreign country imposes a tax (creditable under section  901) on a tax base that includes in small part a percentage of the value  of a company's oil reserves in place, modified gross income from  extraction includes such a percentage of value solely for purposes of  making the tax allocation in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Modified gross income from extraction is increased for purposes  of this paragraph (a)(5) by the entire excess of the posted price over  fair market value if the foreign country uses a posted price system or  other pricing arrangement described in section 907(d) in imposing its  income tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Modified gross income from FORI is that income attributable to  the activities in sections 907(c)(2) (A) through (C) and (E).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Modified gross income for any class may not include gross  income that is not subject to taxation by the foreign country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Allocation of tax credits. The foreign taxes paid or accrued on  a particular class of income equals the precredit tax on the class  reduced (but not below zero) by the credits allowed under foreign law  against the foreign tax on the particular class. Any tax credit  attributable to a class that is not allocated to that class is allocated  to the other class in the base or, if there are three classes in the  base, is apportioned ratably among the taxes paid or accrued on the  other two classes (as reduced in accordance with the preceding  sentence).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Withholding taxes. Paragraph (a) (2) through (6) of this section  does not apply to withholding taxes imposed by a foreign country. FOGEI  taxes may include withholding taxes imposed with respect to a  distribution from a corporation. The portion of the total withholding  taxes on a distribution that constitutes FOGEI taxes is determined by  the portion of the distribution that is FOGEI. In addition, FOGEI taxes  may include taxes imposed on a distribution described in section  959(a)(1) or on amounts described in section 959(b). The portion of the  total withholding taxes imposed on a distribution described in section  959(a)(1) or on amounts described in section 959(b) is determined by  reference to the portion of the amount included in gross income under  section 951(a) that was FOGEI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Dividenss--In general. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> FOGEI taxes deemed paid with respect  to a dividend equal the total taxes deemed   paid with respect to the dividend multiplied by the fraction:  FOGEI taxes paid or accrued by the payor/Total foreign taxes paid or  accrued by the payor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With regard to dividends received in taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1986, FOGEI taxes deemed paid with respect to a  dividend equal the total taxes deemed paid with respect to the portion  of the dividend within a separate category multiplied by the fraction: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC07OC91.046</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> This paragraph (b) applies to a dividend described in section  907(c)(3)(A) (including a section 1248 dividend) with reference to the  particular taxable year or years of those accumulated profits out of  which a dividend is paid.

A partner's distributive share of the  partnership's FOGEI taxes is determined under the principles of section  704.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Illustrations. The application of this section may be  illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of Y, a  foreign corporation organized in country S. Y owns all of the stock of  Z, a foreign corporation organized in country T. Each corporation used  the calendar year as its taxable year. In 1983, X includes in its gross  income an amount described in section 951(a) with respect to Z. Assume  that the taxes deemed paid under section 902(a) by X by reason of such  an inclusion is $70. Assume further that Z paid total taxes of $120, $80  of which is FOGEI tax. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the FOGEI  tax deemed paid is $46.67 (i.e., $70x$80/$120). This $46.67 is also  FOGEI under Sec. 1.907(c)-2(d)(5) because it must be included in X's  gross income under section 78.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assume the same facts as in Example 1. Assume further  that in 1983, Z distributes its entire earnings and profits to Y. Y has  no earnings and profits during 1983 other than this dividend. Y paid a  tax of $50 to S. Assume that Y is deemed under section 902(b)(1) to pay  $50 of the tax paid by Z which was not deemed paid by X under section  960(a)(1) in 1983. In 1983, Y distributes its entire earnings and  profits to X. Assume that X is deemed under section 902(a) to pay $100  of the taxes actually paid, and deemed paid, by Y.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies to characterize the  $50 tax of Z that Y is deemed to pay under section 902(b)(1). Y is  deemed to pay $33.33 of FOGEI tax, i.e., the amount of the tax deemed  paid by Y ($50) multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction  is the amount of Z's FOGEI tax ($80) and the denominator is the total  taxes paid by Z ($120).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (a)(8) of this section, a portion of the $50  tax actually paid by Y on the earnings and profits received from Z is  FOGEI tax. The amount of tax actually paid by Y that is FOGEI tax  depends on the amount of the distribution from Z that is FOGEI (see  Sec. 1.907(c)-2(d)(1) (i) and Example 2 (ii) under Sec. 1.907(c)- 2(d)(8)). This result does not depend upon whether a portion of the  distribution from Z is described in section 959(b) and it follows even  though a portion of Y's earnings and profits will be excluded from X's  gross income under section 959(a)(1) when distributed by Y. Assume that  $12.50 of the $50 tax actually paid by Y is FOGEI tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, X is deemed to pay  $45.83 of FOGEI tax by reason of the distribution from Y. This amount is  determined by multiplying the total taxes deemed paid by X by reason of  such distribution ($100) by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is  the FOGEI tax paid, and deemed paid, by Y ($45.83, i.e., $33.33 under  paragraph (ii) of this example plus $12.50 under paragraph (iii) of this  example). The denominator of the fraction is the total taxes paid, and  deemed paid, by Y ($100). This $45.83 is FOGEI under Sec. 1.907(c)- 2(d)(5) because it is included in X's gross income as a section 78  dividend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X, a domestic corporation, has a concession with  foreign country Y that gives it the exclusive right to extract and  export the crude oil and natural gas owned by Y. The concession  agreement and location of the oil and gas wells mandate that X construct  a system of pipelines to transport the minerals that are extracted to a  port where they are loaded onto tankers for export. X owns the  transportation facilities. Y has an income tax system under which income  from mineral operations is subject to a 50 percent tax rate. The  taxation by Y of the mineral operations is a separate tax base under  paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Under this system, Y imposes the tax  at the port prior to export and it establishes a posted price of $12 per  barrel. Y also collects royalties of $1.44 per barrel (i.e., 12 percent  of this posted price) which is deductible in computing the petroleum  tax. Y also allows X deductible lifting costs of $.20 per barrel and  deductible transporting costs of $.80 per barrel. Y does not allow any  credits against the mineral tax. Assume that X does not have any income  in Y other than the mineral income. (In 1983, X extracts, transports,  and exports 10,000,000 barrels of crude oil, but for convenience, all  computations are in terms of one barrel). X pays foreign taxes of $4.78  per barrel, computed as follows:  Sales.................................................  .......   $12.00 Royalties.............................................    $1.44  .......

Thus, at the port, the excess of  posted price ($12) over fair market value ($10) is $2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The $4.78 foreign tax paid to Y is allocated to FOGEI and FORI  in accordance with the rules in paragraph (a) (2) through (5) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, FOGEI and FORI are  subject to foreign taxation under one tax base. This foreign tax is  allocated between FOGEI tax and FORI tax in accordance with paragraph  (a) (4) and (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The modified gross income for FOGEI is $11, i.e., fair market  value in the immediate vicinity of the well ($9) plus the excess at the  port of posted price over fair market value ($2). The modified gross  income for FORI is $1, i.e., value added to the oil beyond the well-head  which is part of Y's tax base ($10-$9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The royalty deductions are all directly attributable to FOGEI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the income of each  class is determined as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">FOGEI     FORI ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Modified gross income...............................    $11.00     $1.00 Deductions:</p><p class="depth0">Royalties.......................................      1.44         0</p><p class="depth0">Lifting.........................................       .20         0</p><p class="depth0">Transporting....................................         0       .80</p><p class="depth0">Total...........................................      1.64       .80 Net Income..........................................      9.36       .20 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the total tax paid to  Y is allocated to FOGEI and FORI in proportion to the income in each  class. The calculation is as follows:  FOGEI tax=$4.78x$9.36/$9.56=$4.68 FORI tax=$4.78x$0.20/$9.56=$0.10  Thus, for the 10,000,000 barrels, the FOGEI tax is $46,800,000 and the  FORI tax is $1,000,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The allocation under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, rather  than the direct application of stated foreign tax rates to foreign-law  taxable income in each class of income (which would produce the same  results in the facts of this example), is necessary when a foreign  country taxes more than one class of income under a progressive rate  structure.

Assume the same facts as in Example 3. Assume further  that X refines the crude oil into primary products prior to export and Y  imposes its tax on the basis of crude oil equivalences of $12 per  barrel, rather than the value of the primary products, to establish port  prices. Assume that this arrangement is a pricing arrangement described  in section 907(d). Thus, Y does not tax the refinery income. The results  are the same as in Example 3 even if $12 per barrel is equal to, more  than, or less than, the value of the primary products at the port. See  paragraph (a)(5)(vi) of this section.
