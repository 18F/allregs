                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicability. This section is intended to meet the  testing requirement of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (15  U.S.C. 2601).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Source. The source material used in developing this TSCA test  guideline is the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances  (OPPTS) harmonized test guideline 870.4100 (August 1998, final  guidelines). This source is available at the address in paragraph (h) of  this section</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Purpose. The objective of a chronic toxicity study is to  determine the effects of a substance in a mammalian species following  prolonged and repeated exposure. A chronic toxicity study should  generate data from which to identify the majority of chronic effects and  to define long-term dose-response relationships. The design and conduct  of chronic toxicity tests should allow for the detection of general  toxic effects, including neurological, physiological, biochemical, and  hematological effects and exposure-related morphological (pathological)  effects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. The definitions in section 3 of TSCA and in 40 CFR  Part 792--Good Laboratory Practice Standards apply to this section. The  following definitions also apply to this section.</p><p class="depth0">Chronic toxicity is the adverse effects occurring as a result of the  repeated daily exposure of experimental animals to a chemical by the  oral, dermal, or inhalation routes of exposure.</p><p class="depth0">Cumulative toxicity is the adverse effects of repeated doses  occurring as a result of prolonged action on, or increased concentration  of, the administered test substance or its metabolites in susceptible  tissue.</p><p class="depth0">Dose in a chronic toxicity study is the amount of test substance  administered daily via the oral, dermal or inhalation routes for a  period of at least 12 months. Dose is expressed as weight of the test  substance (grams, milligrams) per unit body weight of test animal  (milligram per kilogram), or as weight of the test substance in parts  per million (ppm) in food or drinking water per day. For inhalation  exposure, dose is expressed as weight of the test substance per unit  volume of air (milligrams per liter) or as parts per million per day.  For dermal exposure, dose is expressed as weight of the test substance  (grams, milligrams) per unit   body weight of the test animal (milligrams per kilogram) or as weight of  the substance per unit of surface area (milligrams per square  centimeter) per day.</p><p class="depth0">No-observed-effects level (NOEL) is the maximum dose used in a study  which produces no adverse effects. The NOEL is usually expressed in  terms of the weight of a test substance given daily per unit weight of  test animal (milligrams per kilogram per day).</p><p class="depth0">Target organ is any organ of a test animal showing evidence of an  effect induced by a test substance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Limit test. If a test at one dose level of at least 1,000 mg/kg  body weight (expected human exposure may indicate the need for a higher  dose level), using the procedures described for this study, produces no  observable toxic effects and if toxicity would not be expected based  upon data of structurally related compounds, a full study using three  dose levels might not be necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Test procedures--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Animal selection--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Species and strain.  Testing should be performed with two mammalian species, one a rodent and  the other a nonrodent. The rat is the preferred rodent species. Commonly  used laboratory strains must be employed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Age/weight. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Testing must be started with young healthy  animals as soon as possible after weaning and acclimatization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Dosing of rodents should generally begin no later than 8 weeks  of age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Dosing of non-rodents should begin between 4 and 6 months of age  and in no case later than 9 months of age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> At commencement of the study, the weight variation of animals  used should be within 20% of the mean weight for each sex.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Studies using prenatal or neonatal animals may be recommended  under special conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Sex. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Equal numbers of animals of each sex should be used  at each dose level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Females should be nulliparous and nonpregnant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Numbers. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For rodents, at least 40 animals (20 males and 20  females) and for nonrodents at least 8 animals (4 females and 4 males)  should be used at each dose level and concurrent control group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If interim sacrifices are planned, the number should be  increased by the number of animals scheduled to be sacrificed during the  course of the study.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The number of animals at the termination of the study must be  adequate for a meaningful and valid statistical evaluation of chronic  effects. The Agency must be notified if excessive early deaths or other  problems are encountered that might compromise the integrity of the  study.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> To avoid bias, the use of adequate randomization procedures for  the proper allocation of animals to test and control groups is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Each animal should be assigned a unique identification number.  Dead animals, their preserved organs and tissues, and microscopic slides  should be identified by reference to the unique numbers assigned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Husbandry. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Rodents may be group-caged by sex, but the number  of animals per cage must not interfere with clear observation of each  animal. The biological properties of the test substance or toxic effects  (e.g., morbidity, excitability) may indicate a need for individual  caging. Rodents should be housed individually in dermal studies and  during exposure in inhalation studies. Caging should be appropriate to  the nonrodent species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The temperature of the experimental animal rooms should be at 22  3 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The relative humidity of the experimental animal rooms should be  50 20%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Where lighting is artificial, the sequence should be 12 hours  light/12 hours dark.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Control and test animals should be fed from the same batch and  lot. The feed should be analyzed to assure adequacy of nutritional  requirements of the species tested and for impurities that might  influence the outcome of the test. Animals should be fed and watered ad  libitum with food replaced at least weekly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The study should not be initiated until animals have been  allowed a period of acclimatization/quarantine to environmental  conditions, nor should   animals from outside sources be placed on test without an adequate  period of quarantine. An acclimation period of at least 5 days is  recommended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Control and test substances. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Where necessary, the test  substance is dissolved or suspended in a suitable vehicle. If a vehicle  or diluent is needed it should not elicit toxic effects itself nor  substantially alter the chemical or toxicological properties of the test  substance. It is recommended that wherever possible the use of an  aqueous solution be the first choice, followed by consideration of  solution in oil, and finally, solution in other vehicles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> One lot of the test substance should be used, if possible,  throughout the duration of the study, and the research sample should be  stored under conditions that maintain its purity and stability. Prior to  the initiation of the study, there should be a characterization of the  test substance, including the purity of the test compound, and, if  technically feasible, the names and quantities of contaminants and  impurities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the test or control substance is to be incorporated into  feed or another vehicle, the period during which the test substance is  stable in such a mixture should be determined prior to the initiation of  the study. Its homogeneity and concentration should be determined prior  to the initiation of the study and periodically during the study.  Statistically randomized samples of the mixture should be analyzed to  ensure that proper mixing, formulation, and storage procedures are being  followed, and that the appropriate concentration of the test or control  substance is contained in the mixture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Control groups. A concurrent control group is required. This  group should be an untreated or sham-treated control group or, if a  vehicle is used in administering the test substance, a vehicle control  group. If the toxic properties of the vehicle are not known or cannot be  made available, both untreated and vehicle control groups are required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Satellite group. A satellite group of 40 animals (20 animals per  sex) for rodents and 8 animals (4 animals per sex) for nonrodents may be  treated with the high-dose level for 12 months and observed for  reversibility, persistence, or delayed occurrence of toxic effects for a  post-treatment of appropriate length, normally not less than 28 days. In  addition, a control group of 40 animals (20 animals per sex) for rodents  and 8 animals (4 animals per sex) for nonrodents should be added to the  satellite study.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Dose levels and dose selections. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In chronic toxicity tests,  it is desirable to determine a dose-response relationship as well as a  NOEL. Therefore, at least three dose levels with a control group and,  where appropriate, a vehicle control (corresponding to the concentration  of the vehicle at the highest exposure level) should be used. Dose  levels should be spaced to produce a gradation of effects. A rationale  must be provided for the doses selected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The highest-dose level should elicit signs of toxicity without  substantially altering the normal life span of the animal. The highest  dose should be determined based on the findings from a 90-day study to  ensure that the dose used is adequate to assess the chronic toxicity of  the test substance. Thus, the selection of the highest dose to be tested  is dependent upon changes observed in several toxicological parameters  in subchronic studies. The highest dose tested need not exceed 1,000 mg/ kg/day. If dermal application of the test substance produces severe skin  irritation, then it may be necessary either to terminate the study and  choose a lower high-dose level or to reduce the dose level. Gross  criteria for defining severe irritation would include ulcers, fissures,  exudate/crust(eschar), dead tissue, or anything leading to destruction  of the functional integrity of the epidermis (e.g. caking, open sores,  fissuring, eschar). Histological criteria for defining severe irritation  would include follicular and interfollicular crust, microulcer, mild/ moderate degeneration/necrosis, moderate/marked epidermal edema, marked  dermal edema, and marked inflammation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The intermediate dose levels should be spaced to produce a  gradation of toxic effects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The lowest-dose level should produce no evidence of toxicity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Administration of the test substance. The three main routes of  administration are oral, dermal, and inhalation. The choice of the route  of administration depends upon the physical and chemical characteristics  of the test substance and the form typifying exposure in humans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Oral studies. Ideally, the animals should be dosed by gavage or  with capsules on a 7-day per week basis for a period of at least 12  months. However, based primarily on practical considerations, dosing by  gavage or capsules on a 5-day per week schedule is acceptable. If the  test substance is administered via in the drinking water or mixed in the  diet, exposure should be on a 7-day per week basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Dermal studies. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Preparation of animal skin. Shortly before  testing, fur should be clipped from not less than 10% of the body  surface area for application of the test substance. In order to dose  approximately 10% of the body surface, the area starting at the scapulae  (shoulders) to the wing of the ileum (hipbone) and half way down the  flank on each side of the animal should be shaved. Shaving should be  carried out approximately 24 hours before dosing. Repeated clipping or  shaving is usually needed at approximately weekly intervals. When  clipping or shaving the fur, care should be taken to avoid abrading the  skin which could alter its permeability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Preparation of test substance. Liquid test substances are  generally used undiluted, except as indicated in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of  this section. Solids should be pulverized when possible. The substance  should be moistened sufficiently with water or, when necessary, with a  suitable vehicle to ensure good contact with the skin. When a vehicle is  used, the influence of the vehicle on toxicity of, and penetration of  the skin by, the test substance should be taken into account. The volume  of application should be kept constant, e.g., less than 100 [micro]L for  the mouse and less than 300 [micro]L for the rat. Different  concentrations of test solution should be prepared for different dose  levels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Administration of test substance. The duration of exposure  should be at least for 12 months. Ideally, the animals should be treated  with test substance for at least 6 hours per day on a 7-day per week  basis. However, based on practical considerations, application on a 5- day per week basis is acceptable. Dosing should be conducted at  approximately the same time each day. The test substance should be  applied uniformly over the treatment site. The surface area covered may  be less for highly toxic substances. As much of the area should be  covered with as thin and uniform a film as possible. For rats, the test  substance may be held in contact with the skin with a porous gauze  dressing and nonirritating tape if necessary. The test site should be  further covered in a suitable manner to retain the gauze dressing plus  test substance and to ensure that the animals cannot ingest the test  substance. The application site should not be covered when the mouse is  the species of choice. The test substance may be wiped from the skin  after the six-hour exposure period to prevent ingestion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Inhalation studies. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The animals should be exposed to the  test substance for 6 hours per day on a 7-day per week basis, for a  period of at least 12 months. However, based primarily on practical  considerations, exposure for 6 hours per day on a 5-day per week basis  is acceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The animals should be tested in dynamic inhalation equipment  designed to sustain a minimum air flow of 10 air changes per hour, an  adequate oxygen content of at least 19%, and uniform conditions  throughout the exposure chamber. Maintenance of slight negative pressure  inside the chamber will prevent leakage of the test substance into  surrounding areas. It is not normally necessary to measure chamber  oxygen concentration if airflow is adequate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The selection of a dynamic inhalation chamber should be  appropriate for the test substance and test system. When a whole body  chamber is used, individual housing must be used to minimize crowding of  the test animals and maximize their exposure to the test substance. To  ensure stability of a chamber atmosphere, the total volume occupied by  the test animals should not exceed 5% of the volume of the test   chamber. It is recommended, but not required, that nose-only or head- only exposure be used for aerosol studies in order to minimize oral  exposures due to animals licking compound off their fur. The animals  should be acclimated and heat stress minimized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The temperature at which the test is performed should be  maintained at 22 2 [deg]C. The relative humidity  should be maintained between 40-60%, but in certain instances (e.g., use  of water vehicle) this may not be practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The rate of air flow should be monitored continuously but  recorded at least three times during the exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Temperature and humidity should be monitored continuously but  should be recorded at least every 30 min.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> The actual concentrations of the test substance should be  measured in the breathing zone. During the exposure period, the actual  concentrations of the test substance should be held as constant as  practicable, monitored continuously or intermittently depending on the  method of analysis. Chamber concentration may be measured using  gravimetric or analytical methods, as appropriate. If trial run  measurements are reasonably consistent (10% for  liquid aerosol, gas, or vapor; 20% for dry  aerosol), then two measurements should be sufficient. If measurements  are not consistent, three to four measurements should be taken. If there  is some difficulty measuring chamber analytical concentration due to  precipitation, nonhomogeneous mixtures, volatile components, or other  factors, additional analysis of inert components may be necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> During the development of the generating system, particle size  analysis should be performed to establish the stability of aerosol  concentrations with respect to particle size. The mass median  aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) particle size range should be between 1-3  [micro]m. The particle size of hygroscopic materials should be small  enough when dry to assure that the size of the swollen particle will  still be within the 1-3 [micro]m range. Measurements of aerodynamic  particle size in the animal's breathing zone should be measured during a  trial run. If MMAD values for each exposure level are within 10% of each  other, then two measurements during the exposures should be sufficient.  If pretest measurements are not within 10% of each other, three to four  measurements should be taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Feed should be withheld during exposure. Water may also be  withheld during exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Observation period. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Animals should be observed for a period  of at least 12 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Animals in a satellite group (if used) scheduled for follow-up  observations should be kept for at least 28 days further without  treatment to detect recovery from, or persistence of, toxic effects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Observation of animals. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Observations should be made at least  twice each day for morbidity and mortality. Appropriate actions should  be taken to minimize loss of animals to the study (e.g., necropsy or  refrigeration of those animals found dead and isolation or sacrifice of  weak or moribund animals). General clinical observations should be made  at least once a day, preferably at the same time each day, taking into  consideration the peak period of anticipated effects after dosing. The  clinical condition of the animal should be recorded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A careful clinical examination should be made at least once  prior to the initiation of treatment (to allow for within subject  comparisons) and once weekly during treatment in all animals. These  observations should be made outside the home cage, preferably in a  standard arena, and at similar times on each occasion. Effort should be  made to ensure that variations in the observation conditions are  minimal. Observations should be detailed and carefully recorded,  preferably using scoring systems, explicitly defined by the testing  laboratory. Signs noted should include, but not be limited to, changes  in skin, fur, eyes, mucous membranes, occurrence of secretions and  excretions and autonomic activity (e.g., lacrimation, piloerection,  pupil size, unusual respiratory pattern). Changes in gait, posture and  response to handling as well as the presence of clonic or tonic  movements, stereotypies (e.g., excessive   grooming, repetitive circling) or bizarre behavior (e.g., self- mutilation, walking backwards) should be recorded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Once, near the end of the first year of the exposure period  and in any case not earlier than in month 11, assessment of motor  activity, grip strength, and sensory reactivity to stimuli of different  types (e.g., visual, auditory, and proprioceptive stimuli) should be  conducted in rodents. Further details of the procedures that could be  followed are described in the references listed under paragraphs (h)(2),  (h)(7), (h)(8), and (h)(11) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Functional observations conducted towards the end of the study  may be omitted when data on functional observations are available from  other studies and the daily clinical observations did not reveal any  functional deficits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Exceptionally, functional observations may be omitted for groups  that otherwise reveal signs of toxicity to an extent that would  significantly interfere with functional test performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Body weights should be recorded individually for all animals  once prior to the administration of the test substance, once a week  during the first 13 weeks of study and at least once every 4 weeks  thereafter, unless signs of clinical toxicity suggest more frequent  weighing to facilitate monitoring of health status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Measurements of feed consumption should be determined weekly  during the first 13 weeks of the study and at approximately monthly  intervals thereafter unless health status or body weight changes dictate  otherwise. Measurements of water consumption should be determined at the  same intervals if the test substance is administered in the drinking  water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Moribund animals should be removed and sacrificed when  noticed and the time of death should be recorded as precisely as  possible. All survivors should be sacrificed at the end of the study  period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Clinical pathology. Hematology, clinical chemistry, and  urinalysis should be performed on 10 rats per sex per group, and on all  nonrodents. In rodents, the parameters should be examined at  approximately 6 month intervals during the conduct of the study and at  termination. If possible, these collections should be from the same  animals at each interval. In nonrodents, the parameters should be  examined once or twice prior to initiation of treatment, at 6-month  intervals during the conduct of the study, and at termination. If  hematological and biochemical effects were seen in the subchronic study,  testing should also be performed at 3 months. Overnight fasting of  animals prior to blood sampling is recommended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Hematology. The recommended parameters are red blood cell count,  hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean  corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration,  white blood cell count, differential leukocyte count, platelet count,  and a measure of clotting potential, such as prothrombin time or  activated partial thromboplastin time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Clinical chemistry. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Parameters which are considered  appropriate to all studies are electrolyte balance, carbohydrate  metabolism, and liver and kidney function. The selection of specific  tests will be influenced by observations on the mode of action of the  substance and signs of clinical toxicity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The recommended clinical chemistry determinations are potassium,  sodium, calcium (nonrodent), phosphorus (nonrodent), chloride  (nonrodent), glucose, total cholesterol, urea nitrogen, creatinine,  total protein, total bilirubin (nonrodent), and albumin. More than two  hepatic enzymes, (such as alanine aminotransferase, aspartate  aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, or gamma  glutamyl transpeptidase) should also be measured. Measurements of  additional enzymes (of hepatic or other origin) and bile acids, may also  be useful.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If a test chemical has an effect on the hematopoietic system,  reticulocyte counts and bone marrow cytology may be indicated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other determinations that should be carried out if the test  chemical is known or suspected of affecting related measures include  calcium, phosphorus,   fasting triglycerides, hormones, methemoglobin, and cholinesterases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Urinalysis. Urinalysis for rodents should be performed at the  end of the study using timed urine collection. Urinalysis for nonrodents  should be performed prior to treatment, midway through treatment and at  the end of the study using timed urine collection. Urinalysis  determinations include: appearance, volume, osmolality or specific  gravity, pH, protein, glucose, and blood/blood cells.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Ophthalmological examination. Examinations should be made of  all animals using an ophthalmoscope or equivalent device prior to the  administration of the test substance and at termination of the study on  10 rats of each sex in the high-dose and control groups and preferably  in all nonrodents, but at least the control and high-dose groups should  be examined. If changes in eyes are detected, all animals should be  examined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Gross necropsy. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All animals should be subjected to a full  gross necropsy which includes examination of the external surface of the  body, all orifices, and the cranial, thoracic and abdominal cavities and  their contents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At least the liver, kidneys, adrenals, testes, epididymides,  ovaries, uterus, nonrodent thyroid (with parathyroid), spleen, brain,  and heart should be weighed wet as soon as possible after dissection to  avoid drying. The lungs should be weighed if the test substance is  administered by the inhalation route.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The following organs and tissues, or representative samples  thereof, should be preserved in a suitable medium for possible future  histopathological examination:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Digestive system--salivary glands, esophagus, stomach, duodenum,  jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, rectum, liver, pancreas, gallbladder (when  present).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Nervous system--brain (multiple sections, including cerebrum,  cerebellum and medulla/pons), pituitary, peripheral nerve (sciatic or  tibial, preferably in close proximity to the muscle), spinal cord (three  levels, cervical, mid-thoracic and lumbar), eyes (retina, optic nerve).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Glandular system--adrenals, parathyroid, thyroid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Respiratory system--trachea, lungs, pharynx, larynx, nose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Cardiovascular/hematopoietic system--aorta, heart, bone marrow  (and/or fresh aspirate), lymph nodes (preferably one lymph node covering  the route of administration and another one distant from the route of  administration to cover systemic effects), spleen.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Urogenital system--kidneys, urinary bladder, prostate, testes,  epididymides, seminal vesicle(s), uterus, ovaries, female mammary gland.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Other--all gross lesions and masses, skin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In inhalation studies, the entire respiratory tract, including  nose, pharynx, larynx, and paranasal sinuses should be examined and  preserved. In dermal studies, skin from treated and adjacent control  skin sites should be examined and preserved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Inflation of lungs and urinary bladder with a fixative is the  optimal method for preservation of these tissues. The proper inflation  and fixation of the lungs in inhalation studies is considered essential  for appropriate and valid histopathological examination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Information from clinical pathology and other in-life data  should be considered before microscopic examination, since they may  provide significant guidance to the pathologist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Histopathology. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The following histopathology should be  performed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Full histopathology on the organs and tissues (listed under  paragraph (e)(11)(iii) of this section) of all rodents and nonrodents in  the control and high-dose groups, and all rodents and nonrodents that  died or were sacrificed during the study. The examination should be  extended to all animals in all dosage groups if treatment-related  changes are observed in the high-dose group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All gross lesions in all animals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Target tissues in all animals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the results show substantial alteration of the animal's  normal life span, or other effects that might compromise the  significance of the data,   the next lower levels should be examined fully as described in paragraph  (e)(12)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An attempt should be made to correlate gross observations with  microscopic findings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Tissues and organs designated for microscopic examination  should be fixed in 10% buffered formalin or a recognized suitable  fixative as soon as necropsy is performed and no less than 48 hours  prior to trimming.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Data and reporting--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Treatment of results. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Data should be  summarized in tabular form, showing for each test group the number of  animals at the start of the test, the number of animals showing lesions,  the types of lesions and the percentage of animals displaying each type  of lesion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When applicable, all observed results (quantitative and  qualitative) should be evaluated by an appropriate statistical method.  Any generally accepted statistical methods may be used; the statistical  methods including significance criteria should be selected during the  design of the study.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Evaluation of study results. The findings of a chronic toxicity  study should be evaluated in conjunction with the findings of preceding  studies and considered in terms of the toxic effects as well as the  necropsy and histopathological findings. The evaluation will include the  relationship between the dose of the test substance and the presence,  incidence, and severity of abnormalities (including behavioral and  clinical abnormalities), gross lesions, identified target organs, body  weight changes, effects on mortality and any other general or specific  toxic effects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Test report.
