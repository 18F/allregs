                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">SBA will not accept a procurement for award as an 8(a) contract if the circumstances identified in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section exist.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prior intent to award as a small business set-aside, or use the HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, or Women-Owned Small Business programs. The procuring activity issued a solicitation for or otherwise expressed publicly a clear intent to award the contract as a small business set-aside, or to use the HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, or Women-Owned Small Business programs prior to offering the requirement to SBA for award as an 8(a) contract. However, the AA/BD may permit the acceptance of the requirement under extraordinary circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Competition prior to offer and acceptance. The procuring activity competed a requirement among Participants prior to offering the requirement to SBA and receiving SBA's formal acceptance of the requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any competition conducted without first obtaining SBA's formal acceptance of the procurement for the 8(a) BD program will not be considered an 8(a) competitive requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> SBA may accept the requirement for the 8(a) BD program as a competitive 8(a) requirement, but only if the procuring activity agrees to resolicit the requirement using appropriate competitive 8(a) procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Adverse impact. SBA has made a written determination that acceptance of the procurement for 8(a) award would have an adverse impact on an individual small business, a group of small businesses located in a specific geographical location, or other small business programs. The adverse impact concept is designed to protect small business concerns which are performing Government contracts awarded outside the 8(a) BD program, and does not apply to follow-on or renewal 8(a) acquisitions. SBA will not consider adverse impact with respect to any requirement offered to the 8(a) program under Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In determining whether the acceptance of a requirement would have an adverse impact on an individual small business, SBA will consider all relevant factors.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In connection with a specific small business, SBA presumes adverse impact to exist where:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The small business concern has performed the specific requirement for at least 24 months;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The small business is performing the requirement at the time it is offered to the 8(a) BD program, or its performance of the requirement ended within 30 days of the procuring activity's offer of the requirement to the 8(a) BD program; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The dollar value of the requirement that the small business is or was performing is 25 percent or more of its most recent annual gross sales (including those of its affiliates). For a multi-year requirement, the dollar value of

the last 12 months of the requirement will be used to determine whether a small business would be adversely affected by SBA's acceptance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, adverse impact does not apply to ``new'' requirements. A new requirement is one which has not been previously procured by the relevant procuring activity.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Where a requirement is new, no small business could have previously performed the requirement and, thus, SBA's acceptance of the requirement for the 8(a) BD program will not adversely impact any small business.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Construction contracts, by their very nature (e.g., the building of a specific structure), are deemed new requirements.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The expansion or modification of an existing requirement will be considered a new requirement where the magnitude of change is significant enough to cause a price adjustment of at least 25 percent (adjusted for inflation) or to require significant additional or different types of capabilities or work.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> SBA need not perform an impact determination where a new requirement is offered to the 8(a) BD program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In determining whether the acceptance of a requirement would have an adverse impact on a group of small businesses, SBA will consider the effects of combining or consolidating various requirements being performed by two or more small business concerns into a single contract which would be considered a ``new'' requirement as compared to any of the previous smaller requirements. SBA may find adverse impact to exist if one of the existing small business contractors meets the presumption set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In determining whether the acceptance of a requirement would have an adverse impact on other small business programs, SBA will consider all relevant factors, including but not limited to, the number and value of contracts in the subject industry in the 8(a) BD program as compared with other small business programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Release for non-8(a) competition. (1) Except as set forth in (d)(4) of this section, where a procurement is awarded as an 8(a) contract, its follow-on or renewable acquisition must remain in the 8(a) BD program unless SBA agrees to release it for non-8(a) competition. If a procuring agency would like to fulfill a follow-on or renewable acquisition outside of the 8(a) BD program, it must make a written request to and receive the concurrence of the AA/BD to do so. In determining whether to release a requirement from the 8(a) BD program, SBA will consider:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as set forth in (d)(4) of this section, where a procurement is awarded as an 8(a) contract, its follow-on or renewable acquisition must remain in the 8(a) BD program unless SBA agrees to release it for non-8(a) competition. If a procuring agency would like to fulfill a follow-on or renewable acquisition outside of the 8(a) BD program, it must make a written request to and receive the concurrence of the AA/BD to do so. In determining whether to release a requirement from the 8(a) BD program, SBA will consider:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the agency has achieved its SDB goal;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where the agency is in achieving its HUBZone, SDVO, WOSB, or small business goal, as appropriate; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether the requirement is critical to the business development of the 8(a) Participant that is currently performing it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> SBA may decline to accept the offer of a follow-on or renewable 8(a) acquisition in order to give a concern previously awarded the contract that is leaving or has left the 8(a) BD program the opportunity to compete for the requirement outside of the 8(a) BD program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> SBA will consider release under paragraph (2) only where:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The procurement awarded through the 8(a) BD program is being or was performed by either a Participant whose program term will expire prior to contract completion, or by a former Participant whose program term expired within one year of the date of the offering letter;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The concern requests in writing that SBA decline to accept the offer prior to SBA's acceptance of the requirement for award as an 8(a) contract; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The concern qualifies as a small business for the requirement now offered to the 8(a) BD program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In considering release under paragraph (2), SBA will balance the importance of the requirement to the concern's business development needs against the business development needs of other Participants that are qualified to perform the requirement. This determination will include consideration of whether rejection of the requirement would seriously reduce the pool of similar types of contracts available for award as 8(a) contracts. SBA will also seek the views of the procuring agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> SBA will release a requirement under this paragraph only where the procuring activity agrees to procure the requirement as a small business, HUBZone, SDVO small business, or WOSB set-aside.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The requirement that a follow-on procurement must be released from the 8(a) BD program in order for it to be fulfilled outside the 8(a) BD program does not apply to orders offered to and accepted for the 8(a) BD program pursuant to Sec. 124.503(h).
