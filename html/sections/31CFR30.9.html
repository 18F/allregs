                                Sec. 30.9  Q-9: What actions are necessary for a TARP recipient to comply  (the prohibition on golden parachute payments)?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prohibition on golden parachute payments. To comply with the  standards established under section 111(b)(3)(C) of EESA, a TARP  recipient must prohibit any golden parachute payment to a SEO and any of  the next five most highly compensated employees during the TARP period.  A golden parachute payment is treated as paid at the time of departure  and is equal to the aggregate present value of all payments made for a  departure. Thus, a golden parachute payment during the TARP period may  include a right to amounts actually payable after the TARP period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  paragraph (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Employee A is a SEO of a TARP recipient. Employee A is  entitled to a payment of three times his annual compensation upon an  involuntary termination of employment or voluntary termination of  employment for good reason, but such amount is not payable unless and  until the TARP period expires with respect to TARP recipient. Employee A  terminates employment during the TARP period. Because, for purposes of  the prohibition on golden parachute payments, the payment is made at the  time of departure, Employee A may not obtain the right to the payment  upon the termination of employment.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Employee B involuntarily terminated employment on July 1,  2008, at which time Employee B was a SEO of a financial institution.  Employee B's employment agreement provided that if Employee B were  involuntarily terminated or voluntarily terminated employment for good  reason, Employee B would be entitled to a series of five equal annual  payments. After the first payment, but before any subsequent payment,  the entity became a TARP recipient. Because, for purposes of the  prohibition on golden parachute payments, all of the five payments are  deemed to have occurred at termination of employment and because, in  this case, termination of employment occurred before the beginning of  the applicable TARP period, the payment of the four remaining payments  due under the agreement   will not violate the requirements of this section.</p>
