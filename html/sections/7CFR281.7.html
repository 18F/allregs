FNS shall examine the relevant factors specified in Sec. 281.3(b)(1) and shall follow the notification and determination procedures set forth in Sec. 281.3 (c) and (d). If ITO failure is determined, FNS shall require the appropriate agency of the State government to resume administration of the Program on the reservation in accordance with an approved termination and transition arrangement.</p>
