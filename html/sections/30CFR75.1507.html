                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Emergency Response Plan (ERP) shall include the following  for each refuge alternative and component:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The types of refuge alternatives used in the mine, i.e., a  prefabricated self-contained unit or a unit consisting of 15 psi  stoppings constructed prior to an event in a secure space and an  isolated atmosphere.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedures or methods for maintaining approved refuge  alternatives and components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The rated capacity of each refuge alternative, the number of  persons expected to use each refuge alternative, and the duration of  breathable air provided per person by the approved breathable air  component of each refuge alternative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The methods for providing breathable air with sufficient detail  of the component's capability to provide breathable air over the  duration stated in the approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The methods for providing ready backup oxygen controls and  regulators.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The methods for providing an airlock and for providing  breathable air in the airlock, except where adequate positive pressure  is maintained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The methods for providing sanitation facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The methods for harmful gas removal, if necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The methods for monitoring gas concentrations, including  charging and calibration of equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The method for providing lighting sufficient for persons to  perform tasks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Suitable locations for the refuge alternatives and an  affirmative statement that the locations are--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Not within direct line of sight of the working face; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where feasible, not placed in areas directly across from, nor  closer than 500 feet radially from, belt drives, take-ups, transfer  points, air compressors, explosive magazines, seals, entrances to  abandoned areas, and fuel, oil, or other flammable or combustible  material storage. However, the operator may request and the District  Manager may approve an alternative location in the ERP if mining  involves two-entry systems or yield pillars in a longwall that would  prohibit locating the refuge alternative out of direct line of sight of  the working face.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> The maximum mine air temperature at each of the locations where  refuge alternatives are to be placed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For a refuge alternative consisting of 15 psi stoppings  constructed prior to an event in a secure space and an isolated  atmosphere, the ERP shall specify that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The breathable air components shall be approved by MSHA; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The refuge alternative can withstand exposure to a flash fire of  300 degrees Fahrenheit ([deg]F) for 3 seconds and a pressure wave of 15  pounds per square inch (psi) overpressure for 0.2 seconds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the refuge alternative sustains persons for only 48 hours,  the ERP shall detail advanced arrangements that have been made to assure  that persons who cannot be rescued within   48 hours will receive additional supplies to sustain them until rescue.  Advance arrangements shall include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pre-surveyed areas for refuge alternatives with closure errors  of less than 20,000:1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An analysis to demonstrate that the surface terrain, the strata,  the capabilities of the drill rig, and all other factors that could  affect drilling are such that a hole sufficient to provide required  supplies and materials reliably can be promptly drilled within 48 hours  of an accident at a mine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Permissions to cross properties, build roads, and construct  drill sites.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Arrangement with a drilling contractor or other supplier of  drilling services to provide a suitable drilling rig, personnel and  support so that a hole can be completed to the refuge alternative within  48 hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Capability to promptly transport a drill rig to a pre-surveyed  location such that a drilled hole would be completed and located near a  refuge alternative structure within 48 hours of an accident at a mine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The specifications of pipes, air lines, and approved fans or  approved compressors that will be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A method for assuring that within 48 hours, breathable air shall  be provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A method for assuring the immediate availability of a backup  source for supplying breathable air and a backup power source for  surface installations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The ERP shall specify that the refuge alternative is stocked  with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A minimum of 2,000 calories of food and 2.25 quarts of potable  water per person per day in approved containers sufficient to sustain  the maximum number of persons reasonably expected to use the refuge  alternative for at least 96 hours, or for 48 hours if advance  arrangements are made under paragraph (c) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A manual that contains sufficient detail for each refuge  alternative or component addressing in-mine transportation, operation,  and maintenance of the unit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sufficient quantities of materials and tools to repair  components; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> First aid supplies.
