                                Sec. 460.9  What test records you must keep.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Manufacturers and testing labs must keep records of each item of information in the ``Report'' section of the ASTM test method that is used for a test. They must also keep the following records:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The name and address of the testing lab that did each test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The date of each test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For manufacturers, the date each test report was received from a lab. For labs, the date each test report was sent to a manufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For extruded polystyrene, polyurethane, and polyisocyanurate, the age (in days) of the specimen that was tested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For aluminum foil, the emissivity level that was found in the test.
Manufacturers who own their own testing labs need not keep records of the information in paragraph (c) of this section.
Keep these records for at least three years. If the documents show proof for your claims, the three years will begin again each time you make the claim. Federal Trade Commission staff members can check these records at any time, but they must give you reasonable notice first.</p>
