                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this subpart and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, the responsible Department official may suspend or terminate, or refuse to grant or continue, Federal financial assistance, or use any other means authorized by law, to induce compliance with this subpart. Such other means include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appropriate proceedings brought by the Department to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any applicable proceeding under State or local law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Noncompliance with assurance requirement. If an applicant or recipient fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under Sec.  42.105, or fails or refuses to comply with the provisions of the assurance it has furnished, or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with any requirement imposed by or pursuant to title VI or this subpart, Federal financial assistance may be suspended, terminated, or refused in accordance with the procedures of title VI and this subpart. The Department shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of administrative proceedings under this subpart, except that the Department will continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings whenever such assistance is due and payable pursuant to a final commitment made or an application finally approved prior to the effective date of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance. No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The responsible Department official has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this subpart,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The action has been approved by the Attorney General pursuant to Sec.  42.110, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The expiration of 30 days after the Attorney General has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action.
Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The responsible Department official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The action has been approved by the Attorney General, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance.</p>
