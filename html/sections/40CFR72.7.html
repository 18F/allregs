                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. This section applies to any new utility unit that  has not previously lost an exemption under paragraph (f)(4) of this  section and that, in each year starting with the first year for which  the unit is to be exempt under this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Serves during the entire year (except for any period before the  unit commenced commercial operation) one or more generators with total  nameplate capacity of 25 MWe or less;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Burns fuel that does not include any coal or coal-derived fuel  (except coal-derived gaseous fuel with a total sulfur content no greater  than natural gas); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Burns gaseous fuel with an annual average sulfur content of 0.05  percent or less by weight (as determined under paragraph (d) of this  section) and nongaseous fuel with an annual average sulfur content of  0.05 percent or less by weight (as determined under paragraph (d) of  this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any new utility unit that meets the requirements of paragraph  (a) of this section and that is not allocated any allowances under  subpart B of part 73 of this chapter shall be exempt from the Acid Rain  Program, except for the provisions of this section, Sec. Sec. 72.2  through 72.6, and Sec. Sec. 72.10 through 72.13.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The exemption under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be  effective on January 1 of the first full calendar year for which the  unit meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. By  December 31 of the first year for which the unit is to be exempt under  this section, a statement signed by the designated representative  (authorized in accordance with subpart B of this part) or, if no  designated representative has been authorized, a certifying official of  each owner of the unit shall be submitted to permitting authority  otherwise responsible for administering a Phase II Acid Rain permit for  the unit. If the Administrator is not the permitting authority, a copy  of the statement shall be submitted to the Administrator. The statement,  which shall be in a format prescribed by the Administrator, shall  identify the unit, state the nameplate capacity of each generator served  by the unit and the fuels currently burned or expected to be burned by  the unit and their sulfur content by weight, and state that the owners  and operators of the unit will comply with paragraph (f) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After receipt of the statement under paragraph (b)(2) of this  section, the permitting authority shall amend under Sec. 72.83 the  operating permit covering the source at which the unit is located, if  the source has such a permit, to add the provisions and requirements of  the exemption under paragraphs (a), (b)(1), (d), and (f) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any new utility unit that meets the requirements of paragraph  (a) of this section and that is allocated one or more allowances under  subpart B of part 73 of this chapter shall be exempt from the Acid Rain  Program, except for the provisions of this section, Sec. Sec. 72.2  through 72.6, and Sec. Sec. 72.10 through 72.13, if each of the  following requirements are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The designated representative (authorized in accordance with  subpart B of this part) or, if no designated representative has been  authorized, a certifying official of each owner of the unit submits to  the permitting authority otherwise responsible for administering a Phase  II Acid Rain permit for the unit a statement (in a format prescribed by  the Administrator) that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Identifies the unit and states the nameplate capacity of each  generator served by the unit and the fuels currently burned or expected  to be burned by the unit and their sulfur content by weight;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> States that the owners and operators of the unit will comply  with paragraph (f) of this section;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Surrenders allowances equal in number to, and with the same or  earlier compliance use date as, all of those allocated to the unit under  subpart B of part 73 of this chapter for the first year that the unit is  to be exempt under this section and for each subsequent year; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Surrenders any proceeds for allowances under paragraph  (c)(1)(i)(C) or this section withheld from the unit   under Sec. 73.10 of this chapter. If the Administrator is not the  permitting authority, a copy of the statement shall be submitted to the  Administrator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Administrator deducts from the compliance account of the  source that includes the unit allowances under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of  this section and receives proceeds under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(D) of this  section. Within 5 business days of receiving a statement in accordance  with paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the Administrator shall either  deduct the allowances under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section or  notify the owners and operators that there are insufficient allowances  to make such deductions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The exemption under paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be  effective on January 1 of the first full calendar year for which the  requirements of paragraphs (a) and (c)(1) of this section are met. After  notification by the Administrator under the third sentence of paragraph  (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the permitting authority shall amend under  Sec. 72.83 the operating permit covering the source at which the unit is  located, if the source has such a permit, to add the provisions and  requirements of the exemption under paragraphs (a), (c)(1), (d), and (f)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Compliance with the requirement that fuel burned during the year  have an annual average sulfur content of 0.05 percent by weight or less  shall be determined as follows using a method of determining sulfur  content that provides information with reasonable precision,  reliability, accessibility, and timeliness:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For gaseous fuel burned during the year, if natural gas is the  only gaseous fuel burned, the requirement is assumed to be met;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For gaseous fuel burned during the year where other gas in  addition to or besides natural gas is burned, the requirement is met if  the annual average sulfur content is equal to or less than 0.05 percent  by weight. The annual average sulfur content, as a percentage by weight,  for the gaseous fuel burned shall be calculated as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR24OC97.001  where:  %Sannual = annual average sulfur content of the fuel burned</p><p class="depth3">during the year by the unit, as a percentage by weight; %Sn = sulfur content of the nth sample of the fuel delivered</p><p class="depth3">during the year to the unit, as a percentage by weight; Vn = volume of the fuel in a delivery during the year to the</p><p class="depth3">unit of which the nth sample is taken, in standard cubic feet;</p><p class="depth3">or, for fuel delivered during the year to the unit</p><p class="depth3">continuously by pipeline, volume of the fuel delivered</p><p class="depth3">starting from when the nth sample of such fuel is taken until</p><p class="depth3">the next sample of such fuel is taken, in standard cubic feet; dn = density of the nth sample of the fuel delivered during</p><p class="depth3">the year to the unit, in lb per standard cubic foot; and n = each sample taken of the fuel delivered during the year to the unit,</p><p class="depth3">taken at least once for each delivery; or, for fuel that is</p><p class="depth3">delivered during the year to the unit continuously by</p><p class="depth3">pipeline, at least once each quarter during which the fuel is</p><p class="depth3">delivered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For nongaseous fuel burned during the year, the requirement is  met if the annual average sulfur content is equal to or less than 0.05  percent by weight. The annual average sulfur content, as a percentage by  weight, shall be calculated using the equation in paragraph (d)(2) of  this section. In lieu of the factor, volume times density (Vn  dn), in the equation, the factor, mass (Mn), may  be used, where Mn is: mass of the nongaseous fuel in a  delivery during the year to the unit of which the nth sample is taken,  in lb; or, for fuel delivered during the year to the unit continuously  by pipeline, mass of the nongaseous fuel delivered starting from when  the nth sample of such fuel is taken until the next sample of such fuel  is taken, in lb.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and paragraphs  (a), (d), (e)(2), and (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a utility unit under paragraph (e)(1) of this section is  allocated one or more allowances under subpart B of part 73 of this  chapter, the designated representative (authorized in accordance with  subpart B of this part) or, if no designated representative has been  authorized, a certifying official of each owner of the unit shall submit  to the permitting authority that issued the written exemption a  statement (in a format prescribed by the Administrator) meeting the  requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) and (D) of this section.
