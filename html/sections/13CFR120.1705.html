                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initiation of Pool formation. Only an entity approved by SBA to  be a Pool Originator under the Program that continues to qualify to be a  Pool Originator pursuant to this subpart may initiate the formation of a  Pool. The Pool Originator creates the Pool subject to Program Rules and  Regulations, including the parameters set forth in the Guide, and SBA  approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adjustment of Pool requirements. SBA may adjust the Pool  characteristics periodically based on program experience and market  conditions and will publish a revised version of the Guide in the  Federal Register to implement such adjustments. Any such adjustments  shall not affect Pools formed prior to the adjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When the Pool Originator is the Seller. When a Pool Originator  proposes to form a Pool involving a Pool Loan it owns, it must execute  the First Lien Position 504 Loan Pool Guarantee Agreement as Pool  Originator and as Seller and, consequently, will be subject to all  applicable Program Rules and Regulations pertaining to both roles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When the Pool Originator does not own the Pool Loan. When a Pool  Originator proposes to form a Pool involving a Pool Loan it does not  own, it must purchase the Loan Interest it proposes to pool from a  Seller that owns the whole Pool Loan and that has the servicing rights.  The Pool Originator must purchase the Loan Interest and take it into  inventory or settle the purchase of the Loan Interest through the CSA  concurrently with the formation of the Pool. The entity selling the Loan  Interest to the Pool Originator must execute the First Lien Position 504  Loan Pool Guarantee Agreement as Seller and, consequently, will be  subject to all applicable Program Rules and Regulations pertaining to a  Seller. The Pool Originator must also execute the First Lien Position  504 Loan Pool Guaranty Agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> What CSA must receive prior to Pool formation. Before the CSA  may carry out its responsibilities relating to the formation of a Pool,  it must receive:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From the Pool Originator: A properly completed First Lien  Position 504 Loan Pool application form, First Lien Position 504 Loan  Guarantee Agreement, and any other documentation which SBA may require,  if applicable; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All cost reimbursement due and payable to the CSA prior to Pool  formation owed by the Participants participating in the formation of the  Pool.</p>
