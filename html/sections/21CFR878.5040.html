                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A suction lipoplasty system is a device intended  for aesthetic body contouring. The device consists of a powered suction  pump (containing a microbial filter on the exhaust and a microbial in- line filter in the connecting tubing between the collection bottle and  the safety trap), collection bottle, cannula, and connecting tube. The  microbial filters, tubing, collection bottle, and cannula must be  capable of being changed between patients. The powered suction pump has  a motor with a minimum of \1/3\ horsepower, a variable vacuum range from  0 to 29.9 inches of mercury, vacuum control valves to regulate the  vacuum with accompanying vacuum gauges, a single or double rotary vane  (with or without oil), a single or double diaphragm, a single or double  piston, and a safety trap.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification.
