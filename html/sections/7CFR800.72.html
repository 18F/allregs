                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When transportation of the service representative to the service location (at other than a specified duty point) is more than 25 miles from an FGIS office, the actual transportation cost in addition to the applicable hourly rate for each service representative will be assessed from the FGIS office to the service point and return. When commercial modes of transportation (e.g., airplanes) are required, the actual expense incurred for the round-trip travel will be assessed. When services are provided to more than one applicant, the travel and other related charges will be prorated between applicants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to a 2-hour minimum charge for service on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, an additional charge will be assessed when the revenue from the services in Sec. 800.71, schedule A, table 2, does not equal or exceed what would have been collected at the applicable hourly rate. The additional charge will be the difference between the actual unit fee revenue and the hourly fee revenue. Hours accrued

for travel and standby time shall apply in determining the hours for the minimum fee.
