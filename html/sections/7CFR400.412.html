                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> FCIC or the insurance provider will retain all records of  policyholders for a period of not less than 3 years from the date of  final action on a policy for the crop year, unless further maintenance  of specific records is requested by FCIC. Final actions on insurance  policies include conclusion of insurance events, such as the latest of  termination of the policy, completion of loss adjustment, or  satisfaction of claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The statute of limitations for FCIC contract claims may permit  litigation to be instituted after the period of record retention.  Destruction of records prior to the expiration of the statute of  limitations will not provide a defense to any action by FCIC against any  private insurance company.
