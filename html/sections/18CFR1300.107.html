When any of the following exemptions applies only to a limited range of official actions, rather than all official acts, the range of actions will be specified within the language of the exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An investment in a business enterprise in the form of ownership of bonds, notes, and other evidences of indebtness which are not convertible into shares of preferred or common stock and have no warrants attached entitling the holder to purchase stock provided that the estimated market value of the interest does not exceed $5,000;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An investment in the form of shares in the ownership of enterprises, including preferred and common stocks whether voting or nonvoting, or warrants to purchase such shares, or evidences of indebtedness convertible into such shares provided that the estimated market value of the interest does not exceed $5,000 and does not exceed 1 percent of the estimated market value of all the outstanding shares of the enterprise;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Shares or investments in a well-diversified money market or mutual fund;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Vested interests in a pension fund arising out of former employment and to which no further contributions are being made in the employee's behalf, provided that, if the pension plan is a defined benefit plan, the assets of the plan are diversified. For the purpose of this provision, payments are not considered to be made ``in the employee's behalf'' if they are made solely to maintain adequate plan funding rather than to provide specific benefits for the employee; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The interest an employee has by virtue of his or her personal or family use of electric power or through his or her interests in an organization using electric power generated or distributed by TVA, for purposes of his or her official actions at TVA in the process of developing or approving TVA power rate schedules.</p>
