                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Incumbents. A public filer as defined in Sec. 2634.202 of this subpart who, during any calendar year, performs the duties of his position or office, as described in that section, for a period in excess of 60 days shall file a public financial disclosure report containing the information prescribed in subpart C of this part, on or before May 15 of the succeeding year.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. An SES official commences performing the duties of his position on November 15. He will not be required to file an incumbent report for that calendar year.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. An employee, who is classified at GS-15, is assigned to fill an SES position in an acting capacity, from October 15 through December 31. Having performed the duties of a covered position for more than 60 days during the calendar year, he will be required to file an incumbent report. In addition, he must file a new entrant report the first time he serves more than 60 days in a calendar year in the position, in accordance with Sec. 2634.201(b) and Sec. 2634.204(c)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> New entrants. (1) Within 30 days of assuming a public filer position or office described in Sec. 2634.202 of this subpart, an individual shall file a public financial disclosure report containing the information prescribed in subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within 30 days of assuming a public filer position or office described in Sec. 2634.202 of this subpart, an individual shall file a public financial disclosure report containing the information prescribed in subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> However, no report shall be required if the individual:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has, within 30 days prior to assuming such position, left another position or office for which a public financial disclosure report under the Act was required to be filed; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has already filed such a report as a nominee or candidate for the position.</p><p class="depth4">Example: Y, an employee of the Treasury Department who has previously filed reports in accordance with the rules of this section, terminates employment with that Department on January 12, 1991, and begins employment with the Commerce Department on February 10, 1991, in a Senior Executive Service position. Y is not a new entrant since he has assumed a position described in Sec. 2634.202 of this subpart within thirty days of leaving another position so described. Accordingly, he need not file a new report with the Commerce Department.</p><p class="depth4">Note: While Y did not have to file a new entrant report with the Commerce Department, that Department should request a copy of the last report which he filed with the Treasury Department, so that Commerce could determine whether or not there would be any conflicts or potential conflicts in connection with Y's new employment. Additionally, Y will have to file an incumbent report covering the 1990 calendar year, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, due not later than May 15, 1991, with Commerce, which should provide a copy to Treasury so that both may review it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nominees. (1) At any time after a public announcement by the President or President-elect of his intention to nominate an individual to an executive branch position, appointment to which requires the advice and consent of the Senate, such individual may, and in any event within five days after the transmittal of the nomination to the Senate shall, file a public financial disclosure report containing the information prescribed in subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At any time after a public announcement by the President or President-elect of his intention to nominate an individual to an executive branch position, appointment to which requires the advice and consent of the Senate, such individual may, and in any event within five days after the transmittal of the nomination to the Senate shall, file a public financial disclosure report containing the information prescribed in subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This requirement shall not apply to any individual who is nominated to a position as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An officer of the uniformed services; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A Foreign Service Officer.</p><p class="depth4">Note: Although the statute, 5 U.S.C. app. (Ethics in Government Act of 1978, section 101(b)(1)), exempts uniformed service officers only if they are nominated for appointment to a grade or rank for which the pay grade is 0-6 or below, the Senate confirmation committees have adopted a practice of exempting all uniformed service officers, unless otherwise specified by the committee assigned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Section 2634.605(c) provides expedited procedures in the case of individuals described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Those individuals referred to in paragraph (c)(2) of this section as being exempt from filing nominee reports shall file new entrant reports, if required by paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Candidates. A candidate (as defined in section 301 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, 2 U.S.C. 431) for nomination or election to the office of President or Vice President (other than an incumbent) shall file a public financial disclosure report containing the information prescribed in subpart C of this part, in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within 30 days of becoming a candidate or on or before May 15 of the calendar year in which the individual becomes a candidate, whichever is later, but in no event later than 30 days before the election; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On or before May 15 of each successive year an individual continues to be a candidate. However, in any calendar year in which an individual continues to be a candidate but all elections relating to such candidacy were held in prior calendar years, the individual need not file a report unless he becomes a candidate for a vacancy during that year.</p><p class="depth3">Example: P became a candidate for President in January 1991. P will be required to file a public financial disclosure report on or before May 15, 1991. If P had become a candidate on June 1, 1991, he would have been required to file a disclosure report within 30 days of that date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Termination of employment. (1) On or before the thirtieth day after termination of employment from a public filer position or office described in Sec. 2634.202 of this subpart, an individual shall file a public financial disclosure report containing the information prescribed in subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On or before the thirtieth day after termination of employment from a public filer position or office described in Sec. 2634.202 of this subpart, an individual shall file a public financial disclosure report containing the information prescribed in subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> However, if within 30 days of such termination the individual assumes employment in another position or office for which a public report under the Act is required to be filed, no report shall be required by the provisions of

this paragraph. See the related Example in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Extensions. The reviewing official may, for good cause shown, grant to any public filer or class thereof an extension of time for filing which shall not exceed 45 days. The reviewing official may, for good cause shown, grant an additional extension of time which shall not exceed 45 days. The employee shall set forth in writing specific reasons why such additional extension of time is necessary. The reviewing official must approve or deny such requests in writing. Such records shall be maintained as part of the official report file. (For extensions on confidential financial disclosure reports, see Sec. 2634.903(d).)
