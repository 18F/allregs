                            <p class="depth0">In some cases an agreement provides for compensation for hours spent  in certain types of activities which would not be regarded as working  time under the Act if no compensation were provided. Preliminary and  postliminary activities and time spent in eating meals between working  hours fall in this category. The agreement of the parties to provide  compensation for such hours may or may not convert them into hours  worked, depending on whether or not it appears from all the pertinent  facts that the parties have agreed to treat such time as hours worked.  Except for certain activity governed by the Portal-to-Portal Act (see  paragraph (b) of this section), the agreement of the parties will be  respected, if reasonable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of the Act will be considered to be met where overtime compensation  at one and one-half times such rate is paid for the hours so compensated  in the workweek which are in excess of the statutory maximum.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Parties have agreed not to treat time as hours worked. Under the  principles set forth in Sec. 778.319, where the payments are made for  time spent in an activity which, if compensable under contract, custom,  or practice, is required to be counted as hours worked under the Act by  virtue of Section 4 of the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 (see parts 785  and 790 of this chapter), no agreement by the parties to exclude such  compensable time from hours worked would be valid. On the other hand, in  the case of time spent in activity which would not be hours worked under  the Act if not compensated and would not become hours worked under the  Portal-to-Portal Act even if made compensable by contract, custom, or  practice, the parties may reasonably agree that the time will not be  counted as hours worked. Activities of this type include eating meals  between working hours. Where it appears from all the pertinent facts  that the parties have agreed to exclude such activities from hours  worked, payments for such time will be regarded as qualifying for  exclusion from the regular rate under the provisions of section 7(e)(2),  as explained in Sec. Sec. 778.216 to 778.224. The payments for such  hours cannot, of course, qualify as overtime premiums creditable toward  overtime compensation under section 7(h) of the Act.
