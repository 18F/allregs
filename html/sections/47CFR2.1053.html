                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Measurements shall be made to detect spurious emissions that may  be radiated directly from the cabinet, control circuits, power leads, or  intermediate circuit elements under normal conditions of installation  and operation. Curves or equivalent data shall be supplied showing the  magnitude of each harmonic and other spurious emission. For this test,  single sideband, independent sideband, and controlled carrier  transmitters shall be modulated under the conditions specified in  paragraph (c) of Sec. 2.1049, as appropriate. For equipment operating on  frequencies below 890 MHz, an open field test is normally required, with  the measuring instrument antenna located in the far-field at all test  frequencies. In the event it is either impractical or impossible to make  open field measurements (e.g. a broadcast transmitter installed in a  building) measurements will be accepted of the equipment as installed.  Such measurements must be accompanied by a description of the site where  the measurements were made showing the location of any possible source  of reflections which might distort the field strength measurements.  Information submitted shall include the relative radiated power of each  spurious emission with reference to the rated power output of the  transmitter, assuming all emissions are radiated from halfwave dipole  antennas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The measurements specified in paragraph (a) of this section  shall be made for the following equipment:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Those in which the spurious emissions are required to be 60 dB  or more below the mean power of the transmitter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All equipment operating on frequencies higher than 25 MHz.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All equipment where the antenna is an integral part of, and  attached directly to the transmitter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other types of equipment as required, when deemed necessary by  the Commission.
