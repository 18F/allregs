                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the contracting officer is aware that contract performance  involves classes of service employees not included in the wage  determination, the contracting officer shall require the contractor to  classify the unlisted classes so as to provide a reasonable relationship  (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between the unlisted  classifications and the classifications listed in the determination (see  paragraph (c) of the clause at 52.222-41, Service Contract Labor  Standards). The contractor shall initiate the conforming procedure  before unlisted classes of employees perform contract work. The  contractor shall submit Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request For  Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate. The contracting  officer shall review the proposed classification and rate and promptly  submit the completed SF 1444 (which must include information regarding  the agreement or disagreement of the employees' representative or the  employees themselves together with the agency recommendation) and all  other pertinent information to the Wage and Hour Division. Within 30  days of receipt of the request, the Wage and Hour Division will (1)  approve, modify, or disapprove the request when the parties are in  agreement or (2) render a final determination in the event of  disagreement among the parties. If the Wage and Hour Division will  require more than 30 days to take action, it will notify the contracting  officer within 30 days of receipt of the request that additional time is  necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Some wage determinations will list a series of classes within a  job classification family, for example, Computer Operators, level I, II,  and III, or Electronic Technicians, level I, II, and III, or Clerk  Typist, level I and II. Generally, level I is the lowest level. It is  the entry level, and establishment of a lower level through conformance  is not permissible. Further, trainee classifications may not be  conformed. Helpers in skilled maintenance trades (for example,  electricians, machinists, and automobile mechanics) whose duties  constitute, in fact, separate and distinct jobs may also be used if  listed on the wage determination, but may not be conformed. Conformance  may not be used to artificially split or subdivide classifications  listed in the wage determination. However, conforming procedures may be  used if the work which an employee performs under the contract is not  within the scope of any classification listed on the wage determination,  regardless of job title. (See 29 CFR 4.152.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Subminimum rates for apprentices, student learners, and disabled  workers are permissible in accordance with paragraph (q) of the clause  at 52.222-41, Service Contract Labor Standards.
