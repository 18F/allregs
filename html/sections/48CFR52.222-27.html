                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 22.810(f), insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Affirmative Action Compliance Requirements for Construction (APR 2015)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. As used in this clause--</p><p class="depth0">Covered area means the geographical area described in the  solicitation for this contract.</p><p class="depth0">Deputy Assistant Secretary means the Deputy Assistant Secretary for  the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, U.S. Department of  Labor, or a designee.</p><p class="depth0">Employer identification number means the Federal Social Security  number used on the employer's quarterly Federal tax return, U.S.  Treasury Department Form 941.</p><p class="depth0">Gender identity has the meaning given by the Department of Labor's  Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, and is found at  www.dol.gov/ofccp/LGBT/LGBT--FAQs.html.</p><p class="depth0">Minority means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> American Indian or Alaskan Native (all persons having origins in  any of the original peoples of North America and maintaining  identifiable tribal affiliations through membership and participation or  community identification).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Asian and Pacific Islander (all persons having origins in any of  the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the Indian  Subcontinent, or the Pacific Islands);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Black (all persons having origins in any of the black African  racial groups not of Hispanic origin); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Hispanic (all persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central  or South American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of  race).</p><p class="depth0">Sexual orientation has the meaning given by the Department of  Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, and is found at  www.dol.gov/ofccp/LGBT/LGBT--FAQs.html.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the Contractor, or a subcontractor at any tier, subcontracts  a portion of the work involving any construction trade, each such  subcontract in excess of $10,000 shall include this clause and the  Notice containing the   goals for minority and female participation stated in the solicitation  for this contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If the Contractor is participating in a Hometown Plan (41 CFR  60-4) approved by the U.S. Department of Labor in a covered area, either  individually or through an association, its affirmative action  obligations on all work in the plan area (including goals) shall comply  with the plan for those trades that have unions participating in the  plan. Contractors must be able to demonstrate participation in, and  compliance with, the provisions of the plan. Each Contractor or  subcontractor participating in an approved plan is also required to  comply with its obligations under the Equal Opportunity clause, and to  make a good faith effort to achieve each goal under the plan in each  trade in which it has employees. The overall good-faith performance by  other Contractors or subcontractors toward a goal in an approved plan  does not excuse any Contractor's or subcontractor's failure to make  good-faith efforts to achieve the plan's goals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The Contractor shall implement the affirmative action procedures  in subparagraphs (g)(1) through (16) of this clause. The goals stated in  the solicitation for this contract are expressed as percentages of the  total hours of employment and training of minority and female  utilization that the Contractor should reasonably be able to achieve in  each construction trade in which it has employees in the covered area.  If the Contractor performs construction work in a geographical area  located outside of the covered area, it shall apply the goals  established for the geographical area where that work is actually  performed. The Contractor is expected to make substantially uniform  progress toward its goals in each craft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Neither the terms and conditions of any collective bargaining  agreement, nor the failure by a union with which the Contractor has a  collective bargaining agreement, to refer minorities or women shall  excuse the Contractor's obligations under this clause, Executive Order  11246, as amended, or the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> In order for the nonworking training hours of apprentices and  trainees to be counted in meeting the goals, apprentices and trainees  must be employed by the Contractor during the training period, and the  Contractor must have made a commitment to employ the apprentices and  trainees at the completion of their training, subject to the  availability of employment opportunities. Trainees must be trained  pursuant to training programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The Contractor shall take affirmative action to ensure equal  employment opportunity. The evaluation of the Contractor's compliance  with this clause shall be based upon its effort to achieve maximum  results from its actions. The Contractor shall document these efforts  fully and implement affirmative action steps at least as extensive as  the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ensure a working environment free of harassment, intimidation,  and coercion at all sites and in all facilities where the Contractor's  employees are assigned to work. The Contractor, if possible, will assign  two or more women to each construction project. The Contractor shall  ensure that foremen, superintendents, and other onsite supervisory  personnel are aware of and carry out the Contractor's obligation to  maintain such a working environment, with specific attention to minority  or female individuals working at these sites or facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Establish and maintain a current list of sources for minority  and female recruitment. Provide written notification to minority and  female recruitment sources and community organizations when the  Contractor or its unions have employment opportunities available, and  maintain a record of the organizations' responses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Establish and maintain a current file of the names, addresses,  and telephone numbers of each minority and female off-the-street  applicant, referrals of minorities or females from unions, recruitment  sources, or community organizations, and the action taken with respect  to each individual. If an individual was sent to the union hiring hall  for referral and not referred back to the Contractor by the union or, if  referred back, not employed by the Contractor, this shall be documented  in the file, along with whatever additional actions the Contractor may  have taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Immediately notify the Deputy Assistant Secretary when the union  or unions with which the Contractor has a collective bargaining  agreement has not referred back to the Contractor a minority or woman  sent by the Contractor, or when the Contractor has other information  that the union referral process has impeded the Contractor's efforts to  meet its obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Develop on-the-job training opportunities and/or participate in  training programs for the area that expressly include minorities and  women, including upgrading programs and apprenticeship and trainee  programs relevant to the Contractor's employment needs, especially those  programs funded or approved by the Department of Labor. The Contractor  shall provide notice of these programs to the sources compiled under  subparagraph (g)(2) of this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Disseminate the Contractor's equal employment policy by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Providing notice of the policy to unions and to training,  recruitment, and outreach programs, and requesting their cooperation in  assisting the Contractor in meeting its contract obligations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Including the policy in any policy manual and in collective  bargaining agreements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Publicizing the policy in the company newspaper, annual  report, etc.;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Reviewing the policy with all management personnel and with all  minority and female employees at least once a year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Posting the policy on bulletin boards accessible to employees at  each location where construction work is performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Review, at least annually, the Contractor's equal employment  policy and affirmative action obligations with all employees having  responsibility for hiring, assignment, layoff, termination, or other  employment decisions. Conduct review of this policy with all on-site  supervisory personnel before initiating construction work at a job site.  A written record shall be made and maintained identifying the time and  place of these meetings, persons attending, subject matter discussed,  and disposition of the subject matter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Disseminate the Contractor's equal employment policy externally  by including it in any advertising in the news media, specifically  including minority and female news media. Provide written notification  to, and discuss this policy with, other Contractors and subcontractors  with which the Contractor does or anticipates doing business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Direct recruitment efforts, both oral and written, to minority,  female, and community organizations, to schools with minority and female  students, and to minority and female recruitment and training  organizations serving the Contractor's recruitment area and employment  needs. Not later than 1 month before the date for acceptance of  applications for apprenticeship or training by any recruitment source,  send written notification to organizations such as the above, describing  the openings, screening procedures, and tests to be used in the  selection process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Encourage present minority and female employees to recruit  minority persons and women. Where reasonable, provide after-school,  summer, and vacation employment to minority and female youth both on the  site and in other areas of the Contractor's workforce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Validate all tests and other selection requirements where  required under 41 CFR 60-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Conduct, at least annually, an inventory and evaluation at  least of all minority and female personnel for promotional  opportunities. Encourage these employees to seek or to prepare for,  through appropriate training, etc., opportunities for promotion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Ensure that seniority practices, job classifications, work  assignments, and other personnel practices, do not have a discriminatory  effect by continually monitoring all personnel and employment-related  activities to ensure that the Contractor's obligations under this  contract are being carried out.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Ensure that all facilities and company activities are  nonsegregated except that separate or single-user rest rooms and  necessary dressing or sleeping areas shall be provided to assure privacy  between the sexes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Maintain a record of solicitations for subcontracts for  minority and female construction contractors and suppliers, including  circulation of solicitations to minority and female contractor  associations and other business associations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Conduct a review, at least annually, of all supervisors'  adherence to and performance under the Contractor's equal employment  policy and affirmative action obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> The Contractor is encouraged to participate in voluntary  associations that may assist in fulfilling one or more of the  affirmative action obligations contained in subparagraphs (g)(1) through  (16) of this clause. The efforts of a contractor association, joint  contractor-union, contractor-community, or similar group of which the  contractor is a member and participant may be asserted as fulfilling one  or more of its obligations under subparagraphs (g)(1) through (16) of  this clause, provided the Contractor--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Actively participates in the group;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Makes every effort to ensure that the group has a positive  impact on the employment of minorities and women in the industry;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ensures that concrete benefits of the program are reflected in  the Contractor's minority and female workforce participation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Makes a good-faith effort to meet its individual goals and  timetables; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Can provide access to documentation that demonstrates the  effectiveness of actions taken on behalf of the Contractor. The  obligation to comply is the Contractor's, and failure of such a group to  fulfill an obligation shall not be a defense for the Contractor's  noncompliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A single goal for minorities and a separate single goal for  women shall be established. The Contractor is required to provide equal  employment opportunity and to take affirmative action for all minority  groups, both male and female, and all women, both minority and  nonminority. Consequently, the Contractor may be in violation of  Executive Order 11246, as amended, if a particular group is employed in  a substantially disparate manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> The Contractor shall not use goals or affirmative action  standards to discriminate against any person because of race, color,  religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> The Contractor shall not enter into any subcontract with any  person or firm debarred from Government contracts under Executive Order  11246, as amended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> The Contractor shall carry out such sanctions and penalties for  violation of this clause and of the Equal Opportunity clause,   including suspension, termination, and cancellation of existing  subcontracts, as may be imposed or ordered under Executive Order 11246,  as amended, and its implementing regulations, by the OFCCP. Any failure  to carry out these sanctions and penalties as ordered shall be a  violation of this clause and Executive Order 11246, as amended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> The Contractor in fulfilling its obligations under this clause  shall implement affirmative action procedures at least as extensive as  those prescribed in paragraph (g) of this clause, so as to achieve  maximum results from its efforts to ensure equal employment opportunity.  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of Executive  Order 11246, as amended, the implementing regulations, or this clause,  the Deputy Assistant Secretary shall take action as prescribed in 41 CFR  60-4.8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> The Contractor shall designate a responsible official to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Monitor all employment-related activity to ensure that the  Contractor's equal employment policy is being carried out;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Submit reports as may be required by the Government; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Keep records that shall at least include for each employee the  name, address, telephone number, construction trade, union affiliation  (if any), employee identification number, social security number, race,  sex, status (e.g., mechanic, apprentice, trainee, helper, or laborer),  dates of changes in status, hours worked per week in the indicated  trade, rate of pay, and locations at which the work was performed.  Records shall be maintained in an easily understandable and retrievable  form; however, to the degree that existing records satisfy this  requirement, separate records are not required to be maintained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Nothing contained herein shall be construed as a limitation upon  the application of other laws that establish different standards of  compliance or upon the requirements for the hiring of local or other  area residents (e.g., those under the Public Works Employment Act of  1977 and the Community Development Block Grant Program).</p><p class="depth0">(End of clause)  [48 FR 42478, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 55 FR 38518, Sept. 18, 1990;  63 FR 70286, Dec. 18, 1998; 80 FR 19508, Apr. 10, 2015]    52.222-28  [Reserved]</p>
