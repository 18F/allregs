                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of computing the amount of a payee's entitlement  under this section, a participant's TSP account balance will include any  loan balance outstanding as of the date used for calculating the payee's  entitlement, unless the court order provides otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the court order awards a percentage or fraction of an account  as of a specific date, the payee's entitlement will be calculated based  on the account balance as of that date. If the date specified in the  order is not a business day, the TSP will use the participant's account  balance as of the last preceding business day.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the court order awards a percentage or fraction of an account  but does not contain a specific date as of which to apply that  percentage or fraction, the TSP will use the effective date of the  order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the court order awards a specific dollar amount, the payee's  entitlement will be the lesser of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The dollar amount stated in the court order; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The vested account balance on the date of disbursement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a court order describes a payee's entitlement in terms of a  fixed dollar amount and a percentage or fraction of the account, the TSP  will pay the fixed dollar amount, even if the percentage or fraction,  when applied to the account balance, would yield a different result.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The payee's entitlement will be credited with TSP investment  earnings as described:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The entitlement calculated under this section will not be  credited with TSP investment earnings unless the court order  specifically provides otherwise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If earnings are awarded and a rate is specified, the rate must  be expressed as an annual percentage rate or as a per diem dollar amount  added to the payee's entitlement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If earnings are awarded and the rate is not specified, the  Agency will calculate the amount to be awarded by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determining the payee's award amount (e.g., the percentage or  fraction of the participant's account);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Determining, based on the participant's investment allocation  as of the date used to calculate the entitlement, the number and  composition of shares that the payee's award amount would have purchased  as of the date used to calculate the entitlement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Multiplying the price per share as of the payment date by the  number and composition of shares calculated in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The TSP will estimate the amount of a payee's entitlement when  it prepares the court order decision letter and will recalculate the  entitlement at the time of payment. The recalculation may differ from  the initial estimation because:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The estimation of the payee's entitlement includes both vested  and nonvested amounts in the participant's account. If, at the time of  payment, the nonvested portion of the account has not become vested, the  recalculated entitlement will apply only to the participant's vested  account balance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After the estimate of the payee's entitlement is prepared, the  TSP may process account transactions that have an effective date on or  before the date used to compute the payee's entitlement. Those  transactions will be included when the payee's entitlement is  recalculated at the time of payment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amount available for payment from the account may be reduced  due to changes in share price (i.e., investment losses).
