                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. At its first organizational meeting, the board of directors of a Federal stock association shall adopt a set of bylaws for the administration and regulation of its affairs. Bylaws may be adopted, amended or repealed by either a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders at a legal meeting or a majority of the board of directors. The bylaws shall contain sufficient provisions to govern the association in accordance with the requirements of Secs. 152.6, 152.7, 152.8, and 152.9 of this part and shall not contain any provision that is inconsistent with those sections or with applicable laws, rules, regulations or the association's charter, except that a bylaw provision inconsistent with Secs. 152.6, 152.7, and 152.9, of this part may be adopted with the approval of the OCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form of Filing--(1) Application requirement.

If the proposed bylaw amendment does not involve a provision that would be covered by paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section and is permissible under all applicable laws, rules, or regulations, then the association shall submit the amendment to the OCC at least 30 days prior to the date the bylaw amendment is to be adopted by the association.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Corporate governance procedures. A Federal stock association may elect to follow the corporate governance procedures of: The laws of the state where the main office of the association is located; the laws of the state where the association's holding company, if any, is incorporated or chartered; Delaware General Corporation law; or The Model Business Corporation Act, provided that such procedures may be elected to the extent not inconsistent with applicable Federal statutes and regulations and safety and soundness, and such procedures are not of the type described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If this election is selected, a Federal stock association shall designate in its bylaws the provision or provisions from the body or bodies of law selected for its corporate governance procedures, and shall file a copy of such bylaws, which are effective upon adoption, within 30 days after adoption. The submission shall indicate, where not obvious, why the bylaw provisions meet the requirements stated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effectiveness. Any bylaw amendment filed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall automatically be effective 30 days from the date of filing of such amendment, provided that the association follows the requirements of its charter and bylaws in adopting such amendment, unless prior to the expiration of such 30-day period the OCC notifies the association that such amendment is rejected or that such amendment requires an application to be filed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effect of subsequent charter or bylaw change. Notwithstanding any subsequent change to its charter or bylaws, the authority of a Federal stock association to engage in any transaction shall be determined only by the association's charter or bylaws then in effect, unless otherwise provided by Federal law or regulation.</p>
