                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. RUS, through its Technical Standards Committees ``A'' and  ``B'' will determine the acceptability of certain standards, standard  specifications, standard drawings, and items of materials and equipment  to be used in transmission, distribution and general plant (excluding  office equipment, tools, and work equipment, and consumer-owned electric  wiring facilities).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Addresses of Committees. The address of Technical Standards  Committee ``A'' is: Chairman, Technical Standards Committee ``A''  (Electric), Rural Utilities Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture,  Washington, DC 20250-1500. The address of Technical Standards Committee  ``B'' is: Chairman, Technical Standards Committee ``B'' (Electric),  Rural Utilities Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC  20250-1500.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review by Technical Standards Committee ``A''. All proposals for  listing a product in the List of Materials must be addressed to  Technical Standards Committee ``A.'' This committee will consider all  proposals made by sponsors of specifications, drawings, materials, or  equipment in categories for which RUS has established criteria for  acceptability. A sponsor may be a manufacturer, supplier, contractor or  any other person or organization which has made an application for  listing or has requested an action by the committee. Committee ``A''  will consider all relevant information presented in determining whether  an item should be accepted by Technical Standards Committee ``A.''  Formal rules of evidence and procedure shall not apply to proceedings  before this committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Action by Technical Standards Committee ``A''. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Committee  ``A'' may take one of the following actions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Accept an item for listing without conditions (domestic items  only),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reject an item (domestic or nondomestic), \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">\1\ Nondomestic items are items which do not qualify as domestic  products pursuant to RUS ``Buy American'' requirement. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Accept an item for listing with conditions (domestic items  only),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Table an item for a time period sufficient to allow the sponsor  to be notified and furnish additional information (domestic or  nondomestic),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Grant technical acceptance with or without conditions for a  period of one year from the date of notification by RUS (nondomestic  items only).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All committee decisions regarding the actions listed above must  be unanimous. If the vote is not unanimous, the item shall be referred  to Technical Standards Committee ``B.'' Written notice of Technical  Standards Committee ``A's'' decision, stating the basis for the  decision, will be provided to the sponsor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Items accepted without conditions by the Technical Standards  Committees will be considered to be accepted on a general basis. No  restrictions as to quantity or application will be placed on items which  have received general acceptance. Items accepted subject to certain  conditions, such as limited use to gain service experience, or limited  use appropriate to certain areas and conditions, will be considered to  be accepted on a conditional basis. The conditions will be cited as a  part of the listing provided for in Sec. 1728.60, or as part of the  technical acceptance for nondomestic items.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Appeal to Technical Standards Committee ``B''. A sponsor may  request a review of an adverse decision by Technical Standards Committee  ``A'' within ten (10) days of notification of such decision by  submitting a letter requesting such review to Technical Standards  Committee ``B'' (Electric).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Action by Technical Standards Committee ``B''. Committee ``B''  may take any of the actions listed for Committee ``A'' in  Sec. 1728.30(d). However, for a Committee ``B'' action to be effective  it must be by majority vote. Failure to   obtain a majority on one of the proposed actions shall mean that the  product will not be listed or accepted. Committee ``B's'' determination  shall be based on the record developed before Committee ``A'' and such  additional information as Committee ``B'' may request. Formal rules of  procedure and evidence shall not apply to proceedings before Committee  ``B.''

RUS acceptance of an item will be conditioned  on the understanding that no design changes (material or dimensions)  affecting the quality, strength, or electrical characteristics of the  item shall be made without prior concurrence of Technical Standards  Committee ``A.''
