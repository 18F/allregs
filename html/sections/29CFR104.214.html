When an employee files an  unfair labor practice charge, the Board may find it appropriate to  excuse the employee from the requirement that charges be filed within  six months after the occurrence of the allegedly unlawful conduct if the  employer has failed to post the required employee notice unless the  employee has received actual or constructive notice that the conduct  complained of is unlawful. See NLRA Section 10(b), 29 U.S.C. 160(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Noncompliance as evidence of unlawful motive. The Board may  consider a knowing and willful refusal to comply with the requirement to  post the employee notice as evidence of unlawful motive in a case in  which motive is an issue.</p>
