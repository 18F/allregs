For the purpose of this paragraph, incidental ingredients are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Substances that have no technical or functional effect in the  cosmetic but are present by reason of having been incorporated into the  cosmetic as an ingredient of another cosmetic ingredient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Processing aids, which are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Substances that are added to a cosmetic during the processing of  such cosmetic but are removed from the cosmetic in accordance with good  manufacturing practices before it is packaged in its finished form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Substances that are added to a cosmetic during processing for  their technical or functional effect in the processing, are converted to  substances the same as constituents of declared ingredients, and do not  significantly increase the concentration of those constituents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Substances that are added to a cosmetic during the processing  of such cosmetic for their technical and functional effect in the  processing but are present in the finished cosmetic at insignificant  levels and do not have any technical or functional effect in that  cosmetic.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> In the event that there is a current or anticipated shortage of  a cosmetic ingredient, the declaration required by this section may  specify alternatives to any ingredients that may be affected.

This paragraph is inapplicable to any  ingredient mentioned in advertising, or in labeling other than in the  declaration of ingredients required by this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> In the event that the shortage of a cosmetic ingredient  necessitates a formulation change, packages bearing labels declaring the  ingredients of the old formulation may be used if the revised ingredient  declaration appears (1) on a firmly affixed tag, tape, card, or sticker  or similar overlabeling attached to the package and bearing the  conspicuous words ``new ingredient list'' in letters not less than \1/ 16\ of an inch in height, or (2) on labeling inside an unsealed package  and the package bears the conspicuous words, on a sticker or similar  overlabeling, ``new ingredient list inside'' in letters not less than  \1/16\ of an inch in height.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> The ingredients of products that are similar in composition and  intended for the same use may be declared as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The declaration of ingredients for an assortment of such  products that are sold together in the same package, e.g., eyeshadows of  different colors, may declare the ingredients that are common to all the  products, in a single list in their cumulative order of predominance or  in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section,  together with a statement, in terms that are as informative as  practicable and that are not misleading, declaring the other ingredients  and identifying the products in which they are present. The color  additive ingredients of all the products in such an assortment, whether  or not common to all   the products, may be declared in a single composite list following the  declaration of the other ingredients without identifying the products in  which they are present.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The ingredients of an assortment of such products that are sold  together in the same package, e.g., eyeshadows of different colors, may  be declared in a single list in their cumulative order of predominance  or in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section,  if the package is designed such that it has a total surface area  available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches. For the  purpose of this paragraph, surface area is not available for labeling if  physical characteristics of the package surface, e.g., decorative  relief, make application of a label impractical.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The declaration of ingredients for such a product that is  individually packaged and bears a label that is shared with other  products pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (g)(2) of this section,  e.g., one lipstick in a line of lipsticks, may declare the ingredients  that are common to all such products, in a single list in their  cumulative order of predominance or in accordance with the provisions of  paragraph (f) of this section, together with a statement, in terms that  are as informative as practicable and that are not misleading, declaring  the other ingredients in such products, and identifying the products in  which they are present. The color additive ingredients shall be declared  in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The declaration of ingredients for an assortment of such  cosmetic products that bears a label that is shared with other products  pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (g)(2) of this section, e.g.,  one of several compacts in a line of compacts, may declare the  ingredients that are common to all such products, in a single list in  their cumulative order of predominance or in accordance with the  provisions of paragraph (f) of this section, together with a statement,  in terms that are as informative as practicable and that are not  misleading, declaring the other ingredients in such products and  identifying the products in which they are present. The color additive  ingredients shall be declared in accordance with the provisions of  paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> As an alternative to the declaration of ingredients in letters  not less than \1/16\ of an inch in height, letters may be not less than  \1/32\ of an inch in height if the package is designed such that it has  a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square  inches.
