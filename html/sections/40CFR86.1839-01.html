                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In lieu of testing an emission-data or durability vehicle selected under Sec. 86.1822-01, Sec. 86.1828-01, or Sec. 86.1829-01, and submitting data therefrom, a manufacturer may submit exhaust emission data, evaporative emission data and/or refueling emission data, as applicable, on a similar vehicle for which certification has been obtained or for which all applicable data required under Sec. 86.1845-01 has previously been submitted. To be eligible for this provision, the manufacturer must use good engineering judgment and meet the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of durability data, the manufacturer must determine that the previously generated durability data represent a worst case or equivalent rate of deterioration for all applicable emission constituents compared to the configuration selected for durability demonstration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prior to certification, the Administrator may require the manufacturer to provide data showing that the distribution of catalyst temperatures of the selected durability configuration is

effectively equivalent or lower than the distribution of catalyst temperatures of the vehicle configuration which is the source of the previously generated data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For the 2001, 2002, and 2003 model years only, paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to the use of exhaust emission deterioration factors meeting the requirements of Sec. 86.1823-01(c)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of emission data, the manufacturer must determine that the previously generated emissions data represent a worst case or equivalent level of emissions for all applicable emission constituents compared to the configuration selected for emission compliance demonstration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In lieu of using newly aged hardware on an EDV as allowed under the provisions of Sec. 86.1823-08(f)(2), a manufacturer may use similar hardware aged for an EDV previously submitted, provided that the manufacturer determines that the previously aged hardware represents a worst case or equivalent rate of deterioration for all applicable emission constituents for durability demonstration.
