                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. CMS may deem a laboratory to meet all applicable  CLIA program requirements through accreditation by a private nonprofit  accreditation program (that is, grant deemed status), or may exempt from  CLIA program requirements all State licensed or approved laboratories in  a State that has a State licensure program established by law, if the  following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The requirements of the accreditation organization or State  licensure program are equal to, or more stringent than, the CLIA  condition-level requirements specified in this part, and the laboratory  would meet the condition-level requirements if it were inspected against  these requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The accreditation program or the State licensure program meets  the requirements of this subpart and is approved by CMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The laboratory authorizes the approved accreditation  organization or State licensure program to release to CMS all records  and information required and permits inspections as outlined in this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Meeting CLIA requirements by accreditation. A laboratory seeking  to meet CLIA requirements through accreditation by an approved  accreditation organization must do the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Obtain a certificate of accreditation as required in subpart D  of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pay the applicable fees as required in subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Meet the proficiency testing (PT) requirements in subpart H of  this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Authorize its PT organization to furnish to its accreditation  organization the results of the laboratory's participation in an  approved PT program for the purpose of monitoring the laboratory's PT  and for making the annual PT results, along with explanatory information  required to interpret the PT results, available on a reasonable basis,  upon request of any person. A laboratory that refuses to authorize  release of its PT results is no longer deemed to meet the condition- level requirements and is subject to a full review by CMS, in accordance  with subpart Q of this part, and may be subject to the suspension or  revocation of its certificate of accreditation under Sec. 493.1840.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Authorize its accreditation organization to release to CMS or a  CMS agent the laboratory's PT results that constitute unsuccessful  participation in an approved PT program, in accordance with the  definition of ``unsuccessful participation in an approved PT program,''  as specified in Sec. 493.2 of this part, when the laboratory has failed  to achieve successful participation in an approved PT program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Authorize its accreditation organization to release to CMS a  notification of the actions taken by the organization as a result of the  unsuccessful participation in a PT program within 30 days of the  initiation of the action. Based on this notification, CMS may take an  adverse action against a laboratory that fails to participate  successfully in an approved PT program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Withdrawal of laboratory accreditation. After an accreditation  organization has withdrawn or revoked its accreditation of a laboratory,  the laboratory retains its certificate of accreditation for 45 days  after the laboratory receives notice of the withdrawal or revocation of  the accreditation, or the effective date of any action taken by CMS,  whichever is earlier.</p>
