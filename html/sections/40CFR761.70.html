Prior to the incineration of PCBs and  PCB Items the owner or operator of an incinerator shall receive the  written approval of the Agency Regional Administrator for the region in  which the incinerator is located, or the appropriate official at EPA  Headquarters. Approval from the appropriate official at EPA Headquarters  may be effective in all ten EPA regions. Such approval shall be obtained  in the following manner:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Application. The owner or operator shall submit to the Regional  Administrator or the Director, Office of Resource Conservation and  Recovery an application which contains:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The location of the incinerator;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A detailed description of the incinerator including general  site plans and design drawings of the incinerator;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Engineering reports or other information on the anticipated  performance of the incinerator;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Sampling and monitoring equipment and facilities available;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Waste volumes expected to be incinerated;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Any local, State, or Federal permits or approvals; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Schedules and plans for complying with the approval  requirements of this regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Trial burn. (i) Following receipt of the application described  in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, EPA shall determine if a trial burn  is required and notify the person who submitted the report whether a  trial burn of PCBs and PCB Items must be conducted. EPA may require the  submission of any other information that EPA finds to be   reasonably necessary to determine the need for a trial burn. Such other  information shall be restricted to the types of information required in  paragraphs (d)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> through (vii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If EPA determines that a trail burn must be held, the person  who submitted the report described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section  shall submit to the Regional Administrator or the Director, Office of  Resource Conservation and Recovery a detailed plan for conducting and  monitoring the trail burn. At a minimum, the plan must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Date trial burn is to be conducted;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Quantity and type of PCBs and PCB Items to be incinerated;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Parameters to be monitored and location of sampling points;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Sampling frequency and methods and schedules for sample  analyses; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Name, address, and qualifications of persons who will review  analytical results and other pertinent data, and who will perform a  technical evaluation of the effectiveness of the trial burn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Following receipt of the plan described in paragraph  (d)(2)(ii) of this section, EPA will approve the plan, require additions  or modifications to the plan, or disapprove the plan. If the plan is  disapproved, EPA will notify the person who submitted the plan of such  disapproval, together with the reasons why it is disapproved. That  person may thereafter submit a new plan in accordance with paragraph  (d)(2)(ii) of this section. If the plan is approved (with any additions  or modifications which EPA may prescribe), EPA will notify the person  who submitted the plan of the approval. Thereafter, the trial burn shall  take place at a date and time to be agreed upon between EPA and the  person who submitted the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other information. In addition to the information contained in  the report and plan described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this  section, EPA may require the owner or operator to submit any other  information that the EPA finds to be reasonably necessary to determine  whether an incinerator shall be approved.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The Regional Administrator will have available for review and  inspection an Agency manual containing information on sampling methods  and analytical procedures for the parameters required in Sec. 761.70(a)  (3), (4), (6), and (7) plus any other parameters he/she may determine to  be appropriate. Owners or operators are encouraged to review this manual  prior to submitting any report required in Sec. 761.70.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Contents of approval. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5)  of this section, the Regional Administrator or the appropriate official  at EPA Headquarters may not approve an incinerator for the disposal of  PCBs and PCB Items unless he finds that the incinerator meets all of the  requirements of paragraphs (a) and/or (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and/or (b) of  this section, EPA may include in an approval any other requirements that  EPA finds are necessary to ensure that operation of the incinerator does  not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment  from PCBs. Such requirements may include a fixed period of time for  which the approval is valid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Waivers. An owner or operator of the incinerator may submit  evidence to the Regional Administrator or the Director, Office of  Resource Conservation and Recovery that operation of the incinerator  will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the  environment from PCBs, when one or more of the requirements of  paragraphs (a) and/or (b) of this section are not met. On the basis of  such evidence and any other available information, EPA may, in its  discretion, find that any requirement of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this  section is not necessary to protect against such a risk, and may waive  the requirements in any approval for that incinerator. Any finding and  waiver under this paragraph must be stated in writing and included as  part of the approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Persons approved. An approval will designate the persons who own  and who are authorized to operate the incinerator, and will apply only  to such persons, except as provided in paragraph (d)(8) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Final approval. Approval of an incinerator will be in writing  and signed by the appropriate EPA official. The   approval will state all requirements applicable to the approved  incinerator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Transfer of property. Any person who owns or operates an  approved incinerator must notify EPA at least 30 days before  transferring ownership in the incinerator or the property it stands  upon, or transferring the right to operate the incinerator. The  transferor must also submit to EPA, at least 30 days before such  transfer, a notarized affidavit signed by the transferee which states  that the transferee will abide by the transferor's EPA incinerator  approval. Within 30 days of receiving such notification and affidavit,  EPA will issue an amended approval substituting the transferee's name  for the transferor's name, or EPA may require the transferee to apply  for a new incinerator approval. In the latter case, the transferee must  abide by the transferor's EPA approval until EPA issues the new approval  to the transferee.  (Sec. 6, Pub.
