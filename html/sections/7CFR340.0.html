The introduction into the United States of such articles also may be subject to other regulations promulgated under the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7701-7772) and found in 7 CFR parts 319, 330, and 360. For example, under regulations promulgated in ``Subpart-Nursery Stock, Plants, Roots, Bulbs, Seeds, and Other Plant Products'' (7 CFR 319.37-3), a permit is required for the importation of certain classes of nursery stock whether such stock is genetically engineered or not. Accordingly, individuals should refer to those regulations before importing any nursery stock.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any regulated article introduced not in compliance with the requirements of this part shall be subject to the immediate application of such remedial measures or safeguards as an inspector determines necessary to prevent the introduction of such plant pests. \2\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\2\ An inspector may hold, seize, quarantine, treat, apply other remedial measures to, destroy, or otherwise dispose of plants, plant pests, or other articles in accordance with sections 411, 412, 421, and 434 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7711, 7712, 7731, and 7754).
