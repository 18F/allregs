                            <p class="depth0">The Division Engineer will make a final decision on the merits of the appeal at the earliest practicable time, in accordance with the following time limits. The administrative appeal process is initiated by the receipt of an RFA by the division engineer. The Corps will review the RFA to determine whether the RFA is acceptable. The Corps will notify the appellant accordingly within 30 days of the receipt of the RFA in accordance with Sec. 331.7(b). If the Corps determines that the RFA is acceptable, the RO will immediately request the administrative record from the district engineer. The division engineer will normally make a final decision on the merits of the appeal within 90 days of the receipt of an acceptable RFA unless any site visit is delayed pursuant to Sec. 331.7(c). In such case, the RO will complete the appeal review and the division engineer will make a final appeal decision within 30 days of the site visit. In no case will a site visit delay extend the total appeal process beyond twelve months from the date of receipt of an acceptable RFA.</p>
