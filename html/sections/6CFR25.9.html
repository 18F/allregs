Within 30 days after receipt of an application for a Certification, the Under Secretary or his designee shall notify the applicant in writing that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The application is complete and will be reviewed, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the application is incomplete, in which case the missing or incomplete parts will be specified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review process. The Under Secretary or his designee will review each complete application for a Certification and any included supporting materials. In performing this function, the Under Secretary or his designee may, but is not required to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Request additional information from the Seller;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Meet with representatives of the Seller;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consult with, and rely upon the expertise of, any other Federal or non-Federal entity; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Perform or seek studies or analyses of the Technology.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Action by the Under Secretary. (1) Within 90 days after receipt of a complete application for a Certification, the Under Secretary shall take one of the following actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within 90 days after receipt of a complete application for a Certification, the Under Secretary shall take one of the following actions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Approve the application and issue an appropriate Certification to the Seller;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notify the Seller in writing that the Technology is potentially eligible for a Certification, but that additional specified information is needed before a decision may be reached; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Deny the application, and notify the Seller in writing of such decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Under Secretary may extend the time period one time for 45 days upon notice to the Seller, and the Under Secretary is not required to provide a reason or cause for such extension. The Under Secretary's decision shall be final and not subject to review, except at the discretion of the Under Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Designation is a pre-condition.
