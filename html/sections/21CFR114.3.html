                            <p class="depth0">For the purposes of this part, the following definitions apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Acid foods means foods that have a natural pH of 4.6 or below.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acidified foods means low-acid foods to which acid(s) or acid  food(s) are added; these foods include, but are not limited to, beans,  cucumbers, cabbage, artichokes, cauliflower, puddings, peppers, tropical  fruits, and fish, singly or in any combination. They have a water  activity (aw) greater than 0.85 and have a finished  equilibrium pH of 4.6 or below. These foods may be called, or may  purport to be, ``pickles'' or ``pickled ------.'' Carbonated beverages,  jams, jellies, preserves, acid foods (including such foods as  standardized and nonstandardized food dressings and condiment sauces)  that contain small amounts of low-acid food(s) and have a resultant  finished equilibrium pH that does not significantly differ from that of  the predominant acid or acid food, and foods that are stored,  distributed, and retailed under refrigeration are excluded from the  coverage of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Lot means the product produced during a period indicated by a  specific code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Low-acid foods means any foods, other than alcoholic beverages,  with a finished equilibrium pH greater than 4.6 and a water activity  (aw) greater than 0.85. Tomatoes and tomato products having a  finished equilibrium pH less than 4.7 are not classed as low-acid foods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Scheduled process means the process selected by a processor as  adequate for use under the conditions of manufacture for a food in  achieving and maintaining a food that will not permit the growth of  microorganisms having public health significance. It includes control of  pH and other critical factors equivalent to the process established by a  competent processing authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Shall is used to state mandatory requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Should is used to state recommended or advisory procedures or to  identify recommended equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Water activity (aw) is a measure of the free moisture  in a product and is the quotient of the water vapor pressure of the  substance divided by the vapor pressure of pure water at the same  temperature.
