                            <p class="depth0">For the purposes of this part:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A&TBCB; or Board means the Architectural and Transportation  Barriers Compliance Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A&TBCB; record or record means any document, writing, photograph,  sound or magnetic recording, drawing or other similar thing by which  information has been preserved, from which the information can be  retrieved and copied, and which is, was, or is alleged to be under the  control of the A&TBCB.;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term includes--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Informal writings such as handwritten notes and drafts;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Information preserved in a form which must be translated or  deciphered by machine in order to be intelligible to humans;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Records which were created or acquired by the A&TBCB;, its  members, its employees, its members' employees, or persons acting on  behalf of its members, by use of A&TBCB; funds or in the course of  transacting official business for the A&TBCB.;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term does not include--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Materials which are legally owned by an A&TBCB; member, employee,  or member's employee or representative   in his or her purely personal capacity; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Materials published by non-Federal organizations which are  readily available to the public, such as books, journals, standards, and  periodicals available through reference libraries, even if such  materials are in the A&TBCB;'s possession.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The terms agency, person, party, rule, rulemaking, order, and  adjudication have the meanings given in 5 U.S.C. 551, except where the  context demonstrates that a different meaning is intended, and except  that for purposes of the Freedom of Information Act the term agency as  defined in 5 U.S.C. 551 includes any executive department, military  department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation,  the United States Postal Service, or other establishment in the  executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of  the President) or any independent regulatory agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A government record under the control of the A&TBCB; means that  the record is subject to the free disposition of the A&TBCB.; This  includes keeping the record available for governmental use as required  and protecting, preserving, and exercising such control over it as may  be necessary for that purpose. Control of a record is not synonymous  with, and does not require, actual physical possession of the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Request means a request to inspect or obtain a copy of one or  more records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Requestor means any person who submits a request to the A&TBCB.;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Public member means a member appointed by the President from  among members of the general public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Direct Costs means those expenditures which an agency actually  incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial  requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA request. Direct  costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing work  (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to  cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not  included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space,  and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Search includes all time spent looking for material that is  responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line  identification of material within documents. Agencies should ensure that  searching for material is done in the most efficient and least expensive  manner so as to minimize costs for both the agency and the requester.  For example, agencies should not engage in line-by-line search when  merely duplicating an entire document would prove the less expensive and  quicker method of complying with a request. Search should be  distinguished, moreover, from review of material in order to determine  whether the material is exempt from disclosure (see paragraph (k) of  this section). Searches may be done manually or by computer using  existing programming.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Duplication refers to the process of making a copy of a document  necessary to respond to an FOIA request. Such copies can take the form  of paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine readable  documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The copy  provided must be in a form that is reasonably usable by requesters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Review refers to the process of examining documents located in  response to a request that is for a commercial use (see paragraph (l) of  this section) to determine whether any portion of any document located  is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any documents  for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise them and  otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent  resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of  exemptions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Commercial Use Request refers to a request from or on behalf of  one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the  commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on  whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester  properly belongs in this category, agencies must determine the use to  which a requester will put the documents requested. Moreover, where an  agency has reasonable cause to doubt   the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where that  use is not clear from the request itself, agencies should seek  additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific  category.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Educational Institution refers to a preschool, a public or  private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate  higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an  institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational  education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Non-Commercial Scientific Institution refers to an institution  that is not operated on a commercial basis as that term is referenced in  paragraph (l) of this section, and which is operated solely for the  purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not  intended to promote any particular product or industry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Representative of the News Media refers to any person actively  gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish  or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information that is  about current events or that would be of current interest to the public.  Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations  broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but  only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of news)  who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the  general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive.  Moreover, as traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g.,  electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications  services), such alternative media would be included in this category. In  the case of freelance journalists, they may be regarded as working for a  news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting  publication through that organization, even though not actually employed  by it. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but agencies  may also look to the past publication record of a requester in making  this determination.
