The specimens referred to  in this paragraph shall be collected and handled only at such time and  place and in such manner as not to interfere with the inspection or to  cause any objectionable condition and shall be identified as inedible  when they leave the establishment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To parts of poultry carcasses that are naturally inedible by  humans, such as entrails and feathers in their natural state.
