                            <p class="depth0">The parties to a lease with crew as described in Sec. 218.3(b) may  apply to the Board for an order disclaiming jurisdiction over the  matter. The application shall be filed jointly by both parties to the  lease, and shall generally conform to the procedural requirements of  part 302, subpart A, of this chapter. It shall be served upon any air  carrier providing services over all or any part of the route upon which  air transportation services will be provided pursuant to the agreement.  The application should set forth in detail all evidence and other  factors relied upon to demonstrate that true operational control and  safety responsibility for the air transportation services to be provided  are in the hands of the lessee rather than the lessor. A copy of the  agreement and all amendments thereof, as well as a summary  interpretation of its pertinent provisions, shall be included with the  applications. Any interested person may file an answer to the  application within 7 days after service hereof. Until the Board has  acted upon the application, no operations in foreign transportation  shall be performed pursuant to the agreement.</p>
