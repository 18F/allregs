                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority. The provisions of Title 14, U.S. Code, section 641(b), authorizes the Coast Guard to sell apparatus or equipment manufactured by or in use in the Coast Guard, which is not readily procurable in the open market. The provisions of Title 14, U.S. Code, section 654 (Pub. L. 86-159 approved Aug. 14, 1959), authorize the Coast Guard to sell supplies and furnish services to public and commercial vessels, and other watercraft. 49 U.S.C. 44502(d) authorizes the Coast Guard to provide for assistance, the sale of fuel, oil, equipment, and supplies, to an aircraft when necessary to allow the aircraft to continue to the nearest private airport.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Charges established by District Commander. The charges for supplies and services which may be normally expected to be furnished to persons, corporations, companies, vessels, and other watercraft, and non-Federal aircraft will vary between various geographical regions depending on local circumstances. The District Commander is hereby delegated authority to prescribe and he shall establish, in advance wherever practicable, the charges to be imposed and collected in various areas under his jurisdiction, which will be in accordance with the applicable general minimum terms and conditions in the laws and this section. In those cases where the charges have not been established in advance, the matter shall be priced on an individual basis, taking into consideration the facts and circumstances regarding the situation. The list(s) of charges established by the District Commander shall be available for reading and copying at the office of the issuing District Commander, which list(s) will be up-dated and reissued when necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sales to vessels and other watercraft. (1) The charges imposed for services are intended to permit repayment of costs involved in those instances where supplies and services are furnished to meet the necessities of the circumstances, and such vessels or watercraft are not within the scope of those distress services performed by the Coast Guard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The charges imposed for services are intended to permit repayment of costs involved in those instances where supplies and services are furnished to meet the necessities of the circumstances, and such vessels or watercraft are not within the scope of those distress services performed by the Coast Guard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Charges for sales of supplies and/or furnishing of services are considered appropriate when the furnishing of food, fuel, general stores, or repairs to the vessel or its equipage are primarily for the convenience of the owner, master, or crew, and furnished at his or their request. It is not intended and the Coast Guard does not procure and stock equipment and supplies except as provided for in current instructions issued by competent authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Supplies provided and services performed will be of a limited nature consistent with the situation and within the capabilities of the Coast Guard unit concerned; provided this will not be in competition with commercial enterprise when such facilities are available and deemed adequate. It is not intended to permit the operators of vessels or watercraft to take advantage of the Government by demanding free supplies or services. Determination as to whether charges will be made is dependent upon the circumstances involved in each instance. The responsibility to make this determination rests with the District Commander who may delegate it to his subordinates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The minimum charge for any supplies or services furnished to a vessel or other watercraft shall be $10. The prices for fuels and materials which may be sold will be at Coast Guard cost plus 20 percent or, if readily determinable, at the commercial price in the immediate operating area, whichever is higher. The charges for services furnished a vessel or watercraft will be an average cost equal to the full price, plus taxes, that a boat owner would pay a local commercial concern for such services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The sales of supplies and services will be documented and will set forth

the name, type, and identifying number of the vessel or watercraft receiving supplies or services; name and address of vessel's owner; and conditions under which it was determined to make a sale to the vessel or watercraft. Wherever possible, payment shall be obtained at the time supplies and services are furnished.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Sales of equipment not readily procurable on the open market. Charges imposed for sales of apparatus and equipment manufactured by or in use in the Coast Guard which, in the opinion of the Commandant (CG-9), is not readily procurable in the open market, are subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The apparatus or equipment has not been reported as excess to the General Services Administration (if so reported, requests to purchase will be submitted by the Commandant (CG-9) to the General Services Administration); and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The apparatus or equipment is not classified for security reasons or is not dangerous to the public health and safety; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The authorized buyers of this apparatus or equipment are foreign, State, or municipal governments or governmental units thereof; parties required to maintain private aids to navigation; contractors engaged on public works; and in other cases in which, in the judgment of the Commandant (FS), the public interest may be served; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The approved sales will be at prices determined by the Commandant (CG-9), which will include an overhead charge not to exceed 25 percent of acquisition cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Sales to and storage of non-Federal aircraft. (1) Activities having the necessary supplies and facilities are authorized to furnish fuel, oil, equipment, supplies, mechanical services, temporary storage, or other assistance to any aircraft operated by State, municipal, or private enterprise in emergency cases. Complete engines, airplane wings, or other major items of equipment shall not be furnished without prior authority from the Commandant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Activities having the necessary supplies and facilities are authorized to furnish fuel, oil, equipment, supplies, mechanical services, temporary storage, or other assistance to any aircraft operated by State, municipal, or private enterprise in emergency cases. Complete engines, airplane wings, or other major items of equipment shall not be furnished without prior authority from the Commandant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Aircraft damaged to the extent that major repairs are required may be given emergency storage at the request of the pilot, provided the necessary facilities are available. No such aircraft will be given a major or minor overhaul. Damaged aircraft may be stored in its original damaged condition. If aircraft requires extensive repairs, such as would include the replacing of major parts and such major parts cannot be made available or supplied within a reasonable length of time by the operator of such aircraft, then the aircraft must be removed from the Coast Guard reservation by the operator without delay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Government will not assume any responsibility for any loss or damage incurred by such aircraft while on a Coast Guard reservation and the owner shall be required to remove the aircraft from the reservation at the earliest practicable date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Storage charges for such aircraft on a Coast Guard reservation shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For the first 6 working days, no charge;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For each calendar day thereafter, $3 for a single motor plane and $5 for a dual or multiengine plane.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In the absence of any information to the contrary regarding a particular item or material, the price at which the item is carried in stock, or on the Plant Property Record (book price) will be regarded as the fair market value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When materials or services or both materials and services are furnished an aircraft, a deposit equal to the estimated value of such services and materials as will be required shall be obtained in advance of the rendition of the services and issuance of the materials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The charges for mechanical services rendered (other than in connection with the arrival, refueling, and departure of airplanes) shall be an hourly charge for labor, with a minimum of 1 hour, which shall be the equivalent to the schedule of wage rates for civilian
