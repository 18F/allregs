Such application shall be in writing, signed  by or on behalf of the applicant, and shall contain a short and simple  statement of the facts constituting the alleged violation and the name  and address of the applicant and the party complained of. If, after  investigation of the matters complained of in the application or after  investigation made on his own motion, the Director has reason to believe  that any person has violated or is violating any of the provisions of  the Act or the regulations made and promulgated thereunder, he may  institute such proceedings as may be authorized by the Act.</p>
