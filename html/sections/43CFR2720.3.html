                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon the authorized officer's determination that all of the  requirements of the Act for conveyance of mineral interests have been  met by the applicant and all actions necessary to determine the fair  market value of the Federal mineral interests in land covered by the  application have been completed, the authorized officer shall notify the  applicant in writing of the fair market value of the Federal mineral  interests, including the administrative costs involved in development of  and issuance of conveyance documents, and give a full and complete  statement of the costs incurred in reaching such determination including  any sum due the United States or that may be unexpended from the deposit  made by the applicant. If the administrative costs of determining the  fair market value of the Federal mineral interests exceed the amount of  the deposit required of the applicant under this subpart, he will be  informed that he is required to pay the difference between the actual  costs and the deposit. If the deposit exceeds the administrative costs  of determining the fair market value of the Federal mineral interests,  the applicant will be informed that he is entitled to a credit for or a  refund of the excess. The notice must require the applicant to pay both  the fair market value of the Federal mineral interests and the remaining  administrative costs owed within 90 days after the date the authorized  officer mails the notice. Failure to pay the required amount within the  allotted time shall constitute a withdrawal of the application and the  application will be dismissed and the case closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Bureau of Land Management will convey mineral rights on  lands for which this part does not require an exploratory program upon  payment by the applicant of fair market value for those mineral  interests and all administrative costs of processing the application to  acquire the mineral rights.
