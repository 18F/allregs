                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agreements. In carrying out its responsibilities to assign social security numbers, SSA enters into agreements with the United States Attorney General, other Federal officials, and State and local welfare agencies. An example of these agreements is discussed in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> States. SSA and a State may enter into an agreement that authorizes employees of a State or one of its subdivisions to accept social security number card applications from some individuals who apply for or are receiving welfare benefits under a State-administered Federal program. Under such an agreement, a State employee is also authorized to certify the application to show that he or she has reviewed the required evidence of the applicant's age, identity, and U.S. citizenship. The employee is also authorized to obtain evidence to assist SSA in determining whether the applicant has previously been assigned a number. The employee will then send the application to SSA which will issue a social security number card.
