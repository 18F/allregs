                            <p class="depth0">School food authorities must comply with the competitive food  service and standards requirements specified in Sec. 210.11 of this  chapter.  [78 FR 39093, June 28, 2013]    Sec. 220.12a  Competitive food services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> State agencies and School Food Authorities shall establish such  rules or regulations as are necessary to control the sale of foods in  competition with breakfasts served under the Program. Such rules or  regulations shall prohibit the sale of foods of minimal nutritional  value, as listed in appendix B of this part, in the food service areas  during the breakfast periods. The sale of other competitive foods may,  at the discretion of the State agency and the School Food Authority, be  allowed in the food service area during the breakfast period only if all  income from the sale of such foods accrues to the benefit of the  nonprofit school food service or the school or student organizations  approved by the school. State agencies and School Food Authorities may  impose additional restrictions on the sale of and income from all foods  sold at any time throughout schools participating in the School  Breakfast Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any person may submit a petition to FNS requesting that an  individual food be exempted from a category of foods of minimal  nutritional value listed in appendix B. In the case of artificially  sweetened foods, the petition must include a statement of the percent of  RDI for the eight nutrients   listed in the definition of Foods of minimal nutritional value in  Sec. 220.2 that the food provides per serving and the petitioner's  source of this information. In the case of all other foods, the petition  must include a statement of the percent of RDI for the eight nutrients  listed in the definition of Foods of minimal nutritional value in  Sec. 220.2 that the food provides per serving and per 100 calories and  the petitioner's source of this information. The Department will  determine whether or not the individual food is a food of minimal  nutritional value as defined the definition of Foods of minimal  nutritional value in Sec. 220.2, and will inform the petitioner in  writing of such determination, and the public by notice in the Federal  Register as indicated under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. In  determining whether an individual food is a food of minimal nutritional  value, discrete nutrients added to the food will not be taken into  account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any person may submit a petition to FNS requesting that foods in  a particular category of foods be classified as meeting the definition  of Foods of minimal nutritional value in Sec. 220.2. The petition must  identify and define the food category in easily understood language,  list examples of the foods contained in the category and include a list  which the foods in that category usually contain. If, upon review of the  petition, the Department determines that the foods in that category  should not be classified as foods of minimal nutritional value, the  petitioner will be so notified in writing. If upon review of the  petition, the Department determines that there is a substantial  likelihood that the foods in that category should be classified as  meeting the definition of Foods of minimal nutritional value in  Sec. 220.2, the Department shall at that time inform the petitioner. In  addition, the Department shall publish a proposed rule restricting the  sale of the foods in that category, setting forth the reasons for this  action, and soliciting public comments. On the basis of comments  received within 60 days of publication of the proposed rule and other  available information, the Department will determine whether the  nutrient composition of the foods indicates that the category should be  classified as a category of foods of minimal nutritional value.  The petitioner shall be notified in writing and the public shall be  notified of the Department's final determination upon publication in the  Federal Register as indicated under section (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> By May 1 and November 1 of each year, the Department shall amend  appendix B to exclude those individual foods identified under paragraph  (b)(1) of this section, and to include those categories of foods  identified under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, Provided That there  are necessary changes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. For the purpose of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Competitive foods means any foods sold in competition with the  School Breakfast Program to children in food service areas during the  breakfast period; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Foods of minimal nutritional value means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of artificially sweetened foods, a food which  provides less than five percent of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for  each of eight specified nutrients per serving; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of all other foods, a food that provides less than  five percent of the RDI for each of eight specified nutrients per 100  calories and less than five percent of the RDI for each of eight  specified nutrients per serving. The eight nutrients to be assessed for  this purpose are protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, niacin, riboflavin,  thiamin, calcium and iron. Categories of foods of minimal nutritional  value are listed in appendix B of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. This section remains in effect through June 30,  2014.

L. 97-35, 95 Stat. 533 (42 U.S.C. 1759a, 1773 and 1757))  [Amdt. 32, 45 FR 6771, Jan. 29, 1980, as amended by Amdt. 34, 45 FR  76937, Nov. 21, 1980; 50 FR 20547, May 17, 1985; 59 FR 23614, May 6,  1994; 72 FR 63792, Nov. 13, 2007.
