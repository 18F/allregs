                                Sec. 553.232  Overtime pay requirements.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">If a public agency pays employees subject to section 7(k) for overtime hours worked in cash wages rather than compensatory time off, such wages must be paid at one and one-half times the employees' regular rates of pay. In addition, employees who have accrued the maximum 480 hours of compensatory time must be paid cash wages of time and one-half their regular rates of pay for overtime hours in excess of the maximum for the work period set forth in Sec. 553.230.


Sec. 553.233  ``Regular rate'' defined.</p><p class="depth0">The rules for computing an employee's ``regular rate'', for purposes of the Act's overtime pay requirements, are set forth in part 778 of this title. These rules are applicable to employees for whom the section 7(k) exemption is claimed when overtime compensation is provided in cash wages. However, wherever the word ``workweek'' is used in part 778, the words ``work period'' should be substituted.</p>
