                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The term ``poultry'' includes domesticated fowl and game birds. Ducks and pigeons are included. Canaries and parakeets are not included.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ``raising'' of poultry includes the breeding, hatching, propagating, feeding, and general care of poultry. Slaughtering, which is the antithesis of ``raising,'' is not included. To constitute ``agriculture,'' slaughtering must come within the secondary meaning of the term ``agriculture.'' The temporary feeding and care of chickens and other poultry for a few days pending sale, shipment or slaughter is not the ``raising'' of poultry. However, feeding, fattening and caring for poultry over a substantial period may constitute the ``raising'' of poultry.</p>
