                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Redeterminations defined. A redetermination is a periodic review of your eligibility to make sure that you are still eligible for a subsidy and if so, to determine whether you should continue to receive a full or partial subsidy. This review deals with evaluating your income and resources (and those of your spouse, who lives with you) and will not affect past months of eligibility. It will be used to determine your future subsidy eligibility and whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy for future months. We will redetermine your eligibility if we made the initial determination of your eligibility or if you are deemed eligible because you receive SSI benefits. Rules regarding redeterminations of initial eligibility determinations made by a State are described in 42 CFR 423.774.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When we make redeterminations. (1) We will redetermine your subsidy eligibility within one year after we determine that you are eligible for the subsidy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We will redetermine your subsidy eligibility within one year after we determine that you are eligible for the subsidy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After the first redetermination, we will redetermine your subsidy eligibility at intervals determined by the Commissioner. The length of time between redeterminations varies depending on the likelihood that your situation may change in a way that affects your eligibility and whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> We may also redetermine your eligibility and whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy when you tell us of a change in your circumstances described in Sec. 418.3120.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> We may redetermine your eligibility when we receive information from you or from data exchanges with Federal and State agencies that may affect whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy or your eligibility for the subsidy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> We will also redetermine eligibility on a random sample of cases for quality assurance purposes. For each collection of sample cases, all factors affecting eligibility and/or whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy may be verified by contact with primary repositories of information relevant to each individual factor (e.g., we may contact employers to verify wage information). Consequently, we may contact a variety of other sources, in addition to recontacting you, to verify the completeness and accuracy of our information.</p><p class="depth3">Filing of Application</p>
