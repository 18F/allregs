Employers must ensure that shackles:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Have permanently affixed and legible identification markings as  prescribed by the manufacturer that indicate the recommended safe  working load;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Not be loaded in excess of its recommended safe working load as  prescribed on the identification markings by the manufacturer; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Not be used without affixed and legible identification markings  as required by paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hooks. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer's recommendations shall be followed  in determining the safe working loads of the various sizes and types of  specific and identifiable hooks. All hooks for which no applicable  manufacturer's recommendations are available shall be tested to twice  the intended safe working load before they are initially put into use.  The employer shall maintain and keep readily available a certification  record which includes the date   of such tests, the signature of the person who performed the test and an  identifier for the hook which was tested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Loads shall be applied to the throat of the hook since loading  the point overstresses and bends or springs the hook.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Hooks shall be inspected periodically to see that they have not  been bent by overloading. Bent or sprung hooks shall not be used.  [47 FR 16986, Apr. 20, 1982, as amended at 51 FR 34562, Sept. 29, 1986;  76 FR 33609, June 8, 2011]</p>
