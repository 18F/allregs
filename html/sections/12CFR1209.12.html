                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. As provided in section 1379B(b) of the Safety and  Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4639(b)), all hearings shall be open to the  public, except that the Director, in his discretion, may determine that  holding an open hearing would be contrary to the public interest. The  Director may make such determination sua sponte at any time by written  notice to all parties, or as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Motion for closed hearing. Within 20 days of service of the  notice of charges, any party may file with the presiding officer a  motion for a private hearing and any party may file a pleading in reply  to the motion. The presiding officer shall forward the motion and any  reply, together with a recommended decision on the motion, to the  Director, who shall make a final   determination. Such motions and replies are governed by Sec. 1209.28 of  this part. A determination under this section is committed to the  discretion of the Director and is not a reviewable final agency action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Filing documents under seal. FHFA counsel of record, in his  discretion, may file or require the filing of any document or part of a  document under seal, if such counsel makes a written determination that  disclosure of the document would be contrary to the public interest. The  presiding officer shall issue an order to govern confidential  information, and take all appropriate steps to preserve the  confidentiality of such documents in whole or in part, including closing  any portion of a hearing to the public or issuing a protective order  under such terms as may be acceptable to FHFA counsel of record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedures for closed hearing. An evidentiary hearing, or any  part thereof, that is closed for the purpose of offering into evidence  testimony or documents filed under seal as provided in paragraph (c) of  this section shall be conducted under procedures that may include: prior  notification to the submitter of confidential information; provisions  for sealing portions of the record, briefs, and decisions; in camera  arguments, offers of proof, and testimony; and limitations on  representatives of record or other participants, as the presiding  officer may designate. Additionally, at such proceedings the presiding  officer may make an opening statement as to the confidentiality and  limitations and deliver an oath to the parties, representatives of  record, or other approved participants as to the confidentiality of the  proceedings.</p>
