                            <p class="depth0">Section 1232(a)(1) provides that any amount received by the holder upon the retirement of an obligation shall be considered as an amount received in exchange therefor. However, section 1232(a)(1) does not apply in the case of an obligation issued before January 1, 1955, which was not issued with interest coupons or in registered form on March 1, 1954. For treatment of gain on an obligation held by certain financial institutions, see section 582(c) and paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of Sec. 1.1232-3.
