                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If an authorized representative of the Secretary finds  conditions or practices, or violations of any requirement of the Act, or  of any requirement of this chapter applicable during the interim  regulatory program, but such violations do not create an imminent danger  to the health or safety of the public, or are not causing and cannot  reasonably be expected to cause significant, imminent environmental harm  to land, air, or water resources, the authorized representative shall  issue a notice of violation fixing a reasonable time for abatement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An authorized representative of the Secretary may extend the  time to abate a violation by written notice if the failure to abate  within the time set was not caused by the permittee's lack of diligence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An authorized representative of the Secretary may establish  interim steps in an abatement period. If the permittee fails to meet any  interim step within the time set, the authorized representative may  extend the time set for meeting the interim step, in accordance with  this section, or may issue a cessation order pursuant to Sec. 722.13 of  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The total time for abatement as originally fixed and  subsequently extended shall not exceed 90 days except upon a showing by  the permittee that it is not feasible to abate the violation within 90  calendar days due to one or more of the circumstances in Sec.  722.12(e). An extended abatement date pursuant to this section shall not  be granted when the permittee's failure to abate within 90 days has been  caused by a lack of diligence or intentional delay by the permittee in  completing the remedial action required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Circumstances which may qualify a surface coal mining operation  for an abatement period of more than 90 days are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where the permittee of an ongoing permitted operation has timely  applied for and diligently pursued a permit renewal or other necessary  approval of designs or plans but such permit or approval has not been or  will not be issued within 90 days after a valid permit expires or is  required, for reasons not within the control of the permittee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where there is a valid judicial order precluding abatement  within 90 days as to which the permittee has diligently pursued all  rights of appeal and as to which he or she has no other effective legal  remedy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where the permittee cannot abate within 90 days due to a labor  strike;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where climatic conditions preclude abatement within 90 days, or  where, due to climatic conditions, abatement within 90 days clearly:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Would cause more environmental harm than it would prevent; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Requires action that would violate safety standards established  by statute or regulation under the Mine Safety and Health Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Whenever an abatement time in excess of 90 days is permitted,  interim abatement measures shall be imposed to the extent necessary to  minimize harm to the public or the environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If any of the conditions in paragraphs (e) (1) through (4)  exist, the permittee may request the authorized representative to grant  an abatement period exceeding 90 days. The authorized representative  shall not grant such an   abatement period without the concurrence of the Director or his or her  designee and the abatement period granted shall not exceed the shortest  possible time necessary to abate the violation. The permittee shall have  the burden of establishing by clear and convincing proof that he or she  is entitled to an extension under the provisions of Sec. 722.12 (d) and  (e). In determining whether or not to grant an abatement period  exceeding 90 days the authorized representative may consider any  relevant written or oral information from the permittee or any other  source. The authorized representative shall promptly and fully document  in the file his or her reasons for granting or denying the request. The  inspector's immediate supervisor shall review this document before  concurring in or disapproving the extended abatement date and shall  promptly and fully document the reasons for his or her concurrence or  disapproval in the file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Any determination made under paragraph (g) shall be in writing  and shall contain a right of appeal to the Office of Hearings and  Appeals in accordance with 43 CFR 4.1281 and the regulations at 43 CFR  part 4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> No extension granted under paragraph (b) may exceed 90 days in  length. Where the condition or circumstance which prevented abatement  within 90 days exists at the expiration of any such extension, the  permittee may request a further extension in accordance with the  procedures of paragraph (g).
