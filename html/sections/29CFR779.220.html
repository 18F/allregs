                                Sec. 779.220  Unified operation may exist as to separately owned or
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Whether there is unified operation of related activities will thus  be of concern primarily in those cases where the related activities are  separately owned or controlled but where, through arrangement, agreement  or otherwise, they are so performed as to constitute a unified business  system organized for a common business purpose. For example, a group of  separately incorporated, separately owned companies, may agree to  conduct their activities in such manner as to be for all intents and  purposes a single business system except for the fact that the ownership  and control of the individual segments of the business are retained, in  part or in whole, by the individual companies comprising the unified  business system. The various units may operate under a single trade  name; construct their establishment to appear identical; use identical  equipment; sell generally the same goods or provide the same type of  services, and, in some cases, at uniform standardized prices; and in  other respects appear to the persons utilizing their services or  purchasing their goods as being the same business. They also may arrange  for group purchasing and warehousing; for advertising as a single  business; and for standardization of their records, as well as their  credit, employment, and other business policies and practices. In such  circumstances the activities may well be performed through ``unified  operation'' sufficient to consider all of the related activities  performed by the group of units as constituting one enterprise, despite  the separate ownership of the various segments and despite the fact that  the individual units or segments may retain control as to some or all of  their own activities. That this is in accord with the congressional  intent is plain, since where the Congress intended that such  arrangements shall not bring a group of certain individual retail or  service establishments into a single enterprise, provision to accomplish  such exception was specifically included. (See Sec. 779.226, discussing  the proviso in section 3(r) with respect to certain franchise and other  specified arrangements entered into between independently owned retail  or service establishments and other businesses.)    Sec. 779.221  ``Common control'' defined.</p><p class="depth0">Under the definition the ``enterprise'' includes all related  activities performed through ``common control'' for a common business  purpose. The word ``control'' may be defined as the act of fact of  controlling; power or authority to control; directing or restraining  domination. ``Control'' thus includes the power or authority to control.  In relation to the performance of the described activities, the  ``control,'' referred to in the definition in section 3(r) includes the  power to direct, restrict, regulate, govern, or administer the  performance of the activities. ``Common'' control includes the sharing  of control and it is not limited to sole control or complete control by  one person or corporation. ``Common'' control therefore exists where the  performance of the described activities are controlled by one person or  by a number of persons, corporations, or other organizational units  acting together. This is clearly supported by the definition which  specifically includes in the ``enterprise'' all such activities whether  performed by ``one or more corporate or other organizational units.''  The meaning of ``common control'' is discussed comprehensively in part  776 of this chapter.</p>
