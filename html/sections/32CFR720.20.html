                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Commanding officers afloat and ashore may permit  service of process of Federal or State courts upon members, civilian  employees, dependents, or contractors residing at or located on a naval  installation, if located within their commands. Service will not be made  within the command without the commanding officer's consent. The intent  of this provision is to protect against interference with mission  accomplishment and to preserve   good order and discipline, while not unnecessarily impeding the court's  work. Where practical, the commanding officer shall require that the  process be served in his presence, or in the presence of a designated  officer. In all cases, individuals will be advised to seek legal  counsel, either from a legal assistance attorney or from personal  counsel for service in personal matters, and from Government counsel for  service in official matters. The commanding officer is not required to  act as a process server. The action required depends in part on the  status of the individual requested and which State issued the process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In-State process. When a process server from a State or Federal  court from the jurisdiction where the naval station is located requests  permission to serve process aboard an installation, the command  ordinarily should not prevent service of process so long as delivery is  made in accordance with reasonable command regulations and is consistent  with good order and discipline. Withholding service may be justified  only in the rare case when the individual sought is located in an area  under exclusive Federal jurisdiction not subject to any reservation by  the State of the right to serve process. Questions on the extent of  jurisdiction should be referred to the staff judge advocate, command  counsel, or local naval legal service office. If service is permitted,  an appropriate location should be designated (for example, the command  legal office) where the process server and the member or employee can  meet privately in order that process may be served away from the  workplace. A member may be directed to report to the designated  location. A civilian may be invited to the designated location. If the  civilian does not cooperate, the process server may be escorted to the  location of the civilian in order that process may be served. A civilian  may be required to leave a classified area in order that the process  server may have access to the civilian. If unusual circumstances require  that the command not permit service, see Sec. 720.20(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Out-of-State process. In those cases where the process is to be  served by authority of a jurisdiction other than that where the command  is located, the person named is not required to accept process.  Accordingly, the process server from the out-of-State jurisdiction need  not be brought face-to-face with the person named in the process.  Rather, the process server should report to the designated command  location while the person named is contacted, apprised of the situation,  and advised that he may accept service, but also may refuse. In the  event that the person named refuses service, the process server should  be so notified. If service of process is attempted from out-of-State by  mail and refused, the refusal should be noted and the documents returned  to the sender. Questions should be referred to the staff judge advocate,  command counsel, or the local naval legal service office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Service of process arising from official duties. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever a  member or civilian employee of the Department of the Navy is served with  process because of his official position, the Judge Advocate General or  the Associate General Counsel (Litigation), as appropriate, shall be  notified by telephone, or by message if telephone is impractical.  Notification shall be confirmed by a letter report by the nearest  appropriate command. The letter report shall include the detailed facts  which give rise to the action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any member or civilian employee served with Federal or State  court civil or criminal process or pleadings (including traffic tickets)  arising from actions performed in the course of official duties shall  immediately deliver all such process and pleadings to the commanding  officer. The commanding officer shall ascertain the pertinent facts and  notify the Judge Advocate General or Associate General Counsel  (Litigation), as appropriate, by telephone or by message if telephone is  impractical, of the service and immediately forward the pleadings and  process to the relevant office. The member or civilian employee will be  advised of the right to remove civil or criminal proceedings from State  to Federal court under 28 U.S.C. 1442, 1442a, rights under the Federal  Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act (28 U.S.C. 2679b),  if applicable, and the right of a Federal employee to request   representation by Department of Justice attorneys in Federal (civil) or  State (civil or criminal) proceedings and in congressional proceedings  in which that person is sued in an individual capacity, as delineated in  28 CFR 50.15. Requests for representation shall be addressed to the  Judge Advocate General or Associate General Counsel (Litigation), as  appropriate, and shall be endorsed by the commanding officer, who shall  provide all necessary data relating to the questions of whether the  person was acting within the course of official duty or scope of  employment at the time of the incident out of which the suit arose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the service of process involves a potential claim against the  Government, see 32 CFR 750.12(a), 750.12(b), and 750.24. The right to  remove to Federal Court under 28 U.S.C. 1442 and 1442a must be  considered where the outcome of the State court action may influence a  claim or potential claim against the United States. Questions should be  directed to the Judge Advocate General or the Associate General Counsel  (Litigation).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Service of process of foreign courts. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Usually, the  amenability of members, civilian employees, and their dependents  stationed in a foreign country, to the service of process from courts of  the host country will have been settled by an agreement between the  United States and the foreign country concerned (for example, in the  countries of the signatory parties, amenability to service of civil  process is governed by paragraphs 5(g) and 9 of Article VIII of the NATO  Status of Forces Agreement, TIAS 2846). When service of process on a  person described above is attempted within the command in a country in  which the United States has no agreement on this subject, advice should  be sought from the Judge Advocate General or the Associate General  Counsel (Litigation), as appropriate. When service of process is upon  the United States Government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities  as the named defendant, the doctrine of sovereign immunity may allow the  service of process to be returned to the court through diplomatic  channels. Service of process directed to an official of the United  States, on the other hand, must always be processed in accordance with  the applicable international agreement or treaty, regardless of whether  the suit involves acts performed in the course of official duties. The  Judge Advocate General or the Associate General Counsel (Litigation), as  appropriate, will arrange through the Department of Justice for defense  of the suit against the United States or an official acting within the  scope of official duties, or make other arrangements, and will issue  instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Usually, the persons described in Sec. 720.20(c)(1) are not  required to accept service of process outside the geographic limits of  the jurisdiction of the court from which the process issued. In such  cases, acceptance of the service is not compulsory, but service may be  voluntarily accepted in accordance with Sec. 720.20(b). In exceptional  cases when the United States has agreed that service of process will be  accepted by such persons when located outside the geographic limits of  the jurisdiction of the court from which the process issued, the  provisions of the agreement and of Sec. 720.20(a) will govern.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Under the laws of some countries (such as Sweden), service of  process is effected by the document, in original or certified copy,  being handed to the person for whom the service is intended. Service is  considered to have taken place even if the person refuses to accept the  legal documents. Therefore, if a commanding officer or other officer in  the military service personally hands, or attempts to hand, that person  the document, service is considered to have been effected, permitting  the court to proceed to judgment. Upon receipt of foreign process with a  request that it be served upon a person described in Sec. 720.20(c)(1),  a commanding officer shall notify the person of the fact that a  particular foreign court is attempting to serve process and also inform  that person that the process may be ignored or received. If the person  to be served chooses to ignore the service, the commanding officer will  return the document to the embassy or consulate of the foreign country  with the notation that the commanding officer had the document, that the  person chose to ignore it, and   that no physical offer of service had been made. The commanding officer  will advise the Judge Advocate General or the Associate General Counsel  (Litigation), as appropriate, of all requests for service of process  from a foreign court and the details thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Leave or liberty to be granted persons served with process. When  members or civilian employees are either served with process, or  voluntarily accept service of process, in cases where the United States  is not a party to the litigation, the commanding officer normally will  grant leave or liberty to the person served to permit compliance with  the process, unless to do so would have an adverse impact on naval  operations. When a member or civilian employee is a witness for a  nongovernmental party because of performance of official duties, the  commanding officer may issue the person concerned permissive orders  authorizing attendance at the trail at no expense to the Government. The  provisions of 32 CFR part 725 must also be considered in such cases.  Members or civilian employees may accept allowances and mileage  tendered; however, any fees tendered for testimony must be paid to the  Department of the Navy unless the member or employee is on authorized  leave while attending the judicial proceeding. When it would be in the  best interests of the United States Government (for example, in State  criminal trails), travel funds may be used to provide members and  civilian employees as witnesses as provided in the Joint Federal Travel  Regulations. Responsibility for the payment of the member's mileage and  allowances will be determined pursuant to the Joint Federal Travel  Regulations, Volume 1, paragraph M6300, subsections 1-3. \3\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\3\ See footnote 1 of Sec. 720.5(b). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Report where service not allowed. Where service of process is  not permitted, or where the member or civilian employee is not given  leave, liberty, or orders to attend a judicial proceeding, a report of  such refusal and the reasons therefor shall be made by telephone, or  message if telephone is impractical, to the Judge Advocate General or  the Associate General Counsel (Litigation), as appropriate.</p>
