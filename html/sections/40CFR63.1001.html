                            <p class="depth0">All terms used in this part shall have the meaning given them in the Act and in this section.</p><p class="depth0">Closed-loop system means an enclosed system that returns process fluid to the process and is not vented directly to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0">Closed-purge system means a system or combination of systems and portable containers to capture purged liquids. Containers must be covered or closed when not being filled or emptied.</p><p class="depth0">Closed-vent system means a system that is not open to the atmosphere and is composed of piping, ductwork, connections, and, if necessary, flow inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from an emission point to a control device.</p><p class="depth0">Combustion device means an individual unit of equipment, such as a flare, incinerator, process heater, or boiler, used for the combustion of organic emissions.</p><p class="depth0">Connector means flanged, screwed, or other joined fittings used to connect two pipelines or a pipeline and a piece of equipment. A common connector is a flange. Joined fittings welded completely around the circumference of the interface are not considered connectors for the purpose of this regulation. For the purpose of reporting and recordkeeping, connector means joined fittings that are not inaccessible, ceramic, or ceramic-lined (e.g., porcelain, glass, or glass-lined) as described in Sec.  63.1008(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Control device means any combustion device, recovery device, recapture device, or any combination of these devices used to comply with this part. Such equipment or devices include, but are not limited to, absorbers, carbon adsorbers, condensers, incinerators, flares, boilers, and process heaters. Primary condensers on steam strippers or fuel gas systems are not considered control devices.</p><p class="depth0">Distance piece means an open or enclosed casing through which the piston rod travels, separating the compressor cylinder from the crankcase.</p><p class="depth0">Double block and bleed system means two block valves connected in series with a bleed valve or line that can vent the line between the two block valves.</p><p class="depth0">Equipment means each pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, connector, and instrumentation system in regulated material service; and any control devices or systems used to comply with this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">First attempt at repair, for the purposes of this subpart, means to take action for the purpose of stopping or reducing leakage of organic material to the atmosphere, followed by monitoring as specified in Sec.  63.1004(b) and, as applicable, in Sec.  63.1004(c), as appropriate, to verify whether the leak is repaired, unless the owner or operator determines by other means that the leak is not repaired.</p><p class="depth0">Fuel gas means gases that are combusted to derive useful work or heat.</p><p class="depth0">Fuel gas system means the offsite and onsite piping and flow and pressure control system that gathers gaseous stream(s) generated by onsite operations, may blend them with other sources of gas, and transports the gaseous stream for use as a fuel gas in combustion equipment, such as furnaces and gas turbines, either singly or in combination.</p><p class="depth0">In gas or vapor service means that a piece of equipment in regulated material service contains a gas or vapor at operating conditions.</p><p class="depth0">In heavy liquid service means that a piece of equipment in regulated material is not in gas or vapor service or in light liquid service.</p><p class="depth0">In light liquid service means that a piece of equipment in regulated-material service contains a liquid that meets the following conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The vapor pressure of one or more of the organic compounds is greater than 0.3 kilopascals at 20 +C,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The total concentration of the pure organic compounds constituents having a vapor pressure greater than 0.3 kilopascals at 20 +C is equal to or greater than 20 percent by weight of the total process stream, and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> The fluid is a liquid at operating conditions.</p><p class="depth0">(Note to definition of ``In light liquid service'': Vapor pressures may be determined by standard reference texts or ASTM D-2879.)</p><p class="depth0">In liquid service means that a piece of equipment in regulated material service is not in gas or vapor service.</p><p class="depth0">In organic hazardous air pollutant or in organic HAP service means that a piece of equipment either contains or contracts a fluid (liquid or gas) that is at least 5 percent by weight of total organic HAP's as determined according to the provisions of Sec.  63.180(d) of subpart H. The provisions of Sec.  63.180(d) of subpart H also specify how to determine that a piece of equipment is not in organic HAP service.</p><p class="depth0">In regulated material service means, for the purposes of this subpart, equipment which meets the definition of ``in VOC service'', ``in VHAP service'', ``in organic hazardous air pollutant service,'' or ``in other chemicals or groups of chemicals service'' as defined in the referencing subpart.</p><p class="depth0">In-situ sampling systems means nonextractive samplers or in-line samplers.</p><p class="depth0">In vacuum service means that equipment is operating at an internal pressure which is at least 5 kilopascals below ambient pressure.</p><p class="depth0">Initial startup means for new sources, the first time the source begins production. For additions or changes not defined as a new source by this subpart, initial startup means the first time additional or changed equipment is put into operation. Initial startup does not include operation solely for testing of equipment. Initial startup does not include subsequent startup of process units following malfunction or process unit shutdowns. Except for equipment leaks, initial startup also does not include subsequent startups (of process units following changes in product for flexible operation units or following recharging of equipment in batch unit operations).</p><p class="depth0">Instrumentation system means a group of equipment components used to condition and convey a sample of the process fluid to analyzers and instruments for the purpose of determining process operating conditions (e.g., composition, pressure, flow, etc.). Valves and connectors are the predominant type of equipment used in instrumentation systems; however, other types of equipment may also be included in these systems. Only valves nominally 1.27 centimeters (0.5 inches) and smaller, and connectors nominally 1.91 centimeters (0.75 inches) and smaller in diameter are considered instrumentation systems for the purposes of this subpart. Valves greater than nominally 1.27 centimeters (0.5 inches) and connectors greater than nominally 1.91 centimeters (0.75 inches) associated with instrumentation systems are not considered part of instrumentation systems and must be monitored individually.</p><p class="depth0">Liquids dripping means any visible leakage from the seal including dripping, spraying, misting, clouding, and ice formation. Indications of liquids dripping include puddling or new stains that are indicative of an existing evaporated drip.</p><p class="depth0">Nonrepairable means that it is technically infeasible to repair a piece of equipment from which a leak has been detected without a process unit or affected facility shutdown.</p><p class="depth0">Open-ended valve or line means any valve, except relief valves, having one side of the valve seat in contact with process fluid and one side open to atmosphere, either directly or through open piping.</p><p class="depth0">Organic monitoring device means a unit of equipment used to indicate the concentration level of organic compounds based on a detection principle such as infra-red, photo ionization, or thermal conductivity.</p><p class="depth0">Pressure release means the emission of materials resulting from the system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the relief device. This release can be one release or a series of releases over a short time period due to a malfunction in the process.</p><p class="depth0">Pressure relief device or valve means a safety device used to prevent operating pressures from exceeding the maximum allowable working pressure of the process equipment. A common pressure relief device is a spring-loaded pressure relief valve. Devices that are actuated either by a pressure of less than or equal to 2.5 pounds per square inch gauge or by a vacuum are not pressure relief devices.</p><p class="depth0">Process unit means the equipment specified in the definitions of process unit in the applicable referencing subpart. If the referencing subpart does not define process unit, then for the purposes of this part, process unit means the equipment assembled and connected by pipes or ducts to process raw materials and to manufacture an intended product.</p><p class="depth0">Process unit shutdown means a work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit, or part of a process unit during which it is technically feasible to clear process material from a process unit, or part of a process unit, consistent with safety constraints and during which repairs can be affected. The following are not considered process unit shutdowns:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> An unscheduled work practice or operations procedure that stops production from a process unit, or part of a process unit, for less than 24 hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> An unscheduled work practice or operations procedure that would stop production from a process unit, or part of a process unit, for a shorter period of time than would be required to clear the process unit, or part of the process unit, of materials and start up the unit, and would result in greater emissions than delay of repair of leaking components until the next scheduled process unit shutdown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> The use of spare equipment and technically feasible bypassing of equipment without stopping production.</p><p class="depth0">Referencing subpart means the subpart which refers an owner or operator to this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Regulated material, for purposes of this subpart, refers to gases from volatile organic liquids (VOL), volatile organic compounds (VOC), hazardous air pollutants (HAP), or other chemicals or groups of chemicals that are regulated by the referencing subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Regulated source for the purposes of this subpart, means the stationary source, the group of stationary sources, or the portion of a stationary source that is regulated by a referencing subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Relief device or valve means a valve used only to release an unplanned, nonroutine discharge. A relief valve discharge can result from an operator error, a malfunction such as a power failure or equipment failure, or other unexpected cause that requires immediate venting of gas from process equipment in order to avoid safety hazards or equipment damage.</p><p class="depth0">Repaired, for the purposes of this subpart means the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Equipment is adjusted, or otherwise altered, to eliminate a leak as defined in the applicable sections of this subpart, and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Equipment, unless otherwise specified in applicable provisions of this subpart, is monitored as specified in Sec.  63.1004(b) and, as applicable in Sec. Sec.  63.1004(c) and 63.1015 of this part as appropriate, to verify that emissions from the equipment are below the applicable leak definition.</p><p class="depth2">Routed to a process or route to a process means the emissions are conveyed to any enclosed portion of a process unit where the emissions are predominantly recycled and/or consumed in the same

manner as a material that fulfills the same function in the process and/or transformed by chemical reaction into materials that are not regulated materials and/or incorporated into a product; and /or recovered.</p><p class="depth2">Sampling connection system means an assembly of equipment within a process unit or affected facility used during periods of representative operation to take samples of the process fluid. Equipment used to take nonroutine grab samples is not considered a sampling connection system.</p><p class="depth2">Screwed (threaded) connector means a threaded pipe fitting where the threads are cut on the pipe wall and the fitting requires only two pieces to make the connection (i.e., the pipe and the fitting).</p><p class="depth2">Sensor means a device that measures a physical quantity or the change in a physical quantity, such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, pH, or liquid level.</p><p class="depth2">Set pressure means the pressure at which a properly operating pressure relief device begins to open to relieve atypical process system operating pressure.</p><p class="depth2">Start-up means the setting into operation of a piece of equipment or a control device that is subject to this subpart.
