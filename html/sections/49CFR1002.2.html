                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Manner of payment. (1) Except as specified in this section, all filing fees will be payable at the time and place the application, petition, notice, tariff, contract summary, or other document is tendered for filing. Filing fees for tariffs, including schedules, and contract summaries, including supplements (Item 78), and filing fees for documents submitted for recording (Item 83) may be charged to accounts established by the Board in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as specified in this section, all filing fees will be payable at the time and place the application, petition, notice, tariff, contract summary, or other document is tendered for filing. Filing fees for tariffs, including schedules, and contract summaries, including supplements (Item 78), and filing fees for documents submitted for recording (Item 83) may be charged to accounts established by the Board in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Billing account procedure. Form STB-1032 must be submitted to the Board's Section of Financial Services to establish STB billing accounts for filing fees for tariffs and for documents submitted for recording.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fees will be payable to the Surface Transportation Board, by check payable in United States currency drawn upon funds deposited in a United States or foreign bank or other financial institution, money order payable in United States currency, or by credit card.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any filing that is not accompanied by the appropriate filing fee, payment via credit card or STB billing account, or a request for waiver of the fee, is deficient. However, the Board may find that a tariff which is submitted without the appropriate filing fee is deficient and reject the tariff filing, if the filer repeatedly fails to submit the appropriate filing fee after the Board has advised the filer of the proper filing fee and tariff filing procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Fees not refundable. Fees will be assessed for every filing in the type of proceeding listed in the schedule of fees contained in paragraph (f) of this section, subject to the exceptions contained in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. After the application, petition, notice, tariff, contract, or other document has been accepted for filing by the Board, the filing fee will not be refunded, regardless of whether the application, petition, notice, tariff, contract, or other document is granted or approved, denied, rejected before docketing, dismissed, or withdrawn. If an individual exemption proceeding becomes a matter of general applicability and is handled through the rulemaking process, the Board will refund the filing fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Related or consolidated proceedings. (1)(i) Except as provided for in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, separate fees need not be paid for related applications filed by the same applicant that would be the subject of one proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> Except as provided for in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, separate fees need not be paid for related applications filed by the same applicant that would be the subject of one proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided for in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, separate fees need not be paid for related applications filed by the same applicant that would be the subject of one proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In proceedings filed under the rail consolidation procedures at 49 CFR part 1180, the applicable filing fee must be paid for each proceeding submitted concurrently with the primary application. The fee for each type of proceeding is set forth in the fee schedule contained in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A separate fee will be assessed for the filing of an application for temporary authority to operate a motor carrier of passengers as provided for in paragraph (f)(5) of this section regardless of whether such application is related to a corresponding transfer proceeding as provided for in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Board may reject concurrently filed applications, petitions, notices, contracts, or other documents asserted to be related and refund the filing fee if, in its judgment, they embrace two or more severable matters which should be the subject of separate proceedings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Waiver or reduction of filing fees. It is the general policy of the Board not to waive or reduce filing fees except as described below:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Filing fees are waived for an application or other proceeding which is filed by a federal government agency, or a state or local government entity. For purposes of this section the phrases ``federal government agency'' or ``government entity'' do not include a quasi-governmental corporation or government subsidized transportation company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In extraordinary situations the Board will accept requests for waivers or fee reductions in accordance with the following procedure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When to request. At the time that a filing is submitted to the Board the

applicant may request a waiver or reduction of the fee prescribed in this part. Such request should be addressed to the Chief, Section of Administration, Office of Proceedings, Surface Transportation Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Basis. The applicant must show the waiver or reduction of the fee is in the best interest of the public, or that payment of the fee would impose an undue hardship upon the requestor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Board action. The Chief, Section of Administration, Office of Proceedings, Surface Transportation Board will notify the applicant of the decision to grant or deny the request for waiver or reduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Schedule of filing fees.
