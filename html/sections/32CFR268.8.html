                                Sec. 268.8  Flash report of major foreign debt arrearages.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Major foreign debt arrearages are monitored by the NAC. Therefore,  periodically DSAA will request flash reports from the DoD Components to  satisfy NAC requirements for information on major foreign debt  arrearages. For this purpose, a ``major'' foreign debt arrearage is any  country program arrearage which involves the sum of $250,000 or more.  Flash reports will be submitted directly to DSAA by the local command in  message form with information copies to the next higher command. The  report will reflect any significant changes in major foreign debt  arrearages from the quarterly foreign indebtedness reports submitted in   accordance with Sec. 268.6. Collections, information on increased  indebtedness, problems encountered in unsuccessful collection attempts,  or country circumstances which may adversely affect collections are  examples of the information which should be included in the flash  reports.</p>
