                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is Department of the Navy policy to cooperate, as prescribed  in this instruction, with courts and federal, state and local officials  in enforcing court orders. The Department of the Navy will cooperate  with requests when such action is consistent with mission requirements  (including operational readiness), the provisions of applicable  international agreements, and ongoing Department of Defense (DoD)  investigations and courts-martial.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Every reasonable effort will be made to resolve the matter  without the respondent returning to the United States, or other action  being taken against the respondent under this instruction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requests to return members for felonies or for contempt  involving unlawful or contemptuous removal of a child from the  jurisdiction of a court or the custody of a parent or other person  awarded custody by a court order will normally be granted, but only if  the member cannot resolve the issue with the court without return to the  United States. When the member's return is inconsistent with mission  requirements, applicable international agreements, or ongoing DoD  investigations or courts-martial, DoD approval of denial will be  requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For all other requests involving members, return will be based  on the circumstances of the individual case as provided in this  instruction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Members will normally be returned on a temporary additional duty  (TAD) basis unless there are compelling reasons the return should be a  permanent change of duty station (PCS).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The involuntary return of employees or family members in  response to a request for return is not authorized. However, the  following action will be taken:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Employees will be strongly urged to comply with court orders.  Failure to comply with court orders involving felonies or contempt  involving unlawful or contemptuous removal of a child from the  jurisdiction of the court or the custody of a parent or other person  awarded custody by a court order will normally require processing for  adverse action, up to and including removal from federal service.  Failure to comply with other court orders may require adverse action,  depending on the circumstances of the individual case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Family members will be strongly encouraged to comply with court  orders. Family members who fail to comply with court orders involving  felonies or contempt involving unlawful or contemptuous removal of a  child from the jurisdiction of the court or the custody of a parent or  other person awarded custody by a court order will normally have their  command sponsorship removed. Failure to comply with other court orders  may also result in removal of command sponsorship, depending on the  circumstances of the individual case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> To facilitate prompt resolution of requests for return of  members, minimize the burden on operating units, and to provide  consistency during initial implementation of this new program, a limited  number of responsible officials, designated in Sec. 720.44, will  respond to requesting officials.</p>
