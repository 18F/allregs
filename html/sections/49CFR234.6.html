Any person (an entity of any type covered under 1  U.S.C. 1, including but not limited to the following: A railroad; a  manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of a railroad;  any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, track,  or facilities; any independent contractor providing goods or services to  a railroad; and any employee of such owner, manufacturer, lessor,  lessee, or independent contractor) who violates any requirement of this  part, except for any violation of Sec. 234.11 of this part, or causes  the violation of any such requirement is subject to a civil penalty of  at least $650, but not more than $25,000 per violation, except that:  Penalties may be assessed against individuals only for willful  violations, and where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of  repeated violations has created an imminent hazard of death or injury to  persons, or has caused death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $105,000  per violation may be assessed. Each day a violation continues shall  constitute a separate offense. Appendix A to this part contains a  schedule of civil penalty amounts used in connection with this rule. The  railroad is not responsible for compliance with respect to any condition  inconsistent with the technical standards   set forth in this part where such variance arises as a result of actions  beyond the control of the railroad and the railroad could not have  prevented the variance through the exercise of due diligence. The  foregoing sentence does not excuse any instance of noncompliance  resulting from the actions of the railroad's employees, agents, or  contractors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Criminal penalty. Whoever knowingly and willfully makes, causes  to be made, or participates in the making of a false entry in reports  required to be filed by this part, or files a false report or other  document required to be filed by this part, except for any document  filed pursuant to Sec. 234.11 of this part, is subject to a $5,000 fine  and 2 years imprisonment as prescribed by 49 U.S.C. 522(a) and 21311(a).
