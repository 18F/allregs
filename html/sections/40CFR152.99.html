                            <p class="depth0">An original data submitter may petition the Agency to deny or cancel  the registration of a product in accordance with this section if he has  submitted to the Agency a valid study which, he claims, satisfies a data  requirement that an applicant purportedly has failed to satisfy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Grounds for petition. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an applicant has offered to pay  compensation to an original data submitter of a study (either  specifically or by filing a general offer to pay statement), the  original data submitter may petition the Agency to deny or cancel the  registration to which the offer related on any of the following grounds:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The applicant has failed to participate in an agreed-upon  procedure for reaching an agreement on the amount and terms of  compensation. The petitioner shall submit a copy of the agreed-upon  procedure and describe the applicant's failure to participate in the  procedure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The applicant has failed to comply with the terms of an  agreement on compensation. The petitioner shall submit a copy of the  agreement, and shall describe how the applicant has failed to comply  with the agreement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The applicant has failed to participate in an arbitration  proceeding. The petitioner shall submit evidence of such failure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The applicant has failed to comply with the terms of an  arbitration decision. The petitioner shall submit a copy of the  arbitration decision, and describe how the applicant has failed to  comply with the decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When no offer to pay has been made, the petitioner shall state  in his petition the basis for the challenge, and describe how the  failure of the applicant to comply with the procedures of this subpart  has deprived him of the rights accorded him under FIFRA section  3(c)(1)(F). Possible grounds for challenge include, but are not limited  to, the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The applicant has failed to list a data requirement applicable  to his product, or has failed to demonstrate compliance with all  applicable data requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The applicant has submitted or cited a study that is not valid.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The applicant has submitted or cited a study that does not  satisfy the data requirement for which it was submitted or cited.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The applicant has falsely or improperly claimed that a data gap  existed at the time of his application.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The applicant has submitted or cited a study originally  submitted by the petitioner, without the required authorization or offer  to pay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure for petition to the Agency--(1) Time for filing. A  petition under paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section may be filed at any time  that the circumstances warrant. A petition under paragraph (a)(2) of  this section must be filed within one year after the Agency makes public  the issuance of the registration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice to affected registrant. At the same time that the  petitioner files his petition with the Agency, the petitioner shall send  a copy to the affected applicant or registrant by certified mail or by  any other method that provides evidence of delivery. The affected  applicant or registrant shall have 60 days from the date of receipt of  the petition to submit written comments to the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disposition of petitions. The Agency will consider the material  submitted by the petitioner and the response, if any, by the affected  applicant or registrant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Agency determines that the petition is without merit, it  will inform the petitioner and the affected applicant or registrant that  the petition is denied. Denial of a petition is a final Agency action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Agency determines that an applicant has acted in any way  described by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Agency will notify  the petitioner and the affected applicant or   registrant that it intends to deny or cancel the registration of the  product in support of which the data were cited. The affected applicant  or registrant will have 15 days from the date of delivery of this notice  to respond. If the Agency determines, after considering any response,  that the affected applicant or registrant has acted in the ways  described by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Agency will deny or  cancel the registration without further hearing. Refer to FIFRA section  3(c)(1)(F)(ii). Denial or cancellation of a registration is a final  Agency action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the  Agency determines that an applicant for registration of a product has  acted in any way that deprives an original data submitter of rights  under FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F), the Agency will take steps to deny the  application or cancel the registration, as appropriate. The procedures  in FIFRA section 3(c)(6) or section 6(b) shall be followed. Denial or  cancellation is a final Agency action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Hearing. Any hearing will be conducted in accordance with the  procedures in 40 CFR part 164. The only matter for resolution at the  hearing shall be whether the registrant failed to comply with the  requirements and procedures of FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F) or of this  subpart, in the manner described by the petitioner. A decision following  a hearing shall be final.  [49 FR 30903, Aug. 1, 1984, as amended at 73 FR 75595, Dec. 12, 2008; 79  FR 6826, Feb. 5, 2014]</p>
