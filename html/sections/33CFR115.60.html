                            <p class="depth0">The following procedures will be observed in the handling of  applications for permits to construct, modify, or replace bridges over  navigable waters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> District Commander's review of application and plans. When an  application is received, the District Commander verifies the authority  for construction of the bridge, reviews the application and plans for  sufficiency, ascertains the views of local authorities and other  interested parties, and ensures that the application complies with  relevant environmental laws, regulations, and orders. If the application  contains any defects that would prevent issuance of a permit (as for  example, if the proposed bridge provided insufficient clearance), the  applicant is notified that the permit cannot be granted and given  reasons for this determination. The applicant may then request that the  application be considered by the Commandant. If the applicant makes such  a request, or if the application is not found defective, the District  Commander notifies the public that it has been received and continues  its processing. A copy of this notification will be sent to the state,  interstate agency or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  responsible for acting on requests for water quality certification for  the project. If the state, interstate agency, or the EPA fails to issue  or deny the water quality certification within 30 days after receiving  the copy of this notification, the requirements for a water quality   certification are waived. If the appropriate agency notifies the  District Commander that the applicant has not filed a request for water  quality certification, or requests additional time to review an  application, additional time will be granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Public meeting. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Public meetings will be held when there are  substantial issues concerning the effect that the proposed bridge will  have on the reasonable needs of navigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice of the public meeting will be published in the Federal  Register. Notice of the meeting is also mailed to State, county, and  municipal authorities and all other known interested parties. It is also  posted at the post office nearest the site and public places in the  vicinity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Meetings are public and conducted in an informal manner. A  designated Coast Guard official presides. The submission of written  statements is invited and encouraged. Anyone desiring to do so may  speak. Statements, written or oral, are not under oath, and cross- examination is not permitted. No fixed order has been established for  the presentation of evidence or argument although proponents are  generally heard first, followed by opponents with full opportunity  afforded for rebuttals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Report and recommendations. After the close of the comment  period and any public meeting, a detailed statement of findings,  conclusions, and recommendations based on all available information  (including Coast Guard records and experience) is prepared. The  following factors may be discussed in this report:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Comparison of proposed bridge with existing bridges over the  waterway; attitude of local authorities; summary of objections raised by  the public, and District Commander's comments or responses; probable  effect on navigation, present and prospective.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Description of the navigation on the waterway past the site of  the proposed bridge, the number and type of vessels, the number of  vessel trips, and the principal method of handling traffic, whether in  single vessels or in tows.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the District Commander approves, or recommends approval  of the plans. If they are found objectionable, the reasons for this  finding will be stated. If there are objectionable features in the plans  which may be corrected, the applicant is given an opportunity to revise  them. If approval is given or recommended, all conditions to which the  permit should be subject will be stated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Action on permit application. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The District Commander may  issue the permit if authorized under Sec.  1.01-60(b) of this chapter;  otherwise, a report with the application shall be submitted to the  Commandant for final action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When an application is approved, the issuing official signs the  permit and transmits it to the applicant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When an application is not approved, the applicant is notified  and provided with reasons for the disapproval and suggestions for  modifications that would justify reconsideration, if appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If an application is disapproved by the District Commander, the  applicant may appeal this decision to the Commandant under Sec.  114.50  of this chapter. The Commandant's determination shall constitute final  agency action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Permit amendments. Applications for amendments to permits will  be processed in the same manner as permit applications. The District  Commander may approve amendments to any permits which that official is  authorized to issue under Sec.  1.01-60(b) of this chapter. All other  amendments must be approved by the Commandant.
