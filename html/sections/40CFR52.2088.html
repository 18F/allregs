The revision establishes a one-hour attainment date of November 15, 2007 for the Rhode Island serious ozone nonattainment area, and approves the contingency measures for purposes of attainment. This revision establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2007 of 30.68 tons per day of volatile organic compounds and 33.97 tons per day of nitrogen oxides to be used in transportation conformity in the Rhode Island serious ozone nonattainment area. Rhode Island also commits to conduct a mid-course review to assess modeling and monitoring progress achieved towards the goal of attainment by 2007, and to submit the results to EPA by December 31, 2004.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination of Attainment. Effective July 6, 2010, EPA is determining that the Providence (All of Rhode Island) 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard.
