                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) has the  responsibility of adjusting each acquisition-related dollar threshold on  October 1 of each year that is evenly divisible by five. Acquisition- related dollar thresholds are defined as dollar thresholds that are  specified in law as a factor in defining the scope of the applicability  of a policy, procedure, requirement, or restriction provided in that law  to the procurement of property or services by an executive agency as  determined by the FAR Council. 41 U.S.C. 431a(c). Part 126, Subpart F,  Contract Assistance, contains acquisition-related dollar thresholds  subject to inflationary adjustments. The FAR Council shall publish a  notice of the adjusted dollar thresholds in the Federal Register. The  adjusted dollar thresholds shall take effect on the date of publication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In order to submit an offer on a specific HUBZone contract, the  qualified HUBZone SBC, together with its affiliates, must be small under  the size   standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A firm must be a qualified HUBZone SBC both at the time of its  initial offer and at the time of award in order to be eligible for a  HUBZone contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> At the time a qualified HUBZone SBC submits its initial offer,  and where applicable its final offer, on a specific HUBZone contract, it  must certify to the CO that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is a qualified HUBZone SBC that appears on SBA's List;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There has been no material change in its circumstances since the  date of certification shown on the List that could affect its HUBZone  eligibility;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It is small under the NAICS code assigned to the procurement;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the qualified HUBZone SBC was certified pursuant to  Sec. 126.200(b), it must represent that it will ``attempt to maintain''  (See Sec. 126.103) the required percentage of employees who are HUBZone  residents during the performance of a HUBZone contract. If the qualified  HUBZone SBC was certified pursuant to Sec. 126.200(a), then it must  represent that at least 35% of its employees engaged in performing the  HUBZone contract reside within any Indian reservation governed by one or  more of its Indian Tribal Government owners or reside within any HUBZone  adjoining any such Indian reservation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If submitting an offer as a joint venture, each qualified  HUBZone SBC must make the certifications in paragraph (c) of this  section separately under its own name.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A qualified HUBZone SBC may submit an offer on a HUBZone  contract for supplies as a nonmanufacturer if it meets the requirements  of the nonmanufacturer rule set forth at Sec. 121.406(b)(1) of this  chapter, and if the small manufacturer providing the end item for the  contact is also a qualified HUBZone SBC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There are no waivers to the nonmanufacturer rule for HUBZone  contracts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this  chapter do not apply to HUBZone contracts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For HUBZone contracts at or below $25,000 in total value, a  qualified HUBZone SBC may supply the end item of any manufacturer,  including a large business, so long as the product acquired is  manufactured or produced in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Multiple Award Contracts--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Total Set-Aside Contracts. The  qualified HUBZone SBC must comply with the applicable limitations on  subcontracting provisions (see Sec. 126.700) and the nonmanufacturer  rule (see Sec. 126.601), if applicable, in the performance of a contract  totally set-aside for HUBZone SBCs. However, the contracting officer, in  his or her discretion, may require the concern to perform the applicable  amount of work or comply with the nonmanufacturer rule for each order  awarded under the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Partial Set-Aside Contracts. For orders awarded under a partial  set-aside contract, the qualified HUBZone SBC must comply with the  applicable limitations on subcontracting provisions (see Sec. 126.700)  and the nonmanufacturer rule (see Sec. 126.601), if applicable, during  each performance period of the contract--e.g., during the base term and  then during each subsequent option thereafter. For orders awarded under  the non-set-aside portion, the qualified HUBZone SBC need not comply  with any limitations on subcontracting or nonmanufacturer rule  requirements. However, the contracting officer, in his or her  discretion, may require the concern to perform the applicable amount of  work or comply with the nonmanufacturer rule for each order awarded  under the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Orders. The qualified HUBZone SBC must comply with the  applicable limitations on subcontracting provisions (see Sec. 126.700)  and the nonmanufacturer rule (see Sec. 126.601), if applicable, in the  performance of each individual order that has been set-aside for HUBZone  SBCs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reserves. The qualified HUBZone SBC must comply with the  applicable limitations on subcontracting provisions (see Sec. 126.700)  and the nonmanufacturer rule (see Sec. 126.601), if applicable, in the  performance of an order that   is set aside for HUBZone SBCs. However, the qualified HUBZone SBC will  not have to comply with the limitations on subcontracting provisions and  the nonmanufacturer rule for any order issued against the Multiple Award  Contract if the order is competed amongst qualified HUBZone SBCs and one  or more other-than-small business concerns.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Recertification of Status for an Award. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A concern that is a  qualified HUBZone SBC at the time of initial offer and contract award,  including a Multiple Award Contract, is considered a HUBZone SBC  throughout the life of that contract. This means that if a HUBZone SBC  is certified at the time of initial offer and contract award for a  Multiple Award Contract, then it will be considered a HUBZone SBC for  each order issued against the contract, unless a contracting officer  requests a new HUBZone SBC certification in connection with a specific  order. Where a concern is later decertified, the procuring agency may  exercise options and still count the award as an award to a HUBZone SBC.  However, the following exceptions apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where a HUBZone contract (or a contract awarded through full and  open competition based on the HUBZone price evaluation preference) is  novated to another business concern, the concern that will continue  performance on the contract must certify its status as a HUBZone SBC to  the procuring agency, or inform the procuring agency that it does not  qualify as a HUBZone SBC, within 30 days of the novation approval. If  the concern cannot certify that it qualifies as a HUBZone SBC, the  agency can no longer count the options or orders issued pursuant to the  contract, from that point forward, towards its HUBZone goals.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where a concern that is performing a HUBZone contract acquires,  is acquired by, or merges with another concern and contract novation is  not required, the concern must, within 30 days of the transaction  becoming final, recertify its HUBZone SBC status to the procuring  agency, or inform the procuring agency that it has been decertified or  no longer qualifies as a HUBZone SBC. If the contractor is unable to  recertify its status as a HUBZone SBC, the agency can no longer count  the options or orders issued pursuant to the contract, from that point  forward, towards its HUBZone goals. The agency must immediately revise  all applicable Federal contract databases to reflect the new status.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where there has been a HUBZone status protest on the  solicitation or contract, see Sec. 126.803(d) for the effect of the  status determination on the contract award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the purposes of contracts (including Multiple Award  Contracts) with durations of more than five years (including options), a  contracting officer must request that a business concern recertify its  HUBZone SBC status no more than 120 days prior to the end of the fifth  year of the contract, and no more than 120 days prior to exercising any  option.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A business concern that did not certify itself as a HUBZone SBC,  either initially or prior to an option being exercised, may recertify  itself as a HUBZone SBC for a subsequent option period if it meets the  eligibility requirements at that time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Recertification does not change the terms and conditions of the  contract. The limitations on subcontracting, nonmanufacturer and  subcontracting plan requirements in effect at the time of contract award  remain in effect throughout the life of the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where the contracting officer explicitly requires concerns to  recertify their status in response to a solicitation for an order, SBA  will determine eligibility as of the date the concern submits its self- representation as part of its response to the solicitation for the order  and at the time of award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A concern's status may be determined at the time of submission  of its initial response to a solicitation for and award of an Agreement  and each order issued pursuant to the Agreement.
