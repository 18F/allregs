Agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of production are hereby authorized and the approval of the Department of the Interior or any agency thereof is not required with respect thereto, but nothing in any such agreement modifies any of the obligations of the lessee under its lease and the regulations in this part. All such obligations are to remain in full force and effect, the same as if free of any such royalties or payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The existence of agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of production, whether or not actually paid, will not be considered in justifying the shutdown or abandonment of any well.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of production need not be filed with the Superintendent unless incorporated in assignments or instruments required to be filed pursuant to Sec. 226.29.</p>
