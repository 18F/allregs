                            <p class="depth0">Upon approving a State permit program, EPA will send to the State  agency administering the permit program any relevant information which  was collected by EPA. The Memorandum of Agreement under Sec. 123.24  (or, in the case of a sewage sludge management program, Sec. 501.14 of  this chapter) will provide for the following, in such manner as the  State Director and the Regional Administrator agree:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prompt transmission to the State Director from the Regional  Administrator of copies of any pending permit applications or any other  relevant information collected before the approval of the State permit  program and not already in the possession of the State Director. When  existing permits are transferred to the State Director (e.g., for  purposes of compliance monitoring, enforcement or reissuance), relevant  information includes support files for permit issuance, compliance  reports and records of enforcement actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures to ensure that the State Director will not issue a  permit on the basis of any application received from the Regional  Administrator which the Regional Administrator identifies as incomplete  or otherwise deficient until the State Director receives information  sufficient to correct the deficiency.
