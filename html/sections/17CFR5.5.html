                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 5.23 of this part, no retail foreign  exchange dealer, futures commission merchant, or in the case of an  introduced account no introducing broker, may open an account that will  engage in retail forex transactions for a retail forex customer, unless  the retail foreign exchange dealer, futures commission merchant or  introducing broker first:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a retail foreign exchange dealer or a person  required to register as an introducing broker solely by reason of this  part, furnishes the retail forex customer with a separate written  disclosure statement containing only the language set forth in paragraph  (b) of this section and the disclosure required by paragraph (e) of this  section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a futures commission merchant or a person  required to register as an introducing broker because it engages in the  activities described in Sec. 1.3(mm) of this chapter, furnishes the  retail forex customer with a separate written disclosure statement  containing only the language set forth in paragraph (b) of this section  and the disclosure required by paragraph (e) of this section; Provided,  however, that the disclosure statement may be attached to other  documents as the initial page(s) of such documents and as the only  material on such page(s); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Receives from the retail forex customer an acknowledgment signed  and dated by the retail forex customer that he received and understood  the disclosure statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The language set forth in the written disclosure statement  required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth0">RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT</p><p class="depth0">OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE THE LEVERAGED  TRADING OF CONTRACTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY CONDUCTED WITH A  FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT OR A RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEALER AS YOUR  COUNTERPARTY. BECAUSE OF THE LEVERAGE AND THE OTHER RISKS DISCLOSED  HERE, YOU CAN RAPIDLY LOSE ALL OF THE FUNDS YOU DEPOSIT FOR SUCH TRADING  AND YOU MAY LOSE MORE THAN YOU DEPOSIT.</p><p class="depth0">YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF AND CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING POINTS  BEFORE DETERMINING WHETHER SUCH TRADING IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> TRADING IS NOT ON A REGULATED MARKET OR EXCHANGE--YOUR DEALER IS  YOUR TRADING PARTNER WHICH IS A DIRECT CONFLICT OF INTEREST. BEFORE YOU  ENGAGE IN ANY RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING, YOU SHOULD CONFIRM THE  REGISTRATION STATUS OF YOUR COUNTERPARTY.</p><p class="depth0">The off-exchange foreign currency trading you are entering into is  not conducted on an interbank market, nor is it conducted on a futures  exchange subject to regulation as a designated contract market by the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The foreign currency trades you  transact are trades with the futures commission merchant or retail  foreign exchange dealer as your counterparty. WHEN YOU SELL, THE DEALER  IS THE BUYER. WHEN YOU BUY, THE DEALER IS THE SELLER. As a result, when  you lose money trading, your dealer is making money on such trades, in  addition to any fees, commissions, or spreads the dealer may charge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> AN ELECTRONIC TRADING PLATFORM FOR RETAIL FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSACTIONS IS NOT AN EXCHANGE. IT IS AN ELECTRONIC CONNECTION FOR  ACCESSING YOUR DEALER. THE TERMS OF AVAILABILITY OF SUCH A PLATFORM ARE  GOVERNED ONLY BY YOUR CONTRACT WITH YOUR DEALER.</p><p class="depth0">Any trading platform that you may use to enter off-exchange foreign  currency transactions is only connected to your futures commission  merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer. You are accessing that  trading platform only to transact with your dealer. You are not trading  with any other entities or customers of the dealer by accessing such  platform. The availability and operation of any such platform, including  the consequences of the unavailability of the trading platform for any  reason, is governed only by the terms of your account agreement with the  dealer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> YOUR DEPOSITS WITH THE DEALER HAVE NO REGULATORY PROTECTIONS.</p><p class="depth0">All of your rights associated with your retail forex trading,  including the manner and denomination of any payments made to you, are  governed by the contract terms established in your account agreement  with the futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer.  Funds deposited by you with a futures commission merchant or retail  foreign exchange dealer for trading off-exchange foreign currency  transactions are not subject to the customer funds protections provided  to customers trading on a contract market that is designated by the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Your dealer may commingle your  funds with its own operating funds or use them for other purposes. In  the event your dealer becomes bankrupt, any funds the dealer is holding  for you in addition to any amounts owed to you resulting from trading,  whether or not any assets are maintained in separate deposit accounts by  the dealer, may be treated as an unsecured creditor's claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> YOU ARE LIMITED TO YOUR DEALER TO OFFSET OR LIQUIDATE ANY  TRADING POSITIONS SINCE THE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT MADE ON AN EXCHANGE OR  MARKET, AND YOUR DEALER MAY SET ITS OWN PRICES.</p><p class="depth0">Your ability to close your transactions or offset positions is  limited to what your dealer will offer to you, as there is no other  market for these transactions. Your dealer may offer any prices it  wishes, and it may offer prices derived from outside sources or not in  its discretion. Your dealer may establish its prices by offering spreads  from third party prices, but it is under no obligation to do so or to  continue to do so. Your dealer may offer different prices to different  customers at any point in time on its own terms. The terms of your  account agreement alone govern the obligations your dealer has to you to  offer prices and offer offset or liquidating transactions in your  account and make any payments to you. The prices offered by your dealer  may or may not reflect prices available elsewhere at any exchange,  interbank, or other market for foreign currency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> PAID SOLICITORS MAY HAVE UNDISCLOSED CONFLICTS</p><p class="depth0">The futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer  may compensate introducing brokers for introducing your account in ways  which are not disclosed to you. Such paid solicitors are not required to  have, and may not have, any special expertise in trading, and may have  conflicts of interest based on the method by which they are compensated.  Solicitors working on behalf of futures commission merchants and   retail foreign exchange dealers are required to register. You should  confirm that they are, in fact registered. You should thoroughly  investigate the manner in which all such solicitors are compensated and  be very cautious in granting any person or entity authority to trade on  your behalf. You should always consider obtaining dated written  confirmation of any information you are relying on from your dealer or a  solicitor in making any trading or account decisions.</p><p class="depth0">FINALLY, YOU SHOULD THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE ANY STATEMENTS BY ANY  DEALERS OR SALES REPRESENTATIVES WHICH MINIMIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF, OR  CONTRADICT, ANY OF THE TERMS OF THIS RISK DISCLOSURE. SUCH STATEMENTS  MAY INDICATE POTENTIAL SALES FRAUD.</p><p class="depth0">THIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT, OF COURSE, DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND  OTHER ASPECTS OF TRADING OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS WITH  A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT OR RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEALER.</p><p class="depth0">I hereby acknowledge that I have received and understood this risk  disclosure statement.  ________________________________________________________________________  Date ________________________________________________________________________  Signature of Customer</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The acknowledgment required by paragraph (a) of this section  must be retained by the retail foreign exchange dealer, futures  commission merchant or introducing broker in accordance with Sec. 1.31  of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> This section does not relieve a retail foreign exchange dealer,  futures commission merchant or introducing broker from any other  disclosure obligation it may have under applicable law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Immediately following the language set forth in paragraph (b)  of this section, the statement required by paragraph (a) of this section  shall include, for each of the most recent four calendar quarters during  which the counterparty maintained retail forex customer accounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The total number of non discretionary retail forex customer  accounts maintained by the retail foreign exchange dealer or futures  commission merchant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The percentage of such accounts that were profitable during the  quarter; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The percentage of such accounts that were not profitable  during the quarter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identification of retail forex customer accounts for the purpose  of this disclosure and the calculation in determining whether each such  account was profitable or not profitable must be made in accordance with  Sec. 5.18(i) of this part. Such statement of profitable trades shall  include the following legend: PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY  INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Each retail foreign exchange dealer or  futures commission merchant shall provide, upon request, to any retail  forex customer or prospective retail forex customer the total number of  non discretionary retail forex accounts maintained by such foreign  exchange dealer or futures commission merchant, the percentage of such  accounts that were profitable and the percentage of such accounts that  were not profitable, calculated in accordance with Sec. 5.18(i) of this  part, for each calendar quarter during the most recent five year period  during which such retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission  merchant maintained non discretionary retail forex customer accounts.</p>
