The  length of the required notice period of the owner request for a rent  increase at the annual anniversary may be established by the PHA. The  request must   be submitted in the form and manner required by the PHA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The PHA may not approve and the owner may not receive any  increase of rent to owner until and unless the owner has complied with  all requirements of the HAP contract, including compliance with the HQS.
