                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of this subpart is to implement the requirements in the  High Seas Driftnet Fishing Moratorium Protection Act (``Moratorium  Protection Act'') to identify and certify nations whose vessels engaged  in illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing; whose fishing activities  result in bycatch of protected living marine resources; or whose vessels  engaged in fishing activities or practices on the high seas that target  or incidentally catch sharks where the nation has not adopted a  regulatory program for the conservation of sharks, comparable in  effectiveness to that of the United States, taking into account  different conditions. This language applies to vessels entitled to fly  the flag of the nation in   question. Where the Secretary of Commerce determines that an identified  nation has not taken the necessary actions to warrant receipt of a  positive certification, the Secretary of Commerce may recommend to the  President that the United States prohibit the importation of certain  fish and fish products from the identified nation or other measures. The  Secretary of Commerce will recommend to the President appropriate  measures, including trade restrictive measures, to be taken against  identified nations that have not received a positive certification, to  address the fishing activities or practices for which such nations were  identified in the biennial report. The Secretary of Commerce will make  such a recommendation on a case-by-case basis in accordance with  international obligations, including the World Trade Organization (WTO)  Agreement. The Moratorium Protection Act also authorizes cooperation and  assistance to nations to take action to combat illegal, unreported, or  unregulated fishing, reduce bycatch of protected living marine  resources, and achieve shark conservation.
