                                Sec.  351.305  Access to business proprietary information.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The administrative protective order. The Secretary will place an administrative protective order on the record within two business days after the day on which a petition is filed or an investigation is self-initiated, within five business days after the day on which a request for a new shipper review is properly filed in accordance with Sec. Sec.  351.214 and 351.303 or an application for a scope ruling is properly filed in accordance with Sec. Sec.  351.225 and 351.303, within five business days after the day on which a request for a changed circumstances review is properly filed in accordance with Sec. Sec.  351.216 and 351.303 or a changed circumstances review is self-initiated, or five business days after initiating any other segment of a proceeding. The administrative protective order will require the authorized applicant to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Establish and follow procedures to ensure that no employee of the authorized applicant's firm releases business proprietary information to any person other than the submitting party, an authorized applicant, or an appropriate Department official identified in section 777(b) of the Act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notify the Secretary of any changes in the facts asserted by the authorized applicant in its administrative protective order application;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Destroy business proprietary information by the time required under the terms of the administrative protective order;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Immediately report to the Secretary any apparent violation of the administrative protective order; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Acknowledge that any unauthorized disclosure may subject the authorized applicant, the firm of which the authorized applicant is a partner, associate, or employee, and any partner, associate, or employee of the authorized applicant's firm to sanctions listed in part 354 of this chapter (19 CFR part 354).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Application for access under administrative protective order. (1) Generally, no more than two independent representatives of a party to the proceeding may have access to business proprietary information under an administrative protective order. A party must designate a lead firm if the party has more than one independent authorized applicant firm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A representative of a party to the proceeding may apply for access to business proprietary information under the administrative protective order by submitting Form ITA-367 to the Secretary. Form ITA-367 must identify the applicant and the segment of the proceeding involved, state the basis for eligibility of the applicant for access to business proprietary information, and state the agreement of the applicant to be bound by the administrative protective order. Form ITA-367 may be prepared on the applicant's own wordprocessing system, and must be accompanied by a certification that the application is consistent with Form ITA-367 and an acknowledgment that any discrepancies will be interpreted in a manner consistent with Form ITA-367. An applicant must apply to receive all business proprietary information on the record of the segment of a proceeding in question, but may waive service of business proprietary information it does not wish to receive from other parties to the proceeding. An applicant must serve an APO application on the other parties by the most expeditious manner possible at the same time that it files the application with the Department.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> With respect to proprietary information submitted to the Secretary on or before the date on which the Secretary grants access to a qualified applicant, except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, within two business days the submitting party shall serve the party which has been granted access, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> To minimize the disruption caused by late applications, an application should be filed before the first questionnaire response has been submitted. Where justified, however, applications may be filed up to the date on which the case briefs are due, but any applicant filing after the first questionnaire response is submitted will be liable for costs associated with the additional production and service of business proprietary information already on the record. Parties have five business days to serve their business proprietary information already on the record to a party who has filed an application after the submission of the first questionnaire response and is authorized to receive such information after such information has been placed on the record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Approval of access under administrative protective order; administrative protective order service list. The Secretary will grant access to a qualified applicant by including the name of the applicant on an administrative protective order service list. Access normally will be granted within five days of receipt of the application unless there is a question regarding the eligibility of the applicant to receive access. In that case, the Secretary will decide whether to grant the applicant access within 30 days of receipt of the application. The Secretary will provide by the most expeditious means available the administrative protective order service list to parties to the proceeding on the day the service list is issued or amended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Additional filing requirements for importers. If an applicant represents a party claiming to be an interested party by virtue of being an importer, then the applicant shall submit, along with the Form ITA-367, documentary evidence demonstrating that during the applicable period of investigation or period of review the party imported subject merchandise. For a scope inquiry, the applicant must present documentary evidence that it imported subject merchandise, or that it has taken steps towards importing the merchandise subject to the scope inquiry.
