                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Taking oral deposition. A party may take the oral deposition of  any person. Reasonable written notice of deposition shall be served upon  the opposing party and the deponent. The attendance of a deponent may be  compelled by subpoena where authorized by law or by other order of the  hearing officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Testifying on oral deposition. Each person testifying on oral  deposition shall be placed under oath by the person before whom the  deposition is taken. The deponent may be examined and cross-examined.  The questions and the answers, together with all objections made, shall  be recorded by the person before whom the deposition is to be taken, or  under that person's direction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Submission to deponent. A transcript of the deposition shall be  submitted to the deponent for examination and signature, unless  submission is waived by the deponent and the parties. Any changes in  form or substance that the deponent desires to make shall be entered  upon the transcript by the person before whom the deposition was taken,  with a statement of reasons given by the deponent for making   them. The transcript shall then be signed by the deponent, unless the  parties by stipulation waive the signing or the deponent is ill, cannot  be found, or refuses to sign. If the transcript is not signed, the  person before whom the deposition was taken shall sign it and state on  the record the reason that it is not signed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Certification and filing. The person before whom the deposition  was taken shall make a certification on the transcript as to its  accuracy.

Subject to appropriate rulings by the  hearing officer on objections, the deposition or any part may be  introduced into evidence for any purpose if the deponent is unavailable.  Only that part of a deposition that is received in evidence at a hearing  shall constitute a part of the record in the proceeding upon which a  decision may be based. Nothing in this rule is intended to limit the use  of a deposition for impeachment purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Payment of fees. Fees shall be paid by the person upon whose  application the deposition is taken.</p>
