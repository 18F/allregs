                            <p class="depth0">A federal savings association may invest in real estate (improved or unimproved) to be used for office and related facilities of the association, or for such office and related facilities and for rental or sale, if such investment is made and maintained under a prudent program of property acquisition to meet the federal savings association's present needs or its reasonable future needs for office and related facilities. A federal savings association may not make an investment that would cause the outstanding book value of all such investments (including investments under Sec. 559.4(e)(2) of this chapter) to exceed its total capital.
