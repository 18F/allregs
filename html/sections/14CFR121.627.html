In that event, continuation toward that airport is an emergency situation as set forth in Sec. 121.557.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If any instrument or item of equipment required under this chapter for the particular operation becomes inoperative en route, the pilot in command shall comply with the approved procedures for such an occurrence as specified in the certificate holder's manual.
