You must demonstrate that  you have discovered a valuable deposit within the period covered by your  prospecting permit.

In addition to the requirements  of paragraph (a) of this section, BLM must determine that the lands are  chiefly valuable for the subject minerals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Asphalt. You may not obtain a preference right lease for  asphalt. However, you may obtain a competitive lease or a fringe acreage  lease under subpart 3508 or 3510 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Permits issued under the authority of Reorganization Plan No. 3  of 1946.
