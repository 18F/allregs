                            <p class="depth0">Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Act, in subpart A of this part, or in this section. If the same term is defined in subpart A of this part and in this section, it shall have the meaning given in this section for the purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Active ingredient means any material that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.

A unit operation may have more than one batch emission episode. For example, a displacement of vapor resulting from the charging of a vessel with HAP will result in a discrete emission episode that will last through the duration of the charge and will have an average flowrate equal to the rate of the charge. If the vessel is then heated, there will also be another discrete emission episode resulting from the expulsion of expanded vapor. Both emission episodes may occur in the same vessel or unit operation. There are possibly other emission episodes that may occur from the vessel or other process equipment, depending on process operations.</p><p class="depth0">Batch operation or Batch process means a noncontinuous operation involving intermittent or discontinuous feed into equipment, and, in general, involves the emptying of the equipment after the batch operation ceases and prior to beginning a new operation.

A segregated stormwater sewer system, which is a drain and collection system designed and operated for the sole purpose of collecting rainfall-runoff at a facility, and which is segregated from all other individual drain systems, is excluded from this definition.</p><p class="depth0">Initial startup means the first time a new or reconstructed source begins production. Initial startup does not include operation solely for testing equipment. Initial startup does not include subsequent start ups (as defined in this section) of processes following malfunctions or process shutdowns.</p><p class="depth0">Internal floating roof means a cover that rests or floats on the liquid surface (but not necessarily in complete contact with it) inside a storage tank or waste management unit that has a permanently affixed roof.</p><p class="depth0">Instrumentation system means a group of equipment components used to condition and convey a sample of the process fluid to analyzers and instruments for the purpose of determining process operating conditions (e.g., composition, pressure, flow, etc.).

If soluble and/or partially soluble HAP compounds are not recovered from water before discharge, the discharge point from the process equipment or storage tank is a POD. If water streams are routed to a recovery device, the discharge from the recovery device is a POD. There can be more than 1 POD per process or PMPU.</p><p class="depth0">Precursor means a material that is manufactured to undergo further chemical change or processing to ultimately manufacture an active ingredient or finished dosage form of a drug. This term does not include commodity chemicals produced by the synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry.</p><p class="depth0">Pressure release means the emission of materials resulting from the system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the pressure relief device. This release can be one release or a series of releases over a short time period due to a malfunction in the process.</p><p class="depth0">Pressure relief device or valve means a safety device used to prevent operating pressures from exceeding the maximum allowable working pressure of the process equipment.

For the purposes of this subpart, process includes any, all, or a combination of reaction, recovery, separation, purification, or other activity, operation, manufacture, or treatment which are used to produce a pharmaceutical product or isolated intermediate. Cleaning operations conducted are considered part of the process. Nondedicated solvent recovery operations located within a contiguous area within the affected source are considered single processes. A storage tank that is used to accumulate used solvent from multiple batches of a single process for purposes of solvent recovery does not represent the end of the process. Nondedicated formulation operations occurring within a contiguous area are considered a single process that is used to formulate numerous materials and/or products. Quality assurance and quality control laboratories are not considered part of any process. Ancillary activities are not considered a process or part of any process.

In a series of condensers, all condensers up to and including the first condenser with an exit gas temperature below the boiling or bubble point of the substance(s) at the liquid surface are considered to be process condensers. All condensers in line prior to a vacuum source are included in this definition.</p><p class="depth0">Process shutdown means a work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process or part of a process during which it is technically feasible to clear process material from a process or part of a process consistent with safety constraints and during which repairs can be effected. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process or part of a process for less than 24 hours is not a process shutdown. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that

would stop production from a process or part of a process for a shorter period of time than would be required to clear the process or part of the process of materials and start up the process, and would result in greater emissions than delay of repair of leaking components until the next scheduled process shutdown, is not a process shutdown. The use of spare equipment and technically feasible bypassing of equipment without stopping production are not process shutdowns.</p><p class="depth0">Process tank means a tank that is used to collect material discharged from a feedstock storage tank or unit operation and to transfer this material to another unit operation within the process or to a product storage tank. Surge control vessels and bottoms receivers that fit these conditions are considered process tanks. Product storage tanks are considered process tanks and are part of the PMPU that produce the stored material. For the purposes of this subpart, vents from process tanks are considered process vents.</p><p class="depth0">Process vent means a vent from a unit operation or vents from multiple unit operations within a process that are manifolded together into a common header, through which a HAP-containing gas stream is, or has the potential to be, released to the atmosphere. Examples of process vents include, but are not limited to, vents on condensers used for product recovery, bottom receivers, surge control vessels, reactors, filters, centrifuges, and process tanks. Emission streams that are undiluted and uncontrolled containing less than 50 ppmv HAP, as determined through process knowledge that no HAP are present in the emission stream or using an engineering assessment as discussed in Sec.  63.1257(d)(2)(ii); test data using Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-6; Method 320 of 40 CFR part 63; or any other test method that has been validated according to the procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of this part, are not considered process vents. Process vents do not include vents on storage tanks regulated under Sec.  63.1253, vents on wastewater emission sources regulated under Sec.  63.1256, or pieces of equipment regulated under Sec.  63.1255.</p><p class="depth0">Production-indexed HAP consumption factor is the result of dividing the annual consumption of total HAP by the annual production rate, per process.</p><p class="depth0">Production-indexed volatile organic compound (VOC) consumption factor is the result of dividing the annual consumption of total VOC by the annual production rate, per process.</p><p class="depth0">Publicly owned treatment works (POTW) means any devices and systems used in the storage, treatment, recycling, and reclamation of municipal sewage or industrial wastes of a liquid nature as defined in section 212(2)(A) of the Clean Water Act, as amended [33 U.S.C.
