                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Warden shall consider an inmate for controlled housing status when the inmate has been confirmed as testing HIV positive and when there is reliable evidence indicating that the inmate may engage in conduct posing a health risk to others. This evidence may come from the statements of the individual, repeated misconduct (including disciplinary actions), or other behavior suggesting that the inmate may engage in predatory or promiscuous sexual behavior, assaultive behavior where body fluids may be transmitted to another, or the sharing of needles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Warden shall submit a recommendation for referral of an inmate for placement in a controlled housing status to the Regional Director in the region where the inmate is located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Based on the perceived health risk to others posed by the inmate's threatened or actual actions, the Warden may, with the telephonic approval of the Regional Director, temporarily (not to exceed 20 work days) place an inmate in a special housing status (e.g., administrative detention, or a secure health service unit room) pending the inmate's appearance before the Hearing Administrator. Reasons for this placement, and the approval of the Regional Director, shall be documented in the inmate central file. The inmate should be seen daily by case management and medical staff while in this temporary status, and a psychological or psychiatric assessment report should be prepared during this temporary placement period.
