                            <p class="depth0">This section describes the general applicability provisions for bag  and possession limits specified in subparts B through V of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The bag and possession limits apply for  species/species groups in or from the EEZ. Unless specified otherwise,  bag limits apply to a person on a daily basis, regardless of the number  of trips in a day. Unless specified otherwise, a person is limited to a  single bag limit for a trip lasting longer than one calendar day. Unless  specified otherwise, possession limits apply to a person on a trip after  the first 24 hours of that trip. The bag and possession limits apply to  a person who fishes in the EEZ in any manner, except a person aboard a  vessel in the EEZ that has on board the commercial vessel permit  required under this part for the appropriate species/species group. The  possession of a commercial vessel permit notwithstanding, the bag and  possession limits apply when the vessel is operating as a charter vessel  or headboat. A person who fishes in the EEZ may not combine a bag limit  specified in subparts B through V of this part with a bag or possession  limit applicable to state waters. A species/species group subject to a  bag limit specified in subparts B through V of this part taken in the  EEZ by a person subject to the bag limits may not be transferred at sea,  regardless of where such transfer takes place, and such fish may not be  transferred in the EEZ. The operator of a vessel that fishes in the EEZ  is responsible for ensuring that the bag and possession limits specified  in subparts B through V of this part are not exceeded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]  [78 FR 22952, Apr. 17, 2013, as amended at 79 FR 19494, Apr. 9, 2014]</p>
