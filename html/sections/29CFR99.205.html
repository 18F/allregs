                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determining Federal awards expended. The determination of when  an award is expended should be based on when the activity related to the  award occurs. Generally, the activity pertains to events that require  the non-Federal entity to comply with laws, regulations, and the  provisions of contracts or grant agreements, such as: expenditure/ expense transactions associated with grants, cost-reimbursement  contracts, cooperative agreements, and direct appropriations; the  disbursement of funds passed through to subrecipients; the use of loan  proceeds under loan and loan guarantee programs; the receipt of  property; the receipt of surplus property; the receipt or use of program  income; the distribution or consumption of food commodities; the  disbursement of amounts entitling the non-Federal entity to an interest  subsidy; and, the period when insurance is in force.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Loan and loan guarantees (loans). Since the Federal Government  is at risk for loans until the debt is repaid, the following guidelines  shall be used to calculate the value of Federal awards expended under  loan programs, except as noted in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this  section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Value of new loans made or received during the fiscal year; plus</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Balance of loans from previous years for which the Federal  Government imposes continuing compliance requirements; plus</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any interest subsidy, cash, or administrative cost allowance  received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Loan and loan guarantees (loans) at institutions of higher  education. When loans are made to students of an institution of higher  education but the institution does not make the loans, then only the  value of loans made during   the year shall be considered Federal awards expended in that year. The  balance of loans for previous years is not included as Federal awards  expended because the lender accounts for the prior balances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prior loan and loan guarantees (loans). Loans, the proceeds of  which were received and expended in prior-years, are not considered  Federal awards expended under this part when the laws, regulations, and  the provisions of contracts or grant agreements pertaining to such loans  impose no continuing compliance requirements other than to repay the  loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Endowment funds. The cumulative balance of Federal awards for  endowment funds which are federally restricted are considered awards  expended in each year in which the funds are still restricted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Free rent. Free rent received by itself is not considered a  Federal award expended under this part. However, free rent received as  part of an award to carry out a Federal program shall be included in  determining Federal awards expended and subject to audit under this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Valuing non-cash assistance. Federal non-cash assistance, such  as free rent, food stamps, food commodities, donated property, or  donated surplus property, shall be valued at fair market value at the  time of receipt or the assessed value provided by the Federal agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Medicare. Medicare payments to a non-Federal entity for  providing patient care services to Medicare eligible individuals are not  considered Federal awards expended under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Medicaid. Medicaid payments to a subrecipient for providing  patient care services to Medicaid eligible individuals are not  considered Federal awards expended under this part unless a State  requires the funds to be treated as Federal awards expended because  reimbursement is on a cost-reimbursement basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Certain loans provided by the National Credit Union  Administration. For purposes of this part, loans made from the National  Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and the Central Liquidity Facility  that are funded by contributions from insured institutions are not  considered Federal awards expended.</p>
