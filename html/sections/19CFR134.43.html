Except for goods of a NAFTA country, articles of a class or kind listed below shall be marked legibly and conspicuously by die stamping, cast-in-the-mold lettering, etching (acid or electrolytic), engraving, or by means of metal plates which bear the prescribed marking and which are securely attached to the article in a conspicuous place by welding, screws, or rivets: knives, forks, steels, cleavers, clippers, shears, scissors, safety razors, blades for safety razors, surgical instruments, dental instruments, scientific and laboratory instruments, pliers, pincers, nippers and hinged hand tools for holding and splicing wire, vacuum containers, and parts of the above articles. Goods of a NAFTA country shall be marked by any reasonable method which is legible, conspicuous and permanent as otherwise provided in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Watch, clock, and timing apparatus. The country of origin marking requirements on watches, clocks, and timing apparatus are intensive and require special methods. (See Sec. 11.9 of this chapter and Chapter 91, Additional U.S. Note 4, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Native American-style jewelry--(1) Definition.

For the purpose of this provision, Native American-style jewelry is jewelry which incorporates traditional Native American design motifs, materials and/or construction and therefore looks like, and could possibly be mistaken for, jewelry made by Native Americans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Method of marking. Except as provided in 19 U.S.C. 1304(a)(3) and in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, Native American-style jewelry must be indelibly marked with the country of origin by cutting, die-sinking, engraving, stamping, or some other permanent method. The indelible marking must appear legibly on the clasp or in some other conspicuous location, or alternatively, on a metal or plastic tag indelibly marked with the country of origin and permanently attached to the article.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exception. If it is technically or commercially infeasible to mark in the manner specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, or in the case of a good of a NAFTA country, the article may be marked by means of a string tag or adhesive label securely affixed, or some other similar method.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Native American-style arts and crafts--(1) Definition. For the purpose of this provision, Native American-style arts and crafts are arts and crafts, such as pottery, rugs, kachina dolls, baskets and beadwork, which incorporate traditional Native American design motifs, materials and/or construction and therefore look like, and could possibly be mistaken for, arts and crafts made by Native Americans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition. For the purpose of this provision, Native American-style arts and crafts are arts and crafts, such as pottery, rugs, kachina dolls, baskets and beadwork, which incorporate traditional Native American design motifs, materials and/or construction and therefore look like, and could possibly be mistaken for, arts and crafts made by Native Americans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Method of Marking. Except as provided for in 19 U.S.C. 1304(a)(3) and Sec. 134.32 of this part, Native American-style arts and crafts must be indelibly marked with the country of origin by means of cutting, die-sinking, engraving, stamping, or some other equally permanent method. On textile articles, such as rugs, a sewn in label is considered to be an equally permanent method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exception. Where it is technically or commercially infeasible to mark in the manner specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, or in the case of a good of a NAFTA country, the article may be marked by means of a string tag or adhesive label securely affixed, or some other similar method.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Assembled articles. Where an article is produced as a result of an assembly operation and the country of origin of such article is determined under this chapter to be the country in which the article was finally assembled, such article may be marked, as appropriate, in a manner such as the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Assembled in (country of final assembly);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assembled in (country of final assembly) from components of (name of country or countries of origin of all components); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Made in, or product of, (country of final assembly).
