                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The fee schedule for ambulance services will be phased in over 5  years beginning April 1, 2002. Subject to the first sentence in  Sec. 414.610(a), payment for services furnished during the transition  period is made based on a combination of the fee schedule payment for  ambulance services and the amount the program would have paid absent the  fee schedule for ambulance services, as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> 2002 Payment. For services furnished in 2002, the payment for  the service component, the mileage component and, if applicable, the  supply component is based on 80 percent of the reasonable charge for  independent suppliers or on 80 percent of reasonable cost for providers,  plus 20 percent of the ambulance fee schedule amount for the service and  mileage components. The reasonable charge or reasonable cost portion of  payment in CY 2002 is equal to the supplier's reasonable charge  allowance or provider's reasonable cost allowance for CY 2001,  multiplied by the statutory inflation factor for ambulance services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> 2003 Payment. For services furnished in CY 2003, payment is  based on 60 percent of the reasonable charge or reasonable cost, as  applicable, plus 40 percent of the ambulance fee schedule amount. The  reasonable charge and reasonable cost portion in CY 2003 is equal to the  supplier's reasonable charge or provider's reasonable cost for CY 2002,  multiplied by the statutory inflation factor for ambulance services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> 2004 Payment. For services furnished in CY 2004, payment is  based on 40 percent of the reasonable charge or reasonable cost, as  applicable, plus 60 percent of the ambulance fee schedule amount. The  reasonable charge and reasonable cost portion in CY 2004 is equal to the  supplier's reasonable charge or provider's reasonable cost for CY 2003,  multiplied by the statutory inflation factor for ambulance services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> 2005 Payment. For services furnished in CY 2005, payment is  based on 20 percent of the reasonable charge or reasonable cost, as  applicable, plus 80 percent of the ambulance fee schedule amount. The  reasonable charge and reasonable cost portion in CY 2005 is equal to the  supplier's reasonable charge or provider's reasonable cost for CY 2004,  multiplied by the statutory inflation factor for ambulance services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> 2006 and Beyond Payment. For services furnished in CY 2006 and  thereafter, the payment is based solely on the ambulance fee schedule  amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Exception. There will be no blended payment allowance as  described in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section for  ground mileage in those States where the Medicare carrier paid  separately for all out-of-county ground ambulance mileage, but did not,  before the implementation of the Medicare   ambulance fee schedule, make a separate payment for any ground ambulance  mileage within the county in which the beneficiary was transported.  Payment for ground ambulance mileage in that State will be made based on  the full ambulance fee schedule amount for ground mileage. This  exception applies only to carrier-processed claims and only in those  States in which the carrier paid separately for out-of-county ambulance  mileage, but did not make separate payment for any in-county mileage  throughout the entire State.</p>
