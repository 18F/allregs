                                Sec. 192.933  What actions must be taken to address integrity issues?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. An operator must take prompt action to  address all anomalous conditions the operator discovers through the  integrity assessment. In addressing all conditions, an operator must  evaluate all anomalous conditions and remediate those that could reduce  a pipeline's integrity. An operator must be able to demonstrate that the  remediation of the condition will ensure the condition is unlikely to  pose a threat to the integrity of the pipeline until the next  reassessment of the covered segment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Temporary pressure reduction. If an operator is unable to  respond within the time limits for certain conditions specified in this  section, the operator must temporarily reduce the operating pressure of  the pipeline or take other action that ensures the safety of the covered  segment. An operator must determine any temporary reduction in operating  pressure required by this section using ASME/ANSI B31G (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 192.7); Pipeline Research Council, International,  PR-3-805 (R-STRENG) (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 192.7); or by  reducing the operating pressure to a level not exceeding 80 percent of  the level at the time the condition was discovered. An operator must  notify PHMSA in accordance with Sec. 192.949 if it cannot meet the  schedule for evaluation and remediation required under paragraph (c) of  this section and cannot provide safety   through a temporary reduction in operating pressure or through another  action. An operator must also notify a State pipeline safety authority  when either a covered segment is located in a State where PHMSA has an  interstate agent agreement or an intrastate covered segment is regulated  by that State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Long-term pressure reduction. When a pressure reduction exceeds  365 days, the operator must notify PHMSA under Sec. 192.949 and explain  the reasons for the remediation delay. This notice must include a  technical justification that the continued pressure reduction will not  jeopardize the integrity of the pipeline. The operator also must notify  a State pipeline safety authority when either a covered segment is  located in a State where PHMSA has an interstate agent agreement, or an  intrastate covered segment is regulated by that State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Discovery of condition. Discovery of a condition occurs when an  operator has adequate information about a condition to determine that  the condition presents a potential threat to the integrity of the  pipeline. A condition that presents a potential threat includes, but is  not limited to, those conditions that require remediation or monitoring  listed under paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section. An  operator must promptly, but no later than 180 days after conducting an  integrity assessment, obtain sufficient information about a condition to  make that determination, unless the operator demonstrates that the 180- day period is impracticable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Schedule for evaluation and remediation. An operator must  complete remediation of a condition according to a schedule prioritizing  the conditions for evaluation and remediation. Unless a special  requirement for remediating certain conditions applies, as provided in  paragraph (d) of this section, an operator must follow the schedule in  ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 192.7), section 7,  Figure 4. If an operator cannot meet the schedule for any condition, the  operator must explain the reasons why it cannot meet the schedule and  how the changed schedule will not jeopardize public safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special requirements for scheduling remediation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Immediate  repair conditions. An operator's evaluation and remediation schedule  must follow ASME/ANSI B31.8S, section 7 in providing for immediate  repair conditions. To maintain safety, an operator must temporarily  reduce operating pressure in accordance with paragraph (a) of this  section or shut down the pipeline until the operator completes the  repair of these conditions. An operator must treat the following  conditions as immediate repair conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A calculation of the remaining strength of the pipe shows a  predicted failure pressure less than or equal to 1.1 times the maximum  allowable operating pressure at the location of the anomaly. Suitable  remaining strength calculation methods include ASME/ANSI B31G  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 192.7) , PRCI PR-3-805 (R-STRENG)  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 192.7), or an alternative  equivalent method of remaining strength calculation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A dent that has any indication of metal loss, cracking or a  stress riser.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An indication or anomaly that in the judgment of the person  designated by the operator to evaluate the assessment results requires  immediate action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> One-year conditions. Except for conditions listed in paragraph  (d)(1) and (d)(3) of this section, an operator must remediate any of the  following within one year of discovery of the condition:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A smooth dent located between the 8 o'clock and 4 o'clock  positions (upper \2/3\ of the pipe) with a depth greater than 6% of the  pipeline diameter (greater than 0.50 inches in depth for a pipeline  diameter less than Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) 12).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A dent with a depth greater than 2% of the pipeline's diameter  (0.250 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12) that  affects pipe curvature at a girth weld or at a longitudinal seam weld.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Monitored conditions. An operator does not have to schedule the  following conditions for remediation, but must record and monitor the  conditions during subsequent risk assessments and   integrity assessments for any change that may require remediation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A dent with a depth greater than 6% of the pipeline diameter  (greater than 0.50 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS  12) located between the 4 o'clock position and the 8 o'clock position  (bottom \1/3\ of the pipe).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A dent located between the 8 o'clock and 4 o'clock positions  (upper \2/3\ of the pipe) with a depth greater than 6% of the pipeline  diameter (greater than 0.50 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less  than Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) 12), and engineering analyses of the dent  demonstrate critical strain levels are not exceeded.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A dent with a depth greater than 2% of the pipeline's diameter  (0.250 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12) that  affects pipe curvature at a girth weld or a longitudinal seam weld, and  engineering analyses of the dent and girth or seam weld demonstrate  critical strain levels are not exceeded. These analyses must consider  weld properties.
