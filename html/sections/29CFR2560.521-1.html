                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. Section 521(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. 1151(a), authorizes the Secretary of Labor to issue an ex parte cease and desist order if it appears to the Secretary that the alleged conduct of a multiple employer welfare arrangement (MEWA) under section 3(40) of ERISA is fraudulent, or creates an immediate danger to the public safety or welfare, or is causing or can be reasonably expected to cause significant, imminent, and irreparable public injury. Section 521(e) of ERISA authorizes the Secretary to issue a summary seizure order if it appears that a MEWA is in a financially hazardous condition. An order may apply to a MEWA or to persons having custody or control of assets of the subject MEWA, any authority over management of the subject MEWA, or any role in the transaction of the subject MEWA's business. This section sets forth standards and procedures for the Secretary to issue ex parte cease and desist and summary seizure orders and for administrative review of the

issuance of such cease and desist orders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. When used in this section, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed in this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Multiple employer welfare arrangement (MEWA) is an arrangement as defined in section 3(40) of ERISA that either is an employee welfare benefit plan subject to Title I of ERISA or offers benefits in connection with one or more employee welfare benefit plans subject to Title I of ERISA. For purposes of section 521 of ERISA, a MEWA does not include a health insurance issuer (including a health maintenance organization) that is licensed to offer or provide health insurance coverage to the public and employers at large in each State in which it offers or provides health insurance coverage, and that, in each such State, is subject to comprehensive licensure, solvency, and examination requirements that the State customarily requires for issuing health insurance policies to the public and employers at large. The term health insurance issuer does not include group health plans. For purposes of this section, the term ``health insurance coverage'' has the same meaning as in ERISA section 733(b)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The conduct of a MEWA is fraudulent:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the MEWA or any person acting as an agent or employee of the MEWA commits an act or omission knowingly and with an intent to deceive or defraud plan participants, plan beneficiaries, employers or employee organizations, or other members of the public, the Secretary, or a State regarding:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The financial condition of the MEWA (including the MEWA's solvency and the management of plan assets);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The benefits provided by or in connection with the MEWA;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The management, control, or administration of the MEWA;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The existing or lawful regulatory status of the MEWA under Federal or State law; or,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Any other material fact, as determined by the Secretary, relating to the MEWA or its operation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fraudulent conduct includes any false statement regarding any of paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) through (b)(2)(i)(E) of this section that is made with knowledge of its falsity or that is made with reckless indifference to the statement's truth or falsity, and the knowing concealment of material information regarding any of paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) through (b)(2)(i)(E) of this section. Examples of fraudulent conduct include, but are not limited to, misrepresenting the terms of the benefits offered by or in connection with the MEWA or the financial condition of the MEWA or engaging in deceptive acts or omissions in connection with marketing or sales or fees charged to employers or employee organizations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The conduct of a MEWA creates an immediate danger to the public safety or welfare if the conduct of a MEWA or any person acting as an agent or employee of the MEWA impairs, or threatens to impair, a MEWA's ability to pay claims or otherwise unreasonably increases the risk of nonpayment of benefits. Intent to create an immediate danger is not required for this criterion. Examples of such conduct include, but are not limited to, a systematic failure to properly process or pay benefit claims, including failure to establish and maintain a claims procedure that complies with the Secretary's claims procedure regulations (29 CFR 2560.503-1 and 29 CFR 2590.715-2719), failure to establish or maintain a recordkeeping system that tracks the claims made, paid, or processed or the MEWA's financial condition, a substantial failure to meet applicable disclosure, reporting, and other filing requirements, including the annual reporting and registration requirements under sections 101(g) and 104 of ERISA, failure to establish and implement a policy or method to determine that the MEWA is actuarially sound with appropriate reserves and adequate underwriting, failure to comply with a cease and desist order issued by a government agency or court, and failure to hold plan assets in trust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The conduct of a MEWA is causing or can be reasonably expected to cause significant, imminent, and irreparable public injury:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the conduct of a MEWA, or of a person acting as an agent or employee of the MEWA, is having, or is reasonably expected to have, a significant and imminent negative effect on one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An employee welfare benefit plan that is, or offers benefits in connection with, a MEWA;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The sponsor of such plan or the employer or employee organization that makes payments for benefits provided by or in connection with a MEWA; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Plan participants and plan beneficiaries; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If it is not reasonable to expect that such effect will be fully repaired or rectified.</p><p class="depth4">Intent to cause injury is not required for this criterion. Examples of such conduct include, but are not limited to, conversion or concealment of property of the MEWA; improper disposal, transfer, or removal of funds or other property of the MEWA, including unreasonable compensation or payments to MEWA operators and service providers (e.g. brokers, marketers, and third party administrators); employment by the MEWA of a person prohibited from such employment pursuant to section 411 of ERISA, and embezzlement from the MEWA. For purposes of section 521 of ERISA, compensation that would be excessive under 26 CFR 1.162-7 will be considered unreasonable compensation or payments for purposes of this regulation. Depending upon the facts and circumstances, compensation may be unreasonable under this regulation even it is not excessive under 26 CFR 1.162-7.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A MEWA is in a financially hazardous condition if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Secretary has probable cause to believe that a MEWA:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Is, or is in imminent danger of becoming, unable to pay benefit claims as they come due, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Has sustained, or is in imminent danger of sustaining, a significant loss of assets; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A person responsible for management, control, or administration of the MEWA's assets is the subject of a cease and desist order issued by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A person, for purposes of this section, is an individual, partnership, corporation, employee welfare benefit plan, association, or other entity or organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Temporary cease and desist order. (1)(i) The Secretary may issue a temporary cease and desist order when the Secretary finds there is reasonable cause to believe that the conduct of a MEWA, or any person acting as an agent or employee of the MEWA, is -</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> The Secretary may issue a temporary cease and desist order when the Secretary finds there is reasonable cause to believe that the conduct of a MEWA, or any person acting as an agent or employee of the MEWA, is -</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Secretary may issue a temporary cease and desist order when the Secretary finds there is reasonable cause to believe that the conduct of a MEWA, or any person acting as an agent or employee of the MEWA, is -</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Fraudulent;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Creates an immediate danger to the public safety or welfare; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Is causing or can be reasonably expected to cause significant, imminent, and irreparable public injury.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A single act or omission may be the basis for a temporary cease and desist order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A temporary cease and desist order, as the Secretary determines is necessary and appropriate to stop the conduct on which the order is based, and to protect the interests of plan participants, plan beneficiaries, employers or employee organizations, or other members of the public, may--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prohibit specific conduct or prohibit the transaction of any business of the MEWA;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Prohibit any person from taking specified actions, or exercising authority or control, concerning funds or property of a MEWA or of any employee benefit plan, regardless of whether such funds or property have been commingled with other funds or property; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Bar any person either directly or indirectly, from providing management, administrative, or other services to any MEWA or to an employee benefit plan or trust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Secretary may require documentation from the subject of the order verifying compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effect of order on other remedies. The issuance of a temporary or final cease and desist order shall not foreclose the Secretary from seeking additional remedies under ERISA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Administrative hearing. (1) A temporary cease and desist order shall become a final order as to any MEWA or other person named in the order 30 days after such person receives notice of the order unless, within this period,

such person requests a hearing in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A temporary cease and desist order shall become a final order as to any MEWA or other person named in the order 30 days after such person receives notice of the order unless, within this period,

such person requests a hearing in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A person requesting a hearing must file a written request and an answer to the order showing cause why the order should be modified or set aside. The request and the answer must be filed in accordance with 29 CFR part 2571 and Sec. 18.4 of this title.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A hearing shall be held expeditiously following the receipt of the request for a hearing by the Office of the Administrative Law Judges, unless the parties mutually consent, in writing, to a later date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The decision of the administrative law judge shall be issued expeditiously after the conclusion of the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Secretary must offer evidence supporting the findings made in issuing the order that there is reasonable cause to believe that the MEWA (or a person acting as an employee or agent of the MEWA) engaged in conduct specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The person requesting the hearing has the burden to show that the order should be modified or set aside. To meet this burden such person must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the MEWA (or a person acting as an employee or agent of the MEWA) did not engage in conduct specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or must show that the requirements imposed by the order, are, in whole or part, arbitrary and capricious.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any temporary cease and desist order for which a hearing has been requested shall remain in effect and enforceable, pending completion of the administrative proceedings, unless stayed by the Secretary, an administrative law judge, or by a court.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The Secretary may require that the hearing and all evidence be treated as confidential.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Summary seizure order. (1) Subject to paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section, the Secretary may issue a summary seizure order when the Secretary finds there is probable cause to believe that a MEWA is in a financially hazardous condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subject to paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section, the Secretary may issue a summary seizure order when the Secretary finds there is probable cause to believe that a MEWA is in a financially hazardous condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, the Secretary, before issuing a summary seizure order to remove assets and records from the control and management of the MEWA or any persons having custody or control of such assets or records, shall obtain judicial authorization from a federal court in the form of a warrant or other appropriate form of authorization and may at that time pursue other actions such as those set forth in paragraph (f)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Secretary reasonably believes that any delay in issuing the order is likely to result in the removal, dissipation, or concealment of plan assets or records, the Secretary may issue and serve a summary seizure order before seeking court authorization. Promptly following service of the order, the Secretary shall seek authorization from a federal court and may at that time pursue other actions such as those set forth in paragraph (f)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A summary seizure order may authorize the Secretary to take possession or control of all or part of the books, records, accounts, and property of the MEWA (including the premises in which the MEWA transacts its business) to protect the benefits of plan participants, plan beneficiaries, employers or employee organizations, or other members of the public, and to safeguard the assets of employee welfare benefit plans. The order may also direct any person having control and custody of the assets that are the subject of the order not to allow any transfer or disposition of such assets except upon the written direction of the Secretary, or of a receiver or independent fiduciary appointed by a court.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In connection with or following the execution of a summary seizure order, the Secretary may--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Secure court appointment of a receiver or independent fiduciary to perform any necessary functions of the MEWA;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Obtain court authorization for the Secretary, the receiver or independent fiduciary to take any other action to seize, secure, maintain, or preserve the availability of the MEWA's assets; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Obtain such other appropriate relief available under ERISA to protect

the interest of employee welfare benefit plan participants, plan beneficiaries, employers or employee organizations or other members of the public. Other appropriate equitable relief may include the liquidation and winding up of the MEWA's affairs and, where applicable, the affairs of any person sponsoring the MEWA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Effective date of orders. Cease and desist and summary seizure orders are effective immediately upon issuance by the Secretary and shall remain effective, except to the extent and until any provision is modified or the order is set aside by the Secretary, an administrative law judge, or a court.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Service of orders. (1) As soon as practicable after the issuance of a temporary or final cease and desist order and no later than five business days after issuance of a summary seizure order, the Secretary shall serve the order either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As soon as practicable after the issuance of a temporary or final cease and desist order and no later than five business days after issuance of a summary seizure order, the Secretary shall serve the order either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By delivering a copy to the person who is the subject of the order. If the person is a partnership, service may be made to any partner. If the person is a corporation, association, or other entity or organization, service may be made to any officer of such entity or any person designated for service of process under State law or the applicable plan document. If the person is an employee welfare benefit plan, service may be made to a trustee or administrator. A person's attorney may accept service on behalf of such person;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> By leaving a copy at the principal office, place of business, or residence of such person or attorney; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> By mailing a copy to the last known address of such person or attorney.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If service is accomplished by certified mail, service is complete upon mailing.
