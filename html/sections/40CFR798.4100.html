                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. In the assessment and evaluation of the toxic  characteristics of a substance, determination of its potential to  provoke skin sensitization reactions is important. Information derived  from tests for skin sensitization serves to identify the possible hazard  to a population repeatedly exposed to a test substance. While the  desirability of skin sensitization testing is recognized, there are some  real differences of opinion about the best method to use. The test  selected should be a reliable screening procedure which should not fail  to identify substances with significant allergenic potential, while at  the same time avoiding false negative results.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Skin sensitization (allergic contact  dermatitis) is an immunologically mediated cutaneous reaction to a  substance. In the human, the responses may be characterized by pruritis,  erythema, edema, papules, vesicles, bullae, or a combination of these.  In other species the reactions may differ and only erythema and edema  may be seen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Induction period is a period of at least 1 week following a  sensitization exposure during which a hypersensitive state is developed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Induction exposure is an experimental exposure of a subject to a  test substance with the intention of inducing a hypersensitive state.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Challenge exposure is an experimental exposure of a previously  treated subject to a test substance following an induction period, to  determine whether the subject will react in a hypersensitive manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Principle of the test method. Following initial exposure(s) to a  test substance, the animals are subsequently subjected, after a period  of not less than 1 week, to a challenge exposure with the test substance  to establish whether a hypersensitive state has been induced.  Sensitization is determined by examining the reaction to the challenge  exposure and comparing this reaction to that of the initial induction  exposure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Test procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any of the following seven test methods is  considered to be acceptable. It is realized, however, that the methods  differ in their probability and degree of reaction to sensitizing  substances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Freund's complete adjuvant test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Guinea-pig maximization test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Split adjuvant technique.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Buehler test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Open epicutaneous test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Mauer optimization test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Footpad technique in guinea pig.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Removal of hair is by clipping, shaving, or possibly by  depilation, depending on the test method used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Animal selection--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Species and strain. The young adult guinea  pig is the preferred species. Commonly used laboratory strains should be  employed. If other species are used, the tester should provide  justification/reasoning for their selection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Number and sex. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The number and sex of animals used will  depend on the method employed.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The females should be nulliparous and nonpregnant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Control animals. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Periodic use of a positive control  substance with an acceptable level of reliability for the test system  selected is recommended;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Animals may act as their own controls or groups of induced  animals can be compared to groups which have received only a challenge  exposure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Dose levels. The dose level will depend upon the method  selected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Observation of animals. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Skin reactions should be graded and  recorded after the challenge exposures at the time specified by the  methodology selected. This is usually at 24, 48, and 72, hours.  Additional notations should be made as necessary to fully describe  unusual responses;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Regardless of method selected, initial and terminal body  weights should be recorded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Procedures. The procedures to be used are those described by the  methodology chosen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Data and reporting. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Data should be summarized in tabular  form, showing for each individual animal the skin reaction, results of  the induction exposure(s) and the challenge exposure(s) at times  indicated by the method chosen. As a minimum, the erythema and edema  should be graded and any unusual finding should be recorded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evaluation of the results. The evaluation of results will  provide information on the proportion of each group that became  sensitized and the extent (slight, moderate, severe) of the  sensitization reaction in each individual animal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Test report. In addition to the reporting requirements as  specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J, the following specific  information should be reported:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of the method used and the commonly accepted name.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Information on the positive control study, including positive  control used, method used, and time conducted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The number and sex of the test animals.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Species and strain.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Individual weights of the animals at the start of the test and  at the conclusion of the test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A brief description of the grading system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Each reading made on each individual animal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> References.
