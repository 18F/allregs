                            <p class="depth0">Each handler shall pay to the committee upon demand, his pro rata  share of the expenses authorized by the Secretary for each fiscal  period. Each handler's pro rata share shall be the rate of assessment  per hundredweight fixed by the Secretary times the quantity of potatoes  which he handles as the first handler thereof. At any time during or  after a fiscal period, the Secretary may increase the rate of assessment  as necessary to cover authorized expenses. Such increase shall be  applicable to all potatoes handled during the given fiscal period. The  payment of expenses for the maintenance and functioning of the committee  may be required during periods when no regulations are in effect. If a  handler does not pay his assessment within the time prescribed by the  committee, the assessment may be increased by a late payment charge or  an interest charge, or both, at rates prescribed by the committee with  the approval of the Secretary.
