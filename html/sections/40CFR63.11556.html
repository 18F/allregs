                            <p class="depth0">Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in Sec. 63.2, and in this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Aluminum foundry means a facility that melts aluminum and pours molten aluminum into molds to manufacture aluminum castings (except die casting) that are complex shapes. For purposes of this subpart, this definition does not include primary or secondary metal producers that cast molten aluminum to produce simple shapes such as sows, ingots, bars, rods, or billets.</p><p class="depth0">Aluminum foundry HAP means any compound of the following metals: beryllium, cadmium, lead, manganese, or nickel, or any of these metals in the elemental form.</p><p class="depth0">Annual copper and other nonferrous foundry metal melt capacity means, for new affected sources, the lower of the copper and other nonferrous metal melting operation capacity, assuming 8,760 operating hours per year or, if applicable, the maximum permitted copper and other nonferrous metal melting operation production rate for the melting operation calculated on an annual basis. Unless otherwise specified in the permit, permitted copper and other nonferrous metal melting operation rates that are not specified on an annual basis must be annualized assuming 24 hours per day, 365 days per year of operation. If the permit limits the operating hours of the melting operation(s) or foundry, then the permitted operating hours are used to annualize the maximum permitted copper and other nonferrous metal melt production rate. The annual copper and other nonferrous metal melt capacity does not include the melt capacity for ferrous metal melted in iron or steel foundry melting operations that are co-located with copper or other nonferrous melting operations or the nonferrous metal melted in non-foundry melting operations.</p><p class="depth0">Annual copper and other nonferrous foundry metal melt production means, for existing affected sources, the quantity of copper and other nonferrous metal melted in melting operations at the foundry in a given calendar year. For the purposes of this subpart, metal melt production is determined on the basis of the quantity of metal charged to the melting operations. The annual copper and nonferrous metal melt production does not include the melt production of ferrous metal melted in iron or steel foundry melting operations that are co-located with copper and other nonferrous melting operations or the nonferrous metal melted in non-foundry melting operations.</p><p class="depth0">Annual metal melt capacity, for new affected sources, means the lower of the aluminum, copper, and other nonferrous metal melting operation capacity, assuming 8,760 operating hours per year or, if applicable, the maximum permitted aluminum, copper, and other nonferrous metal melting operation production rate for the melting operation calculated on an annual basis. Unless otherwise specified in the permit, permitted aluminum, copper, and other nonferrous metal melting operation rates that are not specified on an annual basis must be annualized assuming 24 hours per day, 365 days per year of operation. If the permit limits the operating hours of the melting operation(s) or foundry, then the permitted operating hours are used to annualize the maximum permitted aluminum, copper, and other nonferrous metal melt production rate. The annual metal melt capacity does not include the melt capacity for ferrous metal melted in iron or steel foundry

melting operations that are co-located with aluminum, copper, or other nonferrous melting operations or the nonferrous metal melted in non-foundry melting operations.</p><p class="depth0">Annual metal melt production means, for existing affected sources, the quantity of aluminum, copper, and other nonferrous metal melted in melting operations at the foundry in a given calendar year. For the purposes of this subpart, annual metal melt production is determined on the basis of the quantity of metal charged to the melting operations. The annual metal melt production does not include the melt production of ferrous metal melted in iron or steel foundry melting operations that are co-located with aluminum, copper, or other nonferrous melting operations or the nonferrous metal melted in non-foundry melting operations.</p><p class="depth0">Bag leak detection system means a system that is capable of continuously monitoring relative PM (i.e., dust) loadings in the exhaust of a baghouse to detect bag leaks and other upset conditions. A bag leak detection system includes, but is not limited to, an instrument that operates on triboelectric, light scattering, light transmittance, or other effect to continuously monitor relative PM loadings.</p><p class="depth0">Copper foundry means a foundry that melts copper or copper-based alloys and pours molten copper or copper-based alloys into molds to manufacture copper or copper-based alloy castings (excluding die casting) that are complex shapes. For purposes of this subpart, this definition does not include primary or secondary metal producers that cast molten copper to produce simple shapes such as sows, ingots, billets, bars, anode copper, rods, or copper cake.</p><p class="depth0">Copper foundry HAP means any compound of any of the following metals: lead, manganese, or nickel, or any of these metals in the elemental form.</p><p class="depth0">Deviation means any instance where an affected source subject to this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this subpart, including but not limited to any emissions limitation or work practice standard;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement an applicable requirement in this subpart and that is included in the operating permit for any affected source required to obtain such a permit; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Fails to meet any emissions limitation in this subpart during startup, shutdown, or malfunction, regardless of whether or not such failure is permitted by this subpart.</p><p class="depth2">Die casting means operations classified under the North American Industry Classification System codes 331521 (Aluminum Die-Casting Foundries) and 331522 (Nonferrous (except Aluminum) Die-Casting Foundries) and comprises establishments primarily engaged in introducing molten aluminum, copper, and other nonferrous metal, under high pressure, into molds or dies to make die-castings.</p><p class="depth2">Large foundry means, for an existing affected source, a copper or other nonferrous foundry with an annual metal melt production of copper, other nonferrous metals, and all associated alloys (excluding aluminum) of 6,000 tons or greater. For a new affected source, large foundry means a copper or other nonferrous foundry with an annual metal melt capacity of copper, other nonferrous metals, and all associated alloys (excluding aluminum) of 6,000 tons or greater.</p><p class="depth2">Material containing aluminum foundry HAP means a material containing one or more aluminum foundry HAP. Any material that contains beryllium, cadmium, lead, or nickel in amounts greater than or equal to 0.1 percent by weight (as the metal), or contains manganese in amounts greater than or equal to 1.0 percent by weight (as the metal), as shown in formulation data provided by the manufacturer or supplier, such as the Material Safety Data Sheet for the material, is considered to be a material containing aluminum foundry HAP.</p><p class="depth2">Material containing copper foundry HAP means a material containing one or more copper foundry HAP. Any material that contains lead or nickel in amounts greater than or equal to 0.1 percent by weight (as the metal), or

contains manganese in amounts greater than or equal to 1.0 percent by weight (as the metal), as shown in formulation data provided by the manufacturer or supplier, such as the Material Safety Data Sheet for the material, is considered to be a material containing copper foundry HAP.</p><p class="depth2">Material containing other nonferrous foundry HAP means a material containing one or more other nonferrous foundry HAP. Any material that contains chromium, lead, or nickel in amounts greater than or equal to 0.1 percent by weight (as the metal), as shown in formulation data provided by the manufacturer or supplier, such as the Material Safety Data Sheet for the material, is considered to be a material containing other nonferrous foundry HAP.</p><p class="depth2">Melting operations (the affected source) means the collection of furnaces (e.g., induction, reverberatory, crucible, tower, dry hearth) used to melt metal ingot, alloyed ingot and/or metal scrap to produce molten metal that is poured into molds to make castings. Melting operations dedicated to melting ferrous metal at an iron and steel foundry are not included in this definition and are not part of the affected source.</p><p class="depth2">Other nonferrous foundry means a facility that melts nonferrous metals other than aluminum, copper, or copper-based alloys and pours the nonferrous metals into molds to manufacture nonferrous metal castings (excluding die casting) that are complex shapes. For purposes of this subpart, this definition does not include primary or secondary metal producers that cast molten nonferrous metals to produce simple shapes such as sows, ingots, bars, rods, or billets.</p><p class="depth2">Other nonferrous foundry HAP means any compound of the following metals: chromium, lead, and nickel, or any of these metals in the elemental form.</p><p class="depth2">Small foundry means, for an existing affected source, a copper or other nonferrous foundry with an annual metal melt production of copper, other nonferrous metals, and all associated alloys (excluding aluminum) of less than 6,000 tons. For a new affected source, small foundry means a copper or other nonferrous foundry with an annual metal melt capacity of copper, other nonferrous metals, and all associated alloys (excluding aluminum) of less than 6,000 tons.</p>
