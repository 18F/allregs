                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The DD Forms 214 and 215 are a source of significant and  authoritative information used by civilian and governmental agencies to  validate veteran eligibility for benefits. As such, they are valuable  forms and, therefore, vulnerable to fraudulent use. Since they are  sensitive, the forms must be safeguarded at all times. They will be  transmitted, stored, and destroyed in a manner which will prevent  unauthorized use. The Military Services will issue instructions  consistent with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All DD Forms 214 will be surprinted with a reproducible screen  tint using appropriate security ink on Blocks 1, 3, 4.a, 4.b, 12, and 18  through 30. In addition Blocks 1, 3, 5, and 7 of the DD Form 215 will be  similarly surprinted to make alterations readily discernible. No  corrections will be permitted in the screened areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All forms will be secured after duty hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All obsolete forms will be destroyed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All forms to be discarded, including those which are blank or  partially completed, and reproduced copies of DD Form 214, will be  destroyed. No forms will be discarded intact.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Blank forms given to personnel for educational or instructional  purposes, and forms maintained for such use, are to be clearly voided in  an unalterable manner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The commander or commanding officer of each unit or activity  authorized to issue DD Form 214 will appoint, in writing, a commissioned  officer, warrant officer, enlisted member (grade E-7 or above), or DoD  civilian (GS-7 or above) who will requisition, control, and issue blank  DD Forms 214 and 215. The Service concerned may authorize an E-5 or GS-5  to serve in this capacity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The Military Services will monitor the use of DD Form 214 and  review periodically its issuance to insure compliance with procedures  for safeguarding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The DD Form 214-ws will contain the word ``WORKSHEET'' on the  body of the form (see Appendix B). This DD Form 214-ws will be treated  in the same manner as the DD Form 214.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Military Services will issue appropriate instructions to  separation activities stressing the importance of the DD Forms 214 and  215 in obtaining veterans benefits, reemployment rights, and  unemployment insurance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Standard separation program designator (SPD) codes for officer  and enlisted personnel developed under the provisions of DoD Instruction  5000.12 \3\ are published in DoD 5000.12-M. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\3\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 45.3(d)(6). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests to add, change, or delete an SPD code shall be  forwarded by the DoD Component concerned with appropriate justification  to the Assigned Responsible Agency accountable for evaluating,  recommending approval of, and maintaining such codes: Department of the  Navy, Office of The Chief of Naval   Operations, (Attention: OP-161), room 1514, Arlington Annex, Washington,  DC 20350-2000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requests to add, change, or delete an SPD code will be submitted  in accordance with section V., DoD Instruction 5000.12 with prior  written approval by the ASD (FM&P;), or his/her designee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All lists of SPD codes, including supplemental lists, published  by the DoD Components will be stamped ``For Official Use Only'' and will  not be furnished to any agency or individual outside the Department of  Defense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appropriate provisions of the Freedom of Information Act will be  used to deny the release of the lists to the public. An individual being  separated or discharged is entitled access only to his/her SPD code. It  is not intended that these codes stigmatize an individual in any manner.  They are intended for internal use by the Department of Defense in  collecting data to analyze statistical reporting trends that may, in  turn, influence changes in separation policy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Agencies or individuals who come into the possession of these  lists are cautioned on their use because a particular list may be  outdated and not reveal correctly the full circumstances relating to an  individual's separation or discharge.</p><p class="depth3">Sec.
