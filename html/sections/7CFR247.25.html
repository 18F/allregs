                                Sec. 247.25  Allowable uses of administrative funds and other funds.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> What are allowable uses of administrative funds provided to  State and local agencies? Administrative funds may be used for costs  that are necessary to ensure the efficient and effective administration  of the program, in accordance with parts 3016 and 3019 of this title.  Part 3016 of this title contains the rules for management of Federal  grants to State, local, and Indian tribal governments, and part 3019 of  this title contains the grants management rules   for nonprofit organizations. These departmental regulations incorporate  by reference OMB Circulars A-87 (Cost Principles for State, Local, and  Indian Tribal Governments) and A-122 (Cost Principles for Non-Profit  Organizations), which set out the principles for determining whether  specific costs are allowable. For availability of OMB Circulars  referenced in this section, see 5 CFR 1310.3. Some examples of allowable  costs in CSFP include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Storing, transporting, and distributing foods;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determining the eligibility of program applicants;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Program outreach;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Nutrition education;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Audits and fair hearings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Monitoring and review of program operations; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Transportation of participants to and from the local agency, if  necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What are unallowable uses of administrative funds? In addition  to those costs determined to be unallowable by the principles contained  in the OMB circulars referenced in paragraph (a) of this section,  specific examples of unallowable uses of administrative funds in CSFP  include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cost of alteration of facilities not required specifically  for the program; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Actual losses which could have been covered by permissible  insurance (through an approved self-insurance program or by other  means).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> What costs are allowable only with prior approval of FNS?  Capital expenditures, which include the acquisition of facilities or  equipment, or enhancements to such capital assets, with a cost per unit  of at least $5,000, are allowable only with prior approval of FNS.  Examples of equipment include automated information systems, automated  data processing equipment, and other computer hardware and software.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> What procedures must State and local agencies use in procuring  property, equipment, or services with program funds, and disposing of  such property or equipment? The procedures that State and local agencies  must follow in procuring property, equipment, or services with program  funds, or disposing of such property or equipment, are contained in  parts 3016 and 3019 of this title. State, local, and Indian tribal  governments must comply with part 3016 of this title, while nonprofit  subgrantees must comply with part 3019 of this title. State and local  agencies may use procurement procedures established by State and local  regulations as long as these procedures do not conflict with Federal  regulations. Federal regulations do not relieve State or local agencies  from responsibilities established in contracts relating to procurement  of property, equipment, or services. The State agency is the responsible  authority regarding the settlement of all contractual and administrative  issues arising out of procurements for the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> What is program income and how must State and local agencies use  it? Program income is income directly generated from program activities.  It includes, for example, income from the sale of packing containers or  pallets, and the salvage of commodities. Program income does not include  interest earned from administrative funds. State and local agencies must  use program income for allowable program costs, in accordance with part  3016 of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> How must State and local agencies use funds recovered as a  result of claims actions? The State agency must use funds recovered as a  result of claims actions against subdistributing or local agencies in  accordance with the provisions of Sec. 250.15(c) of this chapter. The  State agency must use funds recovered as a result of claims actions  against participants for allowable program costs. The State agency may  authorize local agencies to use such funds for allowable program costs  incurred at the local level.</p>
