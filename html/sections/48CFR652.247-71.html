                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 647.305-71, insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Shipping Instructions (FEB 2015)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each packing box shall be of solid construction in accordance  with best commercial practices and sufficiently strong in direct ratio  to the weight of the contents to withstand excessively rough handling  while in transit overseas. It shall be constructed of lumber that is  well seasoned, reasonably sound, free from bad cross grain and from  knots or knotholes that interfere with nailing or that occupy more than  \1/3\ of the width of the piece of lumber. Box shall be constructed with  three-way corners and diagonal bracing. All nails shall be cement- coated, of correct size and properly spaced to avoid splitting or  warping, and shall be driven into the grain of the wood. Dimension of  lumber shall be in accordance with the following table, dependent upon  the weight of the contents:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Minimum dimensions of lumber for</p><p class="depth2">Weight of box and contents           struts, frame members, and</p><p class="depth2">single diagonal braces ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Up to 45 kg...........................  19.05 x 57.15mm 46 to 113 kg..........................  22.23 x 73.03mm 114 to 181 kg.........................  22.23 x 98.43mm 182 to 272 kg.........................  22.23 x 123.83mm or 25.4 x 98.43</p><p class="depth2">mm ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each box shall be lined with waterproof paper and shall be bound  with 19.05mm steel straps firmly stapled in position to  prevent the straps from slipping off the box. Articles must be secured  and braced inside the shipping container to prevent the articles from  shifting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Packing cases weighing 453.5kg and more must be equipped with  skids. Each skid shall consist of two end sections of 50.8 x 152.4mm  lumber placed flat and a center section of 50.8 x 101.6mm lumber placed  flat and then arranged in line to provide 254mm forklift spaces between  center and end sections. When goods are ready for shipment, the  Contractor shall prepare four (4) copies of a packing list, indicating  the contract and, if applicable, order numbers; case number; itemized  list of contents; net and gross weights in kilograms; and outside  dimensions, including all clears, of each shipping container. The  Contractor shall provide three (3) copies of the packing list to the  U.S. Despatch Agent as specified in the contract or order. The  Contractor shall place the fourth copy of the packing list in packing  case number one, which shall be marked as such so that it is easily  identified by the consignee. Upon receipt of the packing list, the  Despatch Agent will furnish export marks and instructions regarding  shipment to the port specified, depending upon steamer services  available at the time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The export marks shall be stenciled on one side of each box  reserved for that purpose, and the appropriate case number stenciled in  the lower left-hand corner of the same side. The contract and, as  necessary, order numbers, net and gross weights in kilograms shall be  stenciled on the same side. However, if the size of the box is too small  to accommodate all stenciling on one side, the contract and order  numbers and weights may be stenciled on the side opposite that used for  the export marks and case number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The contract and, as necessary, order numbers must appear on all  containers and papers relating to this clause.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)  [53 FR 26177, July 11, 1988; 53 FR 36462, Sept. 20, 1988, as amended at  59 FR 66772, Dec. 28, 1994; 64 FR 43634, Aug. 11, 1999.
