                                Sec. 1493.190  Recovery of defaulted payments.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notification. Upon claim payment to the Holder of the Payment  Guarantee, CCC will notify the Foreign Financial Institution of CCC's  rights under the subrogation agreement to recover all monies in default.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Receipt of monies. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the event that monies related to the  obligation in default are recovered by the Exporter or the Assignee from  or on behalf of the defaulting party, the Importer, or any source  whatsoever (excluding payments among CCC, the Exporter, and the  Assignee), such monies shall be immediately paid to CCC. Any monies  derived from insurance or through the liquidation of any security or  collateral after the claim is filed with CCC shall be deemed recoveries  that must be paid to CCC. If such monies are not received by CCC within  15 Business Days from the date of recovery by the Exporter or the  Assignee, such party will owe to CCC interest from the date of recovery  to the date of receipt by CCC. This interest will be calculated at a  rate equal to the latest average investment rate of the most recent  Treasury 91-day bill auction, as announced by the Department of  Treasury, in effect on the date of recovery and will accrue from such  date to the date of payment by the Exporter or the Assignee to CCC. Such  interest will be charged only on CCC's share of the recovery. If there  has been no 91-day auction within 90 calendar days of the date interest  begins to accrue, CCC will apply an alternative rate in a manner to be  described on the USDA Web site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If CCC recovers monies that should be applied to a Payment  Guarantee for which a claim has been paid by CCC, CCC will pay the  Holder of the Payment Guarantee its pro rata share, if any, provided  that the required information necessary for determining pro rata  distribution has been furnished. If a required payment is not made by  CCC within 15 Business Days from the date of recovery or 15 business  days from receiving the required information for determining pro rata  distribution, whichever is later, CCC will pay interest calculated at a  rate equal to the latest average investment rate of the most recent  Treasury 91-day bill auction, as announced by the Department of  Treasury, in effect on the date of recovery and interest will accrue  from such date to the date of payment by CCC. The interest will apply  only to the portion of the recovery payable to the Holder of the Payment  Guarantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Allocation of recoveries. Recoveries received by CCC from any  source whatsoever that are related to the obligation in default will be  allocated by CCC to the Holder of the Payment Guarantee and to CCC on a  pro rata basis determined by their respective interests in such  recoveries. The respective interest of each party will be determined on  a pro rata basis, based on the combined amount of principal and interest  in default on the date the claim is paid by CCC. Once CCC has paid a  particular claim under a Payment Guarantee, CCC pro-rates any  collections it receives and shares these collections proportionately  with the Holder of the Payment Guarantee until both CCC and the Holder  of the Payment Guarantee have been reimbursed in full.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Liabilities to CCC. Notwithstanding any other terms of the  Payment Guarantee, under the following   circumstances the Exporter or the Assignee will be liable to CCC for any  amounts paid by CCC under the Payment Guarantee:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Exporter will be liable to CCC when and if it is determined  by CCC that the Exporter has engaged in fraud, or has been or is in  material breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty  made by the Exporter for the purpose of obtaining the Payment Guarantee  or for fulfilling obligations under the GSM-102 program; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Assignee will be liable to CCC when and if it is determined  by CCC that the Assignee has engaged in fraud or otherwise violated  program requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Cooperation in recoveries. Upon payment by CCC of a claim to the  Holder of the Payment Guarantee, the Holder of the Payment Guarantee and  the Exporter will cooperate with CCC to effect recoveries from the  Foreign Financial Institution and/or the Importer. Cooperation may  include, but is not limited to, submission of documents to the Foreign  Financial Institution (or its representative) to establish a claim;  participation in discussions with CCC regarding the appropriate course  of action with respect to a default; actions related to accelerated  payments as specified in Sec. 1493.180(d); and other actions that do  not increase the obligation of the Holder of the Payment Guarantee or  the Exporter under the Payment Guarantee.</p>
