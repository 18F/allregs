                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Merchandise produced in a beneficiary developing country or any  two or more countries which are members of the same association of  countries--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Except as otherwise provided in this section,  any article which either is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture  of, or is a new or different article of commerce that has been grown,  produced, or manufactured in, a beneficiary developing country may  qualify for duty-free entry under the Generalized System of Preferences  (GSP). No article will be considered to have been grown, produced, or  manufactured in a beneficiary developing country by virtue of having  merely undergone simple (as opposed to complex or meaningful) combining  or packaging operations or mere dilution with water or mere dilution  with another substance that does not materially alter the  characteristics of the article. Duty-free entry under the GSP may be  accorded to an article only if the sum of the cost or value of the  materials produced in the beneficiary developing country or any two or  more countries that are members of the same association of countries and  are treated as one country under section 507(2) of the Trade Act of  1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2467(2)), plus the direct costs of  processing operations performed in the beneficiary developing country or  member countries, is not less than 35 percent of the appraised value of  the article at the time it is entered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Combining, packaging, and diluting operations. No article which  has undergone only a simple combining or packaging operation or a mere  dilution in a beneficiary developing country within the meaning of  paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be entitled to duty-free treatment  even though the processing operation causes the article to meet the  value requirement set forth in that paragraph. For purposes of this  section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Simple combining or packaging operations and mere dilution  include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The addition of batteries to devices;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Fitting together a small number of components by bolting,  glueing, soldering, etc.;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Blending foreign and beneficiary developing country tobacco;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The addition of substances such as anticaking agents,  preservatives, wetting agents, etc.;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Repacking or packaging components together;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Reconstituting orange juice by adding water to orange juice  concentrate; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Diluting chemicals with inert ingredients to bring them to  standard degrees of strength;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Simple combining or packaging operations and mere dilution will  not be taken to include processes such as the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The assembly of a large number of discrete components onto a  printed circuit board;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The mixing together of two bulk medicinal substances followed by  the packaging of the mixed product into individual doses for retail  sale;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The addition of water or another substance to a chemical  compound under pressure which results in a reaction creating a new  chemical compound; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> A simple combining or packaging operation or mere dilution  coupled with any other type of processing such as testing or fabrication  (for example, a simple assembly of a small number of components, one of  which was fabricated in the beneficiary developing country where the  assembly took place); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The fact that an article has undergone more than a simple  combining or packaging operation or mere dilution is not necessarily  dispositive of the question of whether that processing constitutes a  substantial transformation for purposes of determining the country of  origin of the article.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Merchandise grown, produced, or manufactured in a beneficiary  developing country. Merchandise which is wholly the growth, product, or  manufacture of a beneficiary developing country, or an association of  countries treated as one country under section 507(2) of the Trade Act  of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2467(2)) and Sec. 10.171(b), and manufactured  products consisting of materials produced only in such country or  countries, shall normally be presumed to meet the requirements set forth  in this section.
