                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A public entity shall construct any new facility to be used in  providing designated public transportation services so that the facility  is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,  including individuals who use wheelchairs. This requirement also applies  to the construction of a new station for use in intercity or commuter  rail transportation. For purposes of this section, a facility or station  is ``new'' if its construction begins (i.e., issuance of notice to  proceed) after January 25, 1992, or, in the case of intercity or  commuter rail stations, after October 7, 1991.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Full compliance with the requirements of this section is not  required where an entity can demonstrate that it is structurally  impracticable to meet the requirements. Full compliance will be  considered structurally impracticable only in those rare circumstances  when the unique characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of  accessibility features.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If full compliance with this section would be structurally  impracticable, compliance with this section is required to the extent  that it is not structurally impracticable. In that case, any portion of  the facility that can be made accessible shall be made accessible to the  extent that it is not structurally impracticable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If providing accessibility in conformance with this section to  individuals with certain disabilities (e.g.,   those who use wheelchairs) would be structurally impracticable,  accessibility shall nonetheless be ensured to persons with other types  of disabilities (e.g., those who use crutches or who have sight,  hearing, or mental impairments) in accordance with this section.  [56 FR 45621, Sept. 6, 1991, as amended at 71 FR 63266, Oct. 30, 2006]</p>
