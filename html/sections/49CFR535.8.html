                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. Manufacturers producing heavy-duty  vehicles and engines applicable to fuel consumption standards in Sec.  535.5, for each given model year, must submit the required information  as specified in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The information required by this part must be submitted by the  deadlines specified in this section and must be based upon all the  information and data available to the manufacturer 30 days before  submitting information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Manufacturers must submit information electronically through the  EPA database system as the single point of entry for all information  required for this national program and both agencies will have access to  the information. The format for the required information is specified by  EPA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If by model year 2012 the agencies are not prepared to receive  information through the EPA database system, manufacturers are required  to submit information to EPA using an approved information format. A  manufacturer can use a different format, if it sends EPA a written  request with justification for a waiver.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Manufacturers submitting petitions for the off-road exemption in  paragraph (h) of this section should consider the timing to submit  petitions early enough in advance of the model year to ensure that a  determination can be made by the agencies and should a vehicle fail to  be excluded the manufacturer has sufficient time to submit and obtain  approval from EPA for the certificate of conformity required in 40 CFR  1037.201 prior to first commercial sale of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pre-model year reports. Manufacturers producing heavy-duty  pickup trucks and vans must submit reports in advance of the model year  providing early estimates demonstrating how their fleet(s) would comply  with GHG emissions and fuel consumption standards. Note, the agencies  understand that early model year reports contain estimates that may  change over the course of a model year and that compliance information  manufactures submit prior to the beginning of a new model year may not  represent the final compliance outcome. The agencies view the necessity  for requiring early model reports as a manufacturer's good faith  projection for demonstrating compliance with emission and fuel  consumption standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Report deadlines. For model years 2013 and later, manufacturer  of heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans complying with voluntary and  mandatory standards must submit a pre-model year report for the given  model year as early as the date of the manufacturer's annual  certification preview meeting with EPA and NHTSA, or prior to submitting  its first application for a certificate of conformity to EPA in  accordance with 40 CFR 1037.104(d). For example, a manufacturer choosing  to comply in model year 2014 could submit its pre-model year report  during its precertification meeting which could occur before January 2,  2013, or could provide its pre-model year report any time prior to  submitting its first application for certification for the given model  year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contents.

Whether the approach involves on-road testing,  modeling, or some other analytical approach, the manufacturer would be  required to present a final methodology to EPA and NHTSA. EPA and NHTSA  would approve the methodology and credits only if certain criteria were  met. Baseline emissions and fuel consumption and control emissions and  fuel consumption would need to be clearly demonstrated over a wide range  of real world driving conditions and over a sufficient number of  vehicles to address issues of uncertainty with the data. Data would need  to be on a vehicle model-specific basis unless a manufacturer  demonstrated model-specific data was not necessary. The agencies may  publish a notice of availability in the Federal Register notifying the  public of a manufacturer's proposed alternative off-cycle credit  calculation methodology and provide opportunity for comment. Any notice  will include details regarding the methodology, but not include any  Confidential Business Information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Credit trades.
