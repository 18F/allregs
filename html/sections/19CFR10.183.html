                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this  section, this section applies to aircraft, aircraft engines, and ground  flight simulators, including their parts, components, and subassemblies,  that qualify as civil aircraft under General Note 6(b) ofthe Harmonized  Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) by meeting the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The aircraft, aircraft engines, ground flight simulators, or  their parts, components, and subassemblies, are used as original or  replacement equipment in the design, development, testing, evaluation,  manufacture, repair, maintenance, rebuilding, modification, or  conversion of aircraft; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> They are either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Manufactured or operated pursuant to a certificate issued by the  Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under 49  U.S.C. 44704 or pursuant to the approval of the airworthiness authority  in the country of exportation, if that approval is recognized by the FAA  as an acceptable substitute for the FAA certificate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Covered by an application for such certificate, submitted to  and accepted by the FAA, filed by an existing type and production  certificate holder pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 44702 and implementing  regulations (Federal Aviation Administration Regulations, title 14, Code  of Federal Regulations); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Covered by an application for such approval or certificate  which will be submitted in the future by an existing type and production  certificate holder, pending the completion of design or other technical  requirements stipulated by the FAA (applicable only to the quantities of  parts, components, and subassemblies as are required to meet the  stipulation).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Department of Defense or U.S. Coast Guard use. If purchased for  use by the Department of Defense or the United States Coast Guard,  aircraft, aircraft engines, and ground flight simulators, including  their parts, components, and subassemblies, are subject to this section  only if they are used as original or replacement equipment in the  design, development, testing, evaluation, manufacture, repair,  maintenance, rebuilding, modification, or conversion of aircraft and  meet the requirements of either paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Claim for admission free of duty. Merchandise qualifying under  paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this section is entitled to duty-free  admission in accordance with General Note 6,   HTSUS, upon meeting the requirements of this section. An importer will  make a claim for duty-free admission under this section and General Note  6, HTSUS, by properly entering qualifying merchandise under a provision  for which the rate of duty ``Free (C)'' appears in the ``Special''  subcolumn of the HTSUS and by placing the special indicator ``C'' on the  entry summary. The fact that qualifying merchandise has previously been  exported with benefit of drawback does not preclude free entry under  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Importer certification. In making a claim for duty-free  admission as provided for under paragraph (c) of this section, the  importer is deemed to certify, in accordance with General Note 6(a)(ii),  HTSUS, that the imported merchandise is, as described in paragraph (a)  or paragraph (b) of this section, a civil aircraft or has been imported  for use in a civil aircraft and will be so used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Documentation. Each entry summary claiming duty-free admission  for imported merchandise in accordance with paragraph (c) of this  section must be supported by documentation to verify the claim for duty- free admission, including the written order or contract and other  evidence that the merchandise entered qualifies under General Note 6,  HTSUS, as a civil aircraft, aircraft engine, or ground flight simulator,  or their parts, components, and subassemblies. Evidence that the  merchandise qualifies under the general note includes evidence of  compliance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section concerning use of the  merchandise and evidence of compliance with the airworthiness  certification requirement of paragraph (a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(ii), or  (a)(2)(iii) of this section, including, as appropriate in the  circumstances, an FAA certification; approval of airworthiness by an  airworthiness authority in the country of export and evidence that the  FAA recognizes that approval as an acceptable substitute for an FAA  certification; an application for a certification submitted to and  accepted by the FAA; a type and production certificate issued by the  FAA; and/or evidence that a type and production certificate holder will  submit an application for certification or approval in the future  pending completion of design or other technical requirements stipulated  by the FAA and of estimates of quantities of parts, components, and  subassemblies as are required to meet design and technical requirements  stipulated by the FAA. This documentation need not be filed with the  entry summary but must be maintained in accordance with the general note  and with the recordkeeping provisions of part 163 of this chapter.  Customs may request production of documentation at any time to verify  the claim for duty-free admission. Failure to produce documentation  sufficient to satisfy the port director that the merchandise qualifies  for duty-free admission will result in a denial of duty-free treatment  and may result in such other measures permitted under the regulations as  the port director finds necessary to more closely monitor the importer's  importations of merchandise claimed to be duty-free under this section.  Proof of end use of the entered merchandise need not be maintained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Post-entry claim. An importer may file a claim for duty-free  treatment under General Note 6, HTSUS, after filing an entry that made  no such duty-free claim, by filing a written statement with Customs any  time prior to liquidation of the entry or prior to the liquidation  becoming final. When filed, the written statement constitutes the  importer=s claim for duty-free treatment under the general note and its  certification that the entered merchandise is a civil aircraft or has  been imported for use in a civil aircraft and will be so used. In  accordance with General Note 6, HTSUS, any refund resulting from a claim  made under this paragraph will be without interest, notwithstanding the  provision of 19 U.S.C. 1505(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Verification. The port director will monitor and periodically  audit selected entries made under this section.  [T.D. 02-31, 67 FR 39289, June 7, 2002]</p>
