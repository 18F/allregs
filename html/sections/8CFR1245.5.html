A medical examination shall not be required of an applicant for adjustment of status who entered the United States as a nonimmigrant spouse, fiance[eacute], or fiancee[eacute] of a United States citizen or the child of such an alien as defined in section 101(a)(15)(K) of the Act and Sec. 214.2(k) of 8 CFR chapter I if the applicant was medically examined prior to, and as a condition of, the issuance of the nonimmigrant visa; provided that the medical examination must have occurred not more than 1 year prior the date of application for adjustment of status. Any applicant certified under paragraphs (1)(A)(ii) or (1)(A)(iii) of section 212(a) of the Act may appeal to a Board of Medical Officers of the U.S. Public Health Service as provided in section 234 of the Act and part 1235 of this chapter.
