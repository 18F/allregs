This notice includes the following statement:</p><p class="depth2">The staff of each institution of the Bureau of Prisons has the  authority to open all mail addressed to you before it is delivered to   you. ``Special Mail'' (mail from the President and Vice President of the  U.S., attorneys, Members of the U.S. Congress, Embassies and Consulates,  the U.S. Department of Justice (excluding the Bureau of Prisons but  including U.S. Attorneys), other Federal law enforcement officers, State  Attorneys General, Prosecuting Attorneys, Governors, U.S. Courts  (including U.S. Probation Officers), and State Courts) may be opened  only in your presence to be checked for contraband. This procedure  occurs only if the sender is adequately identified on the envelope and  the front of the envelope is marked ``Special Mail--Open only in the  presence of the inmate.'' Other mail may be opened and read by the  staff.</p><p class="depth2">If you do not want your general correspondence opened and read, the  Bureau will return it to the Postal Service. This means that you will  not receive such mail. You may choose whether you want your general  correspondence delivered to you subject to the above conditions, or  returned to the Postal Service. Whatever your choice, special mail will  be delivered to you, after it is opened in your presence and checked for  contraband. You can make your choice by signing part I or part II.</p><p class="depth2">Part I--General Correspondence to be Returned to the Postal Service</p><p class="depth2">I have read or had read to me the foregoing notice regarding mail.

When such material is discovered, the inmate  may be subject to disciplinary action, the written material may be  copied, and all material may be referred to the appropriate law  enforcement agency for prosecution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The inmate is responsible for filling out the return address  completely on envelopes provided for the inmate's use by the  institution.
