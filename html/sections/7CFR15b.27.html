                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A recipient to which this subpart applies that provides  extension education may not, on the basis of handicap, exclude qualified  handicapped persons. A recipient shall take into account the needs of  such persons in determining the benefits or services to be provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Delivery sites. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where existing extension office facilities  are inaccessible, recipients may make aid, benefits, or services  normally provided at those sites available to qualified handicapped  persons through other methods which are equally effective. These methods  may include meetings in accessible locations, home visits, written or  telephonic communications, and other equally effective alternatives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For aid, benefits, or services delivered at other publicly-owned  facilities, recipients shall select accessible facilities wherever  possible. If accessible facilities cannot be selected because they are  unavailable or infeasible due to the nature of the activity, recipients  shall use other methods to deliver aid, benefits, or services to  qualified handicapped persons. These methods may include the redesign of  activities or some sessions of activities, the provision of aides, home  visits, or other equally effective alternatives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For aid, benefits, or services delivered at privately-owned  facilities, such as homes and farm buildings, recipients shall use  accessible facilities whenever qualified handicapped persons requiring  such accessibility are participating, have expressed an interest in  participating, or are likely to participate. If accessible facilities  cannot be selected because they are unavailable or infeasible due to the  nature of the activity, recipients shall use other methods to deliver  aid, benefits, or services to qualified handicapped persons. These  methods may include the redesign of activities or some sessions of  activities, the provision of aides, home visits, or other equally  effective alternatives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Recipients shall make camping activities accessible to qualified  handicapped persons. Recipients are not required to make every existing  camp, all existing camp facilities, or all camp sessions accessible, but  recipients who operate more than one camp or session may not limit  qualified handicapped persons to one camp or session.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Materials. Recipients shall make materials accessible to  qualified handicapped persons with sensory or mental impairments.  Commonly-used materials shall be readily available in alternate forms  such as Braille or tape. Upon request, recipients shall make other  materials available through appropriate means such as Braille, tape,  readers, large print formats, simplified versions, written scripts, or  interpreters. Recipients need not provide individually prescribed  devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices or services  of a personal nature.
