                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This subpart contains the regulations of  the Department of the Treasury implementing the Freedom of Information  Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended by the Electronic Freedom of  Information Act Amendments of 1996. The regulations set forth procedures  for requesting access to records maintained by the Department of the  Treasury. These regulations apply to all components of the Department of  the Treasury. Any reference in this subpart to the Department or its  officials, employees, or records shall be deemed to refer also to the  components or their officials, employees, or records. Persons interested  in the records of a particular component should also consult the  appendix to this subpart that pertains to that component. In connection  with such republication, and at other appropriate times, components may  issue supplementary regulations applicable only to the component in  question, which are consistent with these regulations. In the event of  any actual or apparent inconsistency, these Departmental regulations  shall govern. Persons interested in the records of a particular  component should, therefore, also consult the Code of Federal  Regulations for any rules or regulations promulgated specifically with  respect to that component (see Appendices to this subpart for cross  references). The head of each component is hereby authorized to  substitute the officials designated and change the addresses specified  in the appendix to this subpart applicable to the components.

As used in this subpart, the following terms shall  have the following meanings:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and 5 U.S.C.  552(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Appeal means a request for a review of an agency's determination  with regard to a fee waiver, category of requester, expedited  processing, or denial in whole or in part of a request for access to a  record or records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Bureau means an entity of the Department of the Treasury that is  authorized to act independently in disclosure matters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Business information means trade secrets or other commercial or  financial information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Business submitter means any entity which provides business  information to the Department of the Treasury or its bureaus and which  has a proprietary interest in the information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Computer software means tools by which records are created,  stored, and retrieved. Normally, computer software, including source  code, object code, and listings of source and object codes, regardless  of medium, are not agency records. However, when data are embedded  within the software and cannot be extracted without the software, the  software may have to be   treated as an agency record. Proprietary (or copyrighted) software is  not an agency record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Confidential commercial information means records provided to  the government by a submitter that arguably contain material exempt from  release under Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.  552(b)(4), because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause  substantial competitive harm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Duplication refers to the process of making a copy of a record  in order to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of  paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine readable  documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Electronic records means those records and information which are  created, stored, and retrievable by electronic means. This ordinarily  does not include computer software, which is a tool by which to create,  store, or retrieve electronic records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Request means any request for records made pursuant to 5 U.S.C.  552(a)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Requester means any person who makes a request for access to  records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Responsible official means a disclosure officer or the head of  the organizational unit having immediate custody of the records  requested, or an official designated by the head of the organizational  unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Review, for fee purposes, refers to the process of examining  records located in response to a commercial use request to determine  whether any portion of any record located is permitted to be withheld.  It also includes processing any records for disclosure; e.g., doing all  that is necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Search includes all time spent looking for material that is  responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line  identification of material within records. Searches may be done manually  or by automated means.  [65 FR 40504, June 30, 2000, as amended at 68 FR 55311, Sept. 25, 2003;  75 FR 743, Jan. 6, 2010]</p>
