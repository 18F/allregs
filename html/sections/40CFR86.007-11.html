The NTE deficiency should only be seen as an allowance for minor deviations from the NTE requirements. The NTE deficiency provisions allow a manufacturer to apply for relief from the NTE emission requirements under limited conditions. EPA expects that manufacturers should have the necessary functioning emission control hardware in place to comply with the NTE.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For model years 2010 through 2013, the Administrator may allow up to three deficiencies per engine family.

In determining whether to allow the additional deficiencies, the Administrator may consider any relevant factors, including the factors identified in paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(A) of this section.

When requested, deficiencies and limited testing regions must be reported for all engine families and power ratings in English with sufficient detail for us to determine if a particular deficiency or limited testing region will be encountered in the emission test data from the portable emission-sampling equipment and field-testing procedures referenced in Sec. 86.1375.

For every two engines that are certified early, the manufacturer may reduce the number of engines that are required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section to meet standards listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by three engines. For example, if a manufacturer produces 100 heavy-duty diesel engines in 2006 that meet all of the applicable standards listed in paragraph (a) of this section, and it produced 10,000 heavy-duty diesel engines in 2007, then only 4,850 ((10,000)(0.50) - (100)(1.5)) of the engines would need to comply with the standards listed in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Manufacturers certifying engines to all of the applicable standards listed in paragraph (a) and (c) of this section (without using credits) prior to model year 2007 may reduce the number of engines that are required to meet the standards listed in paragraph (a) of this section in model year 2007, 2008 and/or 2009, taking into account the phase-in option provided in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
