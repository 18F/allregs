Since New York did not adopt the exclusion at 40  CFR 261.4(a)(17) the State   has a broader in scope program because the effect is to include  materials that are not considered solid waste by EPA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> At 373-4, New York implements a Household Hazardous Waste  program, whereas the Federal program excludes household waste from  regulation as hazardous waste at 261.4(b)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> The following New York provisions are broader in scope because  they include requirements associated with the regulation of PCB waste as  a state-only hazardous waste: 372.1(e)(9) and 376.1(g)(1)(i), 376.4(f).
