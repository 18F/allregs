                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The leakproofness test must be performed with  compressed air or other suitable gases on all packagings intended to  contain liquids, except that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The inner receptacle of a composite packaging may be tested  without the outer packaging provided the test results are not affected;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This test is not required for inner packagings of combination  packagings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Number of packagings to be tested--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Production testing. All  packagings subject to the provisions of this section must be tested and  must pass the leakproofness test:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Before they are first used in transportation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Prior to reuse, when authorized for reuse by Sec. 173.28 of  this subchapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Design qualification and periodic testing. Three samples of each  different packaging must be tested and must pass the leakproofness test.  Exceptions for the number of samples used in conducting the  leakproofness test are subject to the approval of the Associate  Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special preparation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For design qualification and periodic  testing, packagings must be tested with closures in place. For  production testing, packagings need not have their closures in place.  Removable heads need not be installed during production testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For testing with closures in place, vented closures must either  be replaced by similar non-vented closures or the vent must be sealed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Test method. The packaging must be restrained under water while  an internal air pressure is applied; the method of restraint must not  affect the results of the test. The test must be conducted, for other  than production testing, for a minimum time of five minutes. Other  methods, at least equally effective, may be used in accordance with  appendix B of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Pressure applied. An internal air pressure (gauge) must be  applied to the packaging as indicated for the following packing groups:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Packing Group I: Not less than 30 kPa (4 psi).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Packing Group II: Not less than 20 kPa (3 psi).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Packing Group III: Not less than 20 kPa (3 psi).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Criteria for passing the test. A packaging passes the test if  there is no leakage of air from the packaging.
