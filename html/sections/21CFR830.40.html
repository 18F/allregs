A particular version or model may be identified by UDIs from two or more systems for the issuance of UDIs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A device identifier shall be used to identify only one version or model.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the event that a version or model of a device is discontinued, its device identifier may not be reassigned to another device. If a discontinued version or model is re-introduced and no changes have been made that would require the use of a new device identifier, the device identifier that was previously in use may be used to identify the device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the event that an issuing agency relinquishes or does not renew its accreditation, you may continue to use a previously issued UDI until such time as Sec. 830.50 requires you to assign a new device identifier.
