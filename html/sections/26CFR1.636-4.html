                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Except as provided hereinafter in this section,  section 636 and Secs. 1.636-1, 1.636-2, and 1.636-3 apply to production  payments created on or after August 7, 1969, other than production  payments created before January 1, 1971, pursuant to a binding contract  entered into before August 7, 1969.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Election. Under section 503(c)(2) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969,  if the taxpayer so elects, section 636(a) of the Code and Secs. 1.636-1  and 1.636-3 apply to all production payments carved out by him after the  beginning of his last taxable year ending before August 7, 1969,  including such production payments created after such date pursuant to a  binding contract entered into before such date. No interest shall be  allowed on any refund or credit of any overpayment of tax resulting from  an election under section 503(c)(2) for any taxable year ending before  August 7, 1969. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A, a fiscal-year taxpayer whose taxable year ends on  October 31, carved out and sold (from a producing property) production  payments on October 1, 1967, and on July 9, 1969. On August 1, 1969, A  entered into a binding contract to create another carved-out production  payment (from a different producing property) and the production payment  was carved out on December 22, 1969. If A elects under section  503(c)(2), the production payments carved out on July 9, 1969, and  December 22, 1969, are treated as mortgage loans under section 636(a).  The production payment carved out on October 1, 1967, is not treated as  a mortgage loan under section 636(a) because it was carved out before  the beginning of A's last taxable year ending before August 7, 1969.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Time and manner of making election. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any election under  section 503(c)(2) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 must be made not later  than May 30, 1973.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> and  paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall be applied as if such  member filed a separate return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Revocation of election. A valid election under section 503(c)(2)  shall be binding upon the taxpayer unless consent to revoke the election  is obtained from the Commissioner. The application to revoke such  election must be made in writing to the Commissioner of Internal  Revenue, Washington, D.C.   20224, not later than May 30, 1973. Such application must set forth the  reasons therefor and a recomputation of the tax reflecting such  revocation for each prior taxable year affected by the revocation,  whether or not the period of limitations for credit or refund or  assessment and collection has expired with respect to such taxable year.  Consent shall not be given in any case in which the revocation would  result in an increase in the taxpayer's tax liability for a taxable year  for which such period of limitations has expired unless the taxpayer  waives his right to assert the statute of limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Special rule. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph, in the case of a taxpayer who does not make the election  provided in section 503(c)(2) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, section 636  of the Code applies to production payments carved out during the taxable  year which includes August 7, 1969, as provided in paragraph (a) of this  section, only to the extent that the aggregate amount of such production  payments exceeds the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The excess of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The aggregate amount of production payments carved out and sold  by the taxpayer during the 12-month period immediately preceding his  taxable year which includes August 7, 1969, over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The aggregate amount of production payments carved out and sold  before August 7, 1969, by the taxpayer during his taxable year which  includes such date, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount necessary to increase the amount of the taxpayer's  gross income within the meaning of chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code,  for his taxable year which includes August 7, 1969, to an amount equal  to the amount of his deductions (other than any deduction under section  172) allowable for such year under such chapter   In applying the preceding sentence, production payments carved out for  exploration or development are to be taken into account only to the  extent, if any, that gross income from the property (for purposes of  section 613) would have been realized by the taxpayer creating such  production payment under the law existing at the time of the creation of  such production payment, in the absence of section 636(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not apply for any  taxable year for purposes of determining the amount of any deduction for  cost or percentage depletion allowable under section 611 or the  limitation on any foreign tax credit under section 904.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A, a calendar-year taxpayer who does not make the  election provided in section 503(c)(2) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969,  carves out and sells on December 31, 1968, a $500,000 production  payment. Further, A carves out and sells on March 4, 1969, a $300,000  production payment, and on November 14, 1969, a $150,000 production  payment. None of the production payments are carved out for exploration  or development. During 1969, A has gross income of $600,000 (determined  initially for this purpose by treating the $150,000 production payment  carved out on November 14, 1969, as a loan) and allowable deductions of  $700,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The provisions of section 636 do not apply to a portion of the  November 14, 1969, production payment for purposes other than section  611 and section 904 of the Code, determined as follows:  (1) Amount of production payment carved out in 1969 on or       $150,000</p><p class="depth0">after August 7, 1969........................................ (2) Amount of production payment carved out during 1968......    500,000 (3) Amount of production payment carved out during 1969          300,000</p><p class="depth0">taxable year before August 7, 1969..........................</p><p class="depth0">---------- (4) Item (2) minus item (3)..................................    200,000 (5) Excess of allowable deductions over gross income for 1969    100,000 (6) Amount of production payment carved out in 1969 on or        100,000</p><p class="depth0">after August 7, 1969, to which section 636 does not apply</p><p class="depth0">(lesser of items (1), (4), and (5)).........................</p><p class="depth0">Thus, A will not treat $100,000 of the consideration received for the  production payment carved out on November 14, 1969, as a loan and as a  result his gross income for 1969 will be $700,000. However, in computing  percentage depletion, A will not include the $100,000 in gross income  from property and in computing cost depletion A will not include the  mineral units attributable thereto. Nor, will A include the $100,000 in  determining the limitation on foreign tax credit under section 904.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that for  taxable year 1969 A's gross income (determined initially for this  purpose by treating the November 14, 1969, production payment as a loan)  exceeds the amount of his allowable deductions under   chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code. The entire amount of the November  14, 1969, production payment is treated as a mortgage loan under section  636(a).
