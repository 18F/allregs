                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 1515.408(a)(1) insert the following provision:</p><p class="depth0">Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals (AUG 1999)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Other than cost proposal instructions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Submit proposal for  than cost factors as a separate part of the total proposal package. Omit  all cost or pricing details from this proposal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special proposal instructions:  ________________________________________________________________________  ________________________________________________________________________  ________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Cost or pricing proposal instructions. The offeror shall prepare  and submit cost or pricing information data and supporting attachments  in accordance with Table 15-2 of FAR 15.408. In addition to a hard copy  of the information, to expedite review of the proposal, submit an IBM- compatible software or storage device (e.g., USB flash drive or card  reader) containing the financial data required, if this information is  available using   a commercial spreadsheet program on a personal computer. Submit this  information using Microsoft Exchange 365, if available. Identify which  version of Microsoft Exchange used. If the offeror used another  spreadsheet program, indicate the software program used to create this  information. Offerors should include the formulas and factors used in  calculating the financial data. Although submission of a compatible  software or device will expedite review, failure to submit a disk will  not affect consideration of the proposal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General--Submit cost or pricing information prepared in  accordance with FAR Table 15-2, Instructions for Submitting Cost/Price  Proposals When Cost or Pricing Information Are Required and the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Clearly identify separate cost or pricing information associated  with any:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Options to extend the term of the contract;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Options for the Government to order incremental quantities; and/ or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Major tasks, if required by the special instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the contract schedule includes a ``Fixed Rate for Services''  clause, please provide in the cost proposal a schedule duplicating the  format in the clause and include proposed fixed hourly rates per labor  category for the base and any optional contract periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the contract includes the clause at FAR 52.232-7,  ``Payments Under Time and Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts,'' include  in the cost proposal the estimated costs and burden rate to be applied  to materials, other direct costs, or subcontracts. The Government will  include these costs as part of its cost proposal evaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If other divisions, subsidiaries, a parent or affiliated  companies will perform work, provide the name and location of such  affiliate and offeror's intercompany pricing policy. Separately identify  costs and supporting data for each entity proposed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The realism of costs, including personnel compensation rates  (including effective hourly rates due to uncompensated overtime) will be  part of the proposal evaluation. Any reductions to proposed costs or  differences between proposed and known EPA/DCAA recommended rates must  be fully explained. If an offeror makes a reduction which makes its  offer or portions of its offer below anticipated costs, the offeror  shall identify where (i.e., which elements of costs) the proposed  reductions will be made. Unsubstantiated rates may result in an upward  or downward adjustment of the cost proposals to reflect more realistic  costs. Based on this analysis, a projected cost for the offeror will be  calculated to reflect the Government's estimate of the offeror's  probable costs. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between the  promised performance and cost or price should be explained. The burden  of proof for cost credibility rests with the offeror.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Direct labor. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The direct technical labor hours (level-of- effort) appearing in the solicitation are for professional and technical  labor only. These hours do not include management at a level higher than  project management, e.g., corporate and day-to-day management, nor do  they include clerical and support staff at a level lower than  technician. If it is the offeror's normal practice to charge these types  of costs as direct costs, include these costs along with an estimate of  the directly chargeable labor-hours for these personnel. These direct  charges are to be shown separately from the technical (level-of-effort)  effort. If this type of effort is normally included in the offeror's  indirect cost allocations, no estimate is required. However, direct  charging of these on any resulting contract will not be allowed.  Additionally the direct technical labor hours are the workable hours  required by the Government and do not include release time (i.e.,  holidays, vacation, etc.) Submit the proposal utilizing the labor  categories and distribution of the level-of-effort specified in the  solicitation. These are approximate distribution levels and do not  necessarily represent the actual levels which may be experienced during  contract performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Explain the basis of the proposed labor rates, including a  complete justification for all judgmental factors used to develop  weights applied to company's category or individual rates that comprise  the rates for labor categories specified in the solicitation. This  explanation should describe how technical approach coincides with the  proposed costs. If the proposed direct labor rates are based on an  average of the individuals proposed to work on the contract, provide a  list of the individuals proposed and the hours associated with each  individual in deriving the rates. If the proposed direct labor rates are  based on an average of company category rates, identify and describe the  labor categories and the percentages associated with each category in  deriving the rates, explaining in detail the basis for the percentages  assigned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Describe for each labor category proposed, the company's  qualifications and experience requirements. If individual rates are  used, provide the employee's name. If specific individuals are  identified in the technical proposal, correlate these individuals with  the labor categories specified in the solicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Provide a matrix summarizing the effort proposed, including the  subcontracts, by professional and technical level specified in the  solicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Indicate whether current rates or escalated rates are used. If  escalation is included, state the degree (percent) and methodology.   The methodology shall include the effective date of the base rates and  the policy on salary reviews (e.g. anniversary date of employee or  salary reviews for all employees on a specific date).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> State whether any additional direct labor (new hire or  temporary hires) will be required during the performance period of this  acquisition. If so, state the number required, the professional or  technical level and the methodology used to estimate proposed labor  rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> With respect to educational institutions, include the  following information for those professional staff members whose salary  is expected to be covered by a stipulated salary support agreement  pursuant to OMB Circular A-21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Individual's name;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Annual salary and the period for which the salary is applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> List of other research Projects or proposals for which salaries  are allocated, and the proportionate time charged to each; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other duties, such as teaching assignments, administrative  assignments, and other institutional activities. Show the proportionate  time charged to each. (Show proportionate time charges as a percentage  of 100% of time for the entire academic year, exclusive of vacation or  sabbatical leave.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Uncompensated overtime. The decision to propose uncompensated  overtime is the offeror's decision. Should the offeror, however, elect  to propose uncompensated overtime, the offeror must propose a  methodology that is consistent with their cost accounting practices and  company policy. If proposed, provide an estimate of any uncompensated  overtime proposed for exempt personnel working at the offeror's  facilities. This estimate should identify the number of uncompensated  labor hours and the percentage of compensated labor. Uncompensated labor  hours are defined as hours for exempt personnel in excess of regular  hours for a pay period which are actually worked and recorded in  accordance with company policy. Provide a copy of the company policy on  uncompensated overtime. Provide historical percentages of uncompensated  overtime for the past three years. If proposed for subcontractors,  provide separately with subcontractor information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> For labor rate contracts, for each fixed labor rate, offerors  shall identify the basis for the loaded fixed hourly rate for each  contract period for example, the rate might consist of the following  cost elements: raw wage or salary rate, plus fringe benefits (if  applicable), plus overhead rate (if applicable), plus G&A; expense rate  (if applicable), plus profit.</p><p class="depth0">When determining the composite raw wage for a labor category, the  offeror shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> provide in narrative form the basis for the raw wage for each  labor category. If actual wages of current employees are used, the basis  for the projections should be explained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If employees are subject to the Service Contract Act or Davis  Bacon Act, they must be compensated at least at the minimum wage rate  required by the applicable Wage Determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Indirect costs (fringe, overhead, general, and administrative  expenses). </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the rates have been recently approved, include a copy  of the rate agreement. If the agreement does not cover the projected  performance period of the proposed effort, provide the rationale and any  estimated rate calculations for the proposed performance period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Submit supporting documentation for rates which have not been  approved or audited. Indicate whether computations are based upon  historical or projected data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Provide actual pool expenses, base dollars, or hours (as  applicable for the past five years). Include the actual indirect rates  for the past five years including the indirect rates proposed, the  actual indirect rates experienced and, if available, the final  negotiated rate. Indicate the amount of unallowable costs included in  the historical data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Offerors who propose indirect rates for new or substantially  reorganized cost centers should consider offering to accept ceilings on  the indirect rates at the proposed rates. Similarly, offerors whose  subcontractors propose indirect rates for new or substantially  reorganized cost centers should likewise consider offering to accept  ceilings on the subcontractors' indirect rates at the proposed rates.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (b)(3)(iv): The Government reserves the right to  adjust an offeror's or its subcontractor's estimated indirect costs for  evaluation purposes based on the Agency's judgment of the most probable  costs up to the amount of any stated ceiling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If the employees are subject to the Service Contract Act or  Davis Bacon Act, employees must receive the minimum level of benefits  stated in the applicable Wage Determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Travel expense. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the solicitation specifies the amount of  travel costs, this amount is exclusive of any applicable indirect costs  and fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the solicitation does not specify the amount of travel  costs, attach a schedule illustrating how travel was computed. Include a  breakdown indicating number of trips, number of travelers, destinations  from and to, purpose and cost, e.g., mileage, transportation costs,  subsistence rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Equipment, facilities and special equipment, including tooling.  </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If direct charges for use of existing contractor equipment are  proposed, provide a description of these items, including estimated  usage hours, rates, and total costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If equipment purchases are proposed, provide a description of  these items, and a justification as to why the Government should furnish  the equipment or allow its purchase with contract funds. (Unless  specified elsewhere in this solicitation, FAR 45.302-1 requires  contractors to furnish all facilities in performance of contracts with  certain limited exceptions.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Identify Government-owned property in the possession of the  offeror or proposed to be used in the performance of the contract, and  the Government agency which has cognizance over the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Submit proposed rates or use charges for equipment, along with  documentation to support those rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If special purposes facilities or equipment are being proposed,  provide a description of these items, details for the proposed costs  including competitive prices, and justification as to why the Government  should furnish the equipment or allow its purchase with contract funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> If fabrication by the prime contractor is contemplated, include  details of material, labor, and overhead.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Other Direct Costs (ODC). </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the solicitation specifies the  amount of other direct costs, this amount is exclusive of any applicable  indirect cost and fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the amount is not specified in the solicitation, attach a  schedule detailing how other direct costs were computed. Identify the  major ODC items that under the accounting system would be a direct  charge on any resulting contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If any of the cost elements identified as part of the  specified other direct costs are recovered as an indirect cost, in  accordance with the offeror's accounting system, those costs should not  be included as a direct cost. Complete explanation of this adjustment  and the contractor's practice should be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Provide historical other direct costs dollars per level of  effort hour on similar contracts or work assignments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Team subcontracts. When the cost of a subcontract is substantial  (5 percent of the total estimated contract dollar value or $100,000,  whichever is less), the offeror shall include the following  subcontractor information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Provide details of subcontract costs in the same format as the  prime contractor's costs. This detailed information may be provided  separately to the EPA if the subcontractor does not wish to provide this  data to the prime contractor. Cost data provided separately by a  contractor must be received by the time, date and at the location  specified for the receipt of proposals. The subcontractor's package  should be clearly marked with the RFP number, the name of the prime  offeror, and a statement that the package is subcontractor data relevant  to the proposal from the prime offeror. If submitted with the prime  contractor's proposal, identify the subcontractors. State the amount of  service estimated to be required and the quoted daily or hourly rate.  Offerors are encouraged to provide letters of intent, signed by  subcontractors, agreeing to a specified rate for life of the contract.  Include a cost or price analysis of the subcontractor cost showing the  reasons why the costs are considered reasonable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Describe how the prospective team subcontractors were chosen as  part of the offeror's proposed team; and rationale for selection;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Describe the necessity for the subcontractor's effort as  either a supplement or complement to the offeror's in-house expertise;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Identify the areas of the scope of work and the level of effort  the subcontractors are anticipated to perform. Provide a reconciliation  summary of the proposed hours and ODCs for the prime contractor and  proposed subcontractor(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Describe the prime contractor's management structure and  internal controls to ensure efficient and quality performance of team  subcontractors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Facilities Capital Cost of Money (FCCM). When an offeror elects  to claim FCCM as an allowable cost, the offeror must submit Form CASB- CNF and show calculation of the proposed amount. FCCM will be an  allowable cost under the contemplated contract, if the criteria for  allowability at FAR 31.205-10(a)(2) are met.</p><p class="depth0">(End of provision)</p><p class="depth0">Alterate I (AUG 1999). If the Government's requirement is a fully  dedicated staff person for a twelve month period(s) for each specified  position and performance is on a Government facility, add the following  paragraph (b)(2)(x) to the basic provision:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> The level of effort for each position is to be proposed in work  years. A work year is considered to consist of 2080 hours inclusive of  direct and indirect time (40 hours per week x 52 weeks per year = 2080  hours). The proposal must identify proposed work years and clearly  identify how many hours in each work year are direct (i.e., productive  working hours) and how many are indirect (i.e., paid absences). If the  company policy includes a different base work week, the total available  hours would be different. For example, if the company's policy calls for  a 37.5 hour work week, offeror would deduct paid absences from 1950 hour  (37.5 hours/week x 52 weeks/year = 1950 hours). Offeror should clearly  identify the paid absences as to how many hours are for holiday and how  many hours are for vacation and sick leave. The   amount of indirect time (paid absences) identified in the proposal must  be consistent with company policy and must allow for the ten Federal  government holidays.</p><p class="depth0">Alternate II (AUG 1999). If the Government's requirement is a fully  dedicated staff person for a twelve month period(s) for each specified  position and performance is not on a Government facility; add the  following paragraph (b)(2)(x) to the basic provision:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> The level of effort for each position is to be proposed in work  years. A work year is considered to consist of 2080 hours inclusive of  direct and indirect time (40 hours per week x 52 weeks per year = 2080  hours). The proposal must identify proposed work years and clearly  identify how many hours in each work year are direct (i.e., productive  working hours) and how many are indirect (i.e., paid absences). If the  company policy includes a different base work week, the total available  hours would be different. For example, if the company's policy calls for  a 37.5 hour work week, offeror would deduct paid absences from 1950 hour  (37.5 hours/week x 52 weeks/year = 1950 hours). Offeror should clearly  identify the paid absences as to how many hours are for holiday and how  many hours are for vacation and sick leave.</p><p class="depth0">Alternate III (AUG 1999). If the requirement is for the acquisition  of supplies or equipment, substitute the following paragraphs (a)(iv)- (viii) and add (a)(ix) and (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Provide information as to how the proposed supplies or  equipment meet the salient characteristics required by the contract line  item;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Provide published brochures, catalogs, or other technical  literature by contract line item;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Meet any interface or compatibility requirements by contract  line item;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Describe warranty services and how delivered by contract line  item;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Assumptions, deviations and exceptions (as necessary); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Additional information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Supplies--Provide unit pricing by contract line items for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> each line item;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> delivery;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> installation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> sets of operating manuals;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> training;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> warranty;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> maintenance; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> volume discounts.
