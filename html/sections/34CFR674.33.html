If a borrower has received loans from more than one  institution and has notified the institution that he or she wants the  minimum monthly payment determination to be based on payments due to  other institutions, the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the total of the monthly repayments is equal to at least the  minimum monthly repayment, no institution may exercise a minimum monthly  repayment option.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If only one institution exercises the minimum monthly repayment  option when the monthly repayment would otherwise be less than the  minimum repayment option, that institution receives the difference  between the minimum monthly repayment and the repayment owed to the  other institution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If each institution exercises the minimum repayment option,  the minimum monthly repayment must be divided among the institutions in  proportion to the amount of principal advanced by each institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Minimum monthly repayment of both Defense and NDSL or Federal  Perkins loans from one or more institutions. If the borrower has  notified the institution that he or she wants the minimum monthly  payment determination to be   based on payments due to other institutions, and if the total monthly  repayment is less than $30 and the monthly repayment on a Defense loan  is less than $15 a month, the amount attributed to the Defense loan may  not exceed $15 a month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Minimum monthly repayment of loans with differing grace periods  and deferments.

The institution may reduce the borrower's scheduled  repayments for a period of not more than one year at a time if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It determines that the borrower is unable to make the scheduled  repayments due to hardship (see Sec.  674.33(c)); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The borrower's scheduled repayment is the minimum monthly  repayment described in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Minimum monthly repayment rates.

The school confirms this agreement by  notice to the borrower, and by recording the terms in the borrower's  file.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In granting a forbearance under this section, an institution  shall grant a temporary cessation of payments, unless the borrower  chooses another form of forbearance subject to paragraph (d)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An institution shall grant forbearance if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount of the payments the borrower is obligated to make on  title IV loans each month (or a proportional share if the payments are  due less frequently than monthly) is collectively equal to or greater  than 20 percent of the borrower's total monthly gross income;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The institution determines that the borrower should qualify for  the forbearance due to poor health or for other acceptable reasons; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Secretary authorizes a period of forbearance due to a  national military mobilization or other national emergency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Before granting a forbearance to a borrower under paragraph  (d)(5)(i) of this section, the institution shall require the borrower to  submit at least the following documentation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Evidence showing the amount of the most recent total monthly  gross income received by the borrower; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Evidence showing the amount of the monthly payments owed by the  borrower for the most recent month for the borrower's title IV loans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Interest accrues during any period of forbearance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The institution may not include the periods of forbearance  described in this paragraph in determining the 10-year repayment period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Compromise of repayment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An institution may compromise on  the repayment of a defaulted loan if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The institution has fully complied with all due diligence  requirements specified in subpart C of this part; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The student borrower pays in a single lump-sum payment--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> 90 percent of the outstanding principal balance on the loan  under this part;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The interest due on the loan; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Any collection fees due on the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Federal share of the compromise repayment must bear the same  relation to the institution's share of the compromise repayment as the  Federal capital contribution to the institution's loan Fund under this  part bears to the institution's capital contribution to the Fund.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Incentive repayment program. An institution may establish the  following repayment incentives:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A reduction of no more than one percent of the interest rate on  a loan on which the borrower has made 48 consecutive, monthly  repayments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A discount of no more than five percent on the balance owed on  a loan which the borrower pays in full prior to the end of the repayment  period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> With the Secretary's approval, any other incentive the  institution determines will reduce defaults and replenish its Fund.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limitation on the use of funds.

The school must also reimburse the  borrower for any amount of principal, interest, late charges or  collection costs the borrower paid on a loan discharged under this  section.
