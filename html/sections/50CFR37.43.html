                            <p class="depth0">If at any time while exploratory activities are being carried out  under an approved exploration plan and special use permit, the Regional  Director, on the basis of information available to him, determines that  continuation of further activities under the plan or permit will  significantly adversely affect the refuge's wildlife, its habitat, or  the environment, or significantly restrict subsistence uses, or that the  permittee has failed to comply with its approved exploration plan, plan  of operation, special use permit, any reasonable stipulation, demand or  order of the Regional Director, or any regulation of this part, the  Regional Director may, without any expense or liability to the  Department, suspend activities under the plan and/or permit for such  time, or make such modifications to the plan and/or permit, or both  suspend and so modify, as he determines necessary and appropriate. Such  suspensions shall state the reasons therefore and be effective  immediately upon receipt of the notice. Suspensions issued orally shall  be followed by a written notice confirming the action within 3 days, and  all written notices will be sent by messenger or registered mail, return  receipt requested. A suspension shall remain in effect until the basis  for the suspension has been corrected to the satisfaction of the  Regional Director. For good cause, the Regional Director may also grant  at the permittee's request, a written waiver of any provision of its  special use permit, so long as such waiver will not be likely to result  in significant adverse effects on the refuge's resources.  Reconsideration of the Regional Director's actions under this section  may be obtained by employing the procedures described in Sec.  37.22(c).  A request for reconsideration shall not operate to stay the Regional  Director's actions unless such stay is granted in writing by the  Director.</p>
