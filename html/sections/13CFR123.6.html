                                Sec. 123.6  What does SBA look for when considering a disaster loan
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">There must be reasonable assurance that you can repay your loan  based on SBA's analysis of your credit or your personal or business cash  flow, and you must also have satisfactory character. SBA will not make a  loan to you if repayment depends upon the sale of collateral through  foreclosure or any other disposition of assets owned by you. SBA is  prohibited by statute from making a loan to you if you are engaged in  the production or distribution of any product or service that has been  determined to be obscene by a court.  [61 FR 3304, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 79 FR 22862, Apr. 25, 2014]</p>
