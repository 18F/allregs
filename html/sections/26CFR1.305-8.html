Thus, for  example, section 305(b)(5) of the Code will not apply to a distribution  of convertible preferred stock made before January 1, 1991, with respect  to stock outstanding on January 10, 1969 (or which was issued pursuant  to a contract binding on the distributing corporation on January 10,  1969), provided the distribution is pursuant to the terms relating to  the issuance of such stock which were in effect on January 10, 1969.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(A)</em>, (B)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>, and (C) of the  Act to have outstanding on January 10, 1969, 4,000 shares of class A  stock (1,000 shares actually outstanding and 3,000 shares that could be  acquired by the exercise   of the conversion privilege contained in the class B stock) and 3,000  shares of class B stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For the purposes of section 421(b)(2)(A) (other than for the  purpose of determining under section 421(b)(2)(A)(iii) that class of  stock which as of January 10, 1969, had the largest fair market value of  all classes of stock of the corporation), (B)(i), and (C) of the Act,  stock will be considered as outstanding on January 10, 1969, if it is  issued pursuant to a conversion privilege contained in stock issued,  mediately or immediately, as a stock dividend with respect to stock  outstanding on January 10, 1969.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If, after applying subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the class  of stock which as of January 10, 1969, had the largest fair market value  of all classes of stock of the corporation is a class of stock which is  convertible into another class of nonconvertible stock, then for  purposes of section 421(b)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act stock issued upon  conversion of any such convertible stock (whether or not outstanding on  January 10, 1969) into stock of such other class shall be deemed to be  stock which meets the requirements of section 421(b)(2)(A)(iii) of the  Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of section 421(b) of the Act, stock of a  corporation held in its treasury will not be considered as outstanding  and a distribution of such stock will be considered to be an issuance of  such stock on the date of distribution. Stock of a parent corporation  held by its subsidiary is not considered treasury stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The following stock shall not be taken into account for purposes  of applying section 421(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Act: (i) Stock issued after  January 10, 1969, and before October 10, 1969 (other than stock which  was issued pursuant to a contract binding on January 10, 1969, on the  distributing corporation); (ii) stock described in section  421(b)(2)(C)(i), (ii), or (iii) of the Act; and (iii) stock issued,  mediately or immediately, as a stock dividend with respect to stock of  the same class outstanding on January 10, 1969. For example, if on June  1, 1970, corporation Y issues additional stock of that class of stock  which as of January 10, 1969, had the largest fair market value of all  classes of stock of the corporation, such additional stock will not be  taken into account for the purpose of meeting the requirement under  section 421(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Act that the stock as to which there is a  receipt of property must have been outstanding on January 10, 1969, and  thus subparagraph (A) of section 421(b)(2) of the Act will not, where  otherwise applicable, cease to apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Section 421(b)(2)(A) of the Act, if otherwise applicable, will  not cease to apply if the distributing corporation issues after October  9, 1969, securities which are convertible into stock that meets the  requirements of section 421(b)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act at a fixed  conversion ratio which takes account of all stock dividends and stock  splits with respect to the stock into which the securities are  convertible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Under section 421(b)(4) of the Act, section 305(b)(4) does not  apply to any distribution (or deemed distribution) by a corporation with  respect to preferred stock made before January 1, 1991, if such  distribution is pursuant to the terms relating to the issuance of such  stock which were in effect on January 10, 1969. For example, if as of  January 10, 1969, a corporation had followed the practice of paying  stock dividends on preferred stock (or of periodically increasing the  conversion ratio of convertible preferred stock) or if the preferred  stock provided for a redemption price in excess of the issue price, then  section 305(b)(4) would not apply to any distribution of stock made (or  which would be considered made if section 305(b)(4) applied) before  January 1, 1991, pursuant to such practice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> If section 421(b)(2) is not applicable and, for that reason, a  distribution (or deemed distribution) is treated as a distribution to  which section 301 applies by virtue of the application of section  305(b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(5), it is irrelevant that, by reason of the  application of section 421(b)(4) of such Act, section 305(b)(4) is not  applicable to the distribution.
