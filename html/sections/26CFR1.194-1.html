                                Sec. 1.194-1  Amortization of reforestation expenditures.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 194 allows a taxpayer to elect to amortize over an 84-month period, up to $10,000 of reforestation expenditures (as defined in Sec. 1.194-3(c)) incurred by the taxpayer in a taxable year in connection with qualified timber property (as defined in Sec. 1.194-3(a)). The election is not available to trusts. Only those reforestation expenditures which result in additions to capital accounts after December 31, 1979 are eligible for this special amortization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination of amortization period. The amortization period must begin on the first day of the first month of the last half of the taxable year during which the taxpayer incurs the reforestation expenditures. For example, the 84-month amortization period begins on July 1 of a taxable year for a calendar year taxpayer, regardless of whether the reforestation expenditures are incurred in January or December of that taxable year. Therefore, a taxpayer will be allowed to claim amortization deductions for only six months of each of the first and eighth taxable years of the period over which the reforestation expenditures will be amortized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recapture. If a taxpayer disposes of qualified timber property within ten years of the year in which the amortizable basis was created and the taxpayer has claimed amortization deductions under section 194, part or all of any gain on the disposition may be recaptured as ordinary income. See section 1245.
