                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Description. The cost-plus-incentive-fee contract is a cost- reimbursement contract that provides for the initially negotiated fee to  be adjusted later by a formula based on the relationship of total  allowable costs to total target costs. This contract type specifies a  target cost, a target fee, minimum and maximum fees, and a fee  adjustment formula. After contract performance, the fee payable to the  contractor is determined in accordance with the formula. The formula  provides, within limits, for increases in fee above target fee when  total allowable costs are less than target costs, and decreases in fee  below target fee when total allowable costs exceed target costs. This  increase or decrease is intended to provide an incentive for the  contractor to manage the contract effectively. When total allowable cost  is greater than or less than the range of costs within which the fee- adjustment formula operates, the contractor is paid total allowable  costs, plus the minimum or maximum fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A cost-plus-incentive-fee contract is  appropriate for services or development and test programs when--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A cost-reimbursement contract is necessary (see 16.301-2) and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A target cost and a fee adjustment formula can be negotiated  that are likely to motivate the contractor to manage effectively.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contract may include technical performance incentives when  it is highly probable that the required development of a major system is  feasible and the Government has established its performance objectives,  at least in general terms. This approach may also apply to other  acquisitions, if the use of both cost and technical performance  incentives is desirable and administratively practical.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The fee adjustment formula should provide an incentive that will  be effective over the full range of reasonably foreseeable variations  from target cost. If a high maximum fee is negotiated, the contract  shall also provide for a low minimum fee that may be a zero fee or, in  rare cases, a negative fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limitations. No cost-plus-incentive-fee contract shall be  awarded unless all limitations in 16.301-3 are complied with.  [48 FR 42219, Sept. 19, 1983.
