                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of section 6412 and the regulations thereunder--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Floor stocks. The term ``floor stocks'' means any article  subject to the tax imposed by section 4071 or section 4081 which--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is sold by the manufacturer (otherwise than in a tax-free sale)  before October 1, 1988,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is held by a dealer at the first moment on October 1, 1988, and  has not been used, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is intended for sale.  However, the term ``floor stocks'' does not include gasoline in retail  stocks held at the place where intended to be sold at retail, nor with  respect to gasoline held for sale by a producer or importer of gasoline.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inventory date. The term ``inventory date'' means the first  moment on the date on which an article is treated as floor stocks within  the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Dealer. The term ``dealer'' includes a wholesaler, jobber,  distributor, or retailer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Held by a dealer--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An article is considered  as ``held by a dealer'' if title to the article has passed to the dealer  (whether or not delivery to the dealer has been made), and if, for  purposes of consumption, title to or possession of the article has not  at any   time been transferred to any person other than a dealer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Floor samples, demonstrators, and articles undergoing repair  (whether or not on the dealer's premises) that are carried in stock to  be sold as new articles, and articles purchased tax-paid by a  manufacturer or a sales subsidiary and held by the person on the  inventory date for resale as such, will be considered as unused and held  by a dealer, if title to or possession of the article has not at any  time been transferred to any person for purposes of consumption.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Articles sold by a dealer to a consumer before the inventory  date and thereafter repossessed by the dealer, and articles purchased  tax-paid by a manufacturer for use in further manufacture within the  meaning of section 4221(d)(6), will not be considered as held by a  dealer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The determination as to the time title or possession passes for  purposes of consumption shall be made under applicable local law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The application of this paragraph (d) may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example (1). If, under local law, title to an article sold by a  dealer under a conditional sales contract is in the dealer on the  inventory date, but the consumer has physical possession of the article  on that date, the article is not considered as held by the dealer.</p><p class="depth3">Example (2). If, under local law, title to an article is in the  consumer on the inventory date because the article is specifically  identified with a contract, but on that date the dealer still has  physical possession of the article, for example, in his will-call  department, the article is not considered as held by the dealer on that  date because title to the article has passed to the consumer for  purposes of consumption.</p><p class="depth3">Example (3). If, under local law, title to an article is in the  consumer on the inventory date because the dealer transferred the  article to a common carrier for delivery to the consumer, the article in  transit is not considered as held by the dealer on that date because  title has passed to the consumer for purposes of consumption, even  though neither the dealer nor the consumer has physical possession of  the article.</p><p class="depth3">Example (4). If, under local law, title to an article is in the  dealer on the inventory date and does not pass to the consumer until  delivery by a common carrier, the article in transit shall be considered  as held by the dealer on that date because neither the title nor  possession has passed to the consumer for purposes of consumption.</p><p class="depth3">Example (5). If an article has been mortgaged or otherwise  hypothecated by a dealer as security for a loan and, under local law,  title to the article is in the creditor on the inventory date, and  physical possession is in the dealer, the article shall be considered as  held by the dealer on that date because neither title nor possession has  passed to the consumer for purposes of consumption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Old rate. The term ``old rate'' means the rate of tax in effect  with respect to the sale of an article before the date designated in  paragraph (a) or (b) of this section on which the tax is reduced in rate  or is terminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> New rate. The term ``new rate'' means the rate of tax, if any,  in effect with respect to the sale of an article on the date designated  in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section on which the tax is reduced in  rate or is terminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Dealer request limitation date. The term ``dealer request  limitation date'' is the date prescribed by section 6412(a)(1) before  which the request on which the manufacturer's claim is based must be  submitted to the manufacturer by the dealer who held the floor stocks on  the inventory date. In the case of an article held by a dealer on  October 1, 1988, the dealer request limitation date is January 1, 1989.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Claim limitation date. The term ``claim limitation date'' means  the last date prescribed by section 6412(a)(1) on which refund or credit  with respect to floor stocks may be claimed by a manufacturer. In the  case of an article held by a dealer on October 1, 1988, the claim  limitation date is March 31, 1989.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Tax paid. A tax is considered paid if it was paid or was offset  by an allowable credit on the return on which it was reported.  [T.D. 8043, 50 FR 32021, Aug. 8, 1985]</p>
