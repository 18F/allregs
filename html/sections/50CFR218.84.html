The speed shall be the slowest safe speed that is consistent with mission, training, and operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Planning Awareness Areas:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Navy shall avoid planning major training exercises involving the use of active sonar in the specified planning awareness areas (PAAs--see Figure 5.3-1 in the AFTT FEIS/OEIS) where feasible. Should national security require the conduct of more than four major exercises (C2X, JTFEX, or similar scale event) in these areas (meaning all or a portion of the exercise) per year, or more than one within the Gulf of Mexico areas per year, the Navy shall provide NMFS with prior notification and include the information in any associated after-action or monitoring reports.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Stranding Response Plan:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Navy shall abide by the current Stranding Response Plan for Major Navy Training Exercises in the Study Area, to include the following measures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Shutdown Procedures--When an Uncommon Stranding Event (USE--defined in Sec.  218.71 (b)(1)) occurs during a Major Training Exercise (MTE) in the

AFTT Study Area, the Navy shall implement the procedures described. in paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(A)(1) through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Navy shall implement a shutdown (as defined Sec.  218.81(b)(2)) when advised by a NMFS Office of Protected Resources Headquarters Senior Official designated in the AFTT Study Area Stranding Communication Protocol that a USE involving live animals has been identified and that at least one live animal is located in the water. NMFS and the Navy will maintain a dialogue, as needed, regarding the identification of the USE and the potential need to implement shutdown procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any shutdown in a given area shall remain in effect in that area until NMFS advises the Navy that the subject(s) of the USE at that area die or are euthanized, or that all live animals involved in the USE at that area have left the area (either of their own volition or herded).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the Navy finds an injured or dead animal floating at sea during an MTE, the Navy shall notify NMFS immediately or as soon as operational security considerations allow. The Navy shall provide NMFS with species or description of the animal(s), the condition of the animal(s), including carcass condition if the animal(s) is/are dead, location, time of first discovery, observed behavior (if alive), and photo or video (if available). Based on the information provided, NFMS will determine if, and advise the Navy whether a modified shutdown is appropriate on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In the event, following a USE, that qualified individuals are attempting to herd animals back out to the open ocean and animals are not willing to leave, or animals are seen repeatedly heading for the open ocean but turning back to shore, NMFS and the Navy shall coordinate (including an investigation of other potential anthropogenic stressors in the area) to determine if the proximity of mid-frequency active sonar training activities or explosive detonations, though farther than 14 nautical miles from the distressed animal(s), is likely contributing to the animals' refusal to return to the open water. If so, NMFS and the Navy will further coordinate to determine what measures are necessary to improve the probability that the animals will return to open water and implement those measures as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Within 72 hours of NMFS notifying the Navy of the presence of a USE, the Navy shall provide available information to NMFS (per the AFTT Study Area Communication Protocol) regarding the location, number and types of acoustic/explosive sources, direction and speed of units using mid-frequency active sonar, and marine mammal sightings information associated with training activities occurring within 80 nautical miles (148 km) and 72 hours prior to the USE event. Information not initially available regarding the 80-nautical miles (148-km), 72-hour period prior to the event will be provided as soon as it becomes available. The Navy will provide NMFS investigative teams with additional relevant unclassified information as requested, if available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p>
