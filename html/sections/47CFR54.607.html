                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The rural rate shall be the average of the rates actually being  charged to commercial customers, other than health care providers, for  identical or similar services provided by the telecommunications carrier  providing the service in the rural area in which the health care  provider is located. The rates included in this average shall be for  services provided over the same distance as the eligible service. The  rates averaged to calculate the rural rate must not include any rates  reduced by universal service support mechanisms. The ``rural rate''  shall be used as described in this subpart to determine the credit or  reimbursement due to a telecommunications carrier that provides eligible  telecommunications services to eligible health care providers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the telecommunications carrier serving the health care  provider is not providing any identical or similar services in the rural  area, then the rural rate shall be the average of the tariffed and other  publicly available rates, not including any rates reduced by universal  service programs, charged for the same or similar services in that rural  area over the same distance as the eligible service by other carriers.  If there are no tariffed or publicly available rates for such services  in that rural area, or if the carrier reasonably determines that this  method for calculating the rural rate is unfair, then the carrier shall  submit for the state commission's approval, for intrastate rates, or the  Commission's approval, for interstate rates, a cost-based rate for the  provision of the service in the   most economically efficient, reasonably available manner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The carrier must provide, to the state commission, or intrastate  rates, or to the Commission, for interstate rates, a justification of  the proposed rural rate, including an itemization of the costs of  providing the requested service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The carrier must provide such information periodically  thereafter as required, by the state commission for intrastate rates or  the Commission for interstate rates. In doing so, the carrier must take  into account anticipated and actual demand for telecommunications  services by all customers who will use the facilities over which  services are being provided to eligible health care providers.</p>
