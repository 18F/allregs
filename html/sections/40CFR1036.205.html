                            <p class="depth0">Submit an application for certification as described in 40 CFR  86.007-21, with the following additional information:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>,  treat as separate AECDs any devices that modulate or activate  differently from each other.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Describe any test equipment and procedures that you used if you  performed any tests that did not also involve measurement of criteria  pollutants. Describe any special or alternate test procedures you used  (see 40 CFR 1065.10(c)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Include the emission-related installation instructions you will  provide if someone else installs your engines in their vehicles (see  Sec.  1036.130).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Describe the label information specified in Sec.  1036.135. We  may require you to include a copy of the label.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Identify the CO2 FCLs with which you are certifying  engines in the engine family; also identify any FELs that apply for  CH4 and N2O. The actual U.S.-directed production  volume of configurations that have CO2 emission rates at or  below the FCL and CH4 and N2O emission rates at or  below the applicable standards or FELs must be at least one percent of  your actual (not projected) U.S.-directed production volume for the  engine family. Identify configurations within the family that have  emission rates at or below the FCL and meet the one percent requirement.  For example, if your U.S.-directed production volume for the engine  family is 10,583 and the U.S.-directed production volume for the tested  rating is 75 engines, then you can comply with this provision by setting  your FCL so that one more rating with a U.S.-directed production volume  of at least 31 engines meets the FCL. Where applicable, also identify  other testable configurations required under Sec.  1036.230(b)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Identify the engine family's deterioration factors and describe  how you developed them (see Sec.  1036.241). Present any test data you  used for this.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Present emission data to show that you meet emission standards,  as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Present exhaust emission data for CO2,  CH4, and N2O on an emission-data engine to show  that your engines meet the applicable emission standards we specify in  Sec.  1036.108. Show emission figures before and after applying  deterioration factors for each engine. In addition to the composite  results, show individual measurements for cold-start testing and hot- start testing over the transient test cycle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Note that Sec.  1036.235 allows you to submit an application in  certain cases without new emission data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> State whether your certification is limited for certain engines.  For example, if you certify heavy heavy-duty engines to the  CO2 standards using only transient testing, the engines may  be installed only in vocational vehicles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Unconditionally certify that all the engines in the engine  family comply with the requirements of this part, other referenced parts  of the CFR, and the Clean Air Act. Note that Sec.  1036.235 specifies  which engines to test to show that engines in the entire family comply  with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Include the information required by other subparts of this part.  For example, include the information required by Sec.  1036.725 if you  participate in the ABT program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Include the warranty statement and maintenance instructions if  we request them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Include other applicable information, such as information  specified in this part or 40 CFR part 1068 related to requests for  exemptions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> For imported engines or equipment, identify the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Describe your normal practice for importing engines. For  example, this   may include identifying the names and addresses of any agents you have  authorized to import your engines. Engines imported by nonauthorized  agents are not covered by your certificate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The location of a test facility in the United States where you  can test your engines if we select them for testing under a selective  enforcement audit, as specified in 40 CFR part 1068, subpart E.  [76 FR 57381, Sept. 15, 2011, as amended at 78 FR 36389, June 17, 2013]</p>
