                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pursuant to section 1345 of the Act, the Federal Insurance  Administrator may enter into arrangements with individual private sector  property insurance companies or other insurers, such as public entity  risk sharing organizations. Under these arrangements, such companies or  other insurers may offer flood insurance coverage under the program to  eligible applicants. Such WYO companies may offer flood coverage to  policyholders insured by them under their own property business lines of  insurance, pursuant to their customary business practices, including  their usual arrangements with agents and producers. WYO companies may  sell flood insurance coverage in any State in which the WYO company is  authorized to engage in the business of property insurance. Other WYO  insurers may offer flood insurance coverage to their pool members  insured by them under their own property business lines of coverage,  pursuant to their customary business practices. These other WYO insurers  may provide flood coverage in any State that has authorized the other  insurer to provide property coverage to its members. Arrangements  entered into by WYO Companies or other insurers under this subpart must  be in the form and substance of the standard arrangement, titled  ``Financial Assistance/Subsidy Arrangement,'' a copy of which is  included in appendix A of this part and made a part of these  regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any duly authorized insurer so engaged in the Program shall be a  WYO Company. (The term ``WYO Company'' shall include the following kinds  of insurers: Public entity risk-sharing organizations, an association of  local governments, a State association of political subdivisions, a  State-sponsored municipal league, and other intergovernmental risk- sharing pool for covering public entity structures.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A WYO Company is authorized to arrange for the issuance of flood  insurance in any amount within the maximum limits of coverage specified  in Sec. 61.6 of this subchapter, as Insurer, to any person qualifying  for such coverage under parts 61 and 64 of this subchapter who submits  an application to the WYO Company; coverage shall be issued under the  Standard Flood Insurance Policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A WYO Company issuing flood insurance coverage shall arrange for  the adjustment, settlement, payment and defense of all claims arising  from policies of flood insurance it issues under the Program, based upon  the terms and conditions of the Standard Flood Insurance Policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In carrying out its functions under this subpart, a WYO Company  shall use its own customary standards, staff and independent contractor  resources, as it would in the ordinary and necessary conduct of its own  business affairs, subject to the Act and regulations prescribed by the  Federal Insurance Administrator under the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> To facilitate the marketing of flood insurance coverage under  the Program to policyholders of WYO Companies, the Federal Insurance  Administrator will enter into arrangements with such companies whereby  the Federal Government will be a guarantor in which the primary  relationship between the WYO Company and the Federal Government will be  one of a fiduciary nature, i.e., to assure that any taxpayer funds are  accounted for and appropriately expended. In furtherance of this end,  the Federal Insurance Administrator has established ``A Plan to Maintain  Financial Control for Business Written Under the Write Your   Own Program'', a copy of which is included in appendix B of this part  and made a part of these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A WYO Company shall act as a fiscal agent of the Federal  Government, but not as its general agent. WYO Companies are solely  responsible for their obligations to their insured under any flood  insurance policies issued under agreements entered into with the Federal  Insurance Administrator, such that the Federal Government is not a  proper party defendant in any lawsuit arising out of such policies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> To facilitate the underwriting of flood insurance coverage by  WYO Companies, the following procedures will be used by WYO Companies:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To expedite business growth, the WYO Company will encourage its  present property insurance policyholders to purchase flood insurance  through the NFIP WYO Program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To conform its underwriting practices to the underwriting rules  and rates in effect as to the NFIP, the WYO Company will establish  procedures to carry out the NFIP rating system and provide its  policyholders with the same coverage as is afforded under the NFIP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The WYO Company may follow its customary billing practices to  meet the Federal rules on the presentment of premium and net premium  deposits to a Letter of Credit bank account authorized by the Federal  Insurance Administrator and reduction of coverage when an underpayment  is discovered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The WYO Company is expected to meet the recording and reporting  requirements of the WYO Transaction Record Reporting and Processing  Plan. Transactions reported by the WYO Company under the WYO Transaction  Record Reporting and Processing Plan will be analyzed by the NFIP Bureau  & Statistical Agent. A monthly report will be submitted to the WYO  Company and the FIA. The analysis will cover the timeliness of WYO  Company submissions, the disposition of transactions that have not  passed systems edits and the reconciliation of the totals generated from  transaction reports with those submitted on the WYO Company's  reconciliation reports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a WYO Company rejects an application from an agent or a  producer, the agent or producer shall be notified so that the business  can be placed through the NFIP Servicing Agent, or another WYO Company.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Flood insurance coverage will be issued by the WYO Company on a  separate policy form and will not be added, by endorsement, to the  Company's other property insurance forms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Premium payment plans can be offered by the WYO Company so long  as the net premium depository requirements specified under the NFIP/WYO  Program accounting procedures are met. A cancellation by the WYO Company  for non-payment of premium will not produce a pro rata return of the net  premium deposit to the WYO Company.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> NFIP business will not be assumed by the WYO Companies at any  time other than at renewal time, at which time the insurance producer  may submit the business to the WYO Company as new business. However, it  is permissible to cancel and rewrite flood policies to obtain concurrent  expiration dates with other policies covering the property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> To facilitate the adjustment of flood insurance claims by WYO  Companies, the following procedures will be used by WYO Companies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Under the terms of the Arrangement set forth at appendix A of  this part, WYO Companies will adjust claims in accordance with general  Company standards, guided by NFIP Claims manuals. The Arrangement also  provides that claim adjustments shall be binding upon the FIA. For  example, the entire responsibility for providing a proper adjustment for  both combined wind and water claims and flood-alone claims is the  responsibility of the WYO Company. The responsibility for providing a  proper adjustment for combined wind and water claims is to be conducted  by listing in concert with the Single Adjuster provisions listed in  appendix A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The WYO Company may use its staff adjusters, independent  adjusters, or both. It is important that the Company's Claims Department  verifies the correctness of the coverage interpretations and  reasonableness of the payments recommended by the adjusters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An established loss adjustment Fee Schedule is part of the  Arrangement and cannot be changed during an Arrangement year. This is  the expense allowance to cover costs of independent or WYO Company  adjusters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The normal catastrophe claims procedure currently operated by a  WYO Company should be implemented in the event of a claim catastrophe  situation. Flood claims will be handled along with other catastrophe  claims.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> It will be the WYO Company's responsibility to try to detect  fraud (as it does in the case of property insurance) and coordinate its  findings with FIA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Pursuant to the Arrangement, the responsibility for defending  claims will be upon the Write Your Own Company and defense costs will be  part of the unallocated or allocated claim expense allowance, depending  on whether a staff counsel or an outside attorney handles the defense of  the matter. Claims in litigation will be reported by WYO Companies to  FIA upon joinder of issue and FIA may inquire and be advised of the  disposition of such litigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The claim reserving procedures of the individual WYO Company can  be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Regarding the handling of subrogation, if a WYO Company prefers  to forego pursuit of subrogation recovery, it may do so by referring the  matter, with a complete copy of the claim file, to FIA. Subrogation  initiatives may be truncated at any time before suit is commenced (after  commencing an action, special arrangement must bemade). FIA, after  consultation with FEMA's Office of the Chief Counsel (OCC), will forward  the cause of action to OCC or to the NFIP Bureau and Statistical Agent  for prosecution. Any funds received will be deposited, less expenses, in  the National Flood Insurance Fund.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Special allocated loss adjustment expenses will include such  items as: nonstaff attorney fees, engineering fees and special  investigation fees over and above normal adjustment practices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The customary content of claim files will include coverage  verification, normal adjuster investigations, including statements where  necessary, police reports, building reports and investigations, damage  verification and other documentation relevant to the adjustment of  claims under the NFIP's and the WYO Company's traditional claim  adjustment practices and procedures. The WYO Company's claim examiners  and managers will supervise the adjustment of flood insurance claims by  staff and independent claims adjusters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The WYO Company will extend reasonable cooperation to FEMA's  Office of the Chief Counsel on matters pertaining to litigation and  subrogation, under paragraph (i)(8) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> To facilitate establishment of financial controls under the WYO  Program, the WYO Company will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Have a biennial audit of the flood insurance financial  statements conducted by an independent Certified Public Accountant (CPA)  firm at the Company's expense to ensure that the financial data reported  to us accurately represents the flood insurance activities of the  Company. The CPA firm must conduct its audits in accordance with the  generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) and Government Auditing  Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States  (commonly known as ``yellow book'' requirements). The Company must file  with us (the Federal Insurance Administration) a report of the CPA  firm's detailed biennial audit, and, after our review of the audit  report, we will convey our determination to the Standards Committee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Participate in a WYO Company/FIA Operation review. We will  conduct a review of the WYO Company's flood insurance claims,  underwriting, customer service, marketing, and litigation activities at  least once every three (3) years. As part of these reviews, we will  reconcile specific files with a listing of transactions submitted by the  Company under the Transaction Record Reporting and Processing (TRPP)  Plan (Part 5). We will file a report of the Operation Review with the  Standards Committee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Meet the recording and reporting requirements of the WYO  Transaction Record Reporting and Processing Plan and the WYO Accounting  Procedures Manual. Transactions reported to the National Flood Insurance  Program's   (NFIP's) Bureau and Statistical Agent by the WYO Company under the WYO  Transaction Record Reporting and Processing Plan and the WYO Accounting  Procedures Manual will be analyzed by the Bureau and Statistical Agent  and a monthly report will be submitted to the WYO Company and the FIA.  The analysis will cover the timeliness of the WYO Company submissions,  the disposition of transactions which do not pass systems edits and the  reconciliation of the totals generated from transaction reports with  those submitted on WYO Company reconciliation reports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cooperate with FEMA's Chief Financial Officer on Letter of  Credit matters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Cooperate with FIA in the implementation of a claims  reinspection program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Cooperate with FIA in the verification of risk rating  information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Cooperate with DHS's Office of the Inspector General on matters  pertaining to fraud.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> To facilitate the operation of the WYO Program and in order that  a WYO Company can use its own customary standards, staff and independent  contractor resources, as it would in the ordinary and necessary conduct  of its own business affairs, subject to the Act, the Federal Insurance  Administrator, for good cause shown, may grant exceptions to and waivers  of the regulations contained in this title relative to the  administration of the NFIP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> WYO Companies may, on a voluntary basis, elect to participate  in the Mortgage Portfolio Protection Program (MPPP), under which they  can offer, as a last resort, flood insurance at special high rates,  sufficient to recover the full cost of this program in recognition of  the uncertainty as to the degree of risk a given building presents due  to the limited underwriting data required, to properties in a lending  institution's mortgage portfolio to achieve compliance with the flood  insurance purchase requirements of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of  1973. Flood insurance policies under the MPPP may only be issued for  those properties that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Are determined to be located within special flood hazard areas  of communities that are participating in the NFIP, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Are not covered by a flood insurance policy even after a  required series of notices have been given to the property owner  (mortgagor) by the lending institution of the requirement for obtaining  and maintaining such coverage, but the mortgagor has failed to respond.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> WYO Companies participating in the MPPP must provide a detailed  implementation package to any lending institution that, on a voluntary  basis, chooses to participate in the MPPP to ensure the lending  institution has full knowledge of the criteria in that program and must  obtain a signed receipt for that package from the lending institution.  Participating WYO Companies must also maintain evidence of compliance  with paragraph (l)(3) of this section for review during the audits and  reviews required by the WYO Financial Control Plan contained in appendix  B of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The mortgagor must be protected against the lending  institution's arbitrary placing of flood insurance for which the  mortgagor will be billed by being sent three notification letters as  described in paragraphs (l)(4) through (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The initial notification letter must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> State the requirements of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of  1973, as amended;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Announce the determination that the mortgagor's property is in  an identified special flood hazard area as delineated on the appropriate  FEMA map, necessitating flood insurance coverage for the duration of the  loan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Describe the procedure to follow should the mortgagor wish to  challenge the determination;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Request evidence of a valid flood insurance policy or, if there  is none, encourage the mortgagor to obtain a Standard Flood Insurance  Policy (SFIP) promptly from a local insurance agent (or WYO Company);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Advise that the premium for a MPPP policy is significantly  higher than a conventional SFIP policy and   advise as to the option for obtaining less costly flood insurance; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Advise that a MPPP policy will be purchased by the lender if  evidence of flood insurance coverage is not received by a date certain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The second notification letter must remind the mortgagor of the  previous notice and provide essentially the same information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The final notification letter must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Enclose a copy of the flood insurance policy purchased under the  MPPP on the mortgagor's (insured's) behalf, together with the  Declarations Page,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Advise that the policy was purchased because of the failure to  respond to the previous notices, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Remind the insured that similar coverage may be available at  significantly lower cost and advise that the policy can be cancelled at  any time during the policy year and a pro rata refund provided for the  unearned portion of the premium in the event the insured purchases  another policy that is acceptable to satisfy the requirements of the  1973 Act.
