                            <p class="depth0">Every application for Federal financial assistance to which this  regulation applies, and every application for Federal financial  assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition to its approval  and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the  application, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the program  will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with all  requirements imposed by or pursuant to this regulation. In the case of  an application for Federal financial assistance to provide real property  or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or,  in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period  during which the real property   or structures are used for a purpose for which the Federal financial  assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of  similar services or benefits. In the case of personal property the  assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which he  retains ownership or possession of the property. In all other cases the  assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which  Federal financial assistance is extended pursuant to the application.  The responsible agency official shall specify the form of the foregoing  assurances and the extent to which like assurances will be required of  subgrantee, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in  interest, and other participants. Any such assurance shall include  provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial  enforcement.  [30 FR 321, Jan. 9, 1965.
