In lieu of a Cargo Declaration,  Customs Form 1302, to cover such cargo, the owner, underwriter (if the  merchandise has been abandoned to him), or the salvor of the merchandise  shall make entry on Customs Form 7501, and any such applicant shall be  regarded as the consignee of the merchandise for Customs purposes. \76\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\76\ ``* * * The underwriters of abandoned merchandise and the  salvors of merchandise saved from a wreck at sea or on or along a coast  of the United States may be regarded as the consignees.''* * * (Tariff  Act of 1930, sec. 483; 19 U.S.C. 1483) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All such merchandise shall be taken into possession by the  director of the port where it shall first arrive and be retained in his  custody pending entry.
