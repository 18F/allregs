                                Sec. 1980.444  Appraisal of property serving as collateral.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Appraisal reports prepared by independent qualified fee  appraisers will be required on all property that will serve as  collateral. In the case of loans two million dollars or less, the State  Director may modify this requirement by permitting the appraisal to be  made by a qualified appraiser on the lender's staff with experience  appraising the type of collateral involved. The appraisers will give  their opinion regarding the current market value of the collateral and  the purpose for which the appraisal will be used. The lender will be  responsible for assuring that appropriate appraisals are made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The lender will be responsible for determining that appraisers  have the necessary qualifications and experience to make the appraisals.  The lender will consult with FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 for its recommendations before having the appraisal made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The lender will determine that the fees or charges of appraisers  are reasonable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Independent appraisals will be made in accordance with the  accepted format of the industry and those prepared by the lender in  accordance with its policy and procedures. All appraisals will become  part of the application. (See Sec. 1980.541(i)(6) of this subpart.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a subsequent loan request is made within 3 years from the  date of the most recent borrower's appraisal report, and there is no  significant change in collateral, then the FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 State Director in his/her discretion, and if  the lender agrees, may use the existing appraisal report in lieu of  having a new appraisal prepared.  [52 FR 6501, Mar. 4, 1987, as amended at 53 FR 40401, Oct. 17, 1988]</p>
