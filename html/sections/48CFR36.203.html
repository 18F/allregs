                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An independent Government estimate of construction costs shall  be prepared and furnished to the contracting officer at the earliest  practicable time for each proposed contract and for each contract  modification anticipated to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.  The contracting officer may require an estimate when the cost of  required work is not anticipated to exceed the simplified acquisition  threshold. The estimate shall be prepared in as much detail as though  the Government were competing for award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When two-step sealed bidding is used, the independent Government  estimate shall be prepared when the contract requirements are  definitized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Access to information concerning the Government estimate shall  be limited to Government personnel whose official duties require  knowledge of the estimate. An exception to this rule may be made during  contract negotiations to allow the contracting officer to identify a  specialized task and disclose the associated cost breakdown figures in  the Government estimate, but only to the extent deemed necessary to  arrive at a fair and reasonable price. The overall amount of the  Government's estimate shall not be disclosed except as permitted by  agency regulations.
