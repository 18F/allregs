                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law and equity are not controlling in hearings or proceedings conducted under this part. The Administrative Law Judge may, however, exclude evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Depositions. The deposition of any witness taken pursuant to Sec. 10.71 may be admitted into evidence in any proceeding instituted under Sec. 10.60.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requests for admission. Any matter admitted in response to a request for admission under Sec. 10.71 is conclusively established unless the Administrative Law Judge on motion permits withdrawal or modification of the admission. Any admission made by a party is for the purposes of the pending action only and is not an admission by a party for any other purpose, nor may it be used against a party in any other proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Proof of documents. Official documents, records, and papers of the Internal Revenue Service and the Office of Professional Responsibility are admissible in evidence without the production of an officer or employee to authenticate them. Any documents, records, and papers may be evidenced by a copy attested to or identified by an officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service or the Treasury Department, as the case may be.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Withdrawal of exhibits. If any document, record, or other paper is introduced in evidence as an exhibit, the Administrative Law Judge may authorize the withdrawal of the exhibit subject to any conditions that he or she deems proper.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Objections. Objections to evidence are to be made in short form, stating the grounds for the objection. Except as ordered by the Administrative Law Judge, argument on objections will not be recorded or transcribed. Rulings on objections are to be a part of the

record, but no exception to a ruling is necessary to preserve the rights of the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable on September 26, 2007.
