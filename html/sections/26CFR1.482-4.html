                                Sec. 1.482-4  Methods to determine taxable income in connection
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>. Each of the methods must be  applied in accordance with all of the provisions of Sec. 1.482-1,  including the best method rule of Sec. 1.482-1(c), the comparability  analysis of Sec. 1.482-1(d), and the arm's length range of Sec. 1.482- 1(e). The arm's length consideration for the transfer of an intangible  determined under this section must be commensurate with the income  attributable to the intangible. See Sec. 1.482-4(f)(2) (Periodic  adjustments). The available methods are--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The comparable uncontrolled transaction method, described in  paragraph (c) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The comparable profits method, described in Sec. 1.482-5;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The profit split method, described in Sec. 1.482-6; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Unspecified methods described in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definition of intangible. For purposes of section 482, an  intangible is an asset that comprises any of the following items and has  substantial value independent of the services of any individual--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Patents, inventions, formulae, processes, designs, patterns, or  know-how;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Copyrights and literary, musical, or artistic compositions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Trademarks, trade names, or brand names;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Franchises, licenses, or contracts;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Methods, programs, systems, procedures, campaigns, surveys,  studies, forecasts, estimates, customer lists, or technical data; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Other similar items. For purposes of section 482, an item is  considered similar to those listed in paragraph (b)(1) through (5) of  this section if it derives its value not from its physical attributes  but from its intellectual content or other intangible properties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Comparable uncontrolled transaction method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  comparable uncontrolled transaction method evaluates whether the amount  charged for a controlled transfer of intangible property was arm's  length by reference to the amount charged in a comparable uncontrolled  transaction. The amount determined under this method may be adjusted as  required by paragraph (f)(2) of this section (Periodic adjustments).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Comparability and reliability considerations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  Whether results derived from applications of this method are the most  reliable measure of an arm's length result is determined using the  factors described under the best method rule in Sec. 1.482-1(c). The  application of these factors under the comparable uncontrolled  transaction method is discussed in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii), (iii), and  (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reliability. If an uncontrolled transaction involves the  transfer of the same intangible under the same, or substantially the  same, circumstances as the controlled transaction, the results derived  from applying the comparable uncontrolled transaction method will  generally be the most direct and reliable measure of the arm's length  result for the controlled transfer of an intangible. Circumstances  between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions will be considered  substantially the same if there are at most only minor differences that  have a definite and reasonably ascertainable effect on the amount  charged and for which appropriate adjustments are made. If such  uncontrolled transactions cannot be identified, uncontrolled  transactions that involve the transfer of comparable intangibles under  comparable circumstances may be used to apply this method, but the  reliability of the analysis will be reduced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Comparability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The degree of comparability  between controlled and uncontrolled transactions is determined by  applying the comparability provisions of Sec. 1.482-1(d). Although all  of the factors described in Sec. 1.482-1(d)(3) must be considered,  specific factors may be particularly relevant to this method. In  particular, the application of this method requires that the controlled  and uncontrolled transactions involve either the same intangible  property or comparable intangible property, as defined in paragraph  (c)(2)(iii)(B)(1) of this section. In addition, because differences in  contractual terms, or the economic conditions in which transactions take  place, could materially affect the amount charged, comparability under  this method also depends on similarity with respect to these factors, or  adjustments to account for material differences in such circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Factors to be considered in determining comparability--(1)  Comparable intangible property. In order for the intangible property  involved in an uncontrolled transaction to be considered comparable to  the intangible property involved in the controlled transaction, both  intangibles must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Be used in connection with similar products or processes within  the same general industry or market; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Have similar profit potential. The profit potential of an  intangible is most reliably measured by directly calculating the net  present value of the benefits to be realized (based on prospective  profits to be realized or costs to be saved) through the use or  subsequent transfer of the intangible, considering the capital  investment and start-up expenses required, the risks to be assumed, and  other relevant considerations. The need to reliably measure profit  potential increases in relation to both the total amount of potential  profits and the potential rate of return on investment necessary to  exploit the intangible. If the information necessary to directly  calculate net present value of the benefits to be realized is  unavailable, and the need to reliably measure profit potential is  reduced because the potential profits are relatively small in terms of  total amount and rate of return, comparison of profit potential may be  based upon the factors referred to in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B)(2) of  this section. See Example 3 of Sec. 1.482-4(c)(4). Finally, the  reliability of a measure of profit potential is affected by the extent  to which the profit attributable to the intangible can be isolated from  the profit attributable to other factors, such as functions performed  and other resources employed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Comparable circumstances. In evaluating the comparability of the  circumstances of the controlled and uncontrolled transactions, although  all of the factors described in Sec. 1.482-1(d)(3) must be considered,  specific factors that may be particularly relevant to this method  include the following--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The terms of the transfer, including the exploitation rights  granted in the intangible, the exclusive or nonexclusive character of  any rights granted, any restrictions on use, or any limitations on the  geographic area in which the rights may be exploited;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The stage of development of the intangible (including, where  appropriate, necessary governmental approvals, authorizations, or  licenses) in the market in which the intangible is to be used;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Rights to receive updates, revisions, or modifications of the  intangible;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The uniqueness of the property and the period for which it  remains unique, including the degree and duration of protection afforded  to the property under the laws of the relevant countries;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The duration of the license, contract, or other agreement, and  any termination or renegotiation rights;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Any economic and product liability risks to be assumed by the  transferee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The existence and extent of any collateral transactions or  ongoing business relationships between the transferee and transferor;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The functions to be performed by the transferor and  transferee, including any ancillary or subsidiary services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Data and assumptions. The reliability of the results derived  from the comparable uncontrolled transaction method is affected by the  completeness and accuracy of the data used and the reliability of the  assumptions made to apply this method. See Sec. 1.482-1(c) (Best method  rule).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Arm's length range. See Sec. 1.482-1(e)(2) for the determination  of an arm's length range.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> USpharm, a U.S. pharmaceutical company, develops a  new drug Z that is a safe and effective treatment for the disease  zeezee. USpharm has obtained patents covering drug Z in the United  States and in various foreign countries. USpharm has also obtained the  regulatory authorizations necessary to market drug Z in the United  States and in foreign countries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> USpharm licenses its subsidiary in country X, Xpharm, to  produce and sell drug Z in country X. At the same time, it licenses an  unrelated company, Ydrug, to produce and sell drug Z in country Y, a  neighboring country. Prior to licensing the drug, USpharm had obtained  patent protection and regulatory approvals in both countries and both  countries provide similar protection for intellectual property rights.  Country X and country Y are similar countries in terms of population,  per capita income and the incidence of disease zeezee. Consequently,  drug Z is expected to sell in similar quantities and at similar prices  in both countries. In addition, costs of producing and marketing drug Z  in each country are expected to be approximately the same.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> USpharm and Xpharm establish terms for the license of drug Z  that are identical in every material respect, including royalty rate, to  the terms established between USpharm and Ydrug. In this case the  district director determines that the royalty rate established in the  Ydrug license agreement is a reliable measure of the arm's length  royalty rate for the Xpharm license agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the  incidence of the disease zeezee in Country Y is much higher than in  Country X. In this case, the profit potential from exploitation of the  right to make and sell drug Z is likely to be much higher in country Y  than it is in Country X. Consequently, the Ydrug license agreement is  unlikely to provide a reliable measure of the arm's length royalty rate  for the Xpharm license.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> FP, is a foreign company that designs, manufactures  and sells industrial equipment. FP has developed proprietary components  that are incorporated in its products. These components are important in  the operation of FP's equipment and some of them have distinctive  features, but other companies produce similar components and none of  these components by itself accounts for a substantial part of the value  of FP's products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> FP licenses its U.S. subsidiary, USSub, exclusive North  American rights to use the patented technology for producing component  X, a heat exchanger used for cooling operating mechanisms in industrial  equipment. Component X incorporates proven technology that makes it  somewhat more efficient than the heat exchangers commonly used in  industrial equipment. FP also agrees to provide technical support to  help adapt component X to USSub's products and to assist with initial  production. Under the terms of the license agreement USSub pays FP a  royalty equal to 3 percent of sales of USSub equipment incorporating  component X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> FP does not license unrelated parties to use component X, but  many similar components are transferred between uncontrolled taxpayers.  Consequently, the district director decides to apply the comparable  uncontrolled transaction method to evaluate whether the 3 percent  royalty for component X is an arm's length royalty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The district director uses a database of company documents  filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to identify  potentially comparable license agreements between uncontrolled taxpayers  that are on file with the SEC. The district director identifies 40  license agreements that were entered into in the same year as the  controlled transfer or in the prior or following year, and that relate  to transfers of technology associated with industrial equipment that has  similar applications to USSub's products. Further review of these  uncontrolled agreements indicates that 25 of them involved components  that have a similar level of technical sophistication as component X and  could be expected to play a similar role in contributing to the total  value of the final product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The district director makes a detailed review of the terms of  each of the 25 uncontrolled agreements and finds that 15 of them are  similar to the controlled agreement in that they all involve--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The transfer of exclusive rights for the North American market;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Products for which the market could be expected to be of a  similar size to the market for the products into which USSub  incorporates component X;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The transfer of patented technology;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Continuing technical support;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Access to technical improvements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Technology of a similar age; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> A similar duration of the agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Based on these factors and the fact that none of the components  to which these license agreements relate accounts for a substantial part  of the value of the final products, the district director concludes that  these fifteen intangibles have similar profit potential to the component  X technology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The 15 uncontrolled comparables produce the following royalty  rates:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Royalty</p><p class="depth0">License                               rate</p><p class="depth0"><em>(percent)</em> ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1...........................................................        1.0 2...........................................................        1.0 3...........................................................        1.25 4...........................................................        1.25 5...........................................................        1.5 6...........................................................        1.5 7...........................................................        1.75 8...........................................................        2.0 9...........................................................        2.0 10..........................................................        2.0 11..........................................................        2.25 12..........................................................        2.5 13..........................................................        2.5 14..........................................................        2.75 15..........................................................        3.0 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Although the uncontrolled comparables are clearly similar to  the controlled transaction, it is likely that unidentified material  differences exist between the uncontrolled comparables and the  controlled transaction. Therefore, an appropriate statistical technique  must be used to establish the arm's length range. In this case the  district director uses the interquartile range to determine the arm's  length range. Therefore, the arm's length range covers royalty rates  from 1.25 to 2.5 percent, and an adjustment is warranted to the 3  percent royalty charged in the controlled transfer. The district  director determines that the appropriate adjustment corresponds to a  reduction in the royalty rate to 2.0 percent, which is the median of the  uncontrolled comparables.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> USdrug, a U.S. pharmaceutical company, has developed  a new drug, Nosplit, that is useful in treating migraine headaches and  produces no significant side effects. Nosplit replaces another drug,  Lessplit, that USdrug had previously produced and marketed as a  treatment for migraine headaches. A number of other drugs for treating  migraine headaches are already on the market, but Nosplit can be  expected rapidly to dominate the worldwide market for such treatments  and to command a premium price since all other treatments produce side  effects. Thus, USdrug projects that extraordinary profits will be  derived from Nosplit in the U.S. market and other markets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> USdrug licenses its newly established European subsidiary,  Eurodrug, the rights to produce and market Nosplit in the European  market. In setting the royalty rate for this license, USdrug considers  the royalty that it established previously when it licensed the right to  produce and market Lessplit in the European market to an unrelated  European pharmaceutical company. In many respects the two license  agreements are closely comparable. The drugs were licensed at the same  stage in their development and the agreements conveyed identical rights  to the licensees. Moreover, there appear to have been no significant  changes in the European market for migraine headache treatments since  Lessplit was licensed. However, at the time that Lessplit was licensed  there were several other similar drugs already on the market to which  Lessplit was not in all cases superior. Consequently, the projected and  actual Lessplit profits were substantially less than the projected  Nosplit profits. Thus, USdrug concludes that the profit potential of  Lessplit is not similar to the profit potential of Nosplit, and the  Lessplit license agreement consequently is not a comparable uncontrolled  transaction for purposes of this paragraph (c) in spite of the other  indicia of comparability between the two intangibles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Unspecified methods--(1) In general. Methods not specified in  paragraphs (a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>, (2), and (3) of this section may be used to evaluate  whether the amount charged in a controlled transaction is arm's length.  Any method used under this paragraph (d) must be applied in accordance  with the provisions of Sec. 1.482-1. Consistent with the specified  methods, an unspecified method should take into account the general  principle that uncontrolled taxpayers evaluate the terms of a  transaction by considering the realistic alternatives to that  transaction, and only enter into a particular transaction if none of the  alternatives is preferable to it. For example, the comparable  uncontrolled transaction method compares a controlled transaction to  similar uncontrolled transactions to provide a direct estimate of the  price the parties would have agreed to had they resorted directly to a  market alternative to the controlled transaction. Therefore, in  establishing whether a controlled transaction achieved an arm's length  result, an unspecified method should provide information on the prices  or profits that the controlled taxpayer could have realized by choosing  a realistic alternative to the controlled transaction. As with any  method, an unspecified method will not be applied unless it provides the  most reliable measure of an arm's length result under the principles of  the best method rule. See Sec. 1.482-1(c). Therefore, in accordance with  Sec. 1.482-1(d) (Comparability), to the extent that a method relies on  internal data rather than uncontrolled comparables, its reliability will  be reduced. Similarly, the reliability of a method will be affected by  the reliability of the data and assumptions used to apply the method,  including any projections used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example illustrates an application of the  principle of this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> USbond is a U.S. company that licenses to its foreign  subsidiary, Eurobond, a proprietary process that permits the manufacture  of Longbond, a long-lasting industrial adhesive, at a substantially  lower cost than otherwise would be possible. Using the proprietary  process, Eurobond manufactures Longbond and sells it to related and  unrelated parties for the market price of $550 per ton. Under the terms  of the license agreement, Eurobond pays USbond a royalty of $100 per ton  of Longbond sold. USbond also manufactures and markets Longbond in the  United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In evaluating whether the consideration paid for the transfer  of the proprietary process to Eurobond was arm's length, the district  director may consider, subject to the best method rule of Sec. 1.482- 1(c), USbond's alternative of producing and selling Longbond itself.  Reasonably reliable estimates indicate that if USbond directly supplied  Longbond to the European market, a selling price of $300 per ton would  cover its costs and provide a reasonable profit for its functions, risks  and investment of capital associated with the production of Longbond for  the European market. Given that the market price of Longbond was $550  per ton, by licensing the   proprietary process to Eurobond, USbond forgoes $250 per ton of profit  over the profit that would be necessary to compensate it for the  functions, risks and investment involved in supplying Longbond to the  European market itself. Based on these facts, the district director  concludes that a royalty of $100 for the proprietary process is not  arm's length.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Coordination with tangible property rules. See Sec. 1.482-3(f)  for the provisions regarding the coordination between the tangible  property and intangible property rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Special rules for transfers of intangible property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Form of  consideration. If a transferee of an intangible pays nominal or no  consideration and the transferor has retained a substantial interest in  the property, the arm's length consideration shall be in the form of a  royalty, unless a different form is demonstrably more appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Periodic adjustments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. If an intangible is  transferred under an arrangement that covers more than one year, the  consideration charged in each taxable year may be adjusted to ensure  that it is commensurate with the income attributable to the intangible.  Adjustments made pursuant to this paragraph (f)(2) shall be consistent  with the arm's length standard and the provisions of Sec. 1.482-1. In  determining whether to make such adjustments in the taxable year under  examination, the district director may consider all relevant facts and  circumstances throughout the period the intangible is used. The  determination in an earlier year that the amount charged for an  intangible was an arm's length amount will not preclude the district  director in a subsequent taxable year from making an adjustment to the  amount charged for the intangible in the subsequent year. A periodic  adjustment under the commensurate with income requirement of section 482  may be made in a subsequent taxable year without regard to whether the  taxable year of the original transfer remains open for statute of  limitation purposes. For exceptions to this rule see paragraph  (f)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Transactions involving the same intangible. If  the same intangible was transferred to an uncontrolled taxpayer under  substantially the same circumstances as those of the controlled  transaction; this transaction serves as the basis for the application of  the comparable uncontrolled transaction method in the first taxable year  in which substantial periodic consideration was required to be paid; and  the amount paid in that year was an arm's length amount, then no  allocation in a subsequent year will be made under paragraph (f)(2)(i)  of this paragraph for a controlled transfer of intangible property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Transactions involving comparable intangible. If the arm's  length result is derived from the application of the comparable  uncontrolled transaction method based on the transfer of a comparable  intangible under comparable circumstances to those of the controlled  transaction, no allocation will be made under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of  this section if each of the following facts is established--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The controlled taxpayers entered into a written agreement  (controlled agreement) that provided for an amount of consideration with  respect to each taxable year subject to such agreement, such  consideration was an arm's length amount for the first taxable year in  which substantial periodic consideration was required to be paid under  the agreement, and such agreement remained in effect for the taxable  year under review;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> There is a written agreement setting forth the terms of the  comparable uncontrolled transaction relied upon to establish the arm's  length consideration (uncontrolled agreement), which contains no  provisions that would permit any change to the amount of consideration,  a renegotiation, or a termination of the agreement, in circumstances  comparable to those of the controlled transaction in the taxable year  under review (or that contains provisions permitting only specified,  non-contingent, periodic changes to the amount of consideration);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The controlled agreement is substantially similar to the  uncontrolled agreement, with respect to the time period for which it is  effective and the provisions described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B)(2) of  this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The controlled agreement limits use of the intangible to a  specified field   or purpose in a manner that is consistent with industry practice and any  such limitation in the uncontrolled agreement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> There were no substantial changes in the functions performed by  the controlled transferee after the controlled agreement was executed,  except changes required by events that were not foreseeable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The aggregate profits actually earned or the aggregate cost  savings actually realized by the controlled taxpayer from the  exploitation of the intangible in the year under examination, and all  past years, are not less than 80% nor more than 120% of the prospective  profits or cost savings that were foreseeable when the comparability of  the uncontrolled agreement was established under paragraph (c)(2) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Methods other than comparable uncontrolled transaction. If the  arm's length amount was determined under any method other than the  comparable uncontrolled transaction method, no allocation will be made  under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section if each of the following facts  is established--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The controlled taxpayers entered into a written agreement  (controlled agreement) that provided for an amount of consideration with  respect to each taxable year subject to such agreement, and such  agreement remained in effect for the taxable year under review;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The consideration called for in the controlled agreement was an  arm's length amount for the first taxable year in which substantial  periodic consideration was required to be paid, and relevant supporting  documentation was prepared contemporaneously with the execution of the  controlled agreement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> There have been no substantial changes in the functions  performed by the transferee since the controlled agreement was executed,  except changes required by events that were not foreseeable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The total profits actually earned or the total cost savings  realized by the controlled transferee from the exploitation of the  intangible in the year under examination, and all past years, are not  less than 80% nor more than 120% of the prospective profits or cost  savings that were foreseeable when the controlled agreement was entered  into.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Extraordinary events. No allocation will be made under paragraph  (f)(2)(i) of this section if the following requirements are met--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Due to extraordinary events that were beyond the control of the  controlled taxpayers and that could not reasonably have been anticipated  at the time the controlled agreement was entered into, the aggregate  actual profits or aggregate cost savings realized by the taxpayer are  less than 80% or more than 120% of the prospective profits or cost  savings; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(ii)</em> (B) or (C) of  this section are otherwise satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Five-year period. If the requirements of Sec. 1.482-4  (f)(2)(ii)(B) or (f)(2)(ii)(C) are met for each year of the five-year  period beginning with the first year in which substantial periodic  consideration was required to be paid, then no periodic adjustment will  be made under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section in any subsequent  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph  (f)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> USdrug, a U.S. pharmaceutical company, has developed  a new drug, Nosplit, that is useful in treating migraine headaches and  produces no significant side effects. A number of other drugs for  treating migraine headaches are already on the market, but Nosplit can  be expected rapidly to dominate the worldwide market for such treatments  and to command a premium price since all other treatments produce side  effects. Thus, USdrug projects that extraordinary profits will be  derived from Nosplit in the U.S. and European markets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> USdrug licenses its newly established European subsidiary,  Eurodrug, the rights to produce and market Nosplit for the European  market for 5 years. In setting the royalty rate for this license, USdrug  makes projections of the annual sales revenue and the annual profits to  be derived from the exploitation of Nosplit by Eurodrug. Based on the  projections, a royalty rate of 3.9% is established for the term of the  license.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In Year 1, USdrug evaluates the royalty rate it received from  Eurodrug. Given the high profit potential of Nosplit, USdrug is unable  to locate any uncontrolled transactions dealing with licenses of  comparable intangible property. USdrug therefore determines that the  comparable uncontrolled   transaction method will not provide a reliable measure of an arm's  length royalty. However, applying the comparable profits method to  Eurodrug, USdrug determines that a royalty rate of 3.9% will result in  Eurodrug earning an arm's length return for its manufacturing and  marketing functions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In Year 5, the U.S. income tax return for USdrug is examined,  and the district director must determine whether the royalty rate  between USdrug and Eurodrug is commensurate with the income attributable  to Nosplit. In making this determination, the district director  considers whether any of the exceptions in Sec. 1.482-4(f)(2)(ii) are  applicable. In particular, the district director compares the profit  projections attributable to Nosplit made by USdrug against the actual  profits realized by Eurodrug. The projected and actual profits are as  follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Profit</p><p class="depth0">projections   Actual profits ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Year 1..................................             200             250 Year 2..................................             250             300 Year 3..................................             500             600 Year 4..................................             350             200 Year 5..................................             100             100</p><p class="depth0">-------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Total...............................            1400            1450 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The total profits earned through Year 5 were not less than 80%  nor more than 120% of the profits that were projected when the license  was entered into. If the district director determines that the other  requirements of Sec. 1.482-4(f)(2)(ii)(C) were met, no adjustment will  be made to the royalty rate between USdrug and Eurodrug for the license  of Nosplit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  Eurodrug's actual profits earned were much higher than the projected  profits, as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Profit</p><p class="depth0">projections   Actual profits ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Year 1..................................             200             250 Year 2..................................             250             500 Year 3..................................             500             800 Year 4..................................             350             700 Year 5..................................             100             600</p><p class="depth0">-------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Total...............................            1400            2850 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In examining USdrug's tax return for Year 5, the district  director considers the actual profits realized by Eurodrug in Year 5,  and all past years. Accordingly, although Years 1 through 4 may be  closed under the statute of limitations, for purposes of determining  whether an adjustment should be made with respect to the royalty rate in  Year 5 with respect to Nosplit, the district director aggregates the  actual profits from those years with the profits of Year 5. However, the  district director will make an adjustment, if any, only with respect to  Year 5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> FP, a foreign corporation, licenses to USS, its U.S.  subsidiary, a new air-filtering process that permits manufacturing  plants to meet new environmental standards. The license runs for a 10- year period, and the profit derived from the new process is projected to  be $15 million per year, for an aggregate profit of $150 million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)(1)</em> through (5) of this section have been met.  Specifically, FP and USS have entered into a written agreement that  provides for a royalty in each year of the license, the royalty rate is  considered arm's length for the first taxable year in which a  substantial royalty was required to be paid, the license limited the use  of the process to a specified field, consistent with industry practice,  and there are no substantial changes in the functions performed by USS  after the license was entered into.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In examining Year 4 of the license, the district director  determines that the aggregate actual profits earned by USS through Year  4 are $30 million, less than 80% of the projected profits of $60  million. However, USS establishes to the satisfaction of the district  director that the aggregate actual profits from the process are less  than 80% of the projected profits in Year 3 because an earthquake  severely damaged USS's manufacturing plant. Because the difference  between the projected profits and actual profits was due to an  extraordinary event that was beyond the control of USS, and could not  reasonably have been anticipated at the time the license was entered  into, the requirement under Sec. 1.482-4(f)(2)(ii)(D) has been met, and  no adjustment under this section is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ownership of intangible property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Identification of owner-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The legal owner of intangible property pursuant to the  intellectual property law of the relevant jurisdiction, or the holder of  rights constituting an intangible property pursuant to contractual terms  (such as the terms of a license) or other legal provision, will be  considered the sole owner of the respective intangible property for  purposes of this section unless such ownership is inconsistent with the  economic substance of the underlying transactions. See Sec. 1.482- 1(d)(3)(ii)(B) (identifying contractual terms). If no owner of the  respective intangible property is identified under the intellectual  property law of the relevant jurisdiction, or pursuant to contractual   terms (including terms imputed pursuant to Sec. 1.482-1(d)(3)(ii)(B)) or  other legal provision, then the controlled taxpayer who has control of  the intangible property, based on all the facts and circumstances, will  be considered the sole owner of the intangible property for purposes of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Cost sharing arrangements. The rules in this paragraph (f)(3)  regarding ownership with respect to cost shared intangibles and cost  sharing arrangements will apply only as provided in Sec. 1.482-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The principles of this paragraph (f)(3) are  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. FP, a foreign corporation, is the registered holder of  the AA trademark in the United States. FP licenses to its U.S.  subsidiary, USSub, the exclusive rights to manufacture and market  products in the United States under the AA trademark. FP is the owner of  the trademark pursuant to intellectual property law. USSub is the owner  of the license pursuant to the terms of the license, but is not the  owner of the trademark. See paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section  (defining an intangible as, among other things, a trademark or a  license).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1. As a result of  its sales and marketing activities, USSub develops a list of several  hundred creditworthy customers that regularly purchase AA trademarked  products. Neither the terms of the contract between FP and USSub nor the  relevant intellectual property law specify which party owns the customer  list. Because USSub has knowledge of the contents of the list, and has  practical control over its use and dissemination, USSub is considered  the sole owner of the customer list for purposes of this paragraph  (f)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Contribution to the value of intangible property owned by  another--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The arm's length consideration for a  contribution by one controlled taxpayer that develops or enhances the  value, or may be reasonably anticipated to develop or enhance the value,  of intangible property owned by another controlled taxpayer will be  determined in accordance with the applicable rules under section 482. If  the consideration for such a contribution is embedded within the  contractual terms for a controlled transaction that involves such  intangible property, then ordinarily no separate allocation will be made  with respect to such contribution. In such cases, pursuant to  Sec. 1.482-1(d)(3), the contribution must be accounted for in evaluating  the comparability of the controlled transaction to uncontrolled  comparables, and accordingly in determining the arm's length  consideration in the controlled transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The principles of this paragraph (f)(4) are  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, a member of a controlled group, allows B, another  member of the controlled group, to use tangible property, such as  laboratory equipment, in connection with B's development of an  intangible that B owns. By furnishing tangible property, A makes a  contribution to the development of intangible property owned by another  controlled taxpayer, B. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section,  the arm's length charge for A's furnishing of tangible property will be  determined under the rules for use of tangible property in Sec. 1.482- 2(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. FP, a foreign producer of wristwatches, is the  registered holder of the YY trademark in the United States and in other  countries worldwide. FP enters into an exclusive, five-year, renewable  agreement with its newly organized U.S. subsidiary, USSub. The  contractual terms of the agreement grant USSub the exclusive right to  re-sell YY trademark wristwatches in the United States, obligate USSub  to pay a fixed price per wristwatch throughout the entire term of the  contract, and obligate both FP and USSub to undertake without separate  compensation specified types and levels of marketing activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The consideration for FP's and USSub's marketing activities, as  well as the consideration for the exclusive right to re-sell YY  trademarked merchandise in the United States, are embedded in the  transfer price paid for the wristwatches. Accordingly, pursuant to  paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, ordinarily no separate allocation  would be appropriate with respect to these embedded contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether an allocation is warranted with respect to the  transfer price for the wristwatches is determined under Secs. 1.482-1,  1.482-3, and this section through Sec. 1.482-6. The comparability  analysis would include consideration of all relevant factors, including  the nature of the intangible property embedded in the wristwatches and  the nature of the marketing activities required under the agreement.  This analysis would also take into account that the compensation for the  activities performed by USSub and FP, as well as the consideration for  USSub's use of the YY trademark, is embedded in the transfer price for  the wristwatches, rather than   provided for in separate agreements. See Secs. 1.482-3(f) and 1.482- 9(m)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. FP, a foreign producer of athletic gear, is  the registered holder of the AA trademark in the United States and in  other countries. In year 1, FP licenses to a newly organized U.S.  subsidiary, USSub, the exclusive rights to use certain manufacturing and  marketing intangible property to manufacture and market athletic gear in  the United States under the AA trademark. The license agreement  obligates USSub to pay a royalty based on sales of trademarked  merchandise. The license agreement also obligates FP and USSub to  perform without separate compensation specified types and levels of  marketing activities. In year 1, USSub manufactures and sells athletic  gear under the AA trademark in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The consideration for FP's and USSub's respective marketing  activities is embedded in the contractual terms of the license for the  AA trademark. Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this  section, ordinarily no separate allocation would be appropriate with  respect to the embedded contributions in year 1. See Sec. 1.482-9(m)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether an allocation is warranted with respect to the royalty  under the license agreement would be analyzed under Sec. 1.482-1, and  this section through Sec. 1.482-6. The comparability analysis would  include consideration of all relevant factors, such as the term and  geographical exclusivity of the license, the nature of the intangible  property subject to the license, and the nature of the marketing  activities required to be undertaken pursuant to the license. Pursuant  to paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, the analysis would also take  into account the fact that the compensation for the marketing services  is embedded in the royalty paid for use of the AA trademark, rather than  provided for in a separate services agreement. For illustrations of  application of the best method rule, see Sec. 1.482-8 Examples 10, 11,  and 12.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The year 1 facts are the same as in Example 3,  with the following exceptions. In year 2, USSub undertakes certain  incremental marketing activities in addition to those required by the  contractual terms of the license for the AA trademark executed in year  1. The parties do not execute a separate agreement with respect to these  incremental marketing activities performed by USSub. The license  agreement executed in year 1 is of sufficient duration that it is  reasonable to anticipate that USSub will obtain the benefit of its  incremental activities, in the form of increased sales or revenues of  trademarked products in the U.S. market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To the extent that it was reasonable to anticipate that USSub's  incremental marketing activities would increase the value only of  USSub's intangible property (that is, USSub's license to use the AA  trademark for a specified term), and not the value of the AA trademark  owned by FP, USSub's incremental activities do not constitute a  contribution for which an allocation is warranted under paragraph  (f)(4)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The year 1 facts are the same as in Example 3.  In year 2, FP and USSub enter into a separate services agreement that  obligates USSub to perform certain incremental marketing activities to  promote AA trademark athletic gear in the United States, above and  beyond the activities specified in the license agreement executed in  year 1. In year 2, USSub begins to perform these incremental activities,  pursuant to the separate services agreement with FP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whether an allocation is warranted with respect to USSub's  incremental marketing activities covered by the separate services  agreement would be evaluated under Secs. 1.482-1 and 1.482-9, including  a comparison of the compensation provided for the services with the  results obtained under a method pursuant to Sec. 1.482-9, selected and  applied in accordance with the best method rule of Sec. 1.482-1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether an allocation is warranted with respect to the royalty  under the license agreement is determined under Sec. 1.482-1, and this  section through Sec. 1.482-6. The comparability analysis would include  consideration of all relevant factors, such as the term and geographical  exclusivity of the license, the nature of the intangible property  subject to the license, and the nature of the marketing activities  required to be undertaken pursuant to the license. The comparability  analysis would take into account that the compensation for the  incremental activities by USSub is provided for in the separate services  agreement, rather than embedded in the royalty paid for use of the AA  trademark. For illustrations of application of the best method rule, see  Sec. 1.482-8 Examples 10, 11, and 12.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The year 1 facts are the same as in Example 3.  In year 2, FP and USSub enter into a separate services agreement that  obligates FP to perform incremental marketing activities, not specified  in the year 1 license, by advertising AA trademarked athletic gear in  selected international sporting events, such as the Olympics and the  soccer World Cup. FP's corporate advertising department develops and  coordinates these special promotions. The separate services agreement  obligates USSub to pay an amount to FP for the benefit to USSub that may  reasonably be anticipated as the result of FP's incremental activities.  The separate services agreement is not a qualified cost sharing  arrangement under   Sec. 1.482-7T. FP begins to perform the incremental activities in year 2  pursuant to the separate services agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whether an allocation is warranted with respect to the  incremental marketing activities performed by FP under the separate  services agreement would be evaluated under Sec. 1.482-9. Under the  circumstances, it is reasonable to anticipate that FP's activities would  increase the value of USSub's license as well as the value of FP's  trademark. Accordingly, the incremental activities by FP may constitute  in part a controlled services transaction for which USSub must  compensate FP. The analysis of whether an allocation is warranted would  include a comparison of the compensation provided for the services with  the results obtained under a method pursuant to Sec. 1.482-9, selected  and applied in accordance with the best method rule of Sec. 1.482-1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether an allocation is appropriate with respect to the  royalty under the license agreement would be evaluated under  Secs. 1.482-1 through 1.482-3, this section, and Secs. 1.482-5 and  1.482-6. The comparability analysis would include consideration of all  relevant factors, such as the term and geographical exclusivity of  USSub's license, the nature of the intangible property subject to the  license, and the marketing activities required to be undertaken by both  FP and USSub pursuant to the license. This comparability analysis would  take into account that the compensation for the incremental activities  performed by FP was provided for in the separate services agreement,  rather than embedded in the royalty paid for use of the AA trademark.  For illustrations of application of the best method rule, see  Sec. 1.482-8, Example 10, Example 11, and Example 12.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Consideration not artificially limited. The arm's length  consideration for the controlled transfer of an intangible is not  limited by the consideration paid in any uncontrolled transactions that  do not meet the requirements of the comparable uncontrolled transaction  method described in paragraph (c) of this section. Similarly, the arm's  length consideration for an intangible is not limited by the prevailing  rates of consideration paid for the use or transfer of intangibles  within the same or similar industry.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Lump sum payments--(i) In general. If an intangible is  transferred in a controlled transaction for a lump sum, that amount must  be commensurate with the income attributable to the intangible. A lump  sum is commensurate with income in a taxable year if the equivalent  royalty amount for that taxable year is equal to an arm's length  royalty. The equivalent royalty amount for a taxable year is the amount  determined by treating the lump sum as an advance payment of a stream of  royalties over the useful life of the intangible (or the period covered  by an agreement, if shorter), taking into account the projected sales of  the licensee as of the date of the transfer. Thus, determining the  equivalent royalty amount requires a present value calculation based on  the lump sum, an appropriate discount rate, and the projected sales over  the relevant period. The equivalent royalty amount is subject to  periodic adjustments under Sec. 1.482-4(f)(2)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> to the same extent as  an actual royalty payment pursuant to a license agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the principle of  this paragraph (f)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> FSub is  the foreign subsidiary of USP, a U.S. company. USP licenses FSub the  right to produce and sell the whopperchopper, a patented new kitchen  appliance, for the foreign market. The license is for a period of five  years, and payment takes the form of a single lump-sum charge of  $500,000 that is paid at the beginning of the period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The equivalent royalty amount for this license is determined by  deriving an equivalent royalty rate equal to the lump-sum payment  divided by the present discounted value of FSub's projected sales of  whopperchoppers over the life of the license. Based on the riskiness of  the whopperchopper business, an appropriate discount rate is determined  to be 10 percent. Projected sales of whopperchoppers for each year of  the license are as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Projected</p><p class="depth0">Year                                 sales ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.......................................................      $2,500,000 2.......................................................       2,600,000 3.......................................................       2,700,000 4.......................................................       2,700,000 5.......................................................       2,750,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Based on this information, the present discounted value of the  projected whopperchopper sales is approximately $10 million, yielding an  equivalent royalty rate   of approximately 5%. Thus, the equivalent royalty amounts for each year  are as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Projected      Equivalent</p><p class="depth0">Year                         sales      royalty amount ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.......................................      $2,500,000        $125,000 2.......................................       2,600,000         130,000 3.......................................       2,700,000         135,000 4.......................................       2,700,000         135,000 5.......................................       2,750,000         137,500 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If in any of the five taxable years the equivalent royalty  amount is determined not to be an arm's length amount, a periodic  adjustment may be made pursuant to Sec. 1.482-4(f)(2)(i). The adjustment  in such case would be equal to the difference between the equivalent  royalty amount and the arm's length royalty in that taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Coordination with rules governing cost sharing arrangements.  Section 1.482-7 provides the specific methods to be used to determine  arm's length results of controlled transactions in connection with a  cost sharing arrangement. This section provides the specific methods to  be used to determine arm's length results of a transfer of intangible  property, including in an arrangement for sharing the costs and risks of  developing intangibles other than a cost sharing arrangement covered by  Sec. 1.482-7. In the case of such an arrangement, consideration of the  principles, methods, comparability, and reliability considerations set  forth in Sec. 1.482-7 is relevant in determining the best method,  including an unspecified method, under this section, as appropriately  adjusted in light of the differences in the facts and circumstances  between such arrangement and a cost sharing arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Effective/applicability date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided  in the succeeding sentence, the provisions of paragraphs (f)(3) and (4)  of this section are generally applicable for taxable years beginning  after December 31, 2006.
