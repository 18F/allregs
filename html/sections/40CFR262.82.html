                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. The level of control for exports and imports of waste is indicated by assignment of the waste to either a list of wastes subject to the Green control procedures or a list of wastes subject to the Amber control procedures and by the national procedures of the United States, as defined in Sec. 262.80(a). The OECD Green and Amber lists are incorporated by reference in Sec. 262.89(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Listed wastes subject to the Green control procedures. (i) Green wastes that are not considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in Sec. 262.80(a) are subject to existing controls normally applied to commercial transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Green wastes that are not considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in Sec. 262.80(a) are subject to existing controls normally applied to commercial transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Green wastes that are considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in Sec. 262.80(a) are subject to the Amber control procedures set forth in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Listed wastes subject to the Amber control procedures. (i) Amber wastes that are considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in Sec. 262.80(a) are subject to the Amber control procedures set forth in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Amber wastes that are considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in Sec. 262.80(a) are subject to the Amber control procedures set forth in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amber wastes that are considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in Sec. 262.80(a), are subject to the Amber control procedures in the United States, even if they are imported to or exported from a designated OECD Member country listed in Sec. 262.58(a)(1) that does not consider the waste to be hazardous. In such an event, the responsibilities of the Amber control procedures shift as provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For U.S. exports, the United States shall issue an acknowledgement of receipt and assume other responsibilities of the competent authority of the country of import.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For U.S. imports, the U.S. recovery facility/importer and the United States shall assume the obligations associated with the Amber control procedures that normally apply to the exporter and country of export, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Amber wastes that are not considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in Sec. 262.80(a), but are considered hazardous by an OECD Member country are subject to the Amber control procedures in the OECD Member country that considers the waste hazardous. All responsibilities of the U.S. importer/exporter shift to the importer/exporter of the OECD Member country that considers the waste hazardous unless the parties make other arrangements through contracts.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (a)(2):</p><p class="depth0">Some wastes subject to the Amber control procedures are not listed or otherwise identified as hazardous under RCRA, and therefore are not subject to the Amber control procedures of this subpart. Regardless of the status of the waste under RCRA, however, other Federal environmental statutes (e.g., the Toxic Substances Control Act) restrict certain waste imports or exports. Such restrictions continue to apply with regard to this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Procedures for mixtures of wastes. (i) A Green waste that is mixed with one or more other Green wastes such that the resulting mixture is not considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in Sec. 262.80(a) shall be subject to the Green control procedures, provided the composition of this mixture does not impair its environmentally sound recovery.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (a)(3)(i):</p><p class="depth0">The regulated community should note that some OECD Member countries may require, by domestic law, that mixtures of different Green wastes be subject to the Amber control procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A Green waste that is mixed with one or more Amber wastes, in any amount, de minimis or otherwise, or a mixture of two or more Amber wastes, such that the resulting waste mixture is considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in Sec. 262.80(a) are subject to the Amber control procedures, provided the composition of this mixture does not impair its environmentally sound recovery.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (a)(3)(ii):</p><p class="depth0">The regulated community should note that some OECD Member countries may require, by domestic law, that a mixture of a Green waste and more than a de minimis amount of an Amber waste or a mixture of two or more Amber wastes be subject to the Amber control procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Wastes not yet assigned to an OECD waste list are eligible for transboundary movements, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If such wastes are considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in Sec. 262.80(a), such wastes are subject to the Amber control procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If such wastes are not considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in Sec. 262.80(a), such wastes are subject to the Green control procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General conditions applicable to transboundary movements of hazardous waste: (1) The waste must be destined for recovery operations at a facility that, under applicable domestic law, is operating or is authorized to operate in the importing country;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The transboundary movement must be in compliance with applicable international transport agreements; and</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (b)(2):</p><p class="depth0">These international agreements include, but are not limited to, the Chicago Convention (1944), ADR (1957), ADNR (1970), MARPOL Convention (1973/1978), SOLAS Convention (1974), IMDG Code (1985), COTIF (1985), and RID (1985).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any transit of waste through a non-OECD Member country must be conducted in compliance with all applicable international and national laws and regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Provisions relating to re-export for recovery to a third country: (1) Re-export of wastes subject to the Amber control procedures from the United States, as the country of import, to a third country listed in Sec. 262.58(a)(1) may occur only after an exporter in the United States provides notification to and obtains consent from the competent authorities in the third country, the original country of export, and any transit countries. The notification must comply with the notice and consent procedures in Sec. 262.83 for all countries concerned and the original country of export. The competent authorities of the original country of export, as well as the competent authorities of all other countries concerned have thirty (30) days to object to the proposed movement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The thirty (30) day period begins once the competent authorities of both the initial country of export and new country of import issue Acknowledgements of Receipt of the notification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The transboundary movement may commence if no objection has been lodged after the thirty (30) day period has passed or immediately after written consent is received from all relevant OECD importing and transit countries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of re-export of Amber wastes to a country other than those listed in Sec. 262.58(a)(1), notification to and consent of the competent authorities of the original OECD Member country of export and any OECD Member countries of transit is required as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, in addition to compliance with all international agreements and arrangements to which the first importing OECD Member country is a party and all applicable regulatory requirements for exports from the first country of import.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Duty to return or re-export wastes subject to the Amber control procedures. When a transboundary movement of wastes subject to the Amber control procedures cannot be completed in accordance with the terms of the contract or the consent(s) and alternative arrangements cannot be made to recover the waste in an environmentally sound manner in the country of import, the waste must be returned to the country of export or re-exported to a third country. The provisions of paragraph (c) of this section apply to any shipments to be re-exported to a third country. The following provisions apply to shipments to be returned to the country of export as appropriate:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Return from the United States to the country of export: The U.S. importer must inform EPA at the specified address in Sec. 262.83(b)(1)(i) of the need to return the shipment. EPA will then inform the competent authorities of the countries of export and transit, citing the reason(s) for returning the waste. The U.S. importer must complete the return within ninety (90) days from the time EPA informs the country of export of the need to return the waste, unless informed in writing by EPA of another timeframe agreed to by the concerned Member countries. If the return shipment will cross any transit country, the return shipment may only occur after EPA provides notification to and obtains consent from the competent authority of the country of transit, and provides a copy of that consent to the U.S. importer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Return from the country of import to the United States: The U.S. exporter must provide for the return of the hazardous waste shipment within ninety (90) days from the time the country of import informs EPA of the need to return the waste or such other period of time as the concerned Member countries agree. The U.S. exporter must submit an exception report to EPA in accordance with Sec. 262.87(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Duty to return wastes subject to the Amber control procedures from a country of transit. When a transboundary movement of wastes subject to the Amber control procedures does not comply with the requirements of the notification and movement documents or otherwise constitutes illegal shipment,

and if alternative arrangements cannot be made to recover these wastes in an environmentally sound manner, the waste must be returned to the country of export. The following provisions apply as appropriate:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Return from the United States (as country of transit) to the country of export: The U.S. transporter must inform EPA at the specified address in Sec. 262.83(b)(1)(i) of the need to return the shipment. EPA will then inform the competent authority of the country of export, citing the reason(s) for returning the waste. The U.S. transporter must complete the return within ninety (90) days from the time EPA informs the country of export of the need to return the waste, unless informed in writing by EPA of another timeframe agreed to by the concerned Member countries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Return from the country of transit to the United States (as country of export): The U.S. exporter must provide for the return of the hazardous waste shipment within ninety (90) days from the time the competent authority of the country of transit informs EPA of the need to return the waste or such other period of time as the concerned Member countries agree. The U.S. exporter must submit an exception report to EPA in accordance with Sec. 262.87(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Requirements for wastes destined for and received by R12 and R13 facilities. The transboundary movement of wastes destined for R12 and R13 operations must comply with all Amber control procedures for notification and consent as set forth in Sec. 262.83 and for the movement document as set forth in Sec. 262.84. Additional responsibilities of R12/R13 facilities include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Indicating in the notification document the foreseen recovery facility or facilities where the subsequent R1-R11 recovery operation takes place or may take place.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Within three (3) days of the receipt of the wastes by the R12/R13 recovery facility or facilities, the facility(ies) shall return a signed copy of the movement document to the exporter and to the competent authorities of the countries of export and import. The facility(ies) shall retain the original of the movement document for three (3) years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> As soon as possible, but no later than thirty (30) days after the completion of the R12/R13 recovery operation and no later than one (1) calendar year following the receipt of the waste, the R12 or R13 facility(ies) shall send a certificate of recovery to the foreign exporter and to the competent authority of the country of export and to the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Office of Federal Activities, International Compliance Assurance Division (2254A), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. Washington, DC 20460, by mail, e-mail without digital signature followed by mail, or fax followed by mail.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When an R12/R13 recovery facility delivers wastes for recovery to an R1-R11 recovery facility located in the country of import, it shall obtain as soon as possible, but no later than one (1) calendar year following delivery of the waste, a certification from the R1-R11 facility that recovery of the wastes at that facility has been completed. The R12/R13 facility must promptly transmit the applicable certification to the competent authorities of the countries of import and export, identifying the transboundary movements to which the certification pertain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> When an R12/R13 recovery facility delivers wastes for recovery to an R1-R11 recovery facility located:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the initial country of export, Amber control procedures apply, including a new notification;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In a third country other than the initial country of export, Amber control procedures apply, with the additional provision that the competent authority of the initial country of export shall also be notified of the transboundary movement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Laboratory analysis exemption. The transboundary movement of an Amber waste is exempt from the Amber control procedures if it is in certain quantities and destined for laboratory analysis to assess its physical or chemical characteristics, or to determine its suitability for recovery operations. The quantity of such waste shall be determined by the minimum quantity reasonably needed to perform the analysis in each particular case adequately, but

in no case exceed twenty-five kilograms (25 kg). Waste destined for laboratory analysis must still be appropriately packaged and labeled.</p>
