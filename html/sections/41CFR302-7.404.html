                                Sec.  302-7.404  Are separate weight certificates required when HHG are  administrative expense in the same lot?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Yes, separate weight certificates are required when the PBP&E; and  its packing allowance pushes the shipment over the net weight allowance.  Otherwise, for administrative efficiency, the HHG shipment should be  billed and paid for as a single shipment. If separate weight  certificates are required, then the weight of PBP&E; and the  administrative appropriation chargeable must be listed as separate items  on the bill of lading or other shipping document.</p>
