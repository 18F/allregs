OEI and 2-minute OEI ratings. Following this run, the turbine assembly must be within serviceable limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the test requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, each engine for which 30-second OEI and 2-minute OEI ratings are desired, that incorporates a means for automatic temperature control within its operating limitations in accordance with Sec. 33.28(k), must run for a period of 4 minutes at the maximum power-on rpm with the gas temperature at least 35 [deg]F (19 [deg]C) higher than the maximum operating limit at 30-second OEI rating. Following this run, the turbine assembly may exhibit distress beyond the limits for an overtemperature condition provided the engine is shown by analysis or test, as found necessary by the FAA, to maintain the integrity of the turbine assembly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A separate test vehicle may be used for each test condition.
