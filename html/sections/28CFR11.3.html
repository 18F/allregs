Best efforts shall be made to encourage extensive participation by law firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in the competition for award of these contracts in the pilot districts. Such efforts shall include, at minimum, publication of the requirement for these services in the Commerce Business Daily and in a selection of pertinent legal publications likely to reach socially and economically disadvantaged firms, as well as sending written notice of the requirements to bar associations that have a significant socially and economically disadvantaged membership in the pilot districts. These special recruitment efforts will not authorize or permit preferential consideration to any bidders in selection for award of these contracts. The Department's Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization shall also make its resources available to assist in encouraging broad participation in this competition.</p>
