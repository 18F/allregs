CCC will issue facility payment guarantees only in connection with projects that CCC determines will benefit primarily exports of U.S. agricultural commodities and products, and only where there is a firm contract for the sale of goods or services for the establishment or improvement of an agriculture-related facility. The contract may be contingent, however, on the issuance of a CCC facility payment guarantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Initial payment requirement. The contract for sale of goods or services between the exporter and the importer shall oblige the importer to make an initial payment(s) to the exporter of at least 15 percent of the net contract value in Sec. 1493.260(b)(1). Such initial payment(s) shall be in U.S. dollars or instruments having a definite value in U.S. dollars, and shall be made prior to the export of the goods or services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Required method of payment. CCC will issue a facility payment guarantee only in connection with a sale in which payment will be made under either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An irrevocable foreign bank letter of credit specifically stating the deferred payment terms under which the foreign bank is obligated to make payments in U.S. dollars as payments become due; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An irrevocable foreign bank letter of credit supported by a related obligation specifically stating the deferred payment terms under which the foreign bank is obligated to make payment in U.S. dollars as such payments become due.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Form of letter of credit.

The related obligation referred to in paragraph (d) of this section shall be in one of the following forms:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A letter of credit including a specific promise to pay on deferred payment terms as a special instruction from the issuing bank directly to the U.S. financial institution to refinance the amounts paid by the U.S. financial institution for obligations financed according to the tenor of the letter of credit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A separate document specifically identified and referred to in the letter of credit as the agreement under which the foreign bank is obligated to repay the U.S. financial institution on deferred payment terms;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A separate document setting forth the related obligation, or in a duly executed amendment thereto, as having been financed by a U.S. financial institution pursuant to, and subject to, repayment in accordance with the terms of such related obligation; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A promissory note executed by a foreign bank issuing the letter of credit in favor of the financial institution.</p>
