                            <p class="depth0">Repossession of personal property, located on a Navy or Marine Corps  installation, belonging to a member or to any dependent residing at or  located on a Department of the Navy installation, may be permitted in  the discretion of the commanding officer of the installation where the  property is located, subject to the following. The documents purporting  to authorize repossession and the procedures for repossessing the  property must comply with State law. Prior to permitting physical  repossession of any property, the commanding officer shall cause an  informal inquiry into the circumstances and then determine whether to  allow the repossession. If repossession is to be allowed, the person  whose property is to be repossessed should be asked if he wishes   to relinquish the property voluntarily. Repossession must be carried out  in a manner prescribed by the commanding officer. In the case of  property owned by civilian employees of the Department of the Navy or  civilian contractors or their employees or dependents, the commanding  officer should direct that the disputed property be removed from the  installation until the commanding officer is satisfied that the dispute  is resolved.    Sec. Sec. 720.26-720.29  [Reserved]</p>
