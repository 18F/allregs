                                Sec. 105.16  Sexual assault annual and quarterly reporting requirements.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Annual reporting for the military services. The USD(P&R;) submits  annual FY reports to Congress on the sexual assaults involving members  of the Military Services. Each Secretary of the Military Departments  must submit their Military Service report for the prior FY to the  Secretary of Defense through the DoD SAPRO by March 1. The Secretary of  the Navy must provide separate reports for the Navy and the Marine  Corps. The annual report is accomplished in accordance with section  1631(d) of Public Law 111-383, and includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The policies, procedures, and processes in place or implemented  by the SAPR program during the report year in response to incidents of  sexual assault.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An assessment of the implementation of the policies and  procedures on the prevention, response, and oversight   of sexual assaults in the military to determine the effectiveness of  SAPR policies and programs, including an assessment of how Service  efforts executed DoD SAPR priorities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any plans for the following year on the prevention of and  response to sexual assault, specifically in the areas of advocacy,  healthcare provider and medical response, mental health, counseling,  investigative services, legal services, and chaplain response.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Matrices for Restricted and Unrestricted Reports of the number  of sexual assaults involving Service members, that includes case  synopses, and disciplinary actions taken in substantiated cases and  relevant information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Analyses of the matrices of the number of sexual assaults  involving Service members.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Quarterly reports. The quarterly data reports from the Military  Services are the basis for annual reports, including the data fields  necessary for comprehensive reporting. The information collected to  prepare the quarterly reports has been assigned Reporting Control Symbol  DD-P&R;(A)2205. In quarterly reports, the policies and planned actions  are not required to be reported. Each quarterly report and subsequent FY  annual report shall update the status of those previously reported  investigations that had been reported as opened but not yet completed or  with action pending at the end of a prior reporting period. Once the  final action taken is reported, that specific investigation no longer  needs to be reported. This reporting system will enable the DoD to track  sexual assault cases from date of initiation to completion of command  action or disposition. Quarterly reports are due:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> January 31 for investigations opened during the period of  October 1-December 31.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> April 30 for investigations opened during the period of January  1-March 31.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> July 31 for investigations opened during the period of April 1- June 30.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The final quarterly report (July 1-September 30) shall be  included as part of the FY annual report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Annual reporting for the Military Service Academies (MSA).  Pursuant to section 532 of Public Law 109-364, the USD(P&R;) submits  annual reports on sexual harassment and violence at MSAs to the House of  Representatives and Senate Armed Services Committees each academic  program year (APY). The MSA Sexual Assault Survey conducted by the  Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) has been assigned Report Control  Symbol DD-P&R;(A)2198.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In odd-numbered APYs, superintendents will submit a report to  their respective Military Department Secretaries assessing their  respective MSA policies, training, and procedures on sexual harassment  and violence involving cadets and midshipmen no later than October 15 of  the following APY. DMDC will simultaneously conduct gender relations  surveys of cadets and midshipmen to collect information relating to  sexual assault and sexual harassment at the MSA to supplement these  reports. DoD SAPRO will summarize and consolidate the results of each  MSA's APY assessment, which will serve as the mandated DoD annual report  to Congress.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In even-numbered APYs, DoD SAPRO and the DoD Diversity  Management and Equal Opportunity (DMEO) Office conduct MSA site visits  and a data call to assess each MSA's policies; training, and procedures  regarding sexual harassment and violence involving cadets and  midshipmen; perceptions of Academy personnel regarding program  effectiveness; the number of reports and corresponding case  dispositions; program accomplishments progress made; and challenges.  Together with the DoD SAPRO and DMEO MSA visits, DMDC will conduct focus  groups with cadets and midshipmen to collect information relating to  sexual harassment and violence from the MSAs to supplement this  assessment. DoD SAPRO consolidates the assessments and focus group  results of each MSA into a report, which serves as the mandated DoD  annual report to Congress that will be submitted in December of the  following APY.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Annual reporting of installation data. Installation data is  drawn from the annual reports of sexual assault listed in  Sec. 105.16(a). The Secretaries of each Military Department must submit  their Military Service report of sexual   assault for the prior FY organized by installation to the Secretary of  Defense through the DoD SAPRO by April 30. The Secretary of the Navy  must provide separate reports for the Navy and the Marine Corps. Reports  will contain matrices for Restricted and Unrestricted Reports of the  number of sexual assaults involving Service members organized by  military installation, and matrices including the synopsis and  disciplinary actions taken in substantiated cases.</p>
