                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Under the provisions of the Missing Persons Act, as amended, a  finding   of presumptive death is made by the Secretary of the Navy when a survey  of all available sources of information indicates beyond doubt that the  presumption of continuance of life has been overcome. When a finding of  presumptive death is made, a man's pay accounts are closed as of the day  following the expiration of the 12 months' absence or a longer period  when justified, and the various benefits, such as the six months'  gratuity, become payable. A finding of presumptive death concerning an  officer or enlisted man of the Navy means simply that as of the date  thereof he is for the purposes of Naval administration no longer alive.  It does not mean that death occurred on that or on any other certain  date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Findings of presumptive death are never made when the  ``missing'' status has not continued for at least 12 months. Whenever,  subsequent to the expiration of the 12th month, cumulative or other  evidence establishes by its preponderance that a ``missing'' person is  no longer alive, a prompt finding of presumptive death will be made.  Also, such a finding will be made whenever justified by the lapse of  time beyond the 12 months' absence without specific information being  received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Secretary of the Navy, or such subordinate as he may  designate, has authority to make all determinations necessary in the  administration of the act, and for the purposes of the act  determinations so made shall be conclusive as to death or finding or  death, as to any other status dealt with by the act, and as to any  essential date including that upon which evidence or information is  received in the Department. The determination of the Secretary of the  Navy, or of such subordinate as he may designate, is conclusive as to  whether information received concerning any person is to be construed  and acted upon as an official report of death. When any information  deemed to establish conclusively the death of any person is received in  the department, action shall be taken thereon as an official report of  death, notwithstanding any prior action relating to death or other  status of such person. Under the foregoing provisions a determination of  death is made prior to the expiration of 12 months when the evidence  received is considered to establish conclusively the fact of death and  settlement of accounts is made to the date established as the date of  receipt of evidence on which the fact of death is established.  (Sec. 301, 80 Stat. 379; 5 U.S.C. 301. Interpret or apply 80 Stat. 112- 117, 248-254; 5 U.S.C. 5561-5568, 37 U.S.C. 551-558)  [17 FR 5390, June 14, 1952]</p>
