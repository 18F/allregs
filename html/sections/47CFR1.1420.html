                                Sec. 1.1420  Timeline for access to utility poles.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The term ``attachment'' means any attachment by a cable  television system or provider of telecommunications service to a pole  owned or controlled by a utility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All time limits in this subsection are to be calculated  according to Sec. 1.4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Survey. A utility shall respond as described in Sec. 1.1403(b)  to a cable operator or telecommunications carrier within 45 days of  receipt of a complete application to attach facilities to its utility  poles (or within 60 days, in the case of larger orders as described in  paragraph (g) of this section). This response may be a notification that  the utility has completed a survey of poles for which access has been  requested. A complete application is an application that provides the  utility with the information necessary under its procedures to begin to  survey the poles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Estimate. Where a request for access is not denied, a utility  shall present to a cable operator or telecommunications carrier an  estimate of charges to perform all necessary make-ready work within 14  days of providing the response required by Sec. 1.1420(c), or in the  case where a prospective attacher's contractor has performed a survey,  within 14 days of receipt by the utility of such survey.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A utility may withdraw an outstanding estimate of charges to  perform make-ready work beginning 14 days after the estimate is  presented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A cable operator or telecommunications carrier may accept a  valid estimate and make payment anytime after receipt of an estimate but  before the estimate is withdrawn.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Make-ready. Upon receipt of payment specified in paragraph  (d)(2) of this section, a utility shall notify immediately and in  writing all known entities with existing attachments that may be  affected by the make-ready.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For attachments in the communications space, the notice shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Specify where and what make-ready will be performed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Set a date for completion of make-ready that is no later than  60 days after notification is sent (or 105 days in the case of larger  orders, as described in paragraph (g) of this section).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> State that any entity with an existing attachment may modify  the attachment consistent with the specified make-ready before the date  set for completion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> State that the utility may assert its right to 15 additional  days to complete make-ready.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> State that if make-ready is not completed by the completion date  set by the utility (or, if the utility has asserted its 15-day right of  control, 15 days later), the cable operator or telecommunications  carrier requesting access may complete the specified make-ready.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> State the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a  person to contact for more information about the make-ready procedure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For wireless attachments above the communications space, the  notice shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Specify where and what make-ready will be performed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Set a date for completion of make-ready that is no later than  90 days after notification is sent (or 135 days in the case of larger  orders, as described in paragraph (g) of this section).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> State that any entity with an existing attachment may modify  the attachment consistent with the specified make-ready before the date  set for completion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> State that the utility may assert its right to 15 additional  days to complete make-ready.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> State the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a person  to contact for more information about the make-ready procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For wireless attachments above the communications space, a  utility shall ensure that make-ready is completed by the date set by the  utility in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section (or, if the utility has  asserted its 15-day right of control, 15 days later).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For the purposes of compliance with the time periods in this  section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A utility shall apply the timeline described in paragraphs (c)  through (e) of this section to all requests for pole attachment up to  the lesser of 300 poles or 0.5 percent of the utility's poles in a  state.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A utility may add 15 days to the survey period described in  paragraph (c) of this section to larger orders up to the lesser of 3000  poles or 5 percent of the utility's poles in a state.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A utility may add 45 days to the make-ready periods described in  paragraph (e) of this section to larger orders up to the lesser of 3000  poles or 5 percent of the utility's poles in a state.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A utility shall negotiate in good faith the timing of all  requests for pole attachment larger than the lesser of 3000 poles or 5  percent of the utility's poles in a state.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A utility may treat multiple requests from a single cable  operator or telecommunications carrier as one request when the requests  are filed within 30 days of one another.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A utility may deviate from the time limits specified in this  section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before offering an estimate of charges if the parties have no  agreement specifying the rates, terms, and conditions of attachment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During performance of make-ready for good and sufficient cause  that renders it infeasible for the utility to complete the make-ready  work within the prescribed time frame. A utility that so deviates shall  immediately notify, in writing, the cable operator or telecommunications  carrier   requesting attachment and other affected entities with existing  attachments, and shall include the reason for and date and duration of  the deviation. The utility shall deviate from the time limits specified  in this section for a period no longer than necessary and shall resume  make-ready performance without discrimination when it returns to routine  operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> If a utility fails to respond as specified in paragraph (c) of  this section, a cable operator or telecommunications carrier requesting  attachment in the communications space may, as specified in Sec. 1.1422,  hire a contractor to complete a survey. If make-ready is not complete by  the date specified in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a cable  operator or telecommunications carrier requesting attachment in the  communications space may hire a contractor to complete the make-ready:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Immediately, if the utility has failed to assert its right to  perform remaining make-ready work by notifying the requesting attacher  that it will do so; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After 15 days if the utility has asserted its right to perform  make-ready by the date specified in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section  and has failed to complete make-ready.
