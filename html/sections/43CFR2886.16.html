If BLM does not respond within 5  business days, BLM has denied your request. You may appeal the denial  under Sec. 2881.10 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The immediate temporary suspension order is effective until you  receive BLM's written notice to proceed with your activities.</p>
