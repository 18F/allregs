These circumstances of discharge are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Discharge or dismissal by reason of the sentence of a general court-martial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Discharge as a conscientious objector who refused to perform military duty, to wear the uniform or otherwise to comply with lawful orders of competent military authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Discharge as a deserter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Discharge on the basis, or as part of the basis, of an absence without authority from active duty for a continuous period of at least 180 days, if such discharge was under conditions other than honorable. Additionally, such absence is computed without regard to the applicant's normal or adjusted expiration of term of service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Discharge or dismissal of an officer based on acceptance of the officer's resignation for the good of the service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Discharge, on his/her own application, during a period of hostilities, as an alien.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If it appears that the applicant was discharged under one or more of the circumstances outlined in Sec. 724.504b, a written notification will be sent which informs the applicant that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An initial service record review reveals that the discharge may have been awarded under circumstances which make the applicant ineligible for receipt of VA benefits regardless of any action taken by the NDRB.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Separate action by the Board for Correction of Naval Records (BCNR) and/or the VA, in case of 180 days consecutive UA disqualification, may confer eligibility for VA benefits.
