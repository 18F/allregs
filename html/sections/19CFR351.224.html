                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. In the interests of transparency, the Department  has long had a practice of providing parties with the details of its  antidumping and countervailing duty calculations. This practice has come  to be referred to as a ``disclosure.'' This section contains rules  relating to requests for disclosure and procedures for correcting  ministerial errors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of the  Act, a final determination under section 705(a) or section 735(a) of the  Act, and a final results of a review under section 736(c), section 751,  or section 753 of the Act, normally within five days after the date of  any public announcement or, if there is no public announcement of,  within five days after the date of publication of, the preliminary  determination, final determination, or final results of review  (whichever is applicable). The Secretary will disclose to a party to the  proceeding calculations performed, if any, in connection with a  preliminary results of review under section 751 or section 753 of the  Act, normally not later than ten days after the date of the public  announcement of, or, if there is no public announcement, within five  days after the date of publication of, the preliminary results of  review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Comments regarding ministerial errors--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A party  to the proceeding to whom the Secretary has disclosed calculations  performed in connection with a preliminary determination may submit  comments concerning a significant ministerial error in such  calculations. A party to the proceeding to whom the Secretary has  disclosed calculations performed in connection with a final  determination or the final results of a review may submit comments  concerning any ministerial error in such calculations. Comments  concerning ministerial errors made in the preliminary results of a  review should be included in a party's case brief.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Time limits for submitting comments. A party to the proceeding  must file comments concerning ministerial errors within five days after  the earlier of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date on which the Secretary released disclosure documents to  that party; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date on which the Secretary held a disclosure meeting with  that party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Replies to comments. Replies to comments submitted under  paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be filed within five days after  the date on which the comments were filed with the Secretary. The  Secretary will not consider replies to comments submitted in connection  with a preliminary determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Extensions. A party to the proceeding may request an extension  of   the time limit for filing comments concerning a ministerial error in a  final determination or final results of review under Sec. 351.302(c)  within three days after the date of any public announcement, or, if  there is no public announcement, within five days after the date of  publication of the final determination or final results of review, as  applicable. The Secretary will not extend the time limit for filing  comments concerning a significant ministerial error in a preliminary  determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contents of comments and replies. Comments filed under paragraph  (c)(1) of this section must explain the alleged ministerial error by  reference to applicable evidence in the official record, and must  present what, in the party's view, is the appropriate correction. In  addition, comments concerning a preliminary determination must  demonstrate how the alleged ministerial error is significant (see  paragraph (g) of this section) by illustrating the effect on individual  weighted-average dumping margin or countervailable subsidy rate, the  all-others rate, or the country-wide subsidy rate (whichever is  applicable). Replies to any comments must be limited to issues raised in  such comments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Corrections. The Secretary will analyze any comments received  and, if appropriate, correct any significant ministerial error by  amending the preliminary determination, or correct any ministerial error  by amending the final determination or the final results of review  (whichever is applicable). Where practicable, the Secretary will  announce publicly the issuance of a correction notice, and normally will  do so within 30 days after the date of public announcement, or, if there  is no public announcement, within 30 days after the date of publication,  of the preliminary determination, final determination, or final results  of review (whichever is applicable). In addition, the Secretary will  publish notice of such corrections in the Federal Register. A correction  notice will not alter the anniversary month of an order or suspended  investigation for purposes of requesting an administrative review (see  Sec. 351.213) or a new shipper review (see Sec. 351.214) or initiating  a sunset review (see Sec. 351.218).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Definition of ``ministerial error.'' Under this section,  ministerial error means an error in addition, subtraction, or other  arithmetic function, clerical error resulting from inaccurate copying,  duplication, or the like, and any other similar type of unintentional  error which the Secretary considers ministerial.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Definition of ``significant ministerial error.'' Under this  section, significant ministerial error means a ministerial error (see  paragraph (f) of this section), the correction of which, either singly  or in combination with other errors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Would result in a change of at least five absolute percentage  points in, but not less than 25 percent of, the weighted-average dumping  margin or the countervailable subsidy rate (whichever is applicable)  calculated in the original (erroneous) preliminary determination; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Would result in a difference between a weighted-average dumping  margin or countervailable subsidy rate (whichever is applicable) of zero  (or de minimis) and a weighted-average dumping margin or countervailable  subsidy rate of greater than de minimis, or vice versa.</p>
