The appeal  shall be filed in duplicate and shall set forth the CES operator's or  entity's responses to the grounds specified by the port director in his  written notice letter for the adverse action initiated. The Assistant  Commissioner, Office of Field Operations, or his designee, shall render  a written decision to the CES operator or entity, stating the reasons  for the decision, by letter mailed within 30 working days following  receipt of the appeal, unless the period for decision is extended with  due notification to the CES operator or entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> through (5) of this part shall not take effect unless  the appeal process under this paragraph has been concluded with a  decision adverse to the operator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of suspension or revocation. Once a suspension or  revocation action takes effect, the CES operator must cease CES  operations. However, when CES operations are suspended or revoked and  cancelled by Customs, it is the CES operator's responsibility to ensure  that merchandise already at the CES is properly consigned to another  location for inspection, as directed by the importer and approved by the  port director.
