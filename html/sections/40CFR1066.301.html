                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The procedures described in this subpart are used to determine the road-load target coefficients (A, B, and C) for the simulated road-load equation in Sec.  1066.210(d)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The general procedure for determining road-load force is performing coastdown tests and calculating road-load coefficients. This procedure is described in SAE J1263 and SAE J2263 (incorporated by reference in Sec.  1066.1010). This subpart specifies certain deviations from those procedures for certain applications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use good engineering judgment for all aspects of road-load determination. For example, minimize the effects of grade by performing coastdown testing on reasonably level surfaces and determining coefficients based on average values from vehicle operation in opposite directions over the course.
