                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wetlands consist of areas that are inundated or saturated by  surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to  support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of  vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where wetlands are adjacent to open water, they generally  constitute the transition to upland. The margin between wetland and open  water can best be established by specialists familiar with the local  environment, particularly where emergent vegetation merges with  submerged vegetation over a broad area in such places as the lateral  margins of open water, headwaters, rainwater catch basins, and  groundwater seeps. The landward margin of wetlands also can best be  identified by specialists familiar with the local environment when  vegetation from the two regions merges over a broad area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Wetland vegetation consists of plants that require saturated  soils to survive (obligate wetland plants) as well as plants, including  certain trees, that gain a competitive advantage over others because  they can tolerate prolonged wet soil conditions and their competitors  cannot. In addition to plant populations and communities, wetlands are  delimited by hydrological and physical characteristics of the  environment. These characteristics should be considered when information  about them is needed to supplement information available about  vegetation, or where wetland vegetation has been removed or is dormant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Possible loss of values: The discharge of dredged or fill  material in wetlands is likely to damage or destroy habitat and  adversely affect the biological productivity of wetlands ecosystems by  smothering, by dewatering, by permanently flooding, or by altering  substrate elevation or periodicity of water movement. The addition of  dredged or fill material may destroy wetland vegetation or result in  advancement of succession to dry land species. It may reduce or  eliminate nutrient exchange by a reduction of the system's productivity,  or by altering current patterns and velocities. Disruption or  elimination of the wetland system can degrade water quality by  obstructing circulation patterns that flush large expanses of wetland  systems, by interfering with the filtration function of wetlands, or by  changing the aquifer recharge capability of a wetland. Discharges can  also change the wetland habitat value for fish and wildlife as discussed  in subpart D.   When disruptions in flow and circulation patterns occur, apparently  minor loss of wetland acreage may result in major losses through  secondary impacts. Discharging fill material in wetlands as part of  municipal, industrial or recreational development may modify the  capacity of wetlands to retain and store floodwaters and to serve as a  buffer zone shielding upland areas from wave actions, storm damage and  erosion.</p>
