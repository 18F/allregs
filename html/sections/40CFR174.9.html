                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Although it is strongly recommended that the submitter minimize the  amount of data and other information claimed as Confidential Business  Information (CBI), a submitter may assert a claim of confidentiality for  all or part of the information submitted to EPA in a submission for a  plant-incorporated protectant. (See part 2, subpart B of this chapter.)  To assert such a claim, the submitter must comply with all of the  following procedures:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any claim of confidentiality must accompany the information at  the time the information is submitted to EPA. Failure to assert a claim  at that time   constitutes a waiver of confidentiality for the information submitted,  and the information may be made available to the public, subject to  section 10(g) of FIFRA, with no further notice to the submitter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any claim of confidentiality must be accompanied, at the time  the claim is made, by comments substantiating the claim and explaining  why the submitter believes that the information should not be disclosed.  The submitter must address each of the points listed in Sec.  2.204(e)(4) of this chapter in the substantiation. EPA will consider  incomplete all plant-incorporated protectant submissions containing  information claimed as CBI that are not accompanied by substantiation,  and will suspend any applicable review of such submissions until the  required substantiation is provided.</p>
