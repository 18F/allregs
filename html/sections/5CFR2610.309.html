If neither the applicant nor  agency counsel seeks review and the Director (or designee) does not take  review on his or her own initiative, the initial decision on the  application shall become a final decision of the Office of Government  Ethics 30 days after it is issued. Whether to review a decision is a  matter within the discretion of the Director (or his or her designee, if  any). If review is taken, the Office will issue a final decision on the  application or remand the application to the adjudicative officer for  further proceedings.</p>
