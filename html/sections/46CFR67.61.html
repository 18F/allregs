No citizenship evidence need be provided for owners in that chain of title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The owner of a vessel identified in Sec. 67.11(b) or for which the Maritime Administration has granted approval for transfer or sale, either by written order or by general approval in 46 CFR part 221, and which was under a State or Federal registration or titling system, must provide a copy of the last registration or title, the evidence of removal from foreign registry required by Sec. 67.55, if applicable, and evidence establishing the complete chain of title from the last owner under such registry or title. No citizenship evidence need be provided for owners in that chain of title.</p><p class="depth2">Note: Although vessels returned to documentation without a complete chain of title are not eligible for a coastwise endorsement, this does not preclude such an endorsement if the chain of title, with citizenship evidence, is completed at a later date.
