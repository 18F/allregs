If the ``after'' value has not been obtained by the time that the GHG emissions report is due, you may use the ``before'' value for missing data substitution or the best available estimate of the parameter, based on all available process data (e.g., electrical load, steam production, operating hours). If, for a particular parameter, no quality-assured data are available prior to the missing data incident, the substitute data value shall be the first quality-assured value obtained after the missing data period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For missing records of CO2 concentration, stack gas flow rate, percent moisture, fuel usage, and sorbent usage, the substitute data value shall be the best available estimate of the parameter, based on all available process data (e.g., electrical load, steam production, operating hours, etc.). You must document and retain records of the procedures used for all such estimates.
