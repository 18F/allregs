If any question arises as to the  status of the importer under subheadings 9806.00.20, 9806.00.45 and  9809.00.30, HTSUS, or whether articles entered thereunder are for  official use or for personal or family use, but not as an accommodation  to others or for sale or other commercial use, the port director shall  report the available facts to the Commissioner of Customs for  instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Alcoholic beverages for personal or family use--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General  rule--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Limitation stated.
