                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except for combustor, turbine, and tail pipe sections of turbine  engine installations that contain lines or components carrying flammable  fluids or gases for which it is shown that a fire originating in these  sections can be controlled, there must be a fire extinguisher system  serving each designated fire zone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The fire extinguishing system, the quantity of the extinguishing  agent, the rate of discharge, and the discharge distribution must be  adequate to extinguish fires. It must be shown by either actual or  simulated flights tests that under critical airflow conditions in flight  the discharge of the extinguishing agent in each designated fire zone  specified in paragraph (a) of this section will provide an agent  concentration capable of extinguishing fires in that zone and of  minimizing the probability of reignition. An individual ``one-shot''  system may be used for auxiliary power units, fuel burning heaters, and  other combustion equipment. For each other designated fire   zone, two discharges must be provided each of which produces adequate  agent concentration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The fire extinguishing system for a nacelle must be able to  simultaneously protect each zone of the nacelle for which protection is  provided.
