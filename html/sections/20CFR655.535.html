                                Sec. 655.535  The second attestation element for locations in Alaska:
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The second attestation element shall be satisfied when the  employer signs Form ETA 9033-A, attesting that during the validity  period of the attestation, the employer will employ all United States  longshore workers made available in response to the request for dispatch  who, in compliance with applicable industry standards in the State of  Alaska, including safety considerations, are qualified and available in  sufficient numbers and are needed to perform the longshore activity at  the particular time and location attested to.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In no case shall an employer filing an attestation be required  to hire less than a full work unit of United States longshore workers  needed to perform the longshore activity nor be required to provide  overnight accommodations for the longshore workers while employed. For  purposes of this section, ``full work unit'' means the full complement  of longshore workers needed to perform the longshore activity, as  determined by industry standards in the State of Alaska, including  safety considerations. Where the makeup of a full work unit is covered  by one or more collective bargaining agreements in effect at the time  and location where longshore work is to be performed, the provisions of  such agreement(s) shall be deemed to be in conformance with industry  standards in the State of Alaska.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In no case shall an employer be required to provide  transportation to the vessel where the longshore work is to be  performed, except where:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Surface transportation is available; for purposes of this  section, ``surface transportation'' means a tugboat or other vessel  which is appropriately insured, operated by licensed personnel, and  capable of safely transporting U.S. longshore workers from shore to a  vessel on which longshore work is to be performed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Such transportation may be safely accomplished; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Travel time to the vessel does not exceed one-half hour  each way; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Travel distance to the vessel from the point of embarkation does  not exceed 5 miles; for purposes of this section, ``point of  embarkation'' means a dock or landing at which U.S. longshore workers  may be safely boarded for transport from shore to a vessel on which  longshore work is to be performed; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> In the cases of Wide Bay, Alaska, and Klawock/Craig, Alaska,  travel time does not exceed 45 minutes each way and travel distance to  the vessel from the point of embarkation does not exceed 7.5 miles,  unless the party responding to the request for dispatch agrees to lesser  time and distance specifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a United States longshore worker is capable of getting to and  from the vessel where longshore work is to be performed when the vessel  is beyond the time and distance limitations specified in paragraph  (a)(2)(iii) of this section, and where all of the other criteria  governing the employment of United   States longshore workers under this subpart are met (e.g., ``qualified  and available in sufficient numbers''), the employer is still obligated  to employ the worker to perform the longshore activity. In such  instance, however, the employer shall not be required to provide such  transportation nor to reimburse the longshore worker for the cost  incurred in transport to and from the vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where an employer is required to provide transportation to the  vessel because it is within the time and distance limitations specified  in (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the employer also shall be required to  provide return transportation to the point of embarkation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Documentation. To substantiate the requirement in paragraph (a)  of this section, an employer shall develop and maintain documentation to  meet the employer's burden of proof. Such documentation shall include  records of payments to contract stevedoring companies or private dock  operators, payroll records for United States longshore workers employed,  or other documentation to show clearly that the employer has met its  obligation to employ all United States longshore workers made available  in response to a request for dispatch who are qualified and available in  sufficient numbers. The documentation shall specify the number of full  work units employed pursuant to this section, the composition of such  full work units (i.e., number of workers by job title), and the date(s)  and location(s) where the longshore work was performed. The employer  also shall develop and maintain documentation concerning the provision  of transportation from the point of embarkation to the vessel on which  longshore work is to be performed. Each time one or more United States  longshore workers are dispatched in response to the request under Sec.  655.534, the employer shall retain a written record of whether  transportation to the vessel was provided and the time and distance from  the point of embarkation to the vessel.</p>
