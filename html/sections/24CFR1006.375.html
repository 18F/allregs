The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (41  U.S.C. 701, et seq.) and HUD's implementing regulations in 24 CFR part  21 apply to the use of assistance under this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Displacement and relocation. The following relocation and real  property acquisition policies are applicable to programs developed or  operated under the Act and this part:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Real property acquisition requirements.

A displaced person  (defined in paragraph (d)(7) of this section) must be provided  relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with  the requirements of, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property  Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655)  and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Appeals to the DHHL.

The DHHL shall ensure such compliance  notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the DHHL to  comply with the provisions in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The cost of required relocation assistance is an eligible  project cost in the same manner and to the same extent as other project  costs. However, such assistance may also be paid for with funds  available to the DHHL from any other source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The DHHL shall maintain records in sufficient detail to  demonstrate compliance with this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Definition of displaced person. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of this  section, the term ``displaced person'' means any person (household,  business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real  property, or moves his or her personal property from real property,  permanently, as a direct result of rehabilitation, demolition, or  acquisition for a project assisted under the Act. The term ``displaced  person'' includes, but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the  building/complex permanently after the submission to HUD of a housing  plan that is later approved;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any person, including a person who moves before the date  described in paragraph (d)(7)(i)(A) of this section, that the DHHL  determines was displaced as a direct result of acquisition,  rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the  building/complex permanently after execution of the agreement between  the DHHL and HUD, if the move occurs before the tenant is provided  written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a  suitable, decent, safe and sanitary dwelling in the same building/ complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the  project. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and  estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater  of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The tenant-occupant's monthly rent and estimated average monthly  utility costs before the agreement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 30 percent of gross household income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who is required to relocate  temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex, if either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The tenant-occupant is not offered payment for all reasonable  out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary  relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily  occupied unit, any increased housing costs and incidental expenses; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/ complex after he or she has been required to move to another dwelling  unit in the same building/complex in order to carry out the project, if  either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The tenant-occupant is not offered reimbursement for all  reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Other conditions of the move are not reasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this  section, a person does not qualify as a ``displaced person'' (and is not  eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The person moved into the property after the submission of the  housing plan to HUD, but before signing a lease or commencing occupancy,  was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the  person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated or  suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the person would not qualify  as a ``displaced person'' or for any assistance provided under this  section as a result of the project;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The DHHL determines the person is not displaced as a direct  result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for an assisted  project. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must concur in that  determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The DHHL may at any time ask HUD to determine whether a  specific displacement is or would be covered under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Definition of initiation of negotiations. For purposes of  determining the formula for computing the replacement housing assistance  to be provided to a person displaced as a direct result of  rehabilitation or demolition of the real property, the term ``initiation  of negotiations'' means the execution of the agreement covering the  rehabilitation or demolition (See 49 CFR part 24).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Audits. The DHHL must comply with the requirements of the Single  Audit Act and OMB Circular A-133, with the audit report providing a  schedule of expenditures for each grant. A copy of each audit must be  submitted to HUD concurrent with submittal to the Audit Clearinghouse.  [67 FR 40776, June 13, 2002, as amended at 72 FR 73497, Dec. 27, 2007]</p>
