The  election board or the supervisor shall order a recount and proceed with  same as provided in this part. If the recount results in the contestant  being elected, the deposit shall be refunded; otherwise, the deposit  shall be used to defray all expenses of said recount and any balance not  so used shall be returned to the contestant.
