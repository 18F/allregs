                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reasonable accounting methods required. An  issuer may use any reasonable, consistently applied accounting method to  account for gross proceeds, investments, and expenditures of an issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Bona fide deviations from accounting method. An accounting  method does not fail to be reasonable and consistently applied solely  because a different accounting method is used for a bona fide  governmental purpose to consistently account for a particular item. Bona  fide governmental purposes may include special State law restrictions  imposed on specific funds or actions to avoid grant forfeitures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> applies to bonds issued on or after May 16, 1997.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> do not apply in certain cases involving abusive  arbitrage devices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Universal cap on value of nonpurpose investments allocated to an  issue--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Application. The rules in this paragraph (b)(2) provide an  overall limitation on the amount of gross proceeds allocable to an  issue. Although the universal cap generally may be applied at any time   in the manner described in this paragraph (b)(2), it need not be applied  on any otherwise required date of application if its application on that  date would not result in a reduction or reallocation of gross proceeds  of an issue. For this purpose, if an issuer reasonably expects as of the  issue date that the universal cap will not reduce the amount of gross  proceeds allocable to the issue during the term of the issue, the  universal cap need not be applied on any date on which an issue actually  has all of the following characteristics--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> No replacement proceeds are allocable to the issue, other than  replacement proceeds in a bona fide debt service fund or a reasonably  required reserve or replacement fund;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The net sale proceeds of the issue--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Qualified for one of the temporary periods available for capital  projects, restricted working capital expenditures, or pooled financings  under Sec. 1.148-2 (e)(2), (e)(3), or (e)(4), and those net sales  proceeds were in fact allocated to expenditures prior to the expiration  of the longest applicable temporary period; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> were deposited in a refunding escrow and expended as originally  expected;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The issue does not refund a prior issue that, on any transfer  date, has unspent proceeds allocable to it;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> None of the bonds are retired prior to the date on which those  bonds are treated as retired in computing the yield on the issue; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> No proceeds of the issue are invested in qualified student loans  or qualified mortgage loans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> General rule. Except as otherwise provided below, amounts that  would otherwise be gross proceeds allocable to an issue are allocated  (and remain allocated) to the issue only to the extent that the value of  the nonpurpose investments allocable to those gross proceeds does not  exceed the value of all outstanding bonds of the issue. For this  purpose, gross proceeds allocable to cash, tax-exempt bonds that would  be nonpurpose investments (absent section 148(b)(3)(A)), qualified  student loans, and qualified mortgage loans are treated as nonpurpose  investments. The values of bonds and investments are determined under  Sec. 1.148-4(e) and Sec. 1.148-5(d), respectively. The value of all  outstanding bonds of the issue is referred to as the universal cap.  Thus, for example, the universal cap for an issue of plain par bonds is  equal to the outstanding stated principal amount of those bonds plus  accrued interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determination and application of the universal cap. Except as  otherwise provided, beginning with the first bond year that commences  after the second anniversary of the issue date, the amount of the  universal cap and the value of the nonpurpose investments must be  determined as of the first day of each bond year. For refunding and  refunded issues, the cap and values must be determined as of each date  that, but for this paragraph (b)(2), proceeds of the refunded issue  would become transferred proceeds of the refunding issue, and need not  otherwise be determined in the bond year in which that date occurs. All  values are determined as of the close of business on each determination  date, after giving effect to all payments on bonds and payments for and  receipts on investments on that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> General ordering rule for allocations of amounts in excess of  the universal cap--(A) In general. If the value of all nonpurpose  investments allocated to the gross proceeds of an issue exceeds the  universal cap for that issue on a date as of which the cap is determined  under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, nonpurpose investments  allocable to gross proceeds necessary to eliminate that excess cease to  be allocated to the issue, in the following order of priority--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> First, nonpurpose investments allocable to replacement proceeds;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Second, nonpurpose investments allocable to transferred  proceeds; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Third, nonpurpose investments allocable to sale proceeds and  investment proceeds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Re-allocation of certain amounts. Except as provided in Sec.  1.148-9(b)(3), amounts that cease to be allocated to an issue as a  result of the application of the universal cap may only be allocated to  another issue as replacement proceeds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Allocations of portions of investments. Portions of investments  to which this paragraph (b)(2)(iv) applies are allocated under either  the ratable method or the representative method in the same manner as  allocations of portions of investments to transferred proceeds under  Sec. 1.148-9(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Nonpurpose investments in a bona fide debt service fund not  counted. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), nonpurpose investments  allocated to gross proceeds in a bona fide debt service fund for an  issue are not taken into account in determining the value of the  nonpurpose investments, and those nonpurpose investments remain  allocated to the issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> only, the fair market value of a nonpurpose  investment is adjusted to take into account qualified administrative  costs allocable to the investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Allocation of gross proceeds to expenditures--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Expenditures  in general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Reasonable accounting methods for  allocating funds from different sources to expenditures for the same  governmental purpose include any of the following methods if  consistently applied: a specific tracing method; a gross proceeds spent  first method; a first-in, first-out method; or a ratable allocation  method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> General limitation. An allocation of gross proceeds of an issue  to an expenditure must involve a current outlay of cash for a  governmental purpose of the issue. A current outlay of cash means an  outlay reasonably expected to occur not later than 5 banking days after  the date as of which the allocation of gross proceeds to the expenditure  is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> applies to bonds issued on or after May 16, 1997.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of gross proceeds invested in purpose investments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  In general. Gross proceeds of an issue invested in a purpose investment  are allocated to an expenditure on the date on which the conduit  borrower under the purpose investment allocates the gross proceeds to an  expenditure in accordance with this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception for qualified mortgage loans and qualified student  loans. If gross proceeds of an issue are allocated to a purpose  investment that is a qualified mortgage loan or a qualified student  loan, those gross proceeds are allocated to an expenditure for the  governmental purpose of the issue on the date on which the issuer  allocates gross proceeds to that purpose investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Continuing allocation of gross proceeds to purpose  investments. Regardless of whether gross proceeds of a conduit financing  issue invested in a purpose investment have been allocated to an  expenditure under paragraph (d)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section, with  respect to the actual issuer those gross proceeds continue to be  allocated to the purpose investment until the sale, discharge, or other  disposition of the purpose investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Expenditures for working capital purposes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(3) or paragraph  (d)(4) of this section, proceeds of an issue may only be allocated to  working capital expenditures as of any date to the extent that those  working capital expenditures exceed available amounts (as defined in  paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section) as of that date (i.e., a  ``proceeds-spent-last'' method). For this purpose, proceeds include  replacement proceeds described in Sec. 1.148-1(c)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions--(A) General de minimis exception. Paragraph  (d)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to expenditures to pay--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any issuance costs of the issue or any qualified administrative  costs within the meaning of Sec. Sec. 1.148-5(e)(2) (i) or (ii), or  Sec. 1.148-5(e)(3)(ii)(A);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fees for qualified guarantees of the issue or payments for a  qualified hedge for the issue;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Interest on the issue for a period commencing on the issue date  and ending on the date that is the later of three years from the issue  date or one year after the date on which the project is placed in  service;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Amounts paid to the United States under Sec. Sec. 1.148-3,  1.148-5(c), or 1.148-7 for the issue;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Costs, other than those described in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A)  (1) through (4) of this section, that do not exceed 5 percent of the  sale proceeds of an issue and that are directly related to capital  expenditures financed by the issue (e.g., initial operating expenses for  a new capital project);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Principal or interest on an issue paid from unexpected excess  sale or investment proceeds; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Principal or interest on an issue paid from investment earnings  on a reserve or replacement fund that are deposited in a bona fide debt  service fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exception for extraordinary items. Paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this  section does not apply to expenditures for extraordinary, nonrecurring  items that are not customarily payable from current revenues, such as  casualty losses or extraordinary legal judgments in amounts in excess of  reasonable insurance coverage. If, however, an issuer or a related party  maintains a reserve for such items (e.g., a self-insurance fund) or has  set aside other available amounts for such expenses, gross proceeds  within that reserve must be allocated to expenditures only after all  other available amounts in that reserve are expended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Exception for payment of principal and interest on prior issues.  Paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to expenditures for  payment of principal, interest, or redemption prices on a prior issue  and, for a crossover refunding issue, interest on that issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> No exceptions if replacement proceeds created. The exceptions  provided in this paragraph (d)(3)(ii) do not apply if the allocation  merely substitutes gross proceeds for other amounts that would have been  used to make those expenditures in a manner that gives rise to  replacement proceeds. For example, if a purported reimbursement  allocation of proceeds of a reimbursement bond does not result in an  expenditure under Sec. 1.150-2, those proceeds may not be allocated to  pay interest on an issue that, absent this allocation, would have been  paid from the issuer's current revenues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Definition of available amount--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. For purposes  of this paragraph (d)(3), available amount means any amount that is  available to an issuer for working capital expenditure purposes of the  type financed by an issue. Except as otherwise provided, available  amount excludes proceeds of the issue but includes cash, investments,  and other amounts held in accounts or otherwise by the issuer or a  related party if those amounts may be used by the issuer for working  capital expenditures of the type being financed by an issue without  legislative or judicial action and without a legislative, judicial, or  contractual requirement that those amounts be reimbursed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Reasonable working capital reserve treated as unavailable. A  reasonable working capital reserve is treated as unavailable. Any  working capital reserve is reasonable if it does not exceed 5 percent of  the actual working capital expenditures of the issuer in the fiscal year  before the year in which the determination of available amounts is made.  For this purpose only, in determining the working capital expenditures  of an issuer for a prior fiscal year, any expenditures (whether capital  or working capital expenditures) that are paid out of current revenues  may be treated as working capital expenditures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Qualified endowment funds treated as unavailable. For a  501(c)(3) organization, a qualified endowment fund is treated as  unavailable. A fund is a qualified endowment fund if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The fund is derived from gifts or bequests, or the income  thereon, that were neither made nor reasonably expected to be used to  pay working capital expenditures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pursuant to reasonable, established practices of the  organization,   the governing body of the 501(c)(3) organization designates and  consistently operates the fund as a permanent endowment fund or quasi- endowment fund restricted as to use; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> There is an independent verification that the fund is reasonably  necessary as part of the organization's permanent capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Application to statutory safe harbor for tax and revenue  anticipation bonds. For purposes of section 148(f)(4)(B)(iii)(II),  available amount has the same meaning as in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of  this section, except that the otherwise-permitted reasonable working  capital reserve is treated as part of the available amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Expenditures for grants--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Gross proceeds of an  issue that are used to make a grant are allocated to an expenditure on  the date on which the grant is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Characterization of repayments of grants. If any amount of a  grant financed by gross proceeds of an issue is repaid to the grantor,  the repaid amount is treated as unspent proceeds of the issue as of the  repayment date unless expended within 60 days of repayment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Definition of grant. Grant means a transfer for a governmental  purpose of money or property to a transferee that is not a related party  to or an agent of the transferor. The transfer must not impose any  obligation or condition to directly or indirectly repay any amount to  the transferor. Obligations or conditions intended solely to assure  expenditure of the transferred moneys in accordance with the  governmental purpose of the transfer do not prevent a transfer from  being a grant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Expenditures for reimbursement purposes. In allocating gross  proceeds of issues of reimbursement bonds (as defined in Sec. 1.150-2))  to certain expenditures, Sec. 1.150-2 applies. In allocating gross  proceeds to an expenditure to reimburse a previously paid working  capital expenditure, paragraph (d)(3) of this section applies. Thus, if  the expenditure is described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section or  there are no available amounts on the date a working capital expenditure  is made and there are no other available amounts on the date of the  reimbursement of that expenditure, gross proceeds are allocated to the  working capital expenditure as of the date of the reimbursement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> applies to any issue of  governmental bonds, any issue of private activity bonds issued to  finance a facility that is required by section 142 to be owned by a  governmental unit, and any portion of an issue that is not treated as  consisting of private activity bonds under section 141(b)(9). Investment  proceeds of the issue (other than investment proceeds held in a  refunding escrow) are treated as allocated to expenditures for a  governmental purpose when the amounts are deposited in a commingled fund  with substantial tax or other revenues from governmental operations of  the issuer and the amounts are reasonably expected to be spent for  governmental purposes within 6 months from the date of the commingling.  In establishing these reasonable expectations, an issuer may use any  reasonable accounting assumption and is not bound by the proceeds-spent- last assumption generally required for working capital expenditures  under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Payments to related parties. Any payment of gross proceeds of  the issue to a related party of the payor is not an expenditure of those  gross proceeds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Special rules for commingled funds--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An  accounting method for gross proceeds of an issue in a commingled fund,  other than a bona fide debt service fund, is reasonable only if it  satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2) through (6) of this  section in addition to the other requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Investments held by a commingled fund--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Required ratable  allocations. Not less frequently than as of the close of each fiscal  period, all payments and receipts (including deemed payments and  receipts) on investments held by a commingled fund must be allocated  (but not necessarily distributed) among the different investors in the  fund. This allocation must be based on a consistently applied,  reasonable ratable allocation method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Safe harbors for ratable allocation methods. Reasonable ratable  allocation methods include, without limitation, methods that allocate  these items in proportion to either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The average daily balances of the amounts in the commingled fund  from different investors during a fiscal period (as described in  paragraph (e)(4) of this section); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The average of the beginning and ending balances of the amounts  in the commingled fund from different investors for a fiscal period that  does not exceed one month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Definition of investor. For purposes of this paragraph (e),  the term investor means each different source of funds invested in a  commingled fund. For example, if a city invests gross proceeds of an  issue and tax revenues in a commingled fund, it is treated as two  different investors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certain expenditures involving a commingled fund. If a ratable  allocation method is used under paragraph (d) of this section to  allocate expenditures from the commingled fund, the same ratable  allocation method must be used to allocate payments and receipts on  investments in the commingled fund under paragraph (e)(2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fiscal periods. The fiscal year of a commingled fund is the  calendar year unless the fund adopts another fiscal year. A commingled  fund may use any consistent fiscal period that does not exceed three  months (e.g., a daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly fiscal period).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Unrealized gains and losses on investments of a commingled  fund--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Mark-to-market requirement for internal commingled funds with  longer-term investment portfolios. Except as otherwise provided in this  paragraph (e), in the case of a commingled fund in which the issuer and  any related party own more than 25 percent of the beneficial interests  in the fund (an internal commingled fund), the fund must treat all its  investments as if sold at fair market value either on the last day of  the fiscal year or the last day of each fiscal period. The net gains or  losses from these deemed sales of investments must be allocated to all  investors of the commingled fund during the period since the last  allocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception for internal commingled funds with shorter-term  investment portfolios. If the remaining weighted average maturity of all  investments held by a commingled fund during a particular fiscal year  does not exceed 18 months, and the investments held by the commingled  fund during that fiscal year consist exclusively of obligations, the  mark-to-market requirement of paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section does  not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exception for commingled reserve funds and sinking funds. The  mark-to-market requirement of paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section does  not apply to a commingled fund that operates exclusively as a reserve  fund, sinking fund, or replacement fund for two or more issues of the  same issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Allocations of commingled funds serving as common reserve funds  or sinking funds--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Permitted ratable allocation methods. If a  commingled fund serves as a common reserve fund, replacement fund, or  sinking fund for two or more issues (a commingled reserve), after making  reasonable adjustments to account for proceeds allocated under paragraph  (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, investments held by that commingled  fund must be allocated ratably among the issues served by the commingled  fund in accordance with one of the following methods--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The relative values of the bonds of those issues under Sec.  1.148-4(e);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The relative amounts of the remaining maximum annual debt  service requirements on the outstanding principal amounts of those  issues; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The relative original stated principal amounts of the  outstanding issues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Frequency of allocations. An issuer must make any allocations  required by this paragraph (e)(6) as of a date at least every 3 years  and as of each date that an issue first becomes secured by the  commingled reserve. If relative original principal amounts are used to  allocate, allocations must also be made on the retirement of any issue  secured by the commingled reserve.
