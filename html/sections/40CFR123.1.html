                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This part specifies the procedures EPA will follow in approving, revising, and withdrawing State programs and the requirements State programs must meet to be approved by the Administrator under sections 318, 402, and 405(a) (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System--NPDES) of the CWA. This part also specifies the procedures EPA will follow in approving, revising, and withdrawing State programs under section 405(f) (sludge management programs) of the CWA. The requirements that a State sewage sludge management program must meet for approval by the Administrator under section 405(f) are set out at 40 CFR part 501.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> These regulations are promulgated under the authority of sections 304(i), 101(e), 405, and 518(e) of the CWA, and implement the requirements of those sections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Administrator will approve State programs which conform to the applicable requirements of this part. A State NPDES program will not be approved by the Administrator under section 402 of CWA unless it has authority to control the discharges specified in sections 318 and 405(a) of CWA. Permit programs under sections 318 and 405(a) will not be approved independent of a section 402 program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> Upon approval of a State program, the Administrator shall suspend the issuance of Federal permits for

those activities subject to the approved State program. After program approval EPA shall retain jurisdiction over any permits (including general permits) which it has issued unless arrangements have been made with the State in the Memorandum of Agreement for the State to assume responsibility for these permits. Retention of jurisdiction shall include the processing of any permit appeals, modification requests, or variance requests; the conduct of inspections, and the receipt and review of self-monitoring reports. If any permit appeal, modification request or variance request is not finally resolved when the federally issued permit expires, EPA may, with the consent of the State, retain jurisdiction until the matter is resolved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon approval of a State program, the Administrator shall suspend the issuance of Federal permits for

If any permit appeal, modification request or variance request is not finally resolved when the federally issued permit expires, EPA may, with the consent of the State, retain jurisdiction until the matter is resolved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The procedures outlined in the preceding paragraph (d)(1) of this section for suspension of permitting authority and transfer of existing permits will also apply when EPA approves an Indian Tribe's application to operate a State program and a State was the authorized permitting authority under Sec. 123.23(b) for activities within the scope of the newly approved program. The authorized State will retain jurisdiction over its existing permits as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section absent a different arrangement stated in the Memorandum of Agreement executed between EPA and the Tribe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Upon submission of a complete program, EPA will conduct a public hearing, if interest is shown, and determine whether to approve or disapprove the program taking into consideration the requirements of this part, the CWA and any comments received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any State program approved by the Administrator shall at all times be conducted in accordance with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)(1)</em> Except as may be authorized pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section or excluded by Sec. 122.3, the State program must prohibit all point source discharges of pollutants, all discharges into aquaculture projects, and all disposal of sewage sludge which results in any pollutant from such sludge entering into any waters of the United States within the State's jurisdiction except as authorized by a permit in effect under the State program or under section 402 of CWA. NPDES authority may be shared by two or more State agencies but each agency must have Statewide jurisdiction over a class of activities or discharges. When more than one agency is responsible for issuing permits, each agency must make a submission meeting the requirements of Sec. 123.21 before EPA will begin formal review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as may be authorized pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section or excluded by Sec. 122.3, the State program must prohibit all point source discharges of pollutants, all discharges into aquaculture projects, and all disposal of sewage sludge which results in any pollutant from such sludge entering into any waters of the United States within the State's jurisdiction except as authorized by a permit in effect under the State program or under section 402 of CWA.

When more than one agency is responsible for issuing permits, each agency must make a submission meeting the requirements of Sec. 123.21 before EPA will begin formal review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A State may seek approval of a partial or phased program in accordance with section 402(n) of the CWA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> In many cases, States (other than Indian Tribes) will lack authority to regulate activities on Indian lands. This lack of authority does not impair that State's ability to obtain full program approval in accordance with this part, i.e., inability of a State to regulate activities on Indian lands does not constitute a partial program. EPA will administer the program on Indian lands if a State (or Indian Tribe) does not seek or have authority to regulate activities on Indian lands.</p><p class="depth2">Note: States are advised to contact the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, concerning authority over Indian lands.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Nothing in this part precludes a State from:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adopting or enforcing requirements which are more stringent or more extensive than those required under this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Operating a program with a greater scope of coverage than that required under this part. If an approved State program has greater scope of coverage than required by Federal law the additional coverage is not part of the Federally approved program.</p><p class="depth0">Note: For example, if a State requires permits for discharges into publicly owned treatment works, these permits are not NPDES permits.
