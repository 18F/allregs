With respect to certain sensitive records, additional requirements for verification of identity stated in the appropriate published ``Notice of System of Records'' may be imposed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Written requests.

An individual making a request in person respecting a record about himself may establish his identity by the presentation of a single document bearing a photograph (such as a passport or identification badge) or by the presentation of two items of identification which do not bear a photograph but do bear a name, address and signature (such, as a driver's license or credit card).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inability to provide requisite documentation of identity. An individual making a request in person or in writing respecting a record about himself who cannot provide the necessary documentation of identity may provide a notarized statement, swearing or affirming to his identity and to the fact that he understands that penalties for false statements may be imposed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001, and that penalties for obtaining a record concerning an individual under false pretenses may be imposed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3).
