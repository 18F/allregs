                                Sec. 319.1  Persons living in marital union with United States citizen
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of the Act, the spouse of a United States citizen must establish  that he or she:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence to the United  States;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has resided continuously within the United States, as defined  under Sec. 316.5 of this chapter, for a period of at least three years  after having been lawfully admitted for permanent residence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has been living in marital union with the citizen spouse for the  three years preceding the date of examination on the application, and  the spouse has been a United States citizen for the duration of that  three year period;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Has been physically present in the United States for periods  totaling at least 18 months;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Has resided, as defined in Sec. 316.5 of this chapter, for at  least 3 months immediately preceding the filing of the application, or  immediately preceding the examination on the application if the  application was filed early pursuant to section 334(a) of the Act and  the three month period falls within the required period of residence  under section 316(a) or 319(a) of the Act, in the State or Service  district having jurisdiction over the alien's actual place of residence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Has resided continuously within the United States from the date  of application for naturalization until the time of admission to  citizenship;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For all relevant periods under this paragraph, has been and  continues to be a person of good moral character, attached to the  principles of the Constitution of the United States, and favorably  disposed toward the good order and happiness of the United States; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Has complied with all other requirements for naturalization as  provided in part 316 of this chapter, except for those contained in  Sec. 316.2 (a)(3) through (a)(5) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Marital union--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. An applicant lives in marital union  with a citizen spouse if the applicant actually resides with his or her  current spouse. The burden is on the applicant to establish, in each  individual case, that a particular marital union satisfies the  requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Loss of Marital Union--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Divorce, death or expatriation. A  person is ineligible for naturalization as the spouse of a United States  citizen under section 319(a) of the Act if, before or after the filing  of the application, the marital union ceases to exist due to death or  divorce, or the citizen spouse has expatriated. Eligibility is not  restored to an applicant whose relationship to the citizen spouse  terminates before the applicant's admission to citizenship, even though  the applicant subsequently marries another United States citizen.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Separation--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Legal separation. Any legal separation will  break the continuity of the marital union required for purposes of this  part.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Informal separation. Any informal separation that suggests the  possibility of marital disunity will be evaluated on a case-by-case  basis to determine whether it is sufficient enough to signify the  dissolution of the marital union.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Involuntary separation. In the event that the applicant and  spouse live apart because of circumstances beyond their control, such as  military service in the Armed Forces of the United States or essential  business or occupational demands, rather than because of voluntary legal  or informal separation, the resulting separation, even if prolonged,  will not preclude naturalization under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Physical presence in the United States. In the event that the  alien spouse has never been in the United States, eligibility under this  section is not established even though the alien spouse resided abroad  in marital union with the citizen spouse during the three year period.
