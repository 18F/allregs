                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Only one patent may be extended for a regulatory review period  for any product (Sec.  1.720(h)). If more than one application for  extension of the same patent is filed, the certificate of extension of  patent term, if appropriate, will be issued based upon the first filed  application for extension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If more than one application for extension is filed by a single  applicant which seeks the extension of the term of two or more patents  based upon the same regulatory review period, and the patents are  otherwise eligible for extension pursuant to the requirements of this  subpart, in the absence of an election by the applicant, the certificate  of extension of patent term, if appropriate, will be issued upon the  application for extension of the patent term having the earliest date of  issuance of those patents for which extension is sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If an application for extension is filed which seeks the  extension of the term of a patent based upon the same regulatory review  period as that relied upon in one or more applications for extension  pursuant to the requirements of this subpart, the certificate of  extension of patent term will be issued on the application only if the  patent owner or its agent is the holder of the regulatory approval  granted with respect to the regulatory review period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An application for extension shall be considered complete and  formal regardless of whether it contains the   identification of the holder of the regulatory approval granted with  respect to the regulatory review period. When an application contains  such information, or is amended to contain such information, it will be  considered in determining whether an application is eligible for an  extension under this section. A request may be made of any applicant to  supply such information within a non-extendable period of not less than  one month whenever multiple applications for extension of more than one  patent are received and rely upon the same regulatory review period.  Failure to provide such information within the period for reply set  shall be regarded as conclusively establishing that the applicant is not  the holder of the regulatory approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determinations made under this section shall be included in the  notice of final determination of eligibility for extension of the patent  term pursuant to Sec.  1.750 and shall be regarded as part of that  determination.
