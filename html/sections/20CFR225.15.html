The Overall Minimum PIA is determined under the rules in sections 215 and 223 of the Social Security Act. Railroad and social security earnings are included in the calculation of the Overall Minimum PIA. The Overall Minimum PIA is used to determine the amount which is treated as a social security benefit for the purpose of taxation pursuant to section 86(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
