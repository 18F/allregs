                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Like other Federal employees, an individual serving in a  consultant capacity must conduct himself or herself according to ethical  behavior standards of the highest order. In particular, such an  individual must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Refrain from any use of office which is, or appears to be,  motivated by a private gain for himself or herself or other persons,  particularly those with whom he or she has family, business, or  financial ties. The fact that desired gain, if it materializes, will not  take place at the expense of the Government makes his or her actions no  less improper.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conduct himself or herself in a manner devoid of any suggestion  that he or she is exploiting Government employment for private  advantage. A consultant must not, on the basis of any inside  information, enter into any speculation or recommend speculation to  members of his or her family or business associates, in commodities,  land, or the securities of any private company. This injunction applies  even though the consultant's duties have no connection whatever with the  Government programs or activities which may affect the value of such  commodities, land, or securities. He or she should be   careful in all personal financial activities to avoid any appearance of  acting on the basis of information obtained in the course of his or her  Government work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Refrain from using information not generally available to those  outside the Government for the special benefit of a business or other  entity by which the consultant is employed or retained or in which he or  she has a financial interest. Information not available to private  industry should remain confidential in the consultant's hands and not be  divulged to his or her private employer or clients. In cases of doubt  whether information is generally available to the public, the consultant  should confer with the person for whom he or she provides services, with  the office having functional responsibility for a specific type of  information, or, as appropriate, with the officials designated in Sec.  73.735-202 to give interpretive and advisory service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where requested by a private enterprise to act for it in a  consultant or advisory capacity and the request appears motivated by the  desire for inside information, make a choice between acceptance of the  tendered private employment and continuation of his or her Government  consultancy. He or she may not engage in both.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Not use his or her position in any way to coerce, or give the  appearance of coercing, anyone to provide a financial benefit to him or  her or another person, particularly one with whom the consultant has  family, business, or financial ties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Not receive or solicit anything of value as a gift, gratuity,  loan, entertainment, or favor for himself or herself or another person,  particularly one with whom he or she has family, business, or financial  ties if the acceptance would result in loss of complete independence or  impartiality in serving the Government. All consultants are subject to  the restrictions in Sec. 73.735-506 of this part concerning gifts and  decorations from foreign governments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consultants may engage in other employment so long as there is  no real or apparent conflict between the consultant's private employment  and his or her official duties. See Sec. 73.735 Subpart G. The regular  employment of a consultant who is a special Government employee is not  considered outside work for purposes of Subpart G. Also, the limitation  in Sec. 73.735-701(f) regarding the amount of an honorarium that may be  received does not apply to special Government employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A consultant who has questions about conflicts of interest or  the application of the regulations in this part to him or her or to his  or her assigned work should make inquiry of the person for whom services  are provided. That person may direct the consultant to the Department  Ethics Counselor or a deputy ethics counselor for interpretative and  advisory services as provided in Sec. 73.735-202.</p>
