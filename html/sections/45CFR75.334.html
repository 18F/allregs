                            <p class="depth0">For construction or facility improvement contracts or subcontracts exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the non-Federal entity provided that the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity has made a determination that the Federal interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements must be as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' must consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of the bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the time specified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for in the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223.</p>
