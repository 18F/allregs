A brief description of the leased  property sufficient to identify the property to the lessee and lessor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amount due at lease signing or delivery. The total amount to be  paid prior to or at consummation or by delivery, if delivery occurs  after consummation, using the term ``amount due at lease signing or  delivery.'' The lessor shall itemize each component by type and amount,  including any refundable security deposit, advance monthly or other  periodic payment, and capitalized cost reduction; and in motor vehicle  leases, shall itemize how the amount due will be paid, by type and  amount, including any net trade-in allowance, rebates, noncash credits,  and cash payments in a format substantially similar to the model forms  in appendix A of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Payment schedule and total amount of periodic payments. The  number, amount, and due dates or periods of payments scheduled under the  lease, and the total amount of the periodic payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other charges. The total amount of other charges payable to the  lessor, itemized by type and amount, that are not included in the  periodic payments. Such charges include the amount of any liability the  lease imposes upon the lessee at the end of the lease term; the  potential difference between the residual and realized values referred  to in paragraph (k) of this section is excluded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Total of payments. The total of payments, with a description  such as ``the amount you will have paid by the end of the lease.'' This  amount is the sum of the amount due at lease signing (less any  refundable amounts), the total amount of periodic payments (less any  portion of the periodic payment paid at lease signing), and other  charges under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. In an open- end lease, a description such as ``you will owe an additional amount if  the actual value of the vehicle is less than the residual value'' shall  accompany the disclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Payment calculation. In a motor vehicle lease, a mathematical  progression of how the scheduled periodic payment is derived, in a  format substantially similar to the applicable model form in appendix A  of this part, which shall contain the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Gross capitalized cost. The gross capitalized cost, including a  disclosure of the agreed upon value of the vehicle, a description such  as ``the agreed upon value of the vehicle [state the amount] and any  items you pay for over the lease term (such as service contracts,  insurance, and any outstanding prior credit or lease balance),'' and a  statement of the lessee's option to receive a separate written  itemization of the gross capitalized cost. If requested by the lessee,  the itemization shall be provided before consummation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Capitalized cost reduction. The capitalized cost reduction, with  a description such as ``the amount of any net trade-in allowance,  rebate, noncash credit, or cash you pay that reduces the gross  capitalized cost.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Adjusted capitalized cost. The adjusted capitalized cost, with a  description such as ``the amount used in calculating your base  [periodic] payment.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Residual value. The residual value, with a description such as  ``the value of the vehicle at the end of the lease used in calculating  your base [periodic] payment.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Depreciation and any amortized amounts. The depreciation and any  amortized amounts, which is the difference between the adjusted  capitalized cost and the residual value, with a description such as  ``the amount charged for the vehicle's decline in value through normal  use and for any other items paid over the lease term.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Rent charge. The rent charge, with a description such as ``the  amount charged in addition to the depreciation and any amortized  amounts.'' This amount is the difference between the total of the base  periodic payments over the lease term minus the depreciation and any  amortized amounts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Total of base periodic payments. The total of base periodic  payments with a description such as ``depreciation and any amortized  amounts plus the rent charge.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Lease payments. The lease payments with a description such as  ``the number of payments in your lease.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Base periodic payment. The total of the base periodic payments  divided by the number of payment periods in the lease.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Itemization of other charges. An itemization of any other  charges that are part of the periodic payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Total periodic payment. The sum of the base periodic payment  and any other charges that are part of the periodic payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Early termination--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conditions and disclosure of charges. A  statement of the conditions under which the lessee or lessor may  terminate the lease prior to the end of the lease term; and the amount  or a description of the method for determining the amount of any penalty  or other charge for early termination, which must be reasonable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Early termination notice. In a motor vehicle lease, a notice  substantially similar to the following: ``Early Termination. You may  have to pay a substantial charge if you end this lease early. The charge  may be up to several thousand dollars. The actual charge   will depend on when the lease is terminated. The earlier you end the  lease, the greater this charge is likely to be.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Maintenance responsibilities. The following provisions are  required:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Statement of responsibilities.

A statement of  the lessee's liability, if any, at early termination or at the end of  the lease term for the difference between the residual value of the  leased property and its realized value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Right of appraisal. If the lessee's liability at early  termination or at the end of the lease term is based on the realized  value of the leased property, a statement that the lessee may obtain, at  the lessee's expense, a professional appraisal by an independent third  party (agreed to by the lessee and the lessor) of the value that could  be realized at sale of the leased property. The appraisal shall be final  and binding on the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Liability at end of lease term based on residual value. If the  lessee is liable at the end of the lease term for the difference between  the residual value of the leased property and its realized value:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rent and other charges. The rent and other charges, paid by the  lessee and required by the lessor as an incident to the lease  transaction, with a description such as ``the total amount of rent and  other charges imposed in connection with your lease [state the  amount].''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Excess liability. A statement about a rebuttable presumption  that, at the end of the lease term, the residual value of the leased  property is unreasonable and not in good faith to the extent that the  residual value exceeds the realized value by more than three times the  base monthly payment (or more than three times the average payment  allocable to a monthly period, if the lease calls for periodic payments  other than monthly); and that the lessor cannot collect the excess  amount unless the lessor brings a successful court action and pays the  lessee's reasonable attorney's fees, or unless the excess of the  residual value over the realized value is due to unreasonable or  excessive wear or use of the leased property (in which case the  rebuttable presumption does not apply).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Mutually agreeable final adjustment. A statement that the lessee  and lessor are permitted, after termination of the lease, to make any  mutually agreeable final adjustment regarding excess liability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Fees and taxes.

If the lessee must obtain the insurance,  the types and amounts of coverage required of the lessee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Warranties or guarantees.
