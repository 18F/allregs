                            <p class="depth0">An agency may provide the following flexibilities within its written RPL policies established under this subpart:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Allow RPL eligibles to register only for certain sub-areas of a local commuting area when the agency has components dispersed throughout a large commuting area. However, an agency cannot deny registration throughout the local commuting area if the RPL eligible requests it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Suspend an RPL registration for all positions, permanent and time-limited, if the agency is unable, through documented written means, to contact the RPL registrant; however, the agency must reactivate an RPL registration when the registrant submits an updated application or otherwise requests reactivation in writing. Registration suspension and reactivation do not change the expiration date of the original registration period set in Sec. 330.208.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> Modify the OPM or OPM-approved qualification standard used to determine if an RPL eligible is qualified for a position, provided the:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Modify the OPM or OPM-approved qualification standard used to determine if an RPL eligible is qualified for a position, provided the:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Exception is applied consistently and equitably in filling a position;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> RPL registrant meets any minimum educational requirements for the position; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> RPL registrant has the capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to satisfactorily perform the duties and responsibilities of the position, as determined by the agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any modification to the qualification standard under paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not authorize a waiver of the selection order required under Sec. 330.213.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Permit RPL eligibles to register for positions with work schedules different from the work schedule of the

position from which they were, or will be, separated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Permit RPL registrants to update their qualifications or conditions for accepting positions during the RPL registration period. If an agency provides this flexibility in its RPL policies, the agency must update the RPL registrant's registration information within 10 calendar days of receipt of the registrant's written request. The updated registration information would apply only to those vacancies becoming available after the agency updates the RPL registrant's registration.</p>
