                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. HUD has determined that grants under this part are subject to Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b). Section 7(b) provides that any contract, subcontract, grant or subgrant pursuant to an act authorizing grants to Indian organizations or for the benefit of Indians shall require that, to the greatest extent feasible:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Preference and opportunities for training and employment shall be given to Indians; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Preference in the award of contracts and subcontracts shall be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises as defined in section 3 of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1452).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. (1) The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 450b] defines ``Indian'' to mean a person who is a member of an Indian tribe and defines ``Indian tribe'' to mean any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community including any Alaska native village or regional or village corporation as defined or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In section 3 of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1452) economic enterprise is defined as any Indian--owned commercial, industrial, or business activity established or organized for the purpose of profit, except that Indian ownership must constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise. This act defines Indian organization to mean the governing body of any Indian tribe or entity established or recognized by such governing body.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Preference in administration of grant. To the greatest extent feasible, preference and opportunities for training and employment in connection with the administration of grants awarded under this part shall be given to Indians.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Preference in contracting. To the greatest extent feasible, grantees shall give preference in the award of contracts for projects funded under this part to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each grantee shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Advertise for bids or proposals limited to qualified Indian organizations and Indian-owned enterprises; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Use a two-stage preference procedure, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Stage 1. Invite or otherwise solicit Indian-owned economic enterprises to submit a statement of intent to respond to a bid announcement or request for proposals limited to Indian-owned firms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Stage 2. If responses are received from more than one Indian enterprise found to be qualified, advertise for bids or proposals limited to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Develop, subject to Area ONAP one-time approval, the grantee's own method of providing preference.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the grantee selects a method of providing preference that results in fewer than two responsible qualified organizations or enterprises submitting a statement of intent, a bid or a proposal to perform the contract at a reasonable cost, then the grantee shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Re-advertise the contract, using any of the methods described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Re-advertise the contract without limiting the advertisement for bids or proposals to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If one approvable bid or proposal is received, request Area ONAP review

and approval of the proposed contract and related procurement documents, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.320, in order to award the contract to the single bidder or offeror.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Procurements that are within the dollar limitations established for small purchases under 2 CFR 200.320 need not follow the formal bid or proposal procedures of paragraph (d) of this section, since these procurements are governed by the small purchase procedures of2 CFR 200.320. However, a grantee's small purchase procurement shall, to the greatest extent feasible, provide Indian preference in the award of contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> All preferences shall be publicly announced in the advertisement and bidding or proposal solicitation documents and the bidding and proposal documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A grantee, at its discretion, may require information of prospective contractors seeking to qualify as Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises. Grantees may require prospective contractors to include the following information prior to submitting a bid or proposal, or at the time of submission:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Evidence showing fully the extent of Indian ownership and interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Evidence of structure, management and financing affecting the Indian character of the enterprise, including major subcontracts and purchase agreements; materials or equipment supply arrangements; and management salary or profit-sharing arrangements; and evidence showing the effect of these on the extent of Indian ownership and interest; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Evidence sufficient to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the grantee that the prospective contractor has the technical, administrative, and financial capability to perform contract work of the size and type involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The grantee shall incorporate the following clause (referred to as the Section 7(b) clause) in each contract awarded in connection with a project funded under this part:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The work to be performed under this contract is on a project subject to Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b) (Indian Act). Section 7(b) requires that to the greatest extent feasible:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Preferences and opportunities for training and employment shall be given to Indians; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Preferences in the award of contracts and subcontracts shall be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The parties to this contract shall comply with the provisions of Section 7(b) of the Indian Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In connection with this contract, the contractor shall, to the greatest extent feasible, give preference in the award of any subcontracts to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises, and preferences and opportunities for training and employment to Indians.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The contractor shall include this Section 7(b) clause in every subcontract in connection with the project, and shall, at the direction of the grantee, take appropriate action pursuant to the subcontract upon a finding by the grantee or HUD that the subcontractor has violated the Section 7(b) clause of the Indian Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Complaint procedures. The following complaint procedures are applicable to complaints arising out of any of the methods of providing for Indian preference contained in this part, including alternate methods enacted and approved in a manner described in this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each complaint shall be in writing, signed, and filed with the grantee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A complaint must be filed with the grantee no later than 20 calendar days from the date of the action (or omission) upon which the complaint is based.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Upon receipt of a complaint, the grantee shall promptly stamp the date and time of receipt upon the complaint, and immediately acknowledge its receipt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Within 20 calendar days of receipt of a complaint, the grantee shall either meet, or communicate by mail or telephone, with the complainant in an effort to resolve the matter. The grantee shall make a determination on a complaint and notify the complainant, in writing, within 30 calendar days of the submittal of the complaint to the grantee. The decision of the grantee

shall constitute final administrative action on the complaint.
