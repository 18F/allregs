                            <p class="depth0">The factors to be considered in determining the safety fitness and assigning a safety rating include information from safety reviews, compliance reviews and any other data. The factors may include all or some of the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Adequacy of safety management controls. The adequacy of controls may be questioned if their degree of formalization, automation, etc., is found to be substantially below the norm for similar carriers. Violations, accidents or incidents substantially above the norm for similar carriers will be strong evidence that management controls are either inadequate or not functioning properly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Frequency and severity of regulatory violations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Frequency and severity of driver/vehicle regulatory violations identified during roadside inspections of motor carrier operations in commerce and, if the motor carrier operates in the United States, of operations in Canada and Mexico.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Number and frequency of out-of-service driver/vehicle violations of motor carrier operations in commerce and, if the motor carrier operates in the United States, of operations in Canada and Mexico.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Increase or decrease in similar types of regulatory violations discovered during safety or compliance reviews.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For motor carrier operations in commerce and (if the motor carrier operates in the United States) in Canada and Mexico: Frequency of accidents; hazardous materials incidents; accident rate per million miles; indicators of preventable accidents; and whether such accidents, hazardous materials incidents, and preventable accident indicators have increased or declined over time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Number and severity of violations of CMV and motor carrier safety rules, regulations, standards, and orders that are both issued by a State, Canada, or Mexico and compatible with Federal

rules, regulations, standards, and orders.
