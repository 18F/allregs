                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Generally. You may submit a written request for copies of records in person or by mail.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Records located in a HUD field office. If you are submitting a request for records located in a HUD field office, you should deliver or mail your request to the FOIA Liaison in the appropriate HUD Field Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Records located in HUD headquarters. If you are submitting a request for records located in HUD Headquarters, you should deliver or mail your request to the FOIA Office, Office of the Executive Secretariat in the Office of Administration. You may also use the FOIA electronic request form on HUD's Internet web site at http://www.hud.gov.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> What should I include in my FOIA request? In your FOIA request you should:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Clearly state that you are making a FOIA request. Although Federal agencies are required to process all requests for documents as Freedom of Information Act requests, whether or not specifically designated as FOIA requests, failure to clearly state that you are making a FOIA request could unduly delay the initial handling of your correspondence through HUD's FOIA processing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reasonably describe the records you seek. Include information that you may know about the documents you are requesting;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Indicate the form or format in which you would like the record made available;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> State your agreement to pay the fee. You may specify a dollar amount above which you want HUD to consult with you before you will agree to pay the fee. If you are seeking a waiver or reduction of fees, you must include such a request at the same time as your request for disclosure, and you must describe how the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester (see Sec. 15.110(h));</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Indicate the fee category that you believe applies to you (see Sec. 15.110);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If you are making a request on behalf of another person for information about that person, include a document signed by that person authorizing you to request the information on his or her behalf; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If you are requesting expedited processing, your request should set out the facts you believe show that there is

a compelling need (see Sec. 15.104(d)) to expedite processing of your request.
