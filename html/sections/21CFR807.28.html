Updating

of the listing is also required if an establishment begins performing another activity on or to the device, or ceases to perform an activity on or to the device that had previously been identified on the device listing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An owner or operator shall create a new device listing using the FDA electronic device registration and listing system:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If introducing into commercial distribution an exempt device identified with a product code that is not currently listed by the owner or operator; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If introducing into commercial distribution a non-exempt device with an FDA premarket submission number that is not currently listed by the owner or operator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All device listings for foreign establishments must be submitted before the device may be imported or offered for import into the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An owner or operator who discontinues commercial distribution of a device shall discontinue the device listing using the FDA electronic device registration and listing system.
