                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must test each drilling liner (and liner-lap) to a pressure at least equal to the anticipated pressure to which the liner will be subjected during the formation pressure-integrity test below that liner shoe, or subsequent liner shoes if set. The District Manager may approve or require other liner test pressures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must test each production liner (and liner-lap) to a minimum of 500 psi above the formation fracture pressure at the casing shoe into which the liner is lapped.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You may not resume drilling or other down-hole operations until you obtain a satisfactory pressure test. If the pressure declines more than 10 percent in a 30-minute test or if there is another indication of a leak, you must re-cement, repair the liner, or run additional casing/liner to provide a proper seal.</p>
