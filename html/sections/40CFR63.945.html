                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Procedure for determining no detectable organic emissions for  the purpose of complying with this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The test shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures  specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Each potential  leak interface (i.e., a location where organic vapor leakage could  occur) on the cover and associated closure devices shall be checked.  Potential leak interfaces that are associated with covers and closure  devices include, but are not limited to the interface of the cover and  its foundation mounting; the periphery of any opening on the cover and  its associated closure device; and the sealing seat interface on a  spring-loaded pressure-relief valve.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The test shall be performed when the unit contains a material  having a total organic concentration representative of the range of  concentrations for the materials expected to be managed in the unit.  During the test, the cover and closure devices shall be secured in the  closed position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of  Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response  factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the  average composition of the organic constituents in the material placed  in the unit, not for each individual organic constituent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each  day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part  60, appendix A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Calibration gases shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Zero air (less than 10 ppmv hydrocarbon in air); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A mixture of methane or n-hexane in air at a concentration of  approximately, but less than 10,000 ppmv.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> An owner or operator may choose to adjust or not adjust the  detection instrument readings to account for the background organic  concentration level. If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the  instrument readings for the background level, the background level value  must be determined according to the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR  part 60, appendix A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Each potential leak interface shall be checked by traversing the  instrument probe around the potential leak interface as close to the  interface as possible, as described in Method 21. In the case when the  configuration of the cover or closure device prevents a complete  traverse of the interface, all accessible portions of the interface  shall be sampled. In the case when the configuration of the closure  device prevents any sampling at the interface and the device is equipped  with an enclosed extension or horn (e.g., some pressure relief devices),  the instrument probe inlet shall be placed at approximately the center  of the exhaust area to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)(ii)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If an owner or operator chooses not to adjust the detection  instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, then  the maximum organic concentration value measured by the detection  instrument is compared directly to the applicable value for the  potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the detection  instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, the  value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic  concentration value measured by the instrument and the background  organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (a)(6) of this  section is compared with the applicable value for the potential leak  interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For a potential leak interface other than a seal around a shaft  that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is  determined to operate with no detectable organic   emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph  (a)(8) is less than 500 ppmv.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening,  the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable  organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in  paragraph (a)(8) is less than 10,000 ppmv.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]  [64 FR 38988, July 20, 1999]</p>
