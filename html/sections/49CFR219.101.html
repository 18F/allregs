Except as provided in Sec. 219.103--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No employee may use or possess alcohol or any controlled  substance while assigned by a railroad to perform covered service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No employee may report for covered service, or go or remain on  duty in covered service while--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Under the influence of or impaired by alcohol;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Having .04 or more alcohol concentration in the breath or  blood; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Under the influence of or impaired by any controlled  substance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No employee may use alcohol for whichever is the lesser of the  following periods:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Within four hours of reporting for covered service; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After receiving notice to report for covered service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No employee tested under the provisions of this part whose test  result indicates an alcohol concentration of .02 or greater but less  than .04 may perform or continue to perform covered service functions  for a railroad, nor may a railroad permit the employee to perform or  continue to perform covered service, until the start of the employee's  next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than eight hours  following administration of the test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If an employee tested under the provisions of this part has a  test result indicating an alcohol concentration below 0.02, the test  must be considered negative and is not evidence of alcohol misuse. A  railroad may not use a federal test result below 0.02 either as evidence  in a company proceeding or as a basis for subsequent testing under  company authority. A railroad may take further action to compel  cooperation in other breath or body fluid testing only if it has an  independent basis for doing so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Controlled substance. ``Controlled substance'' is defined by  Sec. 219.5. Controlled substances are grouped as follows: marijuana,  narcotics (such as heroin and codeine), stimulants (such as cocaine and  amphetamines), depressants (such as barbiturates and minor  tranquilizers), and hallucinogens (such as the drugs known as PCP and  LSD). Controlled substances include illicit drugs (Schedule I), drugs  that are required to be distributed only by a medical practitioner's  prescription or other authorization (Schedules II through IV, and some  drugs on Schedule V), and certain preparations for which distribution is  through documented over the counter sales (Schedule V only).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Railroad rules. Nothing in this section restricts a railroad  from imposing an absolute prohibition on the presence of alcohol or any  drug in the body fluids of persons in its employ, whether in furtherance  of the purpose of this part or for other purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Construction. This section may not be construed to prohibit the  presence of an unopened container of an alcoholic beverage in a private  motor vehicle that is not subject to use in the business of the  railroad; nor may it be construed to restrict a railroad from  prohibiting such presence under its own rules.</p>
