                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A brain injury adjunctive interpretive  electroencephalograph assessment aid is a prescription device that uses  a patient's electroencephalograph (EEG) to provide an interpretation of  the structural condition of the patient's brain in the setting of  trauma. A brain injury adjunctive interpretive EEG assessment aid is for  use as an adjunct to standard clinical practice only as an assessment  aid for a medical condition for which there exists other valid methods  of diagnosis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II (special controls). The special  controls for this device are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The technical parameters of the device, hardware and software,  must be fully characterized and include the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Hardware specifications must be provided. Appropriate  verification, validation, and hazard analysis must be performed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Software, including any proprietary algorithm(s) used by the  device to arrive at its interpretation of the patient's condition, must  be described in detail in the software requirements specification (SRS)  and software design specification (SDS). Appropriate software  verification, validation, and hazard analysis must be performed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The device parts that contact the patient must be demonstrated  to be biocompatible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The device must be designed and tested for electrical safety,  electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), thermal, and mechanical safety.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Clinical performance testing must demonstrate the accuracy,  precision-repeatability and reproducibility, of determining the EEG- based interpretation, including any specified equivocal zones (cutoffs).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Clinical performance testing must demonstrate the ability of the  device to function as an assessment aid for the medical condition for  which the device is indicated. Performance measures must demonstrate  device performance characteristics per the intended use in the intended  use environment. Performance measurements must include sensitivity,  specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive  value (NPV) with respect to the study prevalence per the device intended  use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The device design must include safeguards to ensure appropriate  clinical interpretation of the device output (e.g., use in appropriate  patient population, or for appropriate clinical decision).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The labeling and training information must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A warning that the device is not to be used as a stand-alone  diagnostic.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A detailed summary of the clinical performance testing,  including any adverse events and complications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The intended use population and the intended use environment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any instructions technicians should convey to patients  regarding the collection of EEG data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Information allowing clinicians to gauge clinical risk  associated with integrating the EEG interpretive assessment aid into  their diagnostic pathway.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Information allowing clinicians to understand how to integrate  the device output into their diagnostic pathway when the device is  unable to provide a classification or final result.
