                                Sec. 1.809-8  Limitation on deductions for certain mutualization
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Deduction not to reduce taxable investment income. Section  809(g)(1) limits the deduction under section 809(d)(11) for certain  mutualization distributions. This limitation provides that such  deduction shall not exceed the amount (if any) by which the gain from  operations for the taxable year, computed without regard to such  deduction (but after the application of the limitation contained in  section 809(f) and Sec. 1.809-7), exceeds the taxpayer's taxable  investment income for such year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Deduction not to reduce tax below that imposed by 1957 law.  Section 809(g)(2) further limits the deduction under section 809(d)(11).  Under section 809(g)(2), such deduction shall be allowed only to the  extent that it (after the application of all other deductions) does not  reduce the tax imposed by section 802(a)(1) for the taxable year below  the amount of tax which would have been imposed for such taxable year if  the law in effect for 1957 applied for such taxable year. If such  deduction is claimed for 1958 (or 1959), the company shall attach to its  return a schedule showing what its tax for 1958 (or 1959) would have  been had such tax been computed under the law in effect for 1957.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application of section 815. Section 809(g)(3) provides that any  portion of a distribution which is allowed as a deduction under section  809(d)(11) shall not be treated as a distribution to shareholders for  purposes of section 815; except that in the case of any distributions  made in 1959, such portion shall be treated as a distribution with  respect to which a reduction is required under section 815(e)(2)(B)  (relating to adjustment in allocation ratio for certain distributions  after December 31, 1958).
