Appendix to Part 1193--Advisory Guidance</p><p class="depth0">Introduction</p><p class="depth0">1. This appendix provides examples of strategies and notes to assist  in understanding the guidelines and are a source of ideas for alternate  strategies for achieving accessibility. These strategies and notes are  not mandatory. A manufacturer is not required to incorporate all of  these examples or any specific example. Manufacturers are free to use  these or other strategies in addressing the guidelines. The examples  listed here are not comprehensive, nor does adopting or incorporating  them guarantee an accessible product. They are meant to provide a useful  starting point for evaluating the accessibility of a product or  conceptual design and are not intended to inhibit innovation. For a more  complete list of all of the published strategies to date, as well as for  further information and links to on-going discussions, the reader is  referred to the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation  Research's Rehabilitation Engineering Center on Access to  Telecommunications System's strategies Web site (http://trace.wisc.edu/ world/telecomm/).</p><p class="depth0">2. This appendix is organized to correspond to the sections and  paragraphs of the guidelines in this part to which the explanatory  material relates. This appendix does not contain explanatory material  for every section and paragraph of the guidelines in this part.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart A--General</p><p class="depth0">Section 1193.3 Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Readily Achievable</p><p class="depth0">1. Section 255 defines ``readily achievable'' as having the same  meaning as in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). However, the  ADA applies the term to the removal of barriers in existing public  accommodations. Not all of the factors cited in the ADA or the  Department of Justice (DOJ) implementing regulations (July 26, 1991) are  easy to translate to the telecommunications context where the term  applies to telecommunications equipment and customer premises equipment  which is designed, developed and fabricated after February 8, 1996, the  effective date of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.</p><p class="depth0">2. It may not be readily achievable to make every product accessible  or compatible. Depending on the design, technology, or several other  factors, it may be determined that providing accessibility to all  products in a product line is not readily achievable. The guidelines do  not require accessibility or compatibility when that determination has  been made, and it is up to the manufacturer to make it. However, the  assessment as to whether it is or is not readily achievable cannot be  bypassed simply because another product is already accessible. For this  purpose, two products are considered to be different if they have  different functions or features. Products which differ only  cosmetically, where such differences do not affect functionality, are  not considered separate products.</p><p class="depth0">3. Below is a list of factors provided as interim guidance to  manufacturers to assist them in making readily achievable assessments.  The factors are derived from the ADA itself and the DOJ regulations and  are presented in the order in which they appear in   those sources. Ultimately, the priority or weight of these factors is a  compliance issue, under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications  Commission (FCC). Factors applicable to a determination of whether an  action is readily achievable include: the nature and cost of the action  needed to provide accessibility or compatibility; the overall resources  of the manufacturer, including financial resources, technical expertise,  component supply sources, equipment, or personnel; the overall financial  resources of any parent corporation or entity, only to the extent such  resources are available to the manufacturer; and whether the  accessibility solution results in a fundamental alteration of the  product.</p><p class="depth0">a. One factor in making readily achievable assessments is the nature  and cost of the action needed to provide accessibility or compatibility.  The term readily achievable means that an action is ``easily  accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or  expense.'' The nature of the action or solution involves how easy it is  to accomplish, including the availability of technology and expertise,  and the ability to incorporate the solution into the production process.  Obviously, knowing about an accessibility solution, even in detail, does  not mean it is readily achievable for a specific manufacturer to  implement it immediately. Even if it only requires substituting a  different, compatible part, the new part must be ordered and integrated  into the manufacturing process. A more extreme implementation might  require re-tooling or redesign. On the other hand, a given solution  might be so similar to the current design, development and fabrication  process that it is readily achievable to implement it virtually  overnight.</p><p class="depth0">b. Another factor in making readily achievable assessments is the  overall resources of the manufacturer, including financial resources,  technical expertise, component supply sources, equipment, or personnel.  The monetary resources of a manufacturer are obviously a factor in  determining whether an action is readily achievable, but it may be  appropriate to consider other resources, as well. For example, a company  might have ample financial resources and, at first glance, appear to  have no reason for not including a particular accessibility feature in a  given product. However, it might be that the company lacks personnel  with experience in software development, for example, needed to  implement the design solution. One might reason that, if the financial  resources are available, the company should hire the appropriate  personnel, but, if it does, it may no longer have the financial  resources to implement the design solution. One would expect that the  company would develop the technical expertise over time and that  eventually the access solution might become readily achievable.</p><p class="depth0">c. Another factor in making readily achievable assessments is the  overall financial resources of any parent corporation or entity, only to  the extent such resources are available to the manufacturer. Both the  ADA statutory definition of readily achievable and the DOJ regulations  define the resources of a parent company as a factor. However, such  resources are considered only to the extent those resources are  available to the subsidiary. If, for example, the subsidiary is  responsible for product design but the parent company is responsible for  overall marketing, it may be appropriate to expect the parent company to  address some of the marketing goals. If, on the other hand, the  resources of a parent company are not available to the subsidiary, they  may not be relevant. This determination would be made on a case-by-case  basis.</p><p class="depth0">d. A fourth factor in making readily achievable assessments is  whether the accessibility solution results in a fundamental alteration  of the product. This factor, derived by extension from the ``undue  burden'' criteria of the ADA, takes into consideration the effect adding  an accessibility feature might have on a given product. For example, it  may not be readily achievable to add a large display for low vision  users to a small pager designed to fit in a pocket, because making the  device significantly larger would be a fundamental alteration of the  device. On the other hand, adding a voice output may not involve a  fundamental alteration and would serve both blind and low vision users.  In addition, adding an infrared port might be readily achievable and  would allow a large-display peripheral device to be coupled to it. Of  course fundamental alteration means a change in the fundamental  characteristic of the product, not merely a cosmetic or esthetic change.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart B--General Requirements</p><p class="depth0">Section 1193.23 Product Design, Development and Evaluation</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0">1. This section requires manufacturers to evaluate the  accessibility, usability, and compatibility of telecommunications  equipment and customer premises equipment and incorporate such  evaluation throughout product design, development, and fabrication, as  early and consistently as possible. Manufacturers must develop a process  to ensure that products are designed, developed and fabricated to be  accessible whenever it is readily achievable. Since what is readily  achievable will vary according to the stage of development (i.e., some  things will be readily achievable in the design phase which   may not be in later phases), barriers to accessibility and usability  must be identified throughout product design and development, from  conceptualization to production. Moreover, usability can be seriously  affected even after production, if information is not provided in an  effective manner.</p><p class="depth0">2. The details of such an evaluation process will vary from one  company to the next, so this section does not specify its structure or  specific content. Instead, this section sets forth a series of factors  that a manufacturer must consider in developing such a process. How, and  to what extent, each of the factors is incorporated in a specific  process is up to the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0">3. Different manufacturers, or even the same manufacturer at  different times, have the flexibility to tailor any such plan to its own  particular needs. This section does not prescribe any particular plan or  content. It does not require that such a process be submitted to any  entity or that it even be in writing. The requirement is outcome- oriented, and a process could range from purely conceptual to formally  documented, as suits the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0">4. The goal is for designers to be aware of access and incorporate  such considerations in the conceptualization of new products. When an  idea is just beginning to take shape, a designer would ask, ``How would  a blind person use this product? How would a deaf person use it?'' The  sooner a manufacturer makes its design team cognizant of design issues  for achieving accessibility; and proven solutions for accessibility and  compatibility, the easier this process will be.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(1)</p><p class="depth0">Market Research</p><p class="depth0">1. The guidelines do not require market research, testing or  consultation, only that they be considered and incorporated to the  extent deemed appropriate for a given manufacturer. If a manufacturer  has a large marketing effort, involving surveys and focus groups, it may  be appropriate to include persons with disabilities in such groups. On  the other hand, some small companies do not do any real marketing, per  se, but may just notice that a product made by XYZ Corporation is  selling well and, based on this ``marketing survey'' it decides it can  make a cheaper one. Clearly, ``involvement'' of persons with  disabilities is not appropriate in this case.</p><p class="depth0">2. A manufacturer must consider how it could include individuals  with disabilities in target populations of market research. It is  important to realize that any target population for which a manufacturer  might wish to focus a product contains individuals with disabilities,  whether it is teenagers, single parents, women between the ages of 25  and 40, or any other subgroup, no matter how narrowly defined. Any  market research which excludes individuals with disabilities will be  deficient.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(2)</p><p class="depth0">Product Design, Testing, Pilot Demonstrations, and Product Trials</p><p class="depth0">1. Including individuals with disabilities in product design,  testing, pilot demonstrations, and product trials will encourage  appropriate design solutions to accessibility barriers. In addition,  such involvement may result in designs which have an appeal to a broader  market.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(3)</p><p class="depth0">Working Cooperatively With Appropriate Disability-Related Organizations</p><p class="depth0">1. Working cooperatively with appropriate disability-related  organizations is one of the factors that manufacturers must consider in  their product design and development process. The primary reason for  working cooperatively is to exchange relevant information. This is a  two-way process since the manufacturer will get information on barriers  to the use of its products, and may also be alerted to possible sources  for solutions. The process will also serve to inform individuals with  disabilities about what is readily achievable. In addition,  manufacturers will have a conduit to a source of subjects for market  research and product trials.</p><p class="depth0">2. Manufacturers should consult with representatives from a cross- section of disability groups, particularly individuals whose  disabilities affect hearing, vision, movement, manipulation, speech, and  interpretation of information.</p><p class="depth0">3. Because of the complex interrelationship between equipment and  services in providing accessibility to telecommunications products,  coordination and cooperation between manufacturers and service providers  will be beneficial. Involving service providers in the product  development process will encourage appropriate design solutions to  accessibility barriers and permit the exchange of relevant information.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(4)</p><p class="depth0">Making Reasonable Efforts To Validate Unproven Access Solutions</p><p class="depth0">1. Manufacturers must consider how they can make reasonable efforts  to validate any unproven access solutions through testing with  individuals with disabilities or with appropriate disability-related  organizations that have established expertise with individuals with  disabilities. It is important to obtain input from persons or  organizations with established expertise to ensure that input is not  based merely on individual preferences or limited experience.</p><p class="depth0">2. This input should be sought from representatives from a cross- section of disability groups, particularly individuals whose  disabilities affect hearing, vision, movement, manipulation, speech, and  interpretation of information.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart C--Requirements for Accessibility and Usability</p><p class="depth0">Section 1193.33 Information, Documentation, and Training</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0">1. This section requires that manufacturers provide access to  information and documentation. The information and documentation  includes user guides, installation guides, and product support  communications, regarding both the product in general and the  accessibility features of the product. Information and documentation  should be provided to people with disabilities at no additional charge.  Alternate formats or alternate modes of this information is also  required to be available. Manufacturers should also encourage  distributors of their products to establish information dissemination  and technical support programs similar to those established by the  manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0">Alternate Formats and Alternate Modes</p><p class="depth0">1. Alternate formats may include, but are not limited to, Braille,  ASCII text, large print, and audio cassette recording. Alternate modes  may include, but are not limited to, voice, fax, relay service, TTY,  Internet posting, captioning, text-to-speech synthesis, and video  description.</p><p class="depth0">2. In considering how to best provide product information to people  with disabilities, it is essential that information be provided in an  alternate format or mode that is usable by the person needing the  information. For example, some individuals who are blind might require a  manual in Braille to understand and use the product effectively. Other  persons who are blind may prefer this information on a computer disk.  Persons with limited reading skills may need this information recorded  on audio cassette tape so they can listen to the manual. Still other  persons with low vision may be able to read the text version of the  manual if it is provided in a larger font. Likewise, if a tutorial video  is provided, persons who are deaf may require a captioned version so  that they will understand how to use the product effectively. Finally,  individuals who rely on TTYs will need direct TTY access to a customer  service line so they can ask questions about a product like everyone  else.</p><p class="depth0">3. This portion of the appendix explains how to provide information  in alternate formats (Braille, ASCII text, large print, audio cassette)  to persons with disabilities. \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ This information was provided by the American Foundation for the  Blind. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Braille</p><p class="depth0">4. Some persons who are blind rely on the use of Braille in order to  obtain information that is typically provided in print. These persons  may need Braille because of the nature of their disability (such as  persons who are deaf-blind) or because of the complexity of the  material. Most large urban areas have companies or organizations which  can translate printed material to Braille. On the other hand,  manufacturers may wish to consider producing Braille documents ``in  house'' using a personal computer, Braille translation software, and a  Braille printer. The disadvantage is the difficulty in ensuring quality  control and accuracy. Software programs exist which can translate common  word processing formats directly into Braille, but they are not always  error free, especially if the document contains special characters,  jargon, graphics, or charts. Since the typical office worker will not be  able to proofread a Braille document, the initial apparent cost saving  may be quickly lost by having to re-do documents. The Braille  translation software costs approximately $500 and most Braille printers  sold range from $2,000 to $5,000, however some Braille printers,  depending on the speed and other features, do cost more. Depending on  the quality of Braille to be generated, a Braille printer in the $4,000  range should be adequate for most users. By using automatic translation  software, individuals who do not have knowledge of Braille or who have  limited computer skills may be able to produce simple Braille documents  without much trouble. If the document is of a complex format, however,  such as a text box over multiple columns, a sophisticated knowledge of  Braille translation software and formatting will be required.</p><p class="depth0">Electronic Text</p><p class="depth0">5. People who are blind or have low vision and who have access to  computers may be able to use documents in electronic form. Electronic  text must be provided in ASCII or a properly formatted word processor  file. Using electronic text allows this information to be transmitted  through e-mail or other on-line telecommunications. Blind or low vision  persons who have access to a personal computer can then read the  document using synthetic speech, an electronic Braille display, a large  print computer monitor, or they can produce a hard copy in large print  or Braille.</p><p class="depth0">6. Documents prepared for electronic transmission should be in  ASCII. Documents supplied on disk should also be provided in either  ASCII or a word processor format usable by the customer. Word processing  documents should be properly formatted before distribution or conversion  to ASCII. To be correctly formatted, the document should be in Courier  10 point size and formatted for an 80 character line. Tables should be  converted to plain text. Graphics or text boxes should be deleted and  explained or described in text format. This will allow the reader to  understand all of the documentation being presented. Replace bullets  () with ``*'' or ``-'' and convert other extended  ASCII characters into text. When converting a document into ASCII or  word processor formats, it is important to utilize the appropriate ``tab  key'' and ``centering key'' rather than using the space bar. This is  necessary because Braille translation software relies on the proper use  of commands to automate the formatting of a Braille document.</p><p class="depth0">Large Print</p><p class="depth0">7. Persons with low vision may require documentation to be provided  in large print. Large print documents can easily be produced using a  scalable font from any good word processing program and a standard laser  printer. Using the document enlargement option on a photocopier will  usually yield unsatisfactory results.</p><p class="depth0">8. To obtain the best results follow these guidelines:</p><p class="depth0">a. It is preferable to use paper that is standard 8\1/2\ x 11  inches. Larger paper may be used, but care should be taken that a  document does not become too bulky, thus making it difficult to read.  Always use 1 inch margins. Lines longer than 6\1/3\ inches will not  track well for individuals who must use a magnifier.</p><p class="depth0">b. The best contrast with the least glare is achieved on very pale  yellow or cream-colored non-glossy paper, such as paper that is used for  photocopying purposes. To produce a more aesthetic looking document, an  off-white paper may be used and will still give good contrast while  producing less glare than white. Do not use dark colors and shades of  red. Double-sided copying (if print does not bleed through) will produce  a less bulky document.</p><p class="depth0">c. Remove formatting codes that can make reading more difficult. For  example, centered or indented text could be difficult to track because  only a few words will fit on a line. All text should begin at the left  margin. Use only left margin justification to maintain uniform spacing  across lines. Right margin justification can produce uneven spacing  between letters and words. Use 1\1/4\ (1.25) line spacing; do not double  space. Replace tabs with two spaces. Page numbering should be at the top  or bottom left. Avoid columns. If columns are absolutely necessary, use  minimum space between columns. Use dot leaders for tabular material. For  those individuals who are able to read graphics (via the use of a  magnifier or other assistive device) graphics should be included, but  placed on a separate page from the text. For those individuals with low  vision who are unable to read graphics, tables, and charts this material  must be removed from the document and an accurate description of this  material should be included in a text format.</p><p class="depth0">d. There is no standard typeface or point size. For more universal  access, use 18 point type; anything larger could make text too choppy to  read comfortably. Use a good strong bold typeface. Do not use italics,  fine, or fancy typefaces. Do not use compressed typefaces; there should  be normal ``white space'' between characters.</p><p class="depth0">e. Use upper and lowercase letters.</p><p class="depth0">f. Using these instructions, one page of print (11-12 point type)  will equal approximately three pages of large print (14-18 point)  depending on the density of the text.</p><p class="depth0">Cassette Recordings</p><p class="depth0">9. Some persons who are blind or who have learning disabilities may  require documentation on audio cassettes. Audio materials can be  produced commercially or in-house. Agencies sometimes record material  in-house and purchase a high speed tape duplicator ($1,000-2,000) which  is used to make cassette copies from the master. The cost of a  duplicator can be higher depending upon the number of copies produced on  a single run, and whether the duplicator can produce standard speed two- sided copies or half-speed four-sided copies. Although unit costs can be  reduced by using the four-track, half-speed format, this will require  the reader to use a specially designed playback machine. Tapes should be  produced with ``tone indexing'' to allow a user to skip back and forth  from one section to another. By following a few simple guidelines for  selecting readers and creating recordings, most organizations will be  able to successfully record most simple documents.</p><p class="depth0">10. Further guidance in making cassette recordings includes:</p><p class="depth0">a. The reader should be proficient in the language being recorded.</p><p class="depth0">b. The reader should be familiar with the subject. Someone who is  somewhat familiar with the technical aspects of a product but who can  explain functions in ordinary language would be a logical person to  record an audio cassette.</p><p class="depth0">c. The reader should have good diction. Recording should be done in  a conversational tone and at a conversational pace; neither too slow nor  too fast.</p><p class="depth0">d. The reader should be familiar with the material to minimize  stumbling and hesitation.</p><p class="depth0">e. The reader should not editorialize. When recording a document, it  should be read in full. Graphic and pictorial information available to  sighted readers should be described in the narrated text. Tables and  charts whose contents are not already contained in text should be  converted into text and included in the recording.</p><p class="depth0">f. The reader should spell difficult or unusual words and words of  foreign origin.</p><p class="depth0">g. At the beginning of the tape, identify the reader, i.e., ``This  document is being read by John Smith.''</p><p class="depth0">h. On each side of the tape, identify the document and the page  number where the reader is continuing, i.e., ``tape 2, side 1, Guide to  Barrier Free Meetings, continuing on page 75.''</p><p class="depth0">i. For blind users, all cassettes should be labeled in Braille so  that they can easily be referenced in the appropriate order.</p><p class="depth0">Alternate Modes</p><p class="depth0">11. Information is provided increasingly through a variety of means  including television advertisements, Internet postings, information  seminars, and telephone. This portion of the appendix explains how to  provide information in some alternate modes (captioning, video  description, Internet postings, relay service, and TTY).</p><p class="depth0">Captioning</p><p class="depth0">12. When manufacturers of telecommunications equipment or customer  premises equipment provide videos with their products (such as tutorials  or information explaining various components of a product) the video  should be available with captioning. Closed captioning refers to  assistive technology designed to provide access to television for  persons with hearing disabilities that is visible only through the use  of a decoder. Open captions are visible at all times. Captioning is  similar to subtitles in that the audio portion of a television program  is displayed as printed words on the television screen. Captions should  be carefully placed to identify speakers, on-and off-screen sound  effects, music and laughter. Increased captioning was made possible  because of the Television Decoder Circuitry Act which requires all  television sets sold in the United States with screens 13 inches or  larger to have built-in decoder circuitry.</p><p class="depth0">13. Although captioning technology was developed specifically to  make television and video presentations accessible to deaf and hard of  hearing people, there has been widespread interest in using this  technology to provide similar access to meetings, classroom teaching,  and conferences. For meetings, video-conferences, information seminars,  and the like, real-time captioning is sometimes provided. Real-time  captioning uses a stenographic machine connected to a computer with  translation software. The output is then displayed on a monitor or  projected on a screen.</p><p class="depth0">Video Description</p><p class="depth0">14. Just as manufacturers of telecommunications equipment and  customer premises equipment need to make their videos accessible to  persons who are deaf or hard of hearing, they must also be accessible to  persons who are blind or have low vision. This process is known as video  description. Video description may either be a separate audio track that  can be played simultaneously with the regular audio portion of the video  material (adding description during pauses in the regular audio), or it  can be added to (or ``mixed'' with) an existing soundtrack. The latter  is the technique used for videotapes.</p><p class="depth0">Internet Postings</p><p class="depth0">15. The fastest growing way to obtain information about a product is  through use of the Internet, and specifically the World Wide Web.  However, many Internet users with disabilities have difficulty obtaining  this information if it is not correctly formatted. This section provides  information on how to make a World Wide Web site more accessible to  persons with disabilities \2\. Because of its structure, the Web  provides tremendous power and flexibility in presenting information in  multiple formats (text, audio, video, and graphic). However, the  features that provide power and elegance for some users present  potential barriers for people with sensory disabilities. The  indiscriminate use of graphic images and video restrict access for  people who are blind or have low vision. Use of audio and non-captioned  video restrict access for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ This information is based on the document ``Writing HTML  Documents and Implementing Accessibility for the World Wide Web'' by  Paul Fountaine, Center for Information Technology Accommodation, General  Services Administration. For further information, see http:// www.gsa.gov/coca. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">16. The level of accessibility of the information on the Web is  dependent on the format of the information, the transmission media, and  the display system. Many of the issues related to the transmission media  and the display system cannot be affected by the general user. On the  other hand, anyone creating information for a Web server has control of  the accessibility of the information. Careful design and coding of  information will provide access to all people without compromising the  power and elegance of the Web site.</p><p class="depth0">17. A few suggestions are:</p><p class="depth0">a. Every graphic image should have associated text. This will enable  a person using a character-based program, such as Lynx, to understand  the material being presented in the graphical format. It also allows  anyone who does not want to wait for graphics to load to have quick  access to the information on the site.</p><p class="depth0">b. Provide text transcriptions or descriptions for all audio output.  This will enable people who are deaf or hard of hearing to have access  to this information, as well as individuals who do not have sound cards.</p><p class="depth0">c. Make any link text descriptive, but not verbose. For example,  words like ``this'', ``here'', and ``click'' do not convey enough  information about the nature of the link, especially to people who are  blind. Link text should consist of substantive, descriptive words which  can be quickly reviewed by the user. Conversely, link text which is too  long bogs down efficient browsing.</p><p class="depth0">d. Provide alternate mechanisms for on-line forms. Forms are not  supported by all browsers. Therefore, it is important to provide the  user with an opportunity to select alternate methods to access such  forms.</p><p class="depth0">e. All Web pages should be tested using multiple viewers. At a  minimum, pages should be tested with the latest version of Lynx to  ensure that they can be used with screen reader software.</p><p class="depth0">Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS)</p><p class="depth0">18. By using telecommunications relay services (TRS), it has now  become easier for persons with hearing and speech disabilities to  communicate by the telephone. TRS links TTY users with those who do not  have a TTY and use standard telephones. With TRS, a TTY user  communicates with another person with the help of a communications  assistant who is able to talk on the telephone and then communicate by  typing the message verbatim, to the TTY user. The communications  assistant also reads the message typed by the TTY user, or the TTY user  may speak for him or herself using voice carry over.</p><p class="depth0">19. There are now TRS programs in every state. Although TRS is very  valuable, it does have limitations. For example, relay calls take  longer, since they always involve a third party, and typing words takes  longer than speaking words.</p><p class="depth0">Text Telephones (TTYs)</p><p class="depth0">20. A TTY also provides direct two-way typed conversations. The cost  of these devices begins at approximately $200 and they can be operated  by anyone who can type.</p><p class="depth0">21. The following information is excerpted from the brochure ``Using  a TTY'' which is available free of charge from the Access Board:</p><p class="depth0">a. If the TTY line is also used for incoming voice calls, be sure  the person who answers the phone knows how to recognize and answer a TTY  call. You will usually hear silence, a high-pitched, electronic beeping  sound, or a pre-recorded voice message when it is a TTY call. If there  is silence, assume it is a TTY call.</p><p class="depth0">b. TTYs should be placed near a standard telephone so there is  minimal delay in answering incoming TTY calls.</p><p class="depth0">c. To initiate a TTY call, place the telephone headset in the  acoustic cups of the TTY adapter. If the TTY unit is directly connected  to the phone line, there is no need to put the telephone headset in the  acoustic cups. Turn the TTY on. Make sure there is a dial tone by  checking for a steady light on the TTY status indicator.</p><p class="depth0">d. Dial the number and watch the status indicator light to see if  the dialed number is ringing. The ring will make a long slow flash or  two short flashes with a pause in between. If the line is busy, you will  see short, continuous flashes on the indicator light. When the phone is  answered, you will see an irregular light signal as the phone is picked  up and placed in the cradle. If you are calling a combination TTY and  voice number, tap the space bar several times to help the person on the  other end identify this as a TTY call.</p><p class="depth0">e. The person who answers the call is the first to type. Answer the  phone as you would by voice, then type ``GA''.</p><p class="depth0">f. ``GA'' means ``I'm done, go ahead and type''. ``HD'' means hold.  ``GA or SK'' means ``Is there anything more, I'm done''. ``SK'' means  stop keying. This is how you show that the conversation is ended and  that you will hang up. It is polite to type good-bye, thank you for  calling, or some other closing remark before you type ``SK''. Stay on  the line until both parties type SKSK.</p><p class="depth0">22. Because of the amount of time it takes to send and receive  messages, it is important to remember that short words and sentences are  desired by both parties. With some TTY calls it is often not possible to  interrupt when the other person is typing. If you get a garbled message  in all numbers or mixed numbers and letters, tap the space bar and see  if the message clears up. If not, when the person stops typing, you  should type, ``Message garbled, please repeat.'' If the garbled messages  continue, this may mean that one of the TTYs is not working properly,  there is background noise causing interference, or that you may have a  bad connection. In this case you should say something like, ``Let's hang  up and I'll call you back.''</p><p class="depth0">23. The typical TTY message will include many abbreviations and  jargon. The message may also include misspelled words because, if the  meaning is clear, many callers will not bother to correct spelling since  it takes more time. Also, some TTY users communicate in American sign  language, a language with its own grammar and syntax. English may be a  second language. Extend the same patience   and courtesy to TTY callers as you do to all others.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth0">1. This paragraph requires manufacturers to supply a point of  contact for obtaining information about accessibility features of the  product and how to obtain documents in alternate formats. This could be  the name of a specific person, a department or an office. Supplying a  telephone number, and preferably a separate TTY number, is the most  universal method. Web site and e-mail addresses are also desirable, but  should not substitute for a telephone number since many more people have  access to a telephone than have e-mail or Internet access. Of course,  the means for requesting additional accessibility information must,  itself, be accessible.</p><p class="depth0">2. Automated voice response systems are not usable by deaf and hard  of hearing persons. An approach to consider is to augment an automated  voice response system with an automated TTY response system that also  detects whether a caller is using voice or TTY.</p><p class="depth0">3. The phone number should be prominently displayed in product  literature. Ideally, it should be displayed on the outside of the  package so that a potential buyer can obtain information about the  accessibility before purchase. In addition, manufacturers should  acquaint their distributors with this information so that they can  assist customers with disabilities, such as a blind person unable to  read the package information.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth0">1. This paragraph requires manufacturers to consider including  information on accessibility in training a manufacturer provides to its  staff. For example, if technical support staff are trained on how to  provide good technical support, such a program should be expanded to  include information on accessibility features of the manufacturer's  products and peripheral devices that are compatible with them. Such  staff should also have basic information on how to handle TTY and relay  calls. Personnel who deal directly with the public, including market  researchers, should be trained in basic disability ``etiquette.''</p><p class="depth0">Section 1193.35 Redundancy and Selectability [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">1. Although this section is reserved, manufacturers of  telecommunications equipment and customer premises equipment are  encouraged to provide redundancy such that input and output functions  are available in more than one mode.</p><p class="depth0">2. Alternate input and output modes should be selectable by the  user.</p><p class="depth0">3. Products should incorporate multiple modes for input and output  functions so the user is able to select the desired mode.</p><p class="depth0">a. Since there is no single interface design that accommodates all  disabilities, accessibility is likely to be accomplished through various  product designs which emphasize interface flexibility to maximize user  configurability and multiple, alternative and redundant modalities of  input and output.</p><p class="depth0">b. Selectability is especially important where an accessibility  feature for one group of individuals with disabilities may conflict with  an accessibility feature for another. This potential problem could be  solved by allowing the user to switch one of the features on and off.  For example, a conflict may arise between captioning (provided for  persons who are deaf or hard of hearing) and a large font size (provided  for persons with low vision). The resulting caption would either be so  large that it obscures the screen or need to be scrolled or displayed in  segments for a very short period of time.</p><p class="depth0">c. It may not be readily achievable to provide all input and output  functions in a single product or to permit all functions to be  selectable. For example, switching requires control mechanisms which  must be accessible and it may be more practical to have multiple modes  running simultaneously. Whenever possible, it is preferable for the user  to be able to turn on or off a particular mode.</p><p class="depth0">4. Some experiments with smart cards are showing promise for  enhancing accessibility. Instead of providing additional buttons or menu  items to select appropriate input and output modes, basic user  information can be stored on a smart card that triggers a custom  configuration. For example, insertion of a particular card can cause a  device to increase the font size on a display screen or activate speech  output. Another might activate a feature to increase volume output,  lengthen the response time between sequential operations, or allow two  keys to be pressed sequentially instead of simultaneously. This  technology, which depends on the issuance of a customized card to a  particular individual, would allow redundancy and selectability without  adding additional controls which would complicate the operation. As more  and more functions are provided by software rather than hardware, this  option may be more readily achievable.</p><p class="depth0">5. The increasing use of ``plug-ins'' allow a product to be  customized to the user's needs. Plug-ins function somewhat like  peripheral devices to provide accessibility and there is no fundamental  problem in using plug-ins to provide access, as long as the  accessibility plug-ins are provided with the product. For example, at  least one computer operating system comes packaged with accessibility  enhancements which a user can install if wanted. In addition, modems are  typically   sold with bundled software that provides the customer premises equipment  functionality. A compatible screen reader program, for example, could be  bundled with it. At least one software company has developed a  generalized set of accessibility tools designed to be bundled with a  variety of software products to provide access. As yet, such  developments are not fully mature; most products are still installed by  providing on-screen visual prompts, not accompanied by meaningful  sounds.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1193.41 Input, Controls, and Mechanical Functions</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0">Operable Without Vision</p><p class="depth0">1. Individuals who are blind or have low vision cannot locate or  identify controls, latches, or input slits by sight or operate controls  that require sight. Products should be manufactured to be usable  independently by these individuals. For example, individuals who cannot  see must use either touch or sound to locate and identify controls. If a  product uses a flat, smooth touch screen or touch membrane, the user  without vision will not be able to locate the controls without auditory  or tactile cues.</p><p class="depth0">2. Once the controls have been located, the user must be able to  identify the various functions of the controls. Having located and  identified the controls, individuals must be able to operate them.</p><p class="depth0">3. Below are some examples of ways to make products accessible to  persons with visual disabilities:</p><p class="depth0">a. If buttons are used on a product, make them discrete buttons  which can be felt and located by touch. If a flat membrane is used for a  keyboard, provide a raised edge around the control areas or buttons to  make it possible to locate the keys by touch. Once an individual locates  the different controls, he or she needs to identify what the keys are.  If there is a standard number pad arrangement, putting a nib on the  ``5'' key may be all that is necessary for identifying the numbers. On a  QWERTY keyboard, putting a tactile nib on the ``F'' and ``J'' keys  allows touch typists to easily locate their hands on the key.</p><p class="depth0">b. Provide distinct shapes for keys to indicate their function or  make it easy to tell them apart. Provide Braille labels for keys and  controls for those who read Braille to determine the function and use of  controls.</p><p class="depth0">c. Provide large raised letters for short labels on large objects.  Where it is not possible to use raised large letters, a voice mode  selection could be incorporated that announces keys when pressed, but  does not activate them. This would allow people to turn on the voice  mode long enough to explore and locate the item they are interested in,  then release the voice mode and press the control. If it is an  adjustable control, voice confirmation of the status may also be  important.</p><p class="depth0">d. Provide tactile indication on a plug which is not a self- orienting plug. Wireless connections, which eliminate the need to orient  or insert connectors, also solve the problem.</p><p class="depth0">e. Avoid buttons that are activated when touched to allow an  individual to explore the controls to find the desired button. If touch- activated controls cannot be avoided (for example, on a touch screen),  provide an alternate mode where a confirm button is used to confirm  selections (for example, items are read when touched, and activated when  the confirm button is pressed). All actions should be reversible, or  require confirmation before executing non-reversible actions.</p><p class="depth0">f. Once controls have been located and users know what the functions  are, they must be operable. Some types of controls, including mouse  devices, track balls, dials without markings or stops, and push-button  controls with only one state, where the position or setting is indicated  only by a visual cue, will not be usable by persons who are blind or  have low vision. Providing a rotational or linear stop and tactile or  audio detents is a useful strategy. Another is to provide keyboard or  push-button access to the functions. If the product has an audio system  and microprocessor, use audio feedback of the setting. For simple  products, tactile markings may be sufficient.</p><p class="depth0">g. Controls may also be shaped so that they can easily be read by  touch (e.g., a twist knob shaped like a pie wedge). For keys which do  not have any physical travel, some type of audio or tactile feedback  should be provided so that the individual knows when the key has been  activated. A two-state key (on/off) should be physically different in  each position (e.g., a toggle switch or a push-in/pop-out switch), so  the person can tell what state the key is in by feeling it.</p><p class="depth0">h. If an optional voice mode is provided for operating a product, a  simple ``query'' mode can also be provided, which allows an individual  to find out the function and state of a switch without actually  activating it. In some cases, there may be design considerations which  make the optimal mode for a sighted person inaccessible to someone  without vision (e.g., use of a touch screen or mouse). In these cases, a  primary strategy may be to provide a closely linked parallel method for  efficiently achieving the same results (e.g., keyboard access) if there  is a keyboard, or ``SpeedList'' access for touch screens.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth0">Operable With Low Vision and Limited or No Hearing</p><p class="depth0">1. Individuals with low vision often also have hearing disabilities,  especially older individuals. These persons cannot rely solely on audio  access modes commonly used by people who are blind. Tactile strategies  are still quite useful, although many older persons may not be familiar  with Braille. The objective, therefore, is to maximize the number of  people who can use their residual vision, combined with tactile senses,  to operate a product.</p><p class="depth0">2. Strategies for addressing this provision may include the  following: a. Make the information on the product easier to see. Use  high-contrast print symbols and visual indicators, minimize glare on the  display and control surfaces, provide adequate lighting, position  controls near the items they control to make them easy to find, and use  Arabic instead of Roman numerals.</p><p class="depth0">b. The type-face and type-spacing used can greatly affect  legibility. The spacing between letters should be approximately \1/16\  the height of uppercase letters and the spacing should be uniform from  one label to the next. Also, symbols can sometimes be used which are  much more legible and understandable than fine print.</p><p class="depth0">c. Where the display is dynamic, provide a means for the user to  enlarge the display and to ``freeze'' it. In addition to making it  easier to see, there are strategies which can be used to reduce the need  to see things clearly in order to operate them.</p><p class="depth0">d. A judicious use of color-coding, always redundant with other  cues, is extremely helpful to persons with low vision. These cues should  follow standard conventions, and can be used to reduce the need to read  labels (or read labels more than the first time). In addition, all of  the tactile strategies discussed under section 1193.41 (a) can also be  used here.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth0">Operable With Little or No Color Perception</p><p class="depth0">1. Many people are unable to distinguish between certain color  combinations. Others are unable to see color at all.</p><p class="depth0">2. Strategies for addressing this provision include:</p><p class="depth0">a. Eliminate the need for a person see color to operate the product.  This does not eliminate the use of color completely but rather requires  that any information essential to the operation of a product also be  conveyed in some other fashion.</p><p class="depth0">b. Avoid color pairs such as red/green and blue/yellow, that are  indistinguishable by people with limited color perception.</p><p class="depth0">c. Provide colors with different hues and intensity so that colored  objects can be distinguished even on a black and white screen by their  different appearance. Depending upon the product, the manufacturer may  also be able to allow users to adjust colors to match their preferences  and visual abilities.</p><p class="depth0">d. Avoid colors with a low luminance.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth0">Operable Without Hearing</p><p class="depth0">1. Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing cannot locate or  identify controls that require hearing. Products that provide only audio  prompts cannot be used by individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.  For example, a voice-based interactive product that can be controlled  only by listening to menu items and then pressing buttons is not  accessible. By addressing the output issues under section 1193.43(d)  many accessibility problems that affect input under this section can be  solved.</p><p class="depth0">2. Some strategies include:</p><p class="depth0">a. Text versions of audio prompts could be provided which are  synchronized with the audio so that the timing is the same.</p><p class="depth0">b. If prompts are provided visually and no speech or vocalization is  required, most problems associated with locating, identifying, and  operating controls without hearing will be solved.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (e)</p><p class="depth0">Operable With Limited Manual Dexterity</p><p class="depth0">1. Individuals may have difficulty manipulating controls on products  for any number of reasons. Though these disabilities may vary widely,  these persons have difficulty grasping, pinching, or twisting objects  and often have difficulty with finer motor coordination. Some persons  may use a headstick, mouthstick, or artificial limb.</p><p class="depth0">2. Below are some strategies which will assist in designing products  which will meet the needs of these persons:</p><p class="depth0">a. Provide larger buttons and controls, or buttons which are more  widely spaced, to reduce the likelihood that a user will accidentally  activate an adjacent control.</p><p class="depth0">b. Provide guard bars between the buttons or near the buttons so  that accidental movements would hit the guard bars rather than  accidentally bumping switches.</p><p class="depth0">c. Provide an optional mode where buttons must be depressed for a  longer period of time (e.g., SlowKeys) before they would accept input to  help separate between inadvertent motions or bumps and desired  activation.</p><p class="depth0">d. Where two buttons must be depressed simultaneously, provide an  option to allow them to be activated sequentially (e.g., StickiKeys).</p><p class="depth0">e. Avoid buttons which are activated merely by touch, such as  capacitance switches. Where that is difficult to do (e.g., with  touchscreens), provide a ``confirm'' button   which an individual can use to confirm that the item touched is the  desired one. Also, make all actions reversible, or request confirmation  before initiating non-reversible actions.</p><p class="depth0">f. Avoid latches, controls, or key combinations which require  simultaneous activation of two or more buttons, or latches. Also, avoid  very small controls or controls which require rotation of the wrist or  pinching and twisting. Where this is not possible, provide alternate  means for achieving the same functions.</p><p class="depth0">g. Controls which have non-slip surfaces and those that can be  operated with the side of the hand, elbow or pencil can be used to  minimize physical activity required. In some cases, rotary controls can  be used if they can be operated without grasping and twisting (e.g., a  thin pie slice shape control or an edge control). Providing a concave  top on buttons makes them easier to use.</p><p class="depth0">h. Make it easier to insert cards or connectors by providing a bevel  around the slot or connector, or use cards or connectors which can be  inserted in any orientation or which self-center or self-align. Placing  the slot or connector on the front and near a ledge or open space allows  individuals to brace their hands or arms to make use of the slot or  connector easier.</p><p class="depth0">i. For some designs, controls which pose problems for individuals  with disabilities may be the most efficient, logical or effective  mechanism for a majority of users. In these cases, provide alternate  strategies for achieving the same functions, but which do not require  fine manipulation. Speech input or voice recognition could be provided  as an alternate input, although it should not be the only input  technique.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (f)</p><p class="depth0">Operable With Limited Reach and Strength</p><p class="depth0">1. Some individuals may have difficulty operating systems which  require reach or strength. The most straight-forward solution to this  problem is to place the controls where they can be easily reached with  minimal changes to body position. Many products also have controls  located on different parts of the product.</p><p class="depth0">2. When this is the case, the following strategies may be used:</p><p class="depth0">a. Allow the functions to be controlled from the keyboard, which is  located directly in front of the user.</p><p class="depth0">b. Allow voice recognition to be used as an option. This provides  input flexibility, but should never be the only means for achieving a  function.</p><p class="depth0">c. Provide a remote control option that moves all of the controls  for the product together on a unit that can be positioned optimally for  the individual. This allows the individual to operate the product  without having to move to it. If this strategy is used, a standard  communication format would be important to allow the use of alternate  remote controls for those who cannot use the standard remote control.</p><p class="depth0">d. Reduce the force needed to operate controls or latches and avoid  the need for sustained pressure or activity (e.g., use guards rather  than increased strength requirements to avoid accidental activation of  crucial switches).</p><p class="depth0">e. Provide arm or wrist rests or supports, create short cuts that  reduce the number of actions needed, or completely eliminate the need to  operate controls wherever possible by having automatic adjustments.</p><p class="depth0">f. Section 4.34.3 of the Americans with Disabilities Act  Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) also contains specific information  concerning reach ranges. ADAAG gives specific guidance concerning access  to the built environment. Section 4.34.3 indicates the reach ranges for  a front or parallel approach to equipment for individuals using a  wheelchair. This information may prove useful for those  telecommunications manufacturers whose equipment is stationary, such as  an information kiosk.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (g)</p><p class="depth0">Operable Without Time-Dependent Controls</p><p class="depth0">1. Many persons find it very difficult to operate time-dependent  controls.</p><p class="depth0">2. Some strategies which address this problem include:</p><p class="depth0">a. Avoid any timed-out situations or provide instances where the  user must respond to a question or moving display in a set amount of  time or at a specific time (e.g., a rotating display).</p><p class="depth0">b. Where timed responses are required or appropriate, allow the user  to adjust them or set the amount of time allotted to complete a given  task. Warn users that time is running out and allow them to secure  extended time.</p><p class="depth0">c. If the standard mode of operation would be awkward or  inefficient, then provide an alternate mode of operation that offers the  same functions.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (h)</p><p class="depth0">Operable Without Speech</p><p class="depth0">1. Many individuals cannot speak or speak clearly. Products which  require speech in order to operate them should also provide an alternate  way to achieve the same function.</p><p class="depth0">2. Some strategies to achieve this include:</p><p class="depth0">a. Provide an alternate mechanism for achieving all of the functions  which are controlled by speech. If a product includes speech  identification or verification, provide an alternate mechanism for this  function as well.</p><p class="depth0">b. Include individuals who are deaf or who have speech disabilities  in the subject populations that are used to develop voice recognition  algorithms, so that the algorithms will better accommodate a wider range  of speech patterns.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (i)</p><p class="depth0">Operable With Limited Cognitive Skills</p><p class="depth0">1. Many individuals have reduced cognitive abilities, including  reduced memory, sequence tracking, and reading skills. This does not  necessarily prevent these persons from using a telecommunications  product or feature.</p><p class="depth0">2. The following strategies are extensions of techniques for making  products easier for everyone to learn and use:</p><p class="depth0">a. Use standard colors and shapes and group similar functions  together. On products which have some controls that are used by everyone  and other controls which would only be used by advanced users, it is  generally good practice to separate the two, putting the more advanced  features behind a door or under a separate menu item.</p><p class="depth0">b. Products which read the contents of the display aloud, or  controls which announce their settings, are easier for individuals who  have difficulty reading.</p><p class="depth0">c. Design products that are self-adjusting to eliminate additional  controls which must be learned, and reduce the visual clutter.</p><p class="depth0">d. On products which have sign-in procedures, allow user settings to  be associated with them when they sign in or insert their identification  card. The system can then autoconfigure to them. Some new ``smart  cards'' are being designed with user preferences encoded on the card.</p><p class="depth0">e. Where a complex series of steps is required, provide cuing to  help lead the person through the process. It is also helpful to provide  an ``undo'' or back up function, so that any mistakes can be easily  corrected. Most people will find this function helpful.</p><p class="depth0">f. Where functions are not reversible, request some type of  confirmation from the user before proceeding. On labels and  instructions, it is helpful to use short and simple phrases or  sentences. Avoid abbreviations wherever possible. Eliminate the need to  respond within a certain time or to read text within a certain time.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1193.43 Output, Displays, and Control Functions</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0">Availability of Visual Information</p><p class="depth0">1. Just as persons with visual or cognitive disabilities need to be  able to operate the input, controls, and mechanical functions of a  product, they must also have access to the output functions.</p><p class="depth0">2. The following are strategies for addressing this provision:</p><p class="depth0">a. Provide speech output of all displayed text and labels. For  information which is presented in non-text form (e.g., a picture or  graphic), provide a verbal description unless the graphic is just  decorative. When speech output is provided, allow for the spoken message  to be repeated if the message is very long. Also, if the information  being provided is personal in nature, it is recommended that headphones  be provided in order to assure privacy. A message for stepping through  menus is also helpful.</p><p class="depth0">b. Providing Braille labels for controls is an extremely effective  mechanism for those individuals who read Braille.</p><p class="depth0">c. Large raised print can also be used but is generally restricted  to rather large objects due to the size of the letters.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth0">Availability of Visual Information for Low Vision Users</p><p class="depth0">1. Individuals with low vision often also have hearing disabilities,  especially older individuals. These persons cannot rely solely on audio  access modes commonly used by people who are blind. Tactile strategies  are still quite useful. Many people who have low vision can use their  vision to access visually presented information on a product.</p><p class="depth0">2. Strategies for meeting this provision involve:</p><p class="depth0">a. Provide larger, higher contrast text and graphics. Individuals  with 20/200 vision can see lettering if they get close to it, unless it  is very small or has very poor contrast. Although 14 or 18 point type is  recommended for visual displays, it is usually not possible to put this  size text on small products.</p><p class="depth0">b. Make the lettering as large and high contrast as possible to  maximize the number of people who can use the product.</p><p class="depth0">c. On displays where the font size can be varied, allow the user to  increase the font size, even if it means that the user must pan or move  in order to see the full display.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth0">Access to Moving Text</p><p class="depth0">1. Moving text can be an access problem because individuals with low  vision, or other disabilities may find it difficult or impossible to  track moving text with their eyes.</p><p class="depth0">2. Strategies to address this requirement may include the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. Provide a mechanism for freezing the text. Thus, persons could  read the stationary text and obtain the same information.</p><p class="depth0">b. Provide scrolling to display one full line at a time, with a  pause before the next line replaces it.</p><p class="depth0">c. Provide the same information in another type of display which  does not move. The   right-to-left scrolling text on a TTY does not usually present a problem  because it can be controlled by asking the sender to type slower or  pause at specified intervals.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth0">Availability of Auditory Information</p><p class="depth0">1. Individuals who have hearing disabilities are unable to receive  auditory output, or mechanical and other sounds that are emitted by a  product. These sounds are often important for the safe or effective  operation of the product. Therefore, information which is presented  auditorial should be available to all users.</p><p class="depth0">2. Some strategies to achieve this include the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. Provide a visual or tactile signal that will attract the person's  attention and alert the user to a call, page, or other message, or to  warn the user of significant mechanical difficulties in the product.</p><p class="depth0">b. In portable products, a tactile signal such as vibration is often  more effective than a visual signal because a visual signal may be  missed. An auxiliary vibrating signaler might be effective if it is not  readily achievable or effective to build vibration into a portable  product.</p><p class="depth0">c. For stationary products, a prominent visual indicator in the  field of vision (e.g., a screen flash for a computer, or a flashing  light for a telephone) is effective. To inform the user of the status of  a process (e.g., line status on a telephone call, power on, saving to  disk, or disconnected), text messages may be used. It is also desirable  to have an image or light that is activated whenever acoustic energy is  present on a telephone line.</p><p class="depth0">d. Speech messages should be portrayed simultaneously in text form  and displayed where easily seen by the user. Such captions should  usually be verbatim and displayed long enough to be easily read. If the  product provides speech messages and the user must respond to those  messages (e.g., interactive voice response and voice mail), a TTY  accessible method of accessing the product could be provided.</p><p class="depth0">e. TTY to TTY long distance and message unit calls from pay  telephones are often not possible because an operator says how much  money must be deposited. Technology exists to have this information  displayed on the telephone and a test installation is currently  operating at the Butler plaza on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. In addition,  if the product provides interactive communication using speech and  video, it would be helpful to provide a method and channel for allowing  non-speech communication (e.g., text conversation) in parallel with the  video.</p><p class="depth0">f. Certain operations of products make sounds that give status  information, although these sounds are not programmed signals. Examples  include the whir of an operating disk drive and the click of a key being  pushed. Where sounds of this type provide information important for  operating the product, such as a ``beep'' when a key is activated,  provide a light or other visual confirmation of activation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (e)</p><p class="depth0">Availability of Auditory Information for People Who Are Hard of Hearing</p><p class="depth0">1. People who are hard of hearing but not deaf can often use their  hearing to access auditory information on a product.</p><p class="depth0">2. Strategies for addressing this requirement may include the  following:</p><p class="depth0">a. Improve the signal to noise ratio by making the volume  adjustable, between 18-25 dB, increasing the maximum undistorted volume,  and minimizing background noise by such methods as better coupling  between the signal source and the user.</p><p class="depth0">b. Alerting tones are most likely to be heard if they involve  multiple tones, separated in frequency, which contrast with the  environment.</p><p class="depth0">c. Occasionally, varying tones may be preferred for attracting  attention. If speech is used, it is best to test its intelligibility  with individuals who are hard of hearing to maximize its clarity and  ease of understanding. Provide the ability for the user to have any  messages repeated or to repeat the message if no response is received  from the user.</p><p class="depth0">d. For essential auditory information, the information might be  repeated and an acknowledgment from the user requested.</p><p class="depth0">e. The intelligibility of the output can also be maximized by the  location of the speakers and by keeping the speakers away from noise  sources. However, visual displays are often more desirable than loud  prompts or alerts, because the latter reduce privacy and can annoy  others unless the amplified signal is isolated by means of a headphone,  induction coupling, direct plug-in to a hearing aid, or other methods.</p><p class="depth0">f. The use of a telephone handset or earcup which can be held up to  the ear can improve intelligibility without disturbing others in the  area. If a handset or earcup is used, making it compatible with a  hearing aid allows users to directly couple the auditory signal to their  hearing aids. If the microphone in the handset is not being used,  turning it off will also reduce the amount of background noise which the  person hears in the earpiece. Providing a headphone jack also allows  individuals to plug in headphones, induction loops, or amplifiers which  they may use to hear better.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (f)</p><p class="depth0">Prevention of Visually-Induced Seizures</p><p class="depth0">1. Individuals with photo-sensitive epilepsy can have a seizure  triggered by displays   which flicker or flash, particularly if the flash has a high intensity  and within certain frequency ranges.</p><p class="depth0">2. Strategies to address this requirement involve reducing or  eliminating screen flicker or image flashing to the extent possible. In  particular, the rates of 2 Hz or lower or 70 Hz or higher are  recommended. This recommendation reflects current research data on  people with photosensitive epilepsy which indicates that the peak  sensitivity for these individuals is 20 Hz and that the sensitivity then  drops off in both directions.</p><p class="depth0">3. The chance of triggering seizures can also be reduced by avoiding  very bright flashes which occupy a large part of the visual field  (particularly in the center of the visual field) in order to minimize  the impact on the visual cortex.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (g)</p><p class="depth0">Availability of Audio Cutoff</p><p class="depth0">1. Individuals using the audio access mode, as well as those using a  product with the volume turned up, need a way to limit the range of  audio broadcast.</p><p class="depth0">2. If an audio headphone jack is provided, a cut-off switch can be  included in the jack so that insertion of the jack would cut off the  speaker. If a telephone-like handset is used, the external speakers can  be turned off when the handset is removed from the cradle.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (h)</p><p class="depth0">Non-Interference With Hearing Technologies</p><p class="depth0">1. Individuals who are hard of hearing use hearing aids and other  assistive listening devices but these devices cannot be used if a  telecommunications product introduces noise into the listening aids  because of stray electromagnetic interference.</p><p class="depth0">2. Strategies for reducing this interference (as well as improving  hearing aid immunity) are being researched. The most desirable strategy  is to avoid the root causes of interference when a product is initially  designed. If the root sources of interference cannot be removed, then  shielding, placement of components to avoid hearing aid interference,  and field-canceling techniques may be effective. Standards are being  developed to limit interference to acceptable levels, but complete  elimination for some technologies may not yet be practical.</p><p class="depth0">3. In April 1996, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)  established a task group (ANSI C63) under its subcommittee on medical  devices to develop standards to measure hearing aid compatibility and  accessibility to digital wireless telecommunications. The C63.19 task  group is continuing to develop its standard, C63.19-199X, American  National Standard for Methods of Measurement for Hearing Aid  Compatibility with Wireless Communications Devices. When the standard is  completed, the Board intends to reference it in this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (i)</p><p class="depth0">Hearing Aid Coupling</p><p class="depth0">1. Many individuals who are hard of hearing use hearing aids with a  T-coil (or telecoil) feature to allow them to listen to audio output of  products without picking up background noise and to avoid problems with  feedback, signal attenuation or degradation.</p><p class="depth0">2. The Hearing Aid Compatibility (HAC) Act defines a telephone as  hearing aid compatible if it provides internal means for effective use  with hearing aids and meets established technical standards for hearing  aid compatibility.</p><p class="depth0">3. The technical standards for HAC telephones are specified in ANSI/ EIA-504-1989, ``Magnetic Field Intensity Criteria for Telephone  Compatibility with Hearing Aids,'' ANSI/TIA/EIA-504-1-1994, ``An  Addendum to EIA-504,'' which adds the HAC requirements, and the FCC  regulations at 47 CFR 68.317 (a).</p><p class="depth0">4. A good strategy for addressing this requirement for any product  held up to the ear would be to meet these same technical requirements.  If not readily achievable to provide built-in telecoil compatibility,  other means of providing the electro-magnetic signal is the next  strategy to be considered.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart D--Requirements for Compatibility With Peripheral Devices and</p><p class="depth0">Specialized Customer Premises Equipment</p><p class="depth0">Section 1193.51 Compatibility</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0">External Electronic Access to All Information and Control Mechanisms</p><p class="depth0">1. Some individuals with severe or multiple disabilities are unable  to use the built-in displays and control mechanisms on a product.</p><p class="depth0">2. The two most common forms of manipulation-free connections are an  infrared connection or a radio frequency connection point. Currently,  the Infrared Data Association (IrDA) infrared connection point is the  most universally used approach.</p><p class="depth0">3. The Infrared Data Association together with dominant market  players in the cellular and paging industries, Ericsson, Matsushita/ Panasonic, Motorola, NEC, Nokia, NTT DoCoMo, Puma, and TU-KA Phone  Kansai, announced on April 25, 1997 a proposed set of standards that  will empower wireless communication devices, such as cellular phones,  pagers and personal computers to transfer useful information over short  distances using IrDA infrared data communication ports. Because the  proposed standard is designed to be scalable, it is easy-to-adopt by a  wide range of wireless devices from pagers   to more enhanced communications tools such as smart phones. (See http:// www.irda.org).</p><p class="depth0">4. Adding an infrared connector to the serial port of a peripheral  device or specialized customer premises equipment will make these  products more compatible with each other and with customer premises  equipment.</p><p class="depth0">5. An infrared link can provide a mechanism for providing access to  smaller, more advanced telecommunication devices and provide a safety  net for products which are unable to incorporate other technologies.  There is a joint international effort to develop a Universal Remote  Console Communication (URCC) protocol which would achieve this  functionality. (See http://trace.wisc.edu/world/urc/).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth0">Connection Point for External Audio Processing Devices</p><p class="depth0">1. Individuals using audio peripheral devices such as amplifiers,  telecoil adapters, or direct-connection into a hearing aid need a  standard, noise free way to tap into the audio generated by a product.</p><p class="depth0">2. Individuals who cannot hear well can often use products if they  can isolate and enhance the audio output. For example, they could plug  in a headphone which makes the audio louder and helps shut out  background noise; they might feed the signal through an amplifier to  make it louder, or through filters or frequency shifters to make it  better fit their audio profile. If they are wearing a hearing aid, they  may directly connect their hearing aid to the audio signal or plug in a  small audio loop which allows them to couple the audio signal through  their hearing aid's built-in T-coil.</p><p class="depth0">3. Devices which can process the information and provide visual and/ or tactile output are also possible. The most common strategy for  achieving this requirement is the use of a standard 9 mm miniature plug- in jack, common to virtually every personal tape player or radio. For  small products, a subminiature phone jack could be used.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth0">Compatibility of Controls With Prosthetics</p><p class="depth0">1. Individuals who have artificial hands or use headsticks or  mouthsticks to operate products have difficulty with capacitive or heat- operated controls which require contact with a person's body rather than  a tool. Individuals who wear prosthetics are unable to operate some  types of products because they either require motions that cannot easily  be made with a prosthetic hand, or because products are designed which  require touch of the human skin to operate them (e.g., capacitive  touchscreen kiosks), making it impossible for individuals with  artificial arms or hands to operate, except perhaps with their nose or  chin. Some individuals who do not have the use of their arms use either  a headstick or a mouthstick to operate products. Controls and mechanisms  which require a grasping and twisting motion should be avoided.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth0">TTY Connectability</p><p class="depth0">1. Acoustic coupling is subject to interference from ambient noise,  as many handsets do not provide an adequate seal with TTYs. Therefore,  alternate (non-acoustic) connections are needed. Control of the  microphone is needed for situations such as pay-phone usage, where  ambient noise picked up by the mouthpiece often garbles the signal. For  the use of voice carry-over, where the person can speak but not hear,  the user needs to be able to turn the microphone on to speak and off to  allow them to receive the TTY text replies.</p><p class="depth0">2. A TTY can be connected to and used with any telecommunications  product supporting speech communication without requiring purchase of a  special adapter, and the user is able to intermix speech and clear TTY  communication. The most common approach today is to provide an RJ-11  jack. On very small products, where there may not be room for this large  jack, a miniature or subminiature phone-jack wired as a ``headset'' jack  (with both speaker and microphone connections) could be used as an  alternate approach. In either case, a mechanism for turning the phone  mouthpiece (microphone) on and off would reduce garbling in noisy  environments, while allowing the user to speak into the microphone when  desired (to conduct conversations with mixed voice and TTY). For  equipment that combines voice communications, displays, keyboards and  data communication functions, it is desirable to build in direct TTY  capability.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (e)</p><p class="depth0">TTY Signal Compatibility</p><p class="depth0">1. Some telecommunications systems compress the audio signal in such  a manner that standard signals used by a TTY is distorted or attenuated  preventing successful TTY communication over the system. A TTY can be  used with any product providing voice communication function.</p><p class="depth0">2. The de facto standard of domestic TTYs is Baudot which has been  defined in ITU-T Recommendation V.18. Although the V.18 standard has  been adopted, products are not yet available which meet its  requirements.</p><p class="depth0">3. This provision can be addressed by ensuring that the tones used  can travel   through the phones compression circuits undistorted. It is even more  desirable to provide undistorted connectivity to the telephone line in  the frequency range of 390 Hz to 2300 Hz (ITU-T Recommendation V.18), as  this range covers all of the TTY protocols known throughout the world.  Although it may not be achievable with current technology, an alternate  strategy might be to recognize the tones, transmit them as codes, and  resynthesize them at the other end. In addition, it should be possible  for individuals using TTYs to conduct conversations with mixed voice and  TTY, and to control all aspects of the product and receive any messages  generated by the product.</p>
