                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Medical care and hospitalization. The Foreign Service representative should lend any assistance possible (see Sec. Sec. 102.10 and 102.11) in arranging for the best medical and hospital attention available for injured survivors of the accident. If a scheduled United States carrier is involved in an accident, the primary responsibility for providing medical care for passengers and crew rests with the airline, and in such situations the Foreign Service representative should assist the airline in every way that is feasible (see Sec. Sec. 102.10 and 102.11).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Accommodation and onward transportation. If a scheduled United States carrier is involved in an accident, primary responsibility for providing accommodation and onward transportation for passengers and crew rests with the airline, and in such situations the Foreign Service representative should assist the airline in every way that is feasible (see Sec. Sec. 102.10 and 102.11). If the accident involves a private plane or non-scheduled carrier, he should assist passengers and members of the crew who do not require hospitalization in any way compatible with Sec. Sec. 102.10 and 102.11 in obtaining appropriate comfortable accommodations accessible from the scene of the accident. If practicable, surviving passengers should remain in the vicinity of the accident until the United States Government investigating personnel can obtain from them all information pertaining to the accident. Surviving passengers leaving the vicinity should furnish addresses at which they can be reached later. The Foreign Service representative should assist the passengers, insofar as he can under the provision of Sec. Sec. 102.10 and 102.11, in obtaining necessary clearances from local authorities and in getting onward transportation by the most expeditious means of common carrier transportation available. The surviving aircraft crew will be expected to remain in the vicinity of the accident until otherwise instructed by the investigating personnel.</p>
