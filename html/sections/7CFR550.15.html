Required resource contributions must be substantial enough to substantiate a true stake in the project as determined by the ADO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> REE Agency's contribution. The REE Agency's contribution must consist of the total in-house costs to the REE Agency and the total amount to be reimbursed by the REE Agency to the Cooperator for all allowable costs agreed to in advance as reflected in the cooperative agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cooperator's contribution. (1) The Cooperator's contribution must be no less than 20 percent of the total of the resource contributions under the cooperative agreement. Resource contributions of the Cooperator must consist of a sufficient amount of itemized direct costs to substantiate a true stake in the project as determined by the ADO. The Cooperator's contribution must be maintained at 20 percent of Federal funding throughout the life of the cooperative agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Cooperator's contribution must be no less than 20 percent of the total of the resource contributions under the cooperative agreement.

Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the Cooperator's organization. In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the Cooperator organization, rates shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the Cooperator competes for the kind of services involved. In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When an employer other than the Cooperator furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable, but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally paid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Donated supplies may include such items as expendable equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop and classroom supplies.
