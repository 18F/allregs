(1) Tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide tralomethrin, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table in this paragraph. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in this paragraph is to be determined by measuring only the sum of tralomethrin, (S)-cyano(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl (1R,3S)-2,2-dimethyl-3-(1,2,2,2-tetrabromoethyl)cyclopropanecarboxylate, and its metabolites (S)-cyano(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl (1R,3R)-3-(2,2-dibromoethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate and (S)-cyano(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl (1S,3R)-3-(2,2-dibromoethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of tralomethrin, in or on the commodity.

All food-contact surfaces and equipment must be thoroughly cleaned after general surface applications.
