The gripping surface (handle) shall be colored red and shall be easily distinguishable from the rest of the operator. It shall be capable of being adjusted to a height of 6 feet (1.8 m) above the garage floor when the operator is installed according to the instructions specified in Sec. 1211.14(a)(2). The means shall be constructed so that a hand firmly gripping it and applying a maximum of 50 pounds (223 N) of force shall detach the operator with the door obstructed in the down position. The obstructing object, as described in Sec. 1211.7(b), is to be located in several different positions. A marking with instructions for detaching the operator shall be provided as required by Sec. 1211.15(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A means to manually detach the door operator from the door is not required for a door operator that is not directly attached to the door and that controls movement of the door so that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The door is capable of being moved open from any position other than the last (closing) 2 inches (50.8 mm) of travel, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The door is capable of being moved to the 2-inch point from any position between closed and the 2-inch point.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Actuation of a control that initiates movement of a door shall stop and may reverse the door on the down cycle.
