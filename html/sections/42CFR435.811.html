                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, to  determine eligibility of medically needy individuals, a Medicaid agency  must use a single income standard under this subpart that meets the  requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The income standard must take into account the number of persons  in the assistance unit. Subject to the limitations specified in  paragraph (e) of this section. The standard may not diminish by an  increase in the number of persons in the assistance unit. For example,  if the income level in the standard for an assistance unit of two is set  at $400, the income level in the standard for an assistance unit of  three may not be less than $400.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In States that do not use more restrictive requirements than  SSI, the income standard must be set at an amount that is no lower than  the lowest income standards used under the cash assistance programs that  are related to the State's covered medically needy eligibility group or  groups of individuals under Sec.  435.301. The amount of the income  standard is subject to the limitations specified in paragraph (e) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In States that use more restrictive requirements for aged,  blind, and disabled individuals than SSI:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For all individuals except aged, blind, and disabled  individuals, the income standard must be set in accordance with  paragraph (c) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For all aged, blind, and disabled individuals or any combination  of these groups of individuals, the agency   may establish a separate single medically needy income standard that is  more restrictive than the single income standard set under paragraph (c)  of this section. However, the amount of the more restrictive separate  standard for aged, blind, or disabled individuals must be no lower than  the higher of the lowest categorically needy income standard currently  applied under the State's more restrictive criteria under Sec.  435.121  or the medically needy income standard in effect under the State's  Medicaid plan on January 1, 1972. The amount of the income standard is  subject to the limitations specified in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The income standards specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this  section must not exceed the maximum dollar amount of income allowed for  purposes of FFP under Sec.  435.1007.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The income standard may vary based on the variations between  shelter costs in urban areas and rural areas.
