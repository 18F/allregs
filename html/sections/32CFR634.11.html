                                Sec. 634.11  Administrative due process for suspensions and revocations.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Individual Services will promulgate separate regulations  establishing administrative due process procedures for suspension or  revocation of driving privileges. The procedures in paragraphs (b) and  (c) of this section apply to actions taken by Army commanders with  respect to Army military personnel and family members and to civilian  personnel operating motor vehicles on Army installations. For Marine  Corps users, the provisions of this section apply. For Air Force users,  a preliminary suspension for intoxicated driving remains in effect until  the installation commander makes a final decision. Requested hearings  must take place within a reasonable period, which is determined by the  installation commander.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For offenses other than intoxicated driving, suspension or  revocation of the installation driving privilege will not become  effective until the installation commander or designee notifies the  affected person and offers that person an administrative hearing.  Suspension or revocation will take place 14 calendar days after written  notice is received unless the affected person makes an application for a  hearing within this period. Such application will stay the pending  suspension or revocation for a period of 14 calendar days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If, due to action by the government, a hearing is not held  within 14 calendar days, the suspension will not take place until such  time as the person is granted a hearing and is notified of the action of  the installation commander or designee. However, if the affected person  requests that the hearing be continued to a date beyond the 14-day  period, the suspension or revocation will become effective immediately  on receipt of notice that the request for continuance has been granted,  and   remain in force pending a hearing at a scheduled hearing date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If it is determined as a result of a hearing to suspend or  revoke the affected person's driving privilege, the suspension or  revocation will become effective when the person receives the written  notification of such action. In the event that written notification  cannot be verified, either through a return receipt for mail or delivery  through command channels, the hearing authority will determine the  effective date on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the revocation or suspension is imposed after such hearing,  the person whose driving privilege has been suspended or revoked will  have the right to appeal or request reconsideration. Such requests must  be forwarded through command channels to the installation commander  within 14 calendar days from the date the individual is notified of the  suspension or revocation resulting from the administrative hearing. The  suspension or revocation will remain in effect pending a final ruling on  the request. Requests for restricted privileges will be considered per  Sec. 634.15.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If driving privileges are temporarily restored (i.e., for family  hardship) pending resolution of charges, the period of revocation (after  final authority determination) will still total the mandatory 12 months.  The final date of the revocation will be adjusted to account for the  period when the violator's privileges were temporarily restored, as this  period does not count towards the revocation time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For drunk driving or driving under the influence offenses,  reliable evidence readily available will be presented promptly to an  individual designated by the installation commander for review and  authorization for immediate suspension of installation driving  privileges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The reviewer should be any officer to include GS-11 and above,  designated in writing by the installation or garrison commander whose  primary duties are not in the field of law enforcement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reliable evidence includes witness statements, military or  civilian police report of apprehension, chemical test results if  completed, refusal to consent to complete chemical testing, videotapes,  statements by the apprehended individual, field sobriety or preliminary  breath tests results, and other pertinent evidence. Immediate suspension  should not be based solely on published lists of arrested persons,  statements by parties not witnessing the apprehension, or telephone  conversations or other information not supported by documented and  reliable evidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reviews normally will be accomplished within the first normal  duty day following final assembly of evidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Installation commanders may authorize the installation law  enforcement officer to conduct reviews and authorize suspensions in  cases where the designated reviewer is not reasonably available and, in  the judgment of the installation law enforcement officer, such immediate  action is warranted. Air Force Security Forces personnel act in an  advisory capacity to installation commanders. Review by the designated  officer will follow as soon as practical in such cases. When a  suspension notice is based on the law enforcement officer's review,  there is no requirement for confirmation notice following subsequent  review by the designated officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For active duty military personnel, final written notice of  suspension for intoxicated driving will be provided to the individual's  chain of command for immediate presentation to the individual. Air Force  Security Forces provide a copy of the temporary suspension to the  individual at the time of the incident or may provide a copy of the  final determination at the time of the incident, as pre-determined by  the final action authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For civilian personnel, written notice of suspension for  intoxicated driving will normally be provided without delay via  certified mail. Air Force Security Forces personnel provide a copy of  the temporary suspension to the individual at the time of the incident  or may provide a copy of the final determination at the time of the  incident, as pre-determined by the final action authority. If the person  is employed on the installation, such notice will be forwarded through  the military or civilian supervisor. When the notice of suspension is  forwarded through the   supervisor, the person whose privileges are suspended will be required  to provide written acknowledgment of receipt of the suspension notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Notices of suspension for intoxicated driving will include the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The fact that the suspension can be made a revocation under  Sec. 634.9(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The right to request, in writing, a hearing before the  installation commander or designee to determine if post driving  privileges will be restored pending resolution of the charge; and that  such request must be made within 14 calendar days of the final notice of  suspension.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The right of military personnel to be represented by counsel  at his or her own expense and to present evidence and witnesses at his  or her own expense. Installation commanders will determine the  availability of any local active duty representatives requested.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The right of Department of Defense civilian employees to have a  personal representative present at the administrative hearing in  accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Written acknowledgment of receipt to be signed by the individual  whose privileges are to be suspended or revoked.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If a hearing is requested, it must take place within 14 calendar  days of receipt of the request. The suspension for intoxicated driving  will remain in effect until a decision has been made by the installation  commander or designee, but will not exceed 14 calendar days after the  hearing while awaiting the decision. If no decision has been made by  that time, full driving privileges will be restored until such time as  the accused is notified of a decision to continue the suspension.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Hearing on suspension actions under Sec. 634.9(a) for drunk or  impaired driving pending resolution of charges will cover only the  following pertinent issues of whether--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The law enforcement official had reasonable grounds to believe  the person was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle  under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The person was lawfully cited or apprehended for a driving  under the influence offense.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The person was lawfully requested to submit his or her blood,  breath, or urine in order to determine the content of alcohol or other  drugs, and was informed of the implied consent policy (consequences of  refusal to take or complete the test).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The person refused to submit to the test for alcohol or other  drug content of blood, breath, or urine; failed to complete the test;  submitted to the test and the result was .08 or higher blood alcohol  content, or between .05 and .08 in violation of the law of the  jurisdiction in which the vehicle is being operated if the jurisdiction  imposes a suspension solely on the basis of the BAC level; or showed  results indicating the presence of other drugs for an on-post  apprehension or in violation of State laws for an off-post apprehension.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The testing methods were valid and reliable and the results  accurately evaluated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> For revocation actions under Sec. 634.9(b) (3) for intoxicated  driving, the revocation is mandatory on conviction or other findings  that confirm the charge. (Pleas of nolo contendere are considered  equivalent to guilty pleas).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Revocations are effective as of the date of conviction or other  findings that confirm the charges. Test refusal revocations will be in  addition to any other revocation incurred during a hearing. Hearing  authority will determine if revocations for multiple offenses will run  consecutively or concurrently taking into consideration if offenses  occurred on same occasion or different times, dates. The exception is  that test refusal will be one year automatic revocation in addition to  any other suspension.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The notice that revocation is automatic may be placed in the  suspension letter. If it does not appear in the suspension letter, a  separate letter must be sent and revocation is not effective until  receipt of the written notice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Revocations cancel any full or restricted driving privileges  that may have been restored during suspension and the resolution of the  charges. Requests for restoration of full driving privileges are not  authorized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The Army Vehicle Registration System will be utilized to  maintain infractions by individuals on Army installations.</p>
