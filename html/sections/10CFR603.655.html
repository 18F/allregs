                                Sec. 603.655  Frequency of periodic audits of for-profit participants.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">If an expenditure-based TIA provides for periodic audits of a for- profit participant by an IPA, the contracting officer must specify the  frequency for those audits. The contracting officer should consider  having an audit performed during the first year of the award, when the  participant has its IPA do its next financial statement audit, unless  the participant already had a systems audit due to other Federal awards  within the past two years. The frequency thereafter may vary depending  upon the dollars the participant is expending annually under the award,  but it is not unreasonable to require an updated audit every two to  three years to verify that the participant's systems continue to be  reliable (the audit then would cover the two or three-year period  between audits).</p>
