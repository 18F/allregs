                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (5) of  this section, grantees will use only the forms specified in paragraphs  (a) through (e) of this section, and such supplementary or other forms  as may from time to time be authorized by OMB, for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Submitting financial reports to Federal agencies, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Requesting advances or reimbursements when letters of credit  are not used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Grantees need not apply the forms prescribed in this section in  dealing with their subgrantees. However, grantees shall not impose more  burdensome requirements on subgrantees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Grantees shall follow all applicable standard and supplemental  Federal agency instructions approved by OMB to the extend required under  the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 for use in connection with forms  specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. Federal  agencies may issue substantive supplementary instructions only with the  approval of OMB. Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the grantee  to disregard any line item that the Federal agency finds unnecessary for  its decisionmaking purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original  and two copies of forms required under this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Federal agencies may provide computer outputs to grantees to  expedite or contribute to the accuracy of reporting. Federal agencies  may accept the required information from grantees in machine usable  format or computer printouts instead of prescribed forms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Federal agencies may waive any report required by this section  if not needed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Federal agencies may extend the due date of any financial report  upon receiving a justified request from a grantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Financial Status Report--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Form. Grantees will use Standard  Form 269 or 269A, Financial Status Report, to report the status of funds  for all nonconstruction grants and for construction grants when required  in accordance with Sec. 1470.41(e)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Accounting basis. Each grantee will report program outlays and  program income on a cash or accrual basis as prescribed by the awarding  agency. If the Federal agency requires accrual information and the  grantee's accounting records are not normally kept on the accural basis,  the grantee shall not be   required to convert its accounting system but shall develop such accrual  information through and analysis of the documentation on hand.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Frequency. The Federal agency may prescribe the frequency of the  report for each project or program. However, the report will not be  required more frequently than quarterly. If the Federal agency does not  specify the frequency of the report, it will be submitted annually. A  final report will be required upon expiration or termination of grant  support.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Due date. When reports are required on a quarterly or semiannual  basis, they will be due 30 days after the reporting period. When  required on an annual basis, they will be due 90 days after the grant  year. Final reports will be due 90 days after the expiration or  termination of grant support.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Federal Cash Transactions Report--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Form. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For grants paid  by letter or credit, Treasury check advances or electronic transfer of  funds, the grantee will submit the Standard Form 272, Federal Cash  Transactions Report, and when necessary, its continuation sheet,  Standard Form 272a, unless the terms of the award exempt the grantee  from this requirement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> These reports will be used by the Federal agency to monitor  cash advanced to grantees and to obtain disbursement or outlay  information for each grant from grantees. The format of the report may  be adapted as appropriate when reporting is to be accomplished with the  assistance of automatic data processing equipment provided that the  information to be submitted is not changed in substance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Forecasts of Federal cash requirements. Forecasts of Federal  cash requirements may be required in the ``Remarks'' section of the  report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cash in hands of subgrantees. When considered necessary and  feasible by the Federal agency, grantees may be required to report the  amount of cash advances in excess of three days' needs in the hands of  their subgrantees or contractors and to provide short narrative  explanations of actions taken by the grantee to reduce the excess  balances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Frequency and due date. Grantees must submit the report no later  than 15 working days following the end of each quarter. However, where  an advance either by letter of credit or electronic transfer of funds is  authorized at an annualized rate of one million dollars or more, the  Federal agency may require the report to be submitted within 15 working  days following the end of each month.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Request for advance or reimbursement--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Advance payments.  Requests for Treasury check advance payments will be submitted on  Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (This form will  not be used for drawdowns under a letter of credit, electronic funds  transfer or when Treasury check advance payments are made to the grantee  automatically on a predetermined basis.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reimbursements. Requests for reimbursement under nonconstruction  grants will also be submitted on Standard Form 270. (For reimbursement  requests under construction grants, see paragraph (e)(1) of this  section.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Outlay report and request for reimbursement for construction  programs--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Grants that support construction activities paid by  reimbursement method. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requests for reimbursement under construction  grants will be submitted on Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request  for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Federal agencies may,  however, prescribe the Request for Advance or Reimbursement form,  specified in Sec. 1470.41(d), instead of this form.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The frequency for submitting reimbursement requests is treated  in Sec. 1470.41(b)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Grants that support construction activities paid by letter of  credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advance. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When a  construction grant is paid by letter of credit, electronic funds  transfer or Treasury check advances, the grantee will report its outlays  to the Federal agency using Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request  for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The Federal agency will  provide any necessary special instruction. However, frequency and   due date shall be governed by Sec. 1470.41(b) (3) and (4).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When a construction grant is paid by Treasury check advances  based on periodic requests from the grantee, the advances will be  requested on the form specified in Sec. 1470.41(d).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Federal agency may substitute the Financial Status Report  specified in Sec. 1470.41(b) for the Outlay Report and Request for  Reimbursement for Construction Programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Accounting basis. The accounting basis for the Outlay Report and  Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs shall be governed by  Sec. 1470.41(b)(2).</p>
