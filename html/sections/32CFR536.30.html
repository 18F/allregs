                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A properly filed claim stops the running of the SOL when it is received by any organization or activity of the

DOD or the U.S. Armed Services. Placing a claim in the mail does not constitute filing. The first Army claims office that receives the claim will date, time stamp, and initial the claim as of the date the claim was initially received ``on post,'' not by the claims office. If initially received close to the SOL's expiration date by an organization or activity that does not have a claims office, claims personnel will discover and record in the file the date of original receipt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ACO or CPO that first receives the claim will enter the claim into the Tort and Special Claims Application (TSCA) database and let the system assign a number to the claim. The claim, whether on an SF 95 or in any other format, shall be scanned into a computer and uploaded onto the TSCA database so that it will become a permanent part of the electronic record. A joint claim will be given a number for each claimant, for example, husband and wife, injured parent and children. If only one sum is filed for all claimants, the same sum will be assigned for each claimant. However, request the claimant to name a sum for each claimant. The claim will bear this number throughout the claims process. Upon transfer, a new number will not be assigned by the receiving office. If a claim does not meet the definition of a proper claim under Sec. Sec. 536.26 and 536.27, it will be date stamped and logged as a Potentially Compensable Event (PCE).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The claim will be transferred if the claim incident arose in another ACO's geographic area; the receiving ACO will use the claims number originally assigned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI) claims that relate to claims determined cognizable under subpart K of this part will be marked with the symbol ``NAFI'' immediately following the claimant's name, to preclude erroneous payment from appropriated funds (APF). This symbol will also be included in the subject line of all correspondence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Upon receipt, copies of the claims will be furnished as follows (when a current e-mail address is available and it is agreeable with the receiving party, providing copies by e-mail is acceptable):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To USARCS, if the amount claimed exceeds $25,000, or $50,000 per incident. However, if the claim arises under the FTCA or AMCSA, only furnish copies if the amount claimed exceeds $50,000, or $100,000 per incident.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For medical malpractice claims, to the appropriate MTF Commander/s through MEDCOM Headquarters, and to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology at the addresses listed below.</p><p class="depth3">MEDCOM, ATTN: MCHO-CL-Q, 2050 Worth Road, Suite 26, Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234-5026.</p><p class="depth3">Department of Legal Medicine, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, 1335 E. West Highway, 6-100, Silver Spring, MD 20910-6254, Commercial: 301-295-8115, e-mail: casha@afip.osd.mil.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the claim is against AAFES forward a copy to: HQ Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES), ATTN: Office of the General Counsel (GC-Z), P.O. Box 650062, Dallas, TX 75265-0062, e-mail: blanchp@aafes.com.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the claim involves a NAFI, including a recreational user or family child care provider forward a copy to: Army Central Insurance Fund, ATTN: CFSC-FM-I, 4700 King Street, Alexandria, VA 22302-4406, e-mail: riskmanagement@cfsc.army.mil.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> ACOs or CPOs will furnish a copy of any medical or dental malpractice claim to the MTF or dental treatment facility commander and advise the commander of all subsequent actions. The commander will be assisted in his or her responsibility to complete DD Form 2526 (Case Abstract for Malpractice Claims).</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec. 536.30: See the parallel discussion at DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 2-9.</p>
