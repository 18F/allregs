                            <p class="depth0">Ruminant and swine embryos may be imported into the United States  from a region where rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease exists only if  they were conceived, collected, processed, and stored prior to  importation at an embryo collection unit. The embryo collection unit may  be located on the premises where the donor dam's herd of origin is kept,  or at any other location, provided that the embryo collection unit has  been inspected and approved by an APHIS veterinarian and that the  following requirements are met:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Animal holding and breeding area(s). The embryo collection unit  must have an area or areas for holding the donor dams and for breeding  them (either natural breeding or artificial insemination).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Embryo collection area. The embryo collection must have a room  or outdoor area for collection of embryos that contains a device or  devices for restraining embryo donors during embryo collection. If a  room, the floor, walls, and ceiling must be impervious to moisture and  constructed of materials that can withstand repeated cleaning and  disinfection. If an outdoor area, the area must have a floor that is  impervious to moisture and is constructed of materials that can  withstand repeated cleaning and disinfection. If the outdoor area also  has walls or a roof, the walls or roof also must be impervious to  moisture and be constructed of materials that can withstand repeated  cleaning and disinfection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Embryo processing area. The embryo collection unit must have an  enclosed room, which may be mobile, that is used only for processing  embryos. The walls, floor, and ceiling of the room must be impervious to  moisture and constructed of materials that can withstand repeated  cleaning and disinfection. The room must contain a work surface for  handling the embryos, such as a table or countertop that is impervious  to moisture. The room also must contain a microscope with a minimum of  50x magnification, and equipment for freezing the embryos.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Embryo storage area. The embryo collection unit must have one  lockable area that is used only for storing frozen embryos intended for  importation into the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Area for cleaning and disinfecting or sterilizing equipment. The  embryo collection unit must have an enclosed room used for cleaning and  disinfecting or sterilizing equipment used for artificial insemination  or for collection, processing, or storage of embryos. The walls, floor,  and ceiling of the room must be impervious to moisture and constructed  of materials that can withstand repeated cleaning and disinfection.
