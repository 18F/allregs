                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Foreign availability assessment. A foreign availability  assessment is an evidentiary analysis that BIS conducts to assess the  foreign availability of a given item according to the assessment  criteria, based on data submitted by a claimant, the data gathered by  BIS, and the data and recommendations submitted by the Departments of  Defense and State and other relevant departments and agencies, TAC  committees, and industry. BIS uses the results of the analysis in  formulating its recommendation to the Secretary on whether foreign  availability exists for a given item. If the Secretary determines that  foreign availability exists, the Secretary will decontrol the item for  national security reasons or approve the license in question if there is  no foreign policy reason to deny the license, unless the President  exercises a National Security Override (see Sec. 768.7 of this part).  The effect of any such determination on the effectiveness of foreign  policy controls may be considered independent of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Types of assessments. There are two types of foreign  availability assessments:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Denied license assessment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Decontrol assessment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Expedited licensing procedures. See Sec. 768.8 of this part for  the evaluation of eligibility of an item for the expedited licensing  procedures.  [61 FR 12915, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 68585, Dec. 30, 1996]</p>
