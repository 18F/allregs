                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">As provided elsewhere in this subpart, certain fruits and vegetables  may be imported into the United States provided that the fruits or  vegetables originate from an area that is free of a specific pest or  pests. In some cases, fruits or vegetables may only be imported if the  area of export is free of all quarantine pests that attack the fruit or  vegetable. In other cases, fruits and vegetables may be imported if the  area of export is free of one or more quarantine pests that attack the  fruit or vegetable, and provided that the risk posed by the remaining  quarantine pests that attack the fruit or vegetable is mitigated by  other specific phytosanitary measures contained in the regulations in  this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application of international standard for pest free areas. APHIS  requires that determinations of pest-free areas be made in accordance  with the criteria for establishing freedom from pests found in  International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures No. 4, ``Requirements  for the establishment of pest free areas.'' The international standard  was established by the International Plant Protection Convention of the  United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization and is incorporated by  reference in Sec. 300.5 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Survey protocols. APHIS must approve the survey protocol used to  determine and maintain pest-free status, as well as protocols for  actions to be performed upon detection of a pest. Pest-free areas are  subject to audit by APHIS to verify their status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination of pest freedom. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For an area to be considered  free of a specified pest for the purposes of this subpart, the  Administrator must determine, and announce in a notice or rule published  in the Federal Register for 60 days public comment, that the area meets  the criteria of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator will announce his or her decision in a  subsequent Federal Register notice. If appropriate, APHIS would begin  issuing permits for importation of the fruit or vegetable from a pest- free area because:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No comments were received on the notice or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The comments on the notice did not affect the overall  conclusions of the notice and the Administrator's determination of risk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Decertification of pest-free areas; reinstatement. If a pest is  detected in an area that is designated as free of that pest, APHIS would  publish in the Federal Register a notice announcing that the pest-free  status of the area in question has been withdrawn, and that imports of  host crops for the pest in question are subject to application of an  approved treatment for the pest. If a treatment for the pest is not  available, importation of the host crops would be prohibited. In order  for a decertified pest-free area to be reinstated, it would have to meet  the criteria of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> General requirements for fruits and vegetables imported from  pest-free areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Labeling. Each box of fruits or vegetables that is imported into  the United States from a pest-free area under this subpart must be  clearly labeled with:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name of the orchard or grove of origin, or the name of the  grower; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The name of the municipality and State in which the fruits or  vegetables were produced; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The type and amount of fruit the box contains.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Phytosanitary certificate. A phytosanitary certificate must  accompany the imported fruits or vegetables, and must contain an  additional declaration that the fruits originate from a pest-free area  that meets the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Safeguarding. If fruits or vegetables are moved from a pest-free  area into or through an area that is not free of that pest, the fruits  or vegetables must be safeguarded during the time they are present in a  non-pest-free area by being covered with insect-proof mesh screens or  plastic tarpaulins, including while in transit to the packinghouse and  while awaiting packaging. If fruits or vegetables are moved through an  area that is not free of that pest during transit to a port, they must  be packed in insect-proof cartons or containers or be covered by insect- proof mesh or plastic tarpaulins during transit to the port and  subsequent export to the United States. These safeguards described in  this section must be intact upon arrival in the United States.
