However, the Contracting Officer shall not introduce any factor that  could have an effect on the selection process after the common cutoff  date for receipt of final proposal revisions, nor shall the finalization  process in any way prejudice the competitive interest or rights of the  unsuccessful offerors. The Contracting Officer shall restrict  finalization of details with the selected offeror to definitizing the  final agreement on terms and conditions, assuming none of these factors  were involved in the selection process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whenever a change occurs in the requirements, the Contracting  Officer shall reopen the competition, and provide all offerors  submitting final proposal revisions an opportunity to resubmit proposals  based on the revised requirements. If there is a question as to whether  a change is material and would require the initiation of a new  competition, the Contracting Officer shall obtain the advice of  technical personnel and OGC-GLD before proceeding. Significant changes  in the offeror's cost proposal may also necessitate a reopening of a  competition, if the changes alter the factors involved in the original  selection process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon finalization of details, the Contracting Officer shall  obtain a confirmation letter from the successful offeror which includes  any revisions to its technical proposal, the agreed upon price or cost,  and, as applicable, a certificate of current cost or pricing data.</p>
