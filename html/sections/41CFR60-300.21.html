                            <p class="depth0">The term discrimination includes, but is not limited to, the acts  described in this section and Sec. 60-300.23.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Disparate treatment. It is unlawful for the contractor to deny  an employment opportunity or benefit or otherwise to discriminate  against a qualified individual because of that individual's status as a  protected veteran or pre-JVA veteran.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limiting, segregating and classifying. Unless otherwise  permitted by this part, it is unlawful for the contractor to limit,  segregate, or classify a job applicant or employee in a way that  adversely affects his or her employment opportunities or status on the  basis of that individual's status as a protected veteran or pre-JVA  veteran. For example, the contractor may not segregate protected  veterans as a whole, or any classification of protected veterans or pre- JVA veterans, into separate work areas or into separate lines of  advancement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contractual or other arrangements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. It is  unlawful for the contractor to participate in a contractual or other  arrangement or relationship that has the effect of subjecting the  contractor's own qualified applicant or employee who is a protected  veteran or pre-JVA veteran to the discrimination prohibited by this  part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contractual or other arrangement defined. The phrase  ``contractual or other arrangement or relationship'' includes, but is  not limited to, a relationship with: an employment or referral agency; a  labor organization, including a collective bargaining agreement; an  organization providing fringe benefits to an employee of the contractor;  or an organization providing training and apprenticeship programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Application. This paragraph (c) applies to the contractor, with  respect to its own applicants or employees, whether the contractor  offered the contract or initiated the relationship, or whether the  contractor accepted the contract or acceded to the relationship. The  contractor is not liable for the actions of the other party or parties  to the contract which only affect that other party's employees or  applicants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Standards, criteria or methods of administration. It is unlawful  for the contractor to use standards, criteria, or methods of  administration, that are not job-related and consistent with business  necessity, and that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Have the effect of discriminating on the basis of status as a  protected veteran or pre-JVA veteran; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Perpetuate the discrimination of others who are subject to  common administrative control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Relationship or association with a protected veteran. It is  unlawful for the contractor to exclude or deny equal jobs or benefits  to, or otherwise discriminate against, a qualified individual because of  the known protected veteran or pre-JVA veteran status of an individual  with whom the qualified individual is known to have a family, business,  social or other relationship or association.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Not making reasonable accommodation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is unlawful for the  contractor to fail to make reasonable accommodation to the known  physical or mental limitations of an applicant or employee who is a  qualified disabled veteran or pre-JVA special disabled veteran, unless  such contractor can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an  undue hardship on the operation of its business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is unlawful for the contractor to deny employment  opportunities to an applicant or employee who is a qualified disabled  veteran or pre-JVA special disabled veteran based on the need of such  contractor to make reasonable accommodation to such an individual's  physical or mental impairments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A qualified disabled veteran or pre-JVA special disabled veteran  is not required to accept an accommodation, aid, service, opportunity or  benefit which such qualified individual chooses not to accept. However,  if such individual rejects a reasonable accommodation, aid, service,  opportunity or benefit that is necessary to enable the individual to  perform the essential functions of the position held or desired, and  cannot, as a result of that rejection, perform the essential functions  of the position, the individual will not be considered a qualified  disabled veteran or pre-JVA special disabled veteran.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Qualification standards, tests and other selection criteria--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  In general. It is unlawful for the contractor to use qualification  standards, employment tests or other selection criteria that screen out  or tend to screen out individuals on the basis of their status as  protected veterans or pre-JVA veterans unless the standard, test or  other selection criterion, as used by the contractor, is shown to be  job-related for the position in question and is consistent with business  necessity. Selection criteria that concern an essential function may not  be used to exclude a disabled veteran if that individual could satisfy  the criteria with provision of a reasonable accommodation. Selection  criteria that exclude or tend to exclude individuals on the basis of  their status as protected veterans or pre-JVA veterans but concern only  marginal functions of the job would not be consistent with business  necessity. The contractor may not refuse to hire an applicant who is a  disabled veteran or pre-JVA special disabled veteran because the  applicant's disability prevents him or her from performing marginal  functions. When considering a protected veteran or pre-JVA veteran for  an employment opportunity, the contractor may not rely on portions of  such veteran's military record, including his or her discharge papers,  which   are not relevant to the qualification requirements of the opportunity in  issue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, 41 CFR  part 60-3, do not apply to 38 U.S.C. 4212 and are similarly inapplicable  to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Administration of tests. It is unlawful for the contractor to  fail to select and administer tests concerning employment in the most  effective manner to ensure that, when a test is administered to a job  applicant or employee who is a disabled veteran or pre-JVA special  disabled veteran with a disability that impairs sensory, manual, or  speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the skills,  aptitude, or whatever other factor of the applicant or employee that the  test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the impaired sensory,  manual, or speaking skills of such employee or applicant, except where  such skills are the factors that the test purports to measure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Compensation. In offering employment or promotions to protected  veterans or pre-JVA veterans, it is unlawful for the contractor to  reduce the amount of compensation offered because of any income based  upon a disability-related and/or military-service-related pension or  other disability-related and/or military-service-related benefit the  applicant or employee receives from another source.</p>
