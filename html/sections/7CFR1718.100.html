                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose.The purpose of this subpart is to set forth the  policies, requirements, and procedures governing loan contracts entered  into between the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and distribution  borrowers or, in some cases, other electric borrowers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Flexibility for individual circumstances.The intent of this  subpart is to provide the flexibility to address the different needs and  different credit risks of individual borrowers, and other special  circumstances of individual lending situations. The model loan contract  contained in appendix A of this subpart provides an example of what a  loan contract with an ``average'' or ``typical'' distribution borrower  may look like under ``average'' or ``typical'' circumstances. Depending  on the credit risks and other circumstances of individual loans, RUS may  execute loan contracts with provisions that are substantially different  than those set forth in the model. RUS may develop alternative model  loan contract provisions. If it does, such provisions will be made  available to the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Resolution of any differences in contractual provisions.If any  provision of the loan contract appears to be in conflict with provisions  of the mortgage, the loan contract shall have precedence with respect to  the contractual relationship between the borrower and RUS with respect  to such provision. If either document is silent on a matter addressed in  the other document, the other document shall have precedence with  respect to the contractual relationship between the borrower and RUS  with respect to such matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Certain loan contract provisions subject to subsequent  rulemaking.If a loan contract provision imposes an obligation or  limitation on the borrower whose interpretation or specification is  subject to RUS regulations or the discretion of the Administrator or  RUS, such interpretation or specification shall be subject to subsequent  rulemaking. Such interpretation or specification of the borrower's  obligations or limitations may not exceed the authority granted to the  Administrator or RUS in the loan contract provision.</p>
