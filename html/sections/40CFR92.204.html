                            <p class="depth0">This section specifies the procedure and requirements for grouping of engines into engine families.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Manufacturers and remanufacturers shall divide their locomotives and locomotive engines into groupings of locomotives and locomotive engines which are expected to have similar emission characteristics throughout their useful life. Each group shall be defined as a separate engine family. Freshly manufactured locomotives may not be included in the same engine family as remanufactured locomotives. Freshly manufactured engines may be included in the same engine family as remanufactured locomotives, provided such engines are used as replacement engines for locomotive models included in the engine family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For Tier 1 and Tier 2 locomotives and locomotive engines, the following characteristics distinguish engine families:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The combustion cycle (e.g., diesel cycle);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The type of engine cooling employed (air-cooled or water-cooled), and procedure(s) employed to maintain engine temperature within desired limits (thermostat, on-off radiator fan(s), radiator shutters, etc.);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The bore and stroke dimensions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The approximate intake and exhaust event timing and duration (valve or port);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The location of the intake and exhaust valves (or ports);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The size of the intake and exhaust valves (or ports);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The overall injection, or as appropriate ignition, timing characteristics (i.e., the deviation of the timing curves from the optimal fuel economy timing curve must be similar in degree);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The combustion chamber configuration and the surface-to-volume ratio of the combustion chamber when the piston is at top dead center position, using nominal combustion chamber dimensions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The location of the piston rings on the piston;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The method of air aspiration (turbocharged, supercharged, naturally aspirated, Roots blown);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The turbocharger or supercharger general performance characteristics (e.g., approximate boost pressure, approximate response time, approximate size relative to engine displacement);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> The type of air inlet cooler (air-to-air, air-to-liquid, approximate degree to which inlet air is cooled);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> The intake manifold induction port size and configuration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> The type of fuel and fuel system configuration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> The configuration of the fuel injectors and approximate injection pressure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> The type of fuel injection system controls (i.e., mechanical or electronic);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> The type of smoke control system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> The exhaust manifold port size and configuration; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(19)</em> The type of exhaust aftertreatment system (oxidation catalyst, particulate trap), and characteristics of the aftertreatment system (catalyst loading, converter size vs engine size).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For Tier 0 locomotives and locomotive engines, the following characteristics distinguish engine families:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The combustion cycle (e.g., diesel cycle);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The type of engine cooling employed (air-cooled or water-cooled), and procedure(s) employed to maintain engine temperature within desired limits (thermostat, on-off radiator fan(s), radiator shutters, etc.);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The approximate bore and stroke dimensions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The approximate location of the intake and exhaust valves (or ports);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The combustion chamber general configuration and the approximate surface-to-volume ratio of the combustion chamber when the piston is at top dead center position, using nominal combustion chamber dimensions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The method of air aspiration (turbocharged, supercharged, naturally aspirated, Roots blown);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The type of air inlet cooler (air-to-air, air-to-liquid, approximate degree to which inlet air is cooled);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The type of fuel and general fuel system configuration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The general configuration of the fuel injectors and approximate injection pressure; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The fuel injection system control type (electronic or mechanical).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Upon request by the manufacturer or remanufacturer, locomotives or locomotive engines that are eligible to be included in the same engine family based on the criteria in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section may be divided into different engine families. This request must be accompanied by information the manufacturer or remanufacturer believes supports the addition of these different engine families. For the purposes of determining whether an engine family is a small engine family in Sec. 92.603(a)(2), EPA will consider the number of locomotives or locomotive engines that could have been classed together under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, instead of the number of locomotives or locomotive engines that are included in a subdivision allowed by this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Upon request by the manufacturer or remanufacturer, the Administrator may allow locomotives or locomotive engines that would be required to be grouped into separate engine families based on the criteria in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to be grouped into a single engine family if the manufacturer or remanufacturer demonstrates that similar emission characteristics will occur. This request must be accompanied by emission information supporting the appropriateness of such combined engine families.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Remanufactured Tier 2 locomotives may be included in the same engine family as freshly manufactured Tier 2 locomotives, provided such engines are used for locomotive models included in the engine family.
