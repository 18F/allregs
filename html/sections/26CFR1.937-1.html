                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope--(1) In general. Section 937(a) and this section set forth the rules for determining whether an individual qualifies as a bona fide resident of a particular possession (the relevant possession) for purposes of subpart D, part III, Subchapter N, Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code as well as section 865(g)(3), section 876, section 881(b), paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 901(b), section 957(c), section 3401(a)(8)(C), and section 7654(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 937(a) and this section set forth the rules for determining whether an individual qualifies as a bona fide resident of a particular possession (the relevant possession) for purposes of subpart D, part III, Subchapter N, Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code as well as section 865(g)(3), section 876, section 881(b), paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 901(b), section 957(c), section 3401(a)(8)(C), and section 7654(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section and Secs. 1.937-2 and 1.937-3--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Possession means one of the following United States possessions: American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands. When used in a geographical sense, the term comprises only the territory of each such possession (without application of sections 932(c)(3) and 935(c)(2) (as in effect before the effective date of its repeal)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> United States, when used in a geographical sense, is defined in section 7701(a)(9), and without application of sections 932(a)(3) and 935(c)(1) (as in effect before the effective date of its repeal).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Bona fide resident--(1) General rule. An individual qualifies as a bona fide resident of the relevant possession if such individual satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section with respect to such possession.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. An individual qualifies as a bona fide resident of the relevant possession if such individual satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section with respect to such possession.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for members of the Armed Forces. A member of the Armed Forces of the United States who qualified as a bona fide resident of the relevant possession in a prior taxable year is deemed to have satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section for a subsequent taxable year if such individual otherwise is unable to satisfy such requirements by reason of being absent from such possession or present in the United States during such year solely in compliance with military orders. Conversely, a member of the Armed Forces of the United States who did not qualify as a bona fide resident of the relevant possession in a prior taxable year is not considered to have satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section for a subsequent taxable year by reason of being present in such possession solely in compliance with military orders. Armed Forces of the United States is defined (and members of the Armed Forces are described) in section 7701(a)(15).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Juridical persons.

For taxable years beginning before October 23, 2004, and ending after October 22, 2004, an individual is considered to qualify as a bona fide resident of the relevant possession if that individual would be a bona fide resident of the relevant possession by applying the principles of Secs. 1.871-2 through 1.871-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Special rule for cessation of bona fide residence in Puerto Rico. See paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section for a special rule applicable to a citizen of the United States who ceases to be a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico during a taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Presence test--(1) In general.

See paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for alien individuals. A nonresident alien individual (as defined in section 7701(b)(1)(B)) satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (c) for a taxable year if during that taxable year that individual satisfies the substantial presence test of Sec. 301.7701(b)-1(c) of this chapter (except for the substitution of the name of the relevant possession for the term United States where appropriate).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Days of presence.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the following days will not count as days of presence in the United States:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any day that an individual is temporarily present in the United States under circumstances described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) or (C) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any day that an individual is in transit between two points outside the United States (as described in Sec. 301.7701(b)-3(d) of this chapter), and is physically present in the United States for fewer than 24 hours;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any day that an individual is temporarily present in the United States as a professional athlete to compete in a charitable sports event (as described in Sec. 301.7701(b)-3(b)(5) of this chapter);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Any day that an individual is temporarily present in the United States as a student (as defined in section 152(f)(2)); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> In the case of an individual who is an elected representative of the relevant possession, or who serves full time as an elected or appointed official or employee of the government of the relevant possession (or any political subdivision thereof), any day spent serving the relevant possession in that role.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If, during a single day, an individual is physically present--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In the United States and in the relevant possession, that day is considered a day of presence in the relevant possession;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In two possessions, that day is considered a day of presence in the possession where the individual's tax

home is located (applying the rules of paragraph (d) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Qualifying medical treatment--(i) In general. The term qualifying medical treatment means medical treatment provided by (or under the supervision of) a physician (as defined in section 213(d)(4)) for an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that satisfies the documentation and production requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section and that involves--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

The term inpatient care means care requiring an overnight stay in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility, as the case may be.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Documentation and production requirements. In order to satisfy the documentation and production requirements of this paragraph, an individual must, with respect to each qualifying medical treatment, prepare (or obtain), maintain, and, upon a request by the Commissioner (or the person responsible for tax administration in the relevant possession), make available within 30 days of such request:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Records that provide--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The patient's name and relationship to the individual (if the medical treatment is provided to a person other than the individual);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The name and address of the hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility where the medical treatment was provided;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The name, address, and telephone number of the physician who provided the medical treatment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The date(s) on which the medical treatment was provided; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Receipt(s) of payment for the medical treatment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Signed certification by the providing or supervising physician that the medical treatment was qualified medical treatment within the meaning of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, and setting forth--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The patient's name;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A reasonably detailed description of the medical treatment provided by (or under the supervision of) the physician;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The dates on which the medical treatment was provided; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The medical facts that support the physician's certification and determination that the treatment was medically necessary; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Such other information as the Commissioner may prescribe by notice, form, instructions, or other publication (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Significant connection. For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The term significant connection to the United States means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A permanent home in the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Current registration to vote in any political subdivision of the United States; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A spouse or child (as defined in section 152(f)(1)) who has not attained the age of 18 whose principal place of abode is in the United States other than--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A child who is in the United States because the child is living with a custodial parent under a custodial decree or multiple support agreement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A child who is in the United States as a student (as defined in section 152(f)(2)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Permanent home--(A) General rule. For purposes of paragraph (c)(5)(i)(A) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, the term permanent home has the same meaning as in Sec. 301.7701(b)-2(d)(2) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. For purposes of paragraph (c)(5)(i)(A) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, the term permanent home has the same meaning as in Sec. 301.7701(b)-2(d)(2) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exception for rental property. If an individual or the individual's spouse owns property and rents it to another person at any time during the taxable year, then notwithstanding that the rental property may constitute a permanent home under Sec. 301.7701(b)-2(d)(2) of this chapter, it is not a permanent home under this paragraph (c)(5)(ii) unless the taxpayer uses any portion of it as a residence during the taxable year under the principles of section 280A(d). In applying the principles of section

280A(d) for this purpose, an individual is treated as using the rental property for personal purposes on any day determined under the principles of section 280A(d)(2) or on any day that the rental property (or any portion of it) is not rented to another person at fair rental for the entire day. The rental property is not used for personal purposes on any day on which the principal purpose of the use of the rental property is to perform repair or maintenance work on the property. Whether the principal purpose of the use of the rental property is to perform repair or maintenance work is determined in light of all the facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, the following: The amount of time devoted to repair and maintenance work, the frequency of the use for repair and maintenance purposes during a taxable year, and the presence and activities of companions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (c)(5), the term spouse does not include a spouse from whom the individual is legally separated under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Tax home test--(1) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an individual satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (d) for a taxable year if that individual did not have a tax home outside the relevant possession during any part of the taxable year. For purposes of section 937 and this section, an individual's tax home is determined under the principles of section 911(d)(3) without regard to the second sentence thereof. Thus, under section 937, an individual's tax home is considered to be located at the individual's regular or principal (if more than one regular) place of business. If the individual has no regular or principal place of business because of the nature of the business, or because the individual is not engaged in carrying on any trade or business within the meaning of section 162(a), then the individual's tax home is the individual's regular place of abode in a real and substantial sense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an individual satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (d) for a taxable year if that individual did not have a tax home outside the relevant possession during any part of the taxable year. For purposes of section 937 and this section, an individual's tax home is determined under the principles of section 911(d)(3) without regard to the second sentence thereof. Thus, under section 937, an individual's tax home is considered to be located at the individual's regular or principal (if more than one regular) place of business. If the individual has no regular or principal place of business because of the nature of the business, or because the individual is not engaged in carrying on any trade or business within the meaning of section 162(a), then the individual's tax home is the individual's regular place of abode in a real and substantial sense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions--(i) Year of move. See paragraph (f) of this section for a special rule applicable to an individual who becomes or ceases to be a bona fide resident of the relevant possession during a taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Year of move. See paragraph (f) of this section for a special rule applicable to an individual who becomes or ceases to be a bona fide resident of the relevant possession during a taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for seafarers. For purposes of section 937 and this section, an individual is not considered to have a tax home outside the relevant possession solely by reason of employment on a ship or other seafaring vessel that is predominantly used in local and international waters. For this purpose, a vessel is considered to be predominantly used in local and international waters if, during the taxable year, the aggregate amount of time it is used in international waters and in the waters within three miles of the relevant possession exceeds the aggregate amount of time it is used in the territorial waters of the United States, another possession, and a foreign country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rule for students and government officials. Any days described in paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(D) and (E) of this section are disregarded for purposes of determining whether an individual has a tax home outside the relevant possession under paragraph (d)(1) of this section during any part of the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Closer connection test--(1) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, an individual satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (e) for a taxable year if that individual did not have a closer connection to the United States or a foreign country than to the relevant possession during any part of the taxable year. For purposes of this paragraph (e)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, an individual satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (e) for a taxable year if that individual did not have a closer connection to the United States or a foreign country than to the relevant possession during any part of the taxable year. For purposes of this paragraph (e)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The principles of section 7701(b)(3)(B)(ii) and Sec. 301.7701(b)-2(d) of this chapter apply (without regard to the final sentence of Sec. 301.7701(b)-2(b) of this chapter); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An individual's connections to the relevant possession are compared to the aggregate of the individual's connections with the United States and foreign countries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception for year of move. See paragraph (f) of this section for a special rule applicable to an individual who becomes or ceases to be a bona fide resident of the relevant possession during a taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Year of move--(1)Move to a possession. For the taxable year in which an individual's residence changes to the relevant possession, the individual satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and (e)(1) of this section if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>Move to a possession. For the taxable year in which an individual's residence changes to the relevant possession, the individual satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and (e)(1) of this section if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For each of the 3 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year of the change of residence, the individual is not a bona fide resident of the relevant possession;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For each of the last 183 days of the taxable year of the change of residence, the individual does not have a tax home outside the relevant possession or a closer connection to the United States or a foreign country than to the relevant possession; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For each of the 3 taxable years immediately following the taxable year of the change of residence, the individual is a bona fide resident of the relevant possession.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Move from a possession--(i) General rule. Except for a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico to whom Sec. 1.933-1(b) and paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section apply, for the taxable year in which an individual ceases to be a bona fide resident of the relevant possession, the individual satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and (e)(1) of this section if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Except for a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico to whom Sec. 1.933-1(b) and paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section apply, for the taxable year in which an individual ceases to be a bona fide resident of the relevant possession, the individual satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and (e)(1) of this section if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For each of the 3 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year of the change of residence, the individual is a bona fide resident of the relevant possession;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For each of the first 183 days of the taxable year of the change of residence, the individual does not have a tax home outside the relevant possession or a closer connection to the United States or a foreign country than to the relevant possession; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For each of the 3 taxable years immediately following the taxable year of the change of residence, the individual is not a bona fide resident of the relevant possession.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Year of move from Puerto Rico. Notwithstanding an individual's failure to satisfy the presence, tax home, or closer connection test prescribed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the taxable year, the individual is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico for that part of the taxable year described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(E) of this section if the individual--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is a citizen of the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico for a period of at least 2 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Ceases to be a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico during the taxable year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Ceases to have a tax home in Puerto Rico during the taxable year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Has a closer connection to Puerto Rico than to the United States or a foreign country throughout the part of the taxable year preceding the date on which the individual ceases to have a tax home in Puerto Rico.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Examples. The principles of this section are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Presence test. H, a U.S. citizen, is engaged in a profession that requires frequent travel. H spends 195 days of each of the years 2005 and 2006 in Possession N. In 2007, H spends 160 days in Possession N. Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii), H satisfies the presence test of paragraph (c) of this section with respect to Possession N for taxable year 2007. Assuming that in 2007 H does not have a tax home outside of Possession N and does not have a closer connection to the United States or a foreign country under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section respectively, then regardless of whether H was a bona fide resident of Possession N in 2005 and 2006, H is a bona fide resident of Possession N for taxable year 2007.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Presence test. W, a U.S. citizen, lives for part of the taxable year in a condominium, which she owns, located in Possession P. W also owns a house in State N where she lives for 120 days every year to be near her grown children and grandchildren. W is retired and her income consists solely of pension payments, dividends, interest, and Social Security benefits. For 2006, W is only present in Possession P for a total of 175 days because of a 70-day vacation to Europe and Asia. Thus, for taxable year 2006, W is not present in Possession P for at least 183 days, is present in the United States for more than 90 days, and has a significant connection to the United States by reason of her permanent home. However, under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, W still satisfies the presence test of paragraph (c) of this section with respect to Possession P because she has no earned income in the United States and is present for more days in Possession P than in the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Presence test. T, a U.S. citizen, was born and raised in State A, where his mother still lives in the house in which T grew up. T is a sales representative for a company based in Possession V. T lives with his wife and minor children in their house in Possession V. T is registered to vote in Possession V and not in the United States. In 2006, T spends 120 days in State A and another 120 days in foreign countries. When

traveling on business to State A, T often stays at his mother's house in the bedroom he used when he was a child. T's stays are always of short duration, and T asks for his mother's permission before visiting to make sure that no other guests are using the room and that she agrees to have him as a guest in her house at that time. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, T's mother's house is not a permanent home of T. Assuming that no other accommodations in the United States constitute a permanent home with respect to T, then under paragraphs (c)(1)(v) and (c)(5) of this section, T has no significant connection to the United States. Accordingly, T satisfies the presence test of paragraph (c) of this section for taxable year 2006.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Alien resident of possession--presence test. F is a citizen of Country G. F's tax home is in Possession C and F has no closer connection to the United States or a foreign country than to Possession C. F is present in Possession C for 123 days and in the United States for 110 days every year. Accordingly, F is a nonresident alien with respect to the United States under section 7701(b), and a bona fide resident of Possession C under paragraphs (b), (c)(2), (d), and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Seafarers--tax home. S, a U.S. citizen, is employed by a fishery and spends 250 days at sea on a fishing vessel in 2006. When not at sea, S resides with his wife at a house they own in Possession G. The fishing vessel upon which S works departs and arrives at various ports in Possession G, other possessions, and foreign countries, but is in international and local waters (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this section) for 225 days in 2006. Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, for taxable year 2006, S will not be considered to have a tax home outside Possession G for purposes of section 937 and this section solely by reason of S's employment on board the fishing vessel.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Seasonal workers--tax home and closer connection. P, a U.S. citizen, is a permanent employee of a hotel in Possession I, but works only during the tourist season. For the remainder of each year, P lives with her husband and children in Possession Q, where she has no outside employment. Most of P's personal belongings, including her automobile, are located in Possession Q. P is registered to vote in, and has a driver's license issued by, Possession Q. P does her personal banking in Possession Q and P routinely lists her address in Possession Q as her permanent address on forms and documents. P satisfies the presence test of paragraph (c) of this section with respect to both Possession Q and Possession I, because, among other reasons, under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section she does not spend more than 90 days in the United States during the taxable year. P satisfies the tax home test of paragraph (d) of this section only with respect to Possession I, because her regular place of business is in Possession I. P satisfies the closer connection test of paragraph (e) of this section with respect to both Possession Q and Possession I, because she does not have a closer connection to the United States or to any foreign country (and possessions generally are not treated as foreign countries). Therefore, P is a bona fide resident of Possession I for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Closer connection to United States than to possession. Z, a U.S. citizen, relocates to Possession V in a prior taxable year to start an investment consulting and venture capital business. Z's wife and two teenage children remain in State C to allow the children to complete high school. Z travels back to the United States regularly to see his wife and children, to engage in business activities, and to take vacations. He has an apartment available for his full-time use in Possession V, but he remains a joint owner of the residence in State C where his wife and children reside. Z and his family have automobiles and personal belongings such as furniture, clothing, and jewelry located at both residences. Although Z is a member of the Possession V Chamber of Commerce, Z also belongs to and has current relationships with social, political, cultural, and religious organizations in State C. Z receives mail in State C, including brokerage statements, credit card bills, and bank advices. Z conducts his personal banking activities in State C. Z holds a State C driver's license and is registered to vote in State C. Based on the totality of the particular facts and circumstances pertaining to Z, Z is not a bona fide resident of Possession V because he has a closer connection to the United States than to Possession V and therefore fails to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Year of move to possession. D, a U.S. citizen, files returns on a calendar year basis. From January 2003 through May 2006, D resides in State R. In June 2006, D moves to Possession N, purchases a house, and accepts a permanent position with a local employer. D's principal place of business from July 1 through December 31, 2006 is in Possession N, and during that period (which totals at least 183 days) D does not have a closer connection to the United States or a foreign country than to Possession N. For the remainder of 2006, and throughout years 2007 through 2009, D continues to live and work in Possession N and maintains a closer connection to Possession N than to the United States or any foreign country. D satisfies the tax home and closer connection tests for 2006 under paragraphs (d)(2), (e)(2), and (f)(1) of this section. Accordingly, assuming that D also satisfies the presence test in paragraph

(c) of this section, D is a bona fide resident of Possession N for all of taxable year 2006.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. Year of move from possession (other than Puerto Rico). J, a U.S. citizen, files returns on a calendar year basis. From January 2007 through December 2009, J is a bona fide resident of Possession C because she satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section for each year. J continues to reside in Possession C until September 6, 2010, when she accepts new employment and moves to State H. J's principal place of business from January 1 through September 5, 2010 is in Possession C, and during that period (which totals at least 183 days) J does not have a closer connection to the United States or a foreign country than to Possession C. For the remainder of 2010 and throughout years 2011 through 2013, D continues to live and work in State H and is not a bona fide resident of Possession C. J satisfies the tax home and closer connection tests for 2010 with respect to Possession C under paragraphs (d)(2)(i), (e)(2), and (f)(2)(i) of this section. Accordingly, assuming that J also satisfies the presence test of paragraph (c) of this section, J is a bona fide resident of Possession C for all of taxable year 2010.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. Year of move from Puerto Rico. R, a U.S. citizen who files returns on a calendar year basis satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section for years 2006 and 2007. From January through April 2008, R continues to reside and maintain his principal place of business in and closer connection to Puerto Rico. On May 5, 2008, R moves and changes his principal place of business (tax home) to State N and later that year establishes a closer connection to the United States than to Puerto Rico. R does not satisfy the presence test of paragraph (c) for 2008 with respect to Puerto Rico. Moreover, because R had a tax home outside of Puerto Rico and establishes a closer connection to the United States in 2008, R does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) or (e)(1) of this section for 2008. However, because R was a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico for at least two taxable years before his change of residence to State N in 2008, he is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico from January 1 through May 4, 2008 under paragraphs (b)(5) and (f)(2)(ii) of this section. See section 933(2) and Sec. 1.933-1(b) for rules on attribution of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Information reporting requirement. The following individuals are required to file notice of their new tax status in such time and manner as the Commissioner may prescribe by notice, form, instructions, or other publication (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Individuals who take the position for U.S. tax reporting purposes that they qualify as bona fide residents of a possession for a tax year subsequent to a tax year for which they were required to file Federal income tax returns as citizens or residents of the United States who did not so qualify.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Citizens and residents of the United States who take the position for U.S. tax reporting purposes that they do not qualify as bona fide residents of a possession for a tax year subsequent to a tax year for which they were required to file income tax returns (with the Internal Revenue Service, the tax authorities of a possession, or both) as individuals who did so qualify.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Bona fide residents of Puerto Rico or a section 931 possession (as defined in Sec. 1.931-1(c)(1)) who take a position for U.S. tax reporting purposes that they qualify as bona fide residents of that possession for a tax year subsequent to a tax year for which they were required to file income tax returns as bona fide residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands or a section 935 possession (as defined in Sec. 1.935-1(a)(3)(i)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Effective/applicability date. Except as provided in this paragraph (i), this section applies to taxable years ending after January 31, 2006. Paragraph (h) of this section also applies to a taxpayer's 3 taxable years immediately preceding the taxpayer's first taxable year ending after October 22, 2004.
