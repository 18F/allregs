The OIG has the responsibility for  investigating or referring the matter, where appropriate, to DOJ for  action. At its discretion, DOJ may return the claim to GSA for further  handling in accordance with the standards of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This part does not apply to tax debts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This part does not apply to claims between GSA and other Federal  agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> This part does not apply to claims over $100,000.</p>
