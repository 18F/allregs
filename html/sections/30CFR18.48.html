                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each machine shall be equipped with a circuit-interrupting device by means of which all power conductors can be deenergized at the machine. A manually operated controller will not be acceptable as a service switch.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When impracticable to mount the main-circuit-interrupting device on a machine, a remote enclosure will be acceptable. When contacts are used as a main-circuit-interrupting device, a means for opening the circuit shall be provided at the machine and at the remote contactors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Separate two-pole switches shall be provided to deenergize power conductors for headlights or floodlights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each handheld tool shall be provided with a two-pole switch of the ``dead-man-control'' type that must be held closed by hand and will open when hand pressure is released.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A machine designed to operate from both trolley wire and portable cable shall be provided with a transfer switch, or equivalent, which prevents energizing one from the other. Such a switch shall be designed to prevent electrical connection to the machine frame when the cable is energized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Belt conveyors shall be equipped with control switches to automatically stop the driving motor in the event the belt is stopped, or abnormally slowed down.</p><p class="depth2">Note: Short transfer-type conveyors will be exempted from this requirement when attended.</p>
