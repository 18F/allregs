Oppositions shall be limited to the specific issues and allegations contained in such motion; when a motion is incorporated in an answer to a complaint, the opposition to such motion shall not address any issues presented in the answer that are not also specifically raised in the motion. Failure to oppose any motion may constitute grounds for granting of the motion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No reply may be filed to an opposition to a motion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Motions seeking an order that the allegations in the complaint be made more definite and certain are prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Amendments or supplements to complaints to add new claims or requests for relief are prohibited.
