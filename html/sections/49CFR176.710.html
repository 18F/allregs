                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In case of fire, collision, or breakage involving any shipment  of radioactive materials, other than materials of low specific activity,  the radioactive materials must be segregated from unnecessary contact  with personnel. In case of obvious leakage, or if the inside container  appears to be damaged, the stowage area (hold, compartment, or deck  area) containing this cargo must be isolated as much as possible to  prevent radioactive material from entering any person's body through  contact, inhalation, or ingestion. No person may handle the material or  remain in the vicinity unless supervised by a qualified person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A hold or compartment in which leakage of radioactive materials  has occurred may not be used for other cargo until it is decontaminated  in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 176.715.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For reporting requirements, see Sec. 171.15 of this subchapter.</p>
