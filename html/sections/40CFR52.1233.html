USEPA  reserves the right to deem permit conditions not federally enforceable.  Such a determination will be made according to appropriate procedures,  and be based upon the permit, permit approval procedures or permit  requirements which do not conform with the permit program requirements  or the requirements of USEPA's underlying regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For any permitting program located in the State, insofar as the  permitting threshold provisions in Chapter 7007 rules concern the  treatment of sources of greenhouse gas emissions as major sources for  purposes of title V operating permits, EPA approves such provisions only  to the extent they require permits for such sources where the source  emits or has the potential to emit at least 100,000 tpy CO2  equivalent emissions, as well as 100 tpy on a mass basis, as of July 1,  2011.
