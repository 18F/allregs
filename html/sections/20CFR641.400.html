Instead, the State must conduct a competition to select an organization as the grantee of the funds allotted to the State under Sec. 506(e). Public and nonprofit private agencies and organizations, State agencies other than the previously designated, failed agency, and tribal organizations, are eligible to be selected as a grantee for the funds. Other States may not be selected as a grantee for this funding.</p>
