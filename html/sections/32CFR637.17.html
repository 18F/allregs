                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The purpose of gathering police intelligence is to identify  individuals or groups of individuals in an effort to anticipate,  prevent, or monitor possible criminal activity. If police intelligence  is developed to the point where it factually establishes a criminal  offense, an investigation by the military police, (USACIDC) or other  investigative agency will be initiated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Police intelligence will be actively exchanged between  Department of Defense (DOD) law enforcement agencies, military police,  USACIDC, local, state, federal, and international law enforcement  agencies. One tool under development by DOD for sharing police  intelligence is the Joint Protection Enterprise Network (JPEN). JPEN  provides users with the ability to post, retrieve, filter, and analyze  real-world events. There are seven reporting criteria for JPEN:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Non-specific threats;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Surveillance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Elicitation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Tests of Security;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Repetitive Activities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Bomb Threats/Incidents; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Suspicious Activities/Incidents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a written extract from local police intelligence files is  provided to an authorized investigative agency, the following will be  included on the transmittal documents: ``This document is provided for  information and use. Copies of this document, enclosures thereto, and  information therefrom, will not   be further released without the prior approval of the installation  Provost Marhsall.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Local police intelligence files may be exempt from certain  disclosure requirements by AR 25-55 and the Freedom of Information Act  (FOIA).</p>
