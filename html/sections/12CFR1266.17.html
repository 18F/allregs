                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority.

A  Bank may make an advance to any housing associate upon the security of  the following collateral:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration of  HUD under title II of the National Housing Act; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> if the housing associate provides evidence  that such securities are backed solely by mortgages of the type  described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certain advances to SHFAs. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In addition to the collateral  described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a Bank may make an  advance to a housing associate that has satisfied the requirements of  Sec. 1264.3(b) for the purpose of facilitating residential or  commercial mortgage lending that benefits individuals or families  meeting the income requirements in section 142(d) or 143(f) of the  Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 142(d) or 143(f)) upon the security of  the following collateral:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The collateral described in Sec. 1266.7(a)(1) or (2).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The collateral described in Sec. 1266.7(a)(3). Solely for the  purpose of facilitating acceptance of such collateral, a Bank may  establish a cash collateral account for a housing associate that has  satisfied the requirements of Sec. 1264.3(b).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The other real estate-related collateral described in Sec.  1266.7(a)(4), provided that such collateral comprises mortgage loans on  one-to-four family or multifamily residential property.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Prior to making an advance pursuant to this paragraph (b)(2), a  Bank shall obtain a written certification from the housing associate  that it shall use the proceeds of the advance for the purposes described  in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Terms and conditions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Subject to the provisions of  this paragraph (c), a Bank, in its discretion, shall determine whether,  and on what terms, it will make advances to a housing associate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Advance pricing. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A Bank shall price advances to housing  associates in accordance with the requirements for pricing advances to  members set forth in Sec. 1266.3(b). Wherever the term ``member''  appears in Sec. 1266.3(b), the term shall be construed also to mean  ``housing associate.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A Bank shall apply the pricing criteria identified in Sec.  1266.5(b)(2) equally to all of its member and housing associate  borrowers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Limit on advances. The principal amount of any advance made to a  housing associate may not exceed 90 percent of the unpaid principal of  the mortgage loans or securities pledged as security for the advance.  This limit does not apply to an advance made to a housing associate  under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transaction accounts.

A Bank may, from time to time,  require a housing associate to provide evidence that it continues to  satisfy all of the eligibility requirements of the Bank Act, this  subpart and part 1264 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Loss of eligibility. A Bank shall not extend a new advance or  renew an existing advance to a housing associate that no longer meets  the eligibility requirements of the Bank Act, this subpart and part 1264  of this chapter until the entity has provided evidence satisfactory to  the Bank that it is in compliance with such requirements.
