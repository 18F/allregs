                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> NOX allowance transfer deadline. The NOX  allowances are available to be deducted for compliance with a unit's  NOX Budget emissions limitation for a control period in a  given year only if the NOX allowances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Were allocated for a control period in a prior year or the same  year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Are held in the unit's compliance account, or the overdraft  account of the source where the unit is located, as of the  NOX allowance transfer deadline for that control period or  are transferred into the compliance account or overdraft account by a  NOX allowance transfer correctly submitted for recordation  under Sec. 97.60 by the NOX allowance transfer deadline for  that control period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Deductions for compliance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Following the recordation, in  accordance with Sec. 97.61, of NOX allowance transfers  submitted for recordation in the unit's compliance account or the  overdraft account of the source where the unit is located by the  NOX allowance transfer deadline for a control period, the  Administrator will deduct NOX allowances available under  paragraph (a) of this section to cover the unit's NOX  emissions (as determined in accordance with subpart H of this part), or  to account for actual heat input under Sec. 97.42(e), for the control  period:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> From the compliance account; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Only if no more NOX allowances available under  paragraph (a) of this section remain in the compliance account, from the  overdraft account. In deducting allowances for units at the source from  the overdraft account, the Administrator will begin with the unit having  the compliance account with the lowest account number and end with the  unit having the compliance account with the highest account number (with  account numbers sorted beginning with the left-most character and ending  with the right-most character and the letter characters assigned values  in alphabetical order and less than all numeric characters).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator will deduct NOX allowances first  under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and then under paragraph  (b)(1)(ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Until the number of NOX allowances deducted for the  control period equals the number of tons of NOX emissions,  determined in accordance with subpart H of this part, from the unit for  the control period for which compliance is being determined, plus the  number of NOX allowances required for deduction to account  for actual heat input under Sec. 97.42(e) for the control period; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Until no more NOX allowances available under  paragraph (a) of this section remain in the respective account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification of NOX allowances by serial number. The  NOX authorized   account representative for each compliance account may identify by  serial number the NOX allowances to be deducted from the  unit's compliance account under paragraph (b), (d), (e), or (f) of this  section. Such identification shall be made in the compliance  certification report submitted in accordance with Sec. 97.30.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> First-in, first-out. The Administrator will deduct  NOX allowances for a control period from the compliance  account, in the absence of an identification or in the case of a partial  identification of NOX allowances by serial number under  paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or the overdraft account on a first- in, first-out (FIFO) accounting basis in the following order:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Those NOX allowances that were allocated for the  control period to the unit under subpart E or I of this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Those NOX allowances that were allocated for the  control period to any unit and transferred and recorded in the account  pursuant to subpart G of this part, in order of their date of  recordation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Those NOX allowances that were allocated for a  prior control period to the unit under subpart E or I of this part; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Those NOX allowances that were allocated for a prior  control period to any unit and transferred and recorded in the account  pursuant to subpart G of this part, in order of their date of  recordation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Deductions for excess emissions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After making the deductions  for compliance under paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator  will deduct from the unit's compliance account or the overdraft account  of the source where the unit is located a number of NOX  allowances, allocated for a control period after the control period in  which the unit has excess emissions, equal to three times the number of  the unit's excess emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the compliance account or overdraft account does not contain  sufficient NOX allowances, the Administrator will deduct the  required number of NOX allowances, regardless of the control  period for which they were allocated, whenever NOX allowances  are recorded in either account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any allowance deduction required under paragraph (d) of this  section shall not affect the liability of the owners and operators of  the NOX Budget unit for any fine, penalty, or assessment, or  their obligation to comply with any other remedy, for the same  violation, as ordered under the Clean Air Act or applicable State law.  The following guidelines will be followed in assessing fines, penalties  or other obligations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of determining the number of days of violation, if  a NOX Budget unit has excess emissions for a control period,  each day in the control period (153 days) constitutes a day in violation  unless the owners and operators of the unit demonstrate that a lesser  number of days should be considered.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each ton of excess emissions is a separate violation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Deductions for units sharing a common stack. In the case of  units sharing a common stack and having emissions that are not  separately monitored or apportioned in accordance with subpart H of this  part:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The NOX authorized account representative of the  units may identify the percentage of NOX allowances to be  deducted from each such unit's compliance account to cover the unit's  share of NOX emissions from the common stack for a control  period. Such identification shall be made in the compliance  certification report submitted in accordance with Sec. 97.30.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> of this section, the  Administrator will deduct NOX allowances for each such unit  until the number of NOX allowances deducted equals the unit's  identified percentage under paragraph (e)(1) of this section or, if no  percentage is identified, an equal percentage for each unit multiplied  by the number of tons of NOX emissions, as determined in  accordance with subpart H of this part, from the common stack for the  control period for which compliance is being determined. In addition to  the deductions under the first sentence of this paragraph (e)(1), the  Administrator will deduct NOX allowances for each such unit  until the number of NOX allowances deducted equals the number  of NOX allowances required to   account for actual heat input under Sec. 97.42(e) for the unit for the  control period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(3)</em> of this section shall be read to  include respectively: A compliance account or compliance accounts  established under such State NOX Budget Trading Program; an  overdraft account or overdraft accounts established under such State  NOX Budget Trading Program; a general account or general  accounts established under such State NOX Budget Trading  Program; the State or portion of a State covered by such State  NOX Budget Trading Program; and the trading program budget of  the State or portion of a State covered by such State NOX  Budget Trading Program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Administrator will determine the total number of banked  NOX allowances held in compliance accounts, overdraft  accounts, or general accounts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the total number of banked NOX allowances  determined, under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, to be held in  compliance accounts, overdraft accounts, or general accounts is less  than or equal to 10 percent of the sum of the trading program budgets  under Sec. 97.40 for all States for the control period, any banked  NOX allowance may be deducted for compliance in accordance  with paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the total number of banked NOX allowances  determined, under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, to be held in  compliance accounts, overdraft accounts, or general accounts exceeds 10  percent of the sum of the trading program budgets under Sec. 97.40 for  all States for the control period, any banked allowance may be deducted  for compliance in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (e) of this  section, except as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Administrator will determine the following ratio: 0.10  multiplied by the sum of the trading program budgets under Sec. 97.40  for all States for the control period and divided by the total number of  banked NOX allowances determined, under paragraph (f)(1) of  this section, to be held in compliance accounts, overdraft accounts, or  general accounts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Administrator will multiply the number of banked  NOX allowances in each compliance account or overdraft  account by the ratio determined under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this  section. The resulting product is the number of banked NOX  allowances in the account that may be deducted for compliance in  accordance with paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. Any banked  NOX allowances in excess of the resulting product may be  deducted for compliance in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (e) of  this section, except that, if such NOX allowances are used to  make a deduction under paragraph (b) or (e) of this section, two (rather  than one) such NOX allowances shall authorize up to one ton  of NOX emissions during the control period and must be  deducted for each deduction of one NOX allowance required  under paragraph (b) or (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Recordation of deductions. The Administrator will record in the  appropriate compliance account or overdraft account all deductions from  such an account pursuant to paragraph (b), (d), (e), or (f) of this  section.
