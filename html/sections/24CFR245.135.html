Such sanctions may include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Debarment. A person who is debarred is prohibited from future participation in federal programs for a period of time. The specific rules and regulations relating to debarment are found at 2 CFR part 2424.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Suspension. Suspension is a temporary action with the same effect as debarment, to be taken when there is adequate evidence that a cause for debarment may exist and immediate action is needed to protect the public interest. The specific rules and regulations relating to suspension are found at 2 CFR part 2424.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Limited Denial of Participation. An LDP generally excludes a person from future participation in the federal program under which the cause arose. The duration of an LDP is generally up to 12 months. The specific rules and regulations relating to LDPs are found at 2 CFR part 2424, subpart J.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> These sanctions may also apply to affiliates (as defined in 2 CFR part 2424) of these persons or entities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The procedures in 2 CFR part 2424 shall apply to actions under this subpart.
