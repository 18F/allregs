A charter for a Federal mutual savings bank shall substitute the term ``savings bank'' for ``association.'' The term ``trustee'' may be substituted for the term ``director.'' Associations adopting this charter with existing borrower members must grandfather those borrower members who were members as of the date of issuance of the new charter by the Office. Such borrowers shall have one vote for the period of time such borrowings are in existence.</p><p class="depth0">Federal Mutual Charter</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Corporate title.

The purpose of the association is to pursue any or all of the lawful objectives of a Federal mutual savings association chartered under section 5 of the Home Owners' Loan Act and to exercise all the express, implied, and incidental powers conferred thereby and by all acts amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto, subject to the Constitution and laws of the United States as they are now in effect, or as they may hereafter be amended, and subject to all lawful and applicable rules, regulations, and orders of the Office of Thrift Supervision (``Office'').</p><p class="depth0">Section 5. Capital. The association may raise capital by accepting payments on savings and demand accounts and by any other means authorized by the Office.</p><p class="depth0">Section 6. Members. All holders of the association's savings, demand, or other authorized accounts are members of the association. In the consideration of all questions requiring action by the members of the association, each holder of an account shall be permitted to cast one vote for each $100, or fraction thereof, of the withdrawal value of the member's account.

The authorized number of directors shall not be fewer than five nor more than fifteen persons, as fixed in the association's bylaws, except that the number of directors may be decreased to a number less than five or increased to a number greater than fifteen with the prior approval of the Director of the Office or his or her delegate.</p><p class="depth0">Section 8.
