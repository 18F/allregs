                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Article 5 of the Convention mandates that each  participating nation shall take, insofar as possible, the appropriate  legal, scientific, technical, administrative, and financial measures  necessary for the identification, protection, conservation,  preservation, and rehabilitation of properties of outstanding universal  value; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Title IV of Pub. L. 96-515 requires that no non-Federal property  may be nominated to the World Heritage List unless its owner concurs in  writing to such nomination. The nomination document for each property  must include evidence of such legal protections as may be necessary to  ensure preservation of the property and its environment, including, for  example, restrictive covenants, easements, and other forms of protection  (16 U.S.C. 470a-1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Protection Measures for Public Properties. For properties owned  or controlled by Federal, State, and/or local governments, the following  items satisfy the protection requirements outlined in paragraph (a) of  this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Written concurrence by the owner prior to nomination;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The nomination document must include reference to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All legislation establishing or preserving the area; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All existing and proposed administrative measures, including  management plans, that would ensure continued satisfactory maintenance  of the property and its environment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A written statement by the owner(s) that such protection  measures satisfy the requirements outlined in (a) above.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Protection Measures for Private Properties. For properties owned  or controlled by private organizations or individuals, the following  items satisfy the protection requirements outlined in (a) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A written covenant executed by the owner(s) prohibiting, in  perpetuity, any use that is not consistent with, or which threatens or  damages the property's universally significant values, or other trust or  legal arrangement that has that effect; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The opinion of counsel on the legal status and enforcement of  such a prohibition, including, but not limited to, enforceability by the  Federal government or by interested third parties.  In addition, if the owner(s) is willing, a right of first refusal may be  given for acquisition of the property, along with a guaranteed source of  funding and appropriate management framework, in the event of any  proposed sale, succession, voluntary or involuntary transfer, or in the  unlikely event that the requirements outlined above prove to be  inadequate to ensure the preservation of the property's outstanding  universal value. The protection measures for each private property being  considered for possible nomination to the World Heritage List will be  reviewed on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the requirements set  forth above fulfill the mandate of Pub. L. 96-515.</p>
