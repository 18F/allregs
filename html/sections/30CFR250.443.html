                            <p class="depth0">All BOP systems must include the following associated systems and  related equipment:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An automatic backup to the primary accumulator-charging system.  The power source must be independent from the power source for the  primary accumulator-charging system. The independent power source must  possess sufficient capability to close and hold closed all BOP  components.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At least two BOP control stations. One station must be on the  drilling floor. You must locate the other station in a readily  accessible location away from the drilling floor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Side outlets on the BOP stack for separate kill and choke lines.  If your stack does not have side outlets, you must install a drilling  spool with side outlets.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A choke and a kill line on the BOP stack. You must equip each  line with two full-opening valves, one of which must be remote- controlled. For a subsea BOP system, both valves in each line must be  remote-controlled. In addition:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must install the choke line above the bottom ram;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may install the kill line below the bottom ram; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For a surface BOP system, on the kill line you may install a  check valve and a manual valve instead of the remote-controlled valve.  To use this configuration, both manual valves must be readily accessible  and you must install the check valve between the manual valves and the  pump.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A fill-up line above the uppermost BOP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Locking devices installed on the ram-type BOPs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A wellhead assembly with a rated working pressure that exceeds  the maximum anticipated wellhead pressure.
