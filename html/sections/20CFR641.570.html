                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Individual time limit. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Eligible individuals may participate  in the program for a maximum duration of 48 months in the aggregate  (whether or not consecutive), from the later of July 1, 2007, or the  date of the individual's enrollment in the program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At the time of enrollment, the grantee or sub-recipient must  inform the participant of this time limit and the possible extension  available under paragraph (b) of this section, and the grantee or sub- recipient must provide for a system to transition participants to  unsubsidized employment or other assistance before the maximum  enrollment duration has expired. Provisions for transition must be  reflected in the participant's IEP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If requested by a grantee or sub-recipient, the Department will  authorize an extension for individuals who meet the criteria in  paragraph (b) of this section. Notwithstanding any individual extensions  granted, grantees and sub-recipients must ensure that projects do not  exceed the overall average participation cap for all participants, as  described in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Increased periods of individual participation. If requested by a  grantee, the Department will authorize increased periods of  participation for individuals who:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Have a severe disability;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Are frail or are age 75 or older;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Meet the eligibility requirements related to age for, but do not  receive, benefits under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.  401 et seq.);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Live in an area with persistent unemployment and are individuals  with severely limited employment prospects; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Have limited English proficiency or low literacy skills.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Average grantee participation cap. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notwithstanding any  individual extension authorized under paragraph (b) of this section,  each grantee must manage its SCSEP project in such a way that the  grantee does not exceed an average participation cap for all  participants of 27 months (in the aggregate).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A grantee may request, and the Department may authorize, an  extended average participation period of up to 36 months (in the  aggregate) for a particular project area in a given Program Year if the  Department determines that extenuating circumstances exist to justify an  extension, due to one more of the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> High rates of unemployment or of poverty or of participation in  the program of block grants to States for temporary assistance for needy  families established under part A of title IV of the Social Security  Act, in the areas served by a grantee, relative to other areas of the  State involved or the Nation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Significant downturns in the economy of an area served by the  grantee or in the national economy;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Significant numbers or proportions of participants with one or  more barriers to employment, including ``most-in-need'' individuals  described in Sec. 641.710(a)(6), served by a grantee relative to such  numbers or proportions for grantees serving other areas of the State or  Nation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Changes in Federal, State, or local minimum wage requirements;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Limited economies of scale for the provision of community  service employment and other authorized activities in the areas served  by the grantee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of the average participation cap, each grantee will  be considered to be one project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Authorized break in participation. On occasion a participant  takes an authorized break in participation from the program, such as a  formal leave of absence necessitated by personal circumstances or a  break caused because a suitable community service assignment is not  available. Such an authorized break, if taken under a formal grantee  policy allowing such breaks and formally entered into the SCSEP  Performance and Results Quarterly Performance Reporting (SPARQ) system,  will not count toward the individual time limit described in paragraph  (a) or the average participation cap described in paragraph (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Administrative guidance. The Department will issue  administrative guidance detailing the process by which a grantee may  request increased   periods of individual participation, and the process by which a grantee  may request an extension of the average participation cap. The process  will require that the determination of individual participant extension  requests is made in a fair and equitable manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Grantee authority. Grantees may limit the time of participation  for individuals to less than the 48 months described in paragraph (a) of  this section, if the grantee uniformly applies the lower participation  limit, and if the grantee submits a description of the lower  participation limit policy in its grant application or modification of  the grant and the Department approves the policy. (OAA Sec. Sec.  502(b)(1)(C), 518(a)(3)(B)).</p>
