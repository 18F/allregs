                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The determination of the number of seeds, bulblets, or tubers of individual noxious weeds present per unit weight should be made on at least the minimum quantities listed in Sec. 201.46 Table 1: Provided, That if the following indicated numbers of a single kind of seed, bulblet, or tuber are found in the pure seed analysis (or noxious-weed seed examination of a like amount) the occurrence of that kind in the remainder of the bulk examined for noxious-weed seeds need not be noted: \1/2\-gram purity working sample, 16 or more seeds; 1-gram purity working sample, 23 or more seeds; 2-gram purity working sample or larger, 30 or more seeds. The seeds per unit weight shall be based on the number of single seeds. The number of individual seeds shall be determined in burs of sandbur (Cenchrus spp.) and cocklebur (Xanthium spp.); in capsules of dodder (Cuscuta spp.); in berries of groundcherry, horsenettle, and nightshade (Solanaceae); and in the fruits of other noxious weeds that contain more than one seed. Refer to Secs. 201.50 and 201.51(b)(4) for the classification of weed seeds and inert matter, respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A noxious-weed seed examination of coated seed samples shall be made by examining approximately 25,000 units obtained in accordance with Sec. 201.46(d) and which have been de-coated by the method described in Sec. 201.51b(c).
