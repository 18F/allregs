This defect will manifest itself  primarily as a fall in arterial oxygen tension either at rest or during  exercise. No blood-gas study shall be performed if medically  contraindicated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A blood-gas study shall initially be administered at rest and in  a sitting position.

If an exercise blood-gas test is administered, blood shall be drawn  during exercise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any report of a blood-gas study submitted in connection with a  claim shall specify:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Date and time of test;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Altitude and barometric pressure at which the test was  conducted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Name and DOL claim number of the claimant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Name of technician;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Name and signature of physician supervising the study;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The recorded values for PC02, P02, and PH, which have been  collected simultaneously (specify values at rest and, if performed,  during exercise);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Duration and type of exercise;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Pulse rate at the time the blood sample was drawn;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Time between drawing of sample and analysis of sample; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Whether equipment was calibrated before and after each test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> for any blood gas study administered  during a hospitalization which ends in the miner's death.</p>
