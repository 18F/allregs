                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A facility can demonstrate freedom from VHS through negative  testing results provided by an approved laboratory. Testing must meet  the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be conducted with a sample size that provides for a 95 percent  confidence level of detecting a 2 percent prevalence of infection in the  facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Facilities with cultured fish of VHS-regulated species which can  document a 2-year history of negative testing for VHS virus, can conduct  testing at a sampling level to provide a 95 percent confidence level of  detecting a 5 percent prevalence of infection in the facility. Such  testing must be conducted twice a year, with at least 3 months between  tests.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Facilities with cultured fish of VHS-regulated species which  can document a 4-year history of negative testing for VHS virus can  conduct testing at a sampling level to provide a 95 percent confidence  level of detecting a 10 percent prevalence of infection in the   facility. Such testing must be conducted twice a year, with at least 3  months between tests.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Such facilities must be on a secure water source, and document  that any VHS-regulated species in the facility that originated in VHS- regulated States or Canadian provinces originate from facilities of the  same or higher health status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include virus isolation or other assays authorized by the  Administrator, using appropriate cell lines to detect VHS virus, if  present. All suspect VHS cytopathic effects must be positively  identified as VHS through molecular assays and/or genetic sequencing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use proportional numbers of each VHS-regulated fish species  which might be present in the facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Be conducted at water temperatures between 50 and 72 [deg]F, or  at other times or under environmental conditions when VHS is most likely  to be detected, if present.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When APHIS adds a new species to the list of VHS-regulated  species after a facility has been determined to be free of VHS in  accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the facility must conduct  additional testing on fish of the newly listed species, if present in  the facility, and the fish must be free of VHS virus for the facility to  retain its free status. VHS testing must be conducted on each newly  listed species with a sample size that provides for a 95 percent  confidence level of detecting a 2 percent prevalence of infection in the  facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For VHS-regulated fish maintained on a secure water source, test  results will be valid for 6 months from the date of sample collection  provided that no fish of a lesser or unknown health status are  introduced into the facility. Test results for fish held on a water  source that is not a secure water source will be valid for 30 days from  the date of sample collection.</p>
