                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The provisions of this section relate to allotment separations and station separations. Petitions to amend the Table of Allotments (Sec.  73.606(b)) (other than those also expressly requesting amendment of this section or Sec.  73.609) will be dismissed and all applications for new TV broadcast stations or for changes in the transmitter sites of existing stations will not be accepted for filing if they fail to comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2">Note: Licensees and permittees of television broadcast stations which were operating on April 14, 1952 pursuant to one or more separations below those set forth in Sec.  73.610 may continue to so operate, but in no event may they further reduce the separations below the minimum. As the existing separations of such stations are increased, the new separations will become the required minimum separations until separations are reached which comply with the requirements of Sec.  73.610. Thereafter, the provisions of said section shall be applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Minimum co-channel allotment and station separations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>
