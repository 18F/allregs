                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The deductions allowable are specified in section 832(c) and by  reason   of the provisions of section 832(c)(10) and (12) include in addition  certain deductions provided in sections 161, and 241 and following. The  deductions, however, are subject to the limitation provided in section  265, relating to expenses and interest in respect of tax-exempt income.  The net operating loss deduction is computed under section 172 and the  regulations thereunder. For the purposes of section 172, relating to net  operating loss deduction, ``gross income'' shall mean gross income as  defined in section 832(b)(1) and the allowable deductions shall be those  allowed by section 832(c) with the exceptions and limitations set forth  in section 172(d). In addition to the deduction for capital losses  provided in subchapter P (section 1201 and following), chapter 1 of the  Code, insurance companies are allowed a deduction for losses from  capital assets sold or exchanged in order to obtain funds to meet  abnormal insurance losses and to provide for the payment of dividends  and similar distributions to policyholders. A special rule is provided  for the application of the capital loss carryover provisions of section  1212. The deduction is the same as that allowed mutual insurance  companies subject to the tax imposed by section 821; see section  822(c)(6) and the regulations thereunder. Insurance companies, other  than mutual fire insurance companies described in Sec. 1.831-1, are  also allowed a deduction for dividends and similar distributions paid or  declared to policyholders in their capacity as such. The deduction is  otherwise the same as that allowed mutual insurance companies subject to  the tax imposed by section 821; see section 823(2) and the regulations  thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Among the items which may not be deducted are income and profits  taxes imposed by the United States, income and profits taxes imposed by  any foreign country or possession of the United States (in cases where  the company chooses to claim to any extent a credit for such taxes),  taxes assessed against local benefits, decrease during the year due to  adjustments in the book value of capital assets, decrease in liabilities  during the year on account of reinsurance treaties, dividends paid to  shareholders in their capacity as such, remittances to the home office  of a foreign insurance company by the United States branch, and borrowed  money repaid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In computing taxable income of insurance companies, losses  sustained during the taxable year from the sale or other disposition of  property are deductible subject to the limitation contained in section  1211. Insurance companies are entitled to the alternative taxes provided  in section 1201.  [T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11814, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6867, 30 FR  15094, Dec. 12, 1965]</p>
