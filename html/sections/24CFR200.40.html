                            <p class="depth0">The following fees apply to mortgages to be insured under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application fee--SAMA letter (for new construction). An  application fee of $1 per thousand dollars of the requested mortgage  shall accompany the application for a SAMA letter. An additional fee of  $1 per thousand dollars of the requested mortgage amount shall be  charged for the review of plans and specifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application fee--feasibility letter (for substantial  rehabilitation). An application fee of $3 per thousand dollars of the  requested mortgage amount shall accompany the application for a  feasibility letter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application fee--conditional commitment. For a mortgage being  insured under section 223(f) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1715n), an  application-commitment fee of $3 per thousand dollars of the requested  mortgage amount shall accompany an application for conditional  commitment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application fee--firm commitment: General. An application for  firm commitment shall be accompanied by an application-commitment fee  which, when added to any prior fees received in connection with  applications for a SAMA letter or a feasibility letter, will aggregate  $5 per thousand dollars of the requested mortgage amount to be insured.  The payment of an application-commitment fee shall not be required in  connection with an insured mortgage involving the sale by the government  of housing or property acquired, held, or contracted pursuant to the  Atomic Energy Community Act of 1955 (42 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Inspection fee--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The firm commitment may provide  for the payment of an inspection fee in an amount not to exceed $5 per  thousand dollars of the commitment. If an inspection fee is required, it  shall be paid as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the case involves insurance of advances, at the time of  initial endorsement; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the case involves insurance upon completion, before the date  construction is begun.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Existing projects. For a mortgage being insured under section  223(f) of the Act, if the application provides for the completion of  repairs, replacements and/or improvements (repairs), the Commissioner  will charge an inspection fee equal to one percent (1%) of the cost of  the repairs. However, where the Commissioner determines the cost of  repairs is minimal, the Commissioner may establish a minimum inspection  fee that exceeds one percent of the cost of repairs and can periodically  increase or decrease this minimum fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Fees on increases--in general. This section applies to all  applications except applications involving hospitals, which are covered  in 24 CFR part 242.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Increase in firm commitment before endorsement. An application,  filed before initial endorsement (or before endorsement in a case  involving insurance upon completion), for an increase in the amount of  an outstanding firm commitment, shall be accompanied by a combined  additional application and commitment fee. This combined additional fee  shall be in an amount that will aggregate $5 per thousand dollars of the  amount of the requested increase. If an inspection fee was required in  the original commitment, an additional inspection fee shall be paid in  an amount computed at the same dollar rate per thousand dollars of the  amount of increase in commitment as was used for the inspection fee  required in the original commitment. When insurance of advances is  involved, the additional inspection fee shall be paid at the time of  initial endorsement. When insurance upon completion is involved, the  additional inspection fee shall be paid before the date construction is  begun; or, if construction has begun, it shall be paid with the  application for increase.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Increase in mortgage between initial and final endorsement. Upon  the filing of an application between initial and final endorsement, for  an increase in the amount of the mortgage, either by amendment or by  substitution of a new mortgage, a combined additional application and  commitment fee shall accompany the application. This combined additional  fee shall be in an amount that will aggregate $5 per thousand dollars of  the amount of the increase requested. If an inspection fee was required  in the original commitment, an additional inspection fee shall accompany  the application in an amount not to exceed the $5 per thousand dollars  of the amount of the increase requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Loan to cover operating losses. In connection with a loan to  cover operating losses (see Sec. 200.22), a combined application and  commitment fee of $5 per thousand dollars of the amount of the loan  applied for shall be submitted with the application for a firm  commitment. No inspection fee shall be required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reopening of expired commitments. An expired commitment may be  reopened if a request for reopening is received by the Commissioner  within 90   days of the expiration of the commitment. The reopening request shall be  accompanied by a fee of 50 cents per thousand dollars of the amount of  the expired commitment. If the reopening request is not received by the  Commissioner within the required 90-day period, a new application,  accompanied by the required application and commitment fee, must be  submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Transfer fee. Upon application for the approval of a transfer of  physical assets or the substitution of mortgagors, a transfer fee of 50  cents per thousand dollars shall be paid on the original face amount of  the mortgage in all cases, except that a transfer fee shall not be paid  where both parties to the transfer transaction are nonprofit purchasers,  or when the transfer of physical assets or the substitution of  mortgagors occurs contemporaneously with the restructuring of a mortgage  pursuant to a restructuring plan under part 401, subpart C of this  title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Refund of fees. If the amount of the commitment issued or  increase in mortgage granted is less than the amount applied for, the  Commissioner shall refund the excess amount of the application and  commitment fees submitted by the applicant. If an application is  rejected before it is assigned for processing, or in such other  instances as the Commissioner may determine, the entire application and  commitment fee or any portion thereof may be returned to the applicant.  Commitment, inspection and reopening fees may be refunded, in whole or  in part, if it is determined by the Commissioner that there is a lack of  need for the housing or that the construction or financing of the  project has been prevented because of condemnation proceedings or other  legal action taken by a governmental body or public agency, or in such  other instances as the Commissioner may determine. A transfer fee may be  refunded only in such instances as the Commissioner may determine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Fees not required. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The payment of an application,  commitment, inspection, or reopening fee shall not be required in  connection with the insurance of a mortgage involving the sale by the  Secretary of any property acquired under any section or title of the  Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The payment of an application or commitment fee shall not be  required in connection with the insurance of a mortgage used to  facilitate a restructuring plan under part 401, subpart C of this title.  [61 FR 14414, Apr. 1, 1996, as amended at 72 FR 66037, Nov. 26, 2007; 72  FR 67545, Nov. 28, 2007]</p>
