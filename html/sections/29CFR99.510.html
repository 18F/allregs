                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Audit findings reported. The auditor shall report the following as audit findings in a schedule of findings and questioned costs:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reportable conditions in internal control over major programs. The auditor's determination of whether a deficiency in internal control is a reportable condition for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program or an audit objective identified in the compliance supplement. The auditor shall identify reportable conditions which are individually or cumulatively material weaknesses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Material noncompliance with the provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements related to a major program. The auditor's determination of whether a noncompliance with the provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements is material for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program or an audit objective identified in the compliance supplement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Known questioned costs which are greater than $10,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program. Known questioned costs are those specifically identified by the auditor. In evaluating the effect of questioned costs on the opinion on compliance, the auditor considers the best estimate of total costs questioned (likely questioned costs), not just the questioned costs specifically identified (known questioned costs). The auditor shall also report known questioned costs when likely questioned costs are greater than $10,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program. In reporting questioned costs, the auditor shall include information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the questioned costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Known questioned costs which are greater than $10,000 for a Federal program which is not audited as a major program. Except for audit follow-up, the auditor is not required under this part to perform audit procedures for such a Federal program; therefore, the auditor will normally not find questioned costs for a program which is not audited as a major program. However, if the auditor does become aware of questioned costs for a Federal program which is not audited as a major program (e.g., as part of audit follow-up or other audit procedures) and the known questioned costs are greater than $10,000, then the auditor shall report this as an audit finding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The circumstances concerning why the auditor's report on compliance for major programs is other than an unqualified opinion, unless such circumstances are otherwise reported as audit findings in the schedule of findings and questioned costs for Federal awards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Known fraud affecting a Federal award, unless such fraud is otherwise reported as an audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs for Federal awards. This paragraph does not require the auditor to make an additional reporting when the auditor confirms that the fraud was reported outside of the auditor's reports under the direct reporting requirements of GAGAS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Instances where the results of audit follow-up procedures disclosed that the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with Sec. 99.315(b) materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Audit finding detail. Audit findings shall be presented in sufficient detail for the auditee to prepare a corrective action plan and take corrective action and for Federal agencies and pass-through entities to arrive at a management decision. The following specific information shall be included, as applicable, in audit findings:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Federal program and specific Federal award identification including the CFDA title and number, Federal award

number and year, name of Federal agency, and name of the applicable pass-through entity. When information, such as the CFDA title and number or Federal award number, is not available, the auditor shall provide the best information available to describe the Federal award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The criteria or specific requirement upon which the audit finding is based, including statutory, regulatory, or other citation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The condition found, including facts that support the deficiency identified in the audit finding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Identification of questioned costs and how they were computed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the audit findings, such as whether the audit findings represent an isolated instance or a systemic problem. Where appropriate, instances identified shall be related to the universe and the number of cases examined and be quantified in terms of dollar value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The possible asserted effect to provide sufficient information to the auditee and Federal agency, or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient, to permit them to determine the cause and effect to facilitate prompt and proper corrective action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Recommendations to prevent future occurrences of the deficiency identified in the audit finding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Views of responsible officials of the auditee when there is disagreement with the audit findings, to the extent practical.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reference numbers. Each audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs shall include a reference number to allow for easy referencing of the audit findings during follow-up.</p>
