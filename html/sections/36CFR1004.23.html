Provided however, that if State law that applies to operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol establishes more restrictive limits of alcohol concentration in the operator's blood or breath, those limits supersede the limits specified in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section also apply to an operator who is or has been legally entitled to use alcohol or another drug.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Tests. (1) At the request or direction of an authorized person who has probable cause to believe that an operator of a motor vehicle within the area administered by the Presidio Trust has violated a provision of paragraph (a) of this section, the operator shall submit to one or more tests of the blood, breath, saliva or urine for the purpose of determining blood alcohol and drug content.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At the request or direction of an authorized person who has probable cause to believe that an operator of a motor vehicle within the area administered by the Presidio Trust has violated a provision of paragraph (a) of this section, the operator shall submit to one or more tests of the blood, breath, saliva or urine for the purpose of determining blood alcohol and drug content.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Refusal by an operator to submit to a test is prohibited and proof of refusal may be admissible in any related judicial proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any test or tests for the presence of alcohol and drugs shall be determined by and administered at the direction of an authorized person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any test shall be conducted by using accepted scientific methods and equipment of proven accuracy and reliability operated by personnel certified in its use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Presumptive levels.
