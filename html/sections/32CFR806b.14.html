                            <p class="depth0">Consider a request from an individual for his or her own records in  a system of records under both the Freedom of Information Act and the  Privacy Act regardless of the Act cited. The requester does not need to  cite either Act if the records they want are contained in a system of  records. Process the request under whichever Act gives the most  information. When necessary, tell the requester which Act you used and  why.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requesters should describe the records they want. They do not  have to name a system of records number, but they should at least name a  type of record or functional area. For requests that ask for ``all  records about me,'' ask for more information and tell the person how to  review the Air Force systems of records published in the Federal  Register or at http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy/notices/usaf.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requesters should not use government equipment, supplies,  stationery, postage, telephones, or official mail channels for making  Privacy Act requests. System managers will process such requests and  tell requesters that using government resources to make Privacy Act  requests is not authorized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Tell the requester if a record exists and how to review the  record. If possible, respond to requests within 10 workdays of receipt.  If you cannot answer the request in 10 workdays, send a letter  explaining why and give an approximate completion date no more than 20  workdays after the first office received the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Show or give a copy of the record to the requester within 30  workdays of receiving the request unless the system is exempt and the  Air Force lists the exemption in appendix D to this part; or it is  published in this section; or published as a final rule in the Federal  Register. Give information in a form the requester can understand. If  the system is exempt under the Privacy Act, provide any parts releasable  under the Freedom of Information Act, with appeal rights (See subpart F  of this part), citing appropriate exemptions from the Privacy Act and  the Freedom of Information Act, if applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the requester wants another person present during the record  review, the system manager may ask for written consent to authorize  discussing the record with another person present.</p>
