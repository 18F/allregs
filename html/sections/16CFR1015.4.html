The Secretary or delegate of the Secretary may respond directly or forward the request to any other office of the Commission for response. In any case where the Secretary or delegate of the

Secretary in his/her discretion determines that a request for an identifiable record should be initially determined by the Commission, the Secretary, or the delegate of the Secretary, may certify the matter to the Commission for a decision. In that event the Commission decision shall be made within the time limits set forth in Sec. 1015.5 and shall be final. The Commission response shall be in the form set forth in Sec. 1015.7(d) for action on appeal. If no response is made by the Commission within twenty working days, or any extension thereof, the requester and the Commission may take the action specified in Sec. 1015.7(e).
