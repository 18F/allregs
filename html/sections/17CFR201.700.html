                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Rules of Practice. For purposes of these Rules of Practice  contained at 17   CFR 201.700 through 201.701, the following Rules of Practice apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rule 103, 17 CFR 201.103 (Construction of Rules);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rule 104, 17 CFR 201.104 (Business Hours); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rule 160, 17 CFR 201.160 (Time Computation).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Institution of proceedings; notice and opportunity to submit  written views--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Generally. If the Commission determines to initiate  proceedings to determine whether a self-regulatory organization's  proposed rule change should be disapproved, it shall provide notice  thereof to the self-regulatory organization that filed the proposed rule  change, as well as all interested parties and the public, by publication  in the Federal Register of the grounds for disapproval under  consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prior to notice. If the Commission determines to institute  proceedings prior to initial publication by the Commission of the notice  of the self-regulatory organization's proposed rule change in the  Federal Register, then the Commission shall publish notice of the  proposed rule change simultaneously with a brief summary of the grounds  for disapproval under consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Subsequent to notice. If the Commission determines to institute  proceedings subsequent to initial publication by the Commission of the  notice of the self-regulatory organization's proposed rule change in the  Federal Register, then the Commission shall publish separately in the  Federal Register a brief summary of the grounds for disapproval under  consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Service of an order instituting proceedings. In addition to  publication in the Federal Register of the grounds for disapproval under  consideration, the Secretary, or another duly authorized officer of the  Commission, shall serve a copy of the grounds for disapproval under  consideration to the self-regulatory organization that filed the  proposed rule change by serving notice to the person listed as the  contact person on the cover page of the Form 19b-4 filing. Notice shall  be made by delivering a copy of the order to such contact person either  by any method specified in 17 CFR 201.141(a) or by electronic means  including e-mail.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration. The  grounds for disapproval under consideration shall include a brief  statement of the matters of fact and law on which the Commission  instituted the proceedings, including the areas in which the Commission  may have questions or may need to solicit additional information on the  proposed rule change. The Commission may consider during the course of  the proceedings additional matters of fact and law beyond what was set  forth in its notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Demonstration of consistency with the Exchange Act. The burden  to demonstrate that a proposed rule change is consistent with the  Exchange Act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder that are  applicable to the self-regulatory organization is on the self-regulatory  organization that proposed the rule change. As reflected in the General  Instructions to Form 19b-4, the Form is designed to elicit information  necessary for the public to provide meaningful comment on the proposed  rule change and for the Commission to determine whether the proposed  rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act and  the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the self-regulatory  organization. The self-regulatory organization must provide all  information elicited by the Form, including the exhibits, and must  present the information in a clear and comprehensible manner. In  particular, the self-regulatory organization must explain why the  proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange  Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the self- regulatory organization. A mere assertion that the proposed rule change  is consistent with those requirements, or that another self-regulatory  organization has a similar rule in place, is not sufficient. Instead,  the description of the proposed rule change, its purpose and operation,  its effect, and a legal analysis of its consistency with applicable  requirements must all be sufficiently detailed and specific to support  an affirmative Commission finding. Any failure of the self-regulatory  organization to provide the information elicited by Form 19b-4   may result in the Commission not having a sufficient basis to make an  affirmative finding that a proposed rule change is consistent with the  Exchange Act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder that are  applicable to the self-regulatory organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conduct of hearings--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initial comment period in writing.  Unless otherwise specified by the Commission in its notice of grounds  for disapproval under consideration, all interested persons will be  given an opportunity to submit written data, views, and arguments  concerning the proposed rule change under consideration and whether the  Commission should approve or disapprove the proposed rule change. The  self-regulatory organization that submitted the proposed rule change may  file a written statement in support of its proposed rule change  demonstrating, in specific detail, how such proposed rule change is  consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and  regulations thereunder applicable to the self-regulatory organization,  including a response to each of the grounds for disapproval under  consideration. Such statement may include specific representations or  undertakings by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission will  specify in the summary of the grounds for disapproval under  consideration the length of the initial comment period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Oral. The Commission, in its sole discretion, may determine  whether any issues relevant to approval or disapproval would be  facilitated by the opportunity for an oral presentation of views.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rebuttal. At the end of the initial comment period, the self- regulatory organization that filed the proposed rule change will be  given an opportunity to respond to any comments received. The self- regulatory organization may voluntarily file, or the Commission may  request a self-regulatory organization to file, a response to a comment  received regarding any aspect of the proposed rule change under  consideration to assist the Commission in determining whether the  proposed rule change should be disapproved. The Commission will specify  in the summary of the grounds for disapproval under consideration the  length of the rebuttal period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Non-response. Any failure by the self-regulatory organization to  provide a complete response, within the applicable time period  specified, to a comment letter received or to the Commission's grounds  for disapproval under consideration may result in the Commission not  having a sufficient basis to make an affirmative finding that a proposed  rule change is consistent with the Exchange Act and the rules and  regulations issued thereunder that are applicable to the self-regulatory  organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Record before the Commission--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Filing of papers with the  Commission. Filing of papers with the Commission shall be made by filing  them with the Secretary, including through electronic means. In its  notice setting forth the grounds for disapproval under consideration for  a proposed rule change, the Commission shall inform interested parties  of the methods by which they may submit written comments and arguments  for or against Commission approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Public availability of materials received. During the conduct of  the proceedings, the Commission generally will make available publicly  all written comments it receives without change. In its notice setting  forth the grounds for disapproval under consideration for a proposed  rule change, the Commission shall inform interested parties of the  methods by which they may view all written communications relating to  the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other  than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the  provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Record before the Commission. The Commission shall determine  each matter on the basis of the record. The record shall consist of the  proposed rule change filed on Form 19b-4 by the self-regulatory  organization, including all attachments and exhibits thereto, and all  written materials received from any interested parties on the proposed  rule change, including the self-regulatory organization that filed the  proposed rule change, through the means identified by the Commission as  provided in paragraph (1), as well as any   written materials that reflect communications between the Commission and  any interested parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Amended notice not required. The Commission is not required to  amend its notice of grounds for disapproval under consideration in order  to consider, during the course of the proceedings, additional matters of  fact and law beyond what was set forth in the notice of the grounds for  disapproval under consideration.
