                                Sec. 1.1445-1  Withholding on dispositions of U.S. real property
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> or 1445(e). Section 1.1445-5  provides rules concerning the withholding required under section  1445(e), while Sec. 1.1445-6 provides for adjustments to the amount  required to be withheld under section 1445(e). Finally, Sec. 1.1445-7  provides rules concerning the treatment of a foreign corporation that  has made an election under section 897(i) to be treated as a domestic  corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Duty to withhold--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Transferees of U.S. real  property interests are required to deduct and withhold a tax equal to 10  percent of the amount realized by the transferor, if the transferor is a  foreign person and the disposition takes place on or after January 1,  1985. Neither the transferee's duty to withhold nor the amount required  to be withheld is affected by the amount of cash to be paid by the  transferee. Amounts withheld must be reported and paid over in  accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.  Failures to withhold and pay over are subject to the liabilities set  forth in paragraph (e) of this section. If two or more persons are joint  transferees of a U.S. real property interest, each such person is  subject to the obligation to withhold. That obligation is fulfilled with  respect to each such person if any one of them withholds and pays over  the required amount in accordance with the rules of this section. If the  amount realized (as defined in paragraph (g)(5) of this section) by the  transferor is zero, then no withholding is required. For example, if a  real property interest is transferred as a gift (i.e, the recipient does  not assume any liabilities or furnish any other consideration to the  transferor) then no withholding is required. Withholding is not required  with respect to dispositions that takes place before January 1, 1985,  even if the first payment of consideration is made after December 31,  1984.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> U.S. real property interest owned jointly by foreign and non- foreign transferors. The amount subject to withholding under paragraph  (b)(1) of this section with respect to the transfer of a U.S. real  property interest owned by one or more foreign persons (as defined in  Sec. 1.897-1(k)) and one or more non-foreign persons shall be determined  by allocating the amount realized from the transfer between (or among)  such transferors based upon the capital contribution of each transferor  with respect to the property and by aggregating the amounts allocated to  any foreign person (or persons). For this purpose, a husband and wife  will each be deemed to have contributed 50 percent of the aggregate  capital contributed by such husband and wife. See Sec. 1.1445- 1(f)(3)(iv) with respect to the crediting of the amount withheld between  or among joint foreign transferors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Options to acquire a U.S. real property interest--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No  withholding on grant of option. No withholding is required under section  1445 with respect to any amount realized by the grantor on the grant of  an option to acquire a U.S. real property interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No withholding upon lapse of option. No withholding is required  under section 1445 with respect to any amount realized by the grantor  upon the lapse of an option to acquire a U.S. real property interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> does  not apply to require withholding upon the initial grant of an option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Withholding required on exercise of option. If the holder  exercises an option to purchase a U.S. real property interest, the  amount paid for the option shall be considered an amount realized by the  grantor/transferor upon the transfer of the property with respect to   which the option was granted, and shall thus be subject to withholding  on the day that such underlying property is transferred. The preceding  sentence applies regardless of whether or not the terms of the option  specifically provide that the option price is applied to the purchase  price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Exceptions and modifications. The duty to withhold under section  1445(a) is subject to the exceptions and modifications contained in  Secs. 1.1445-2 and 1.1445-3. Generally, Sec. 1.1445-2 provides rules for  determining that withholding is not required because either the  transferor is not a foreign person or the interest transferred is not a  U.S. real property interest. In addition, Sec. 1.1445-2 provides  exceptions to the withholding requirement, including a rule that exempts  from withholding any person who acquires a U.S. real property interest  for use as a residence for a contract price of $300,000 or less. If  withholding is required under section 1445(a), Sec. 1.1445-3 allows the  amount withheld to be modified pursuant to a withholding certificate  issued by the Internal Revenue Service. If a transferee cannot withhold  the full amount required because the first payment of consideration for  the transfer does not involve sufficient cash (or other liquid assets  convertible into cash, such as foreign currency), then a withholding  certificate must be obtained pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reporting and paying over of withheld amounts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A  transferee must report and pay over any tax withheld by the 20th day  after the date of the transfer. Forms 8288 and 8288-A are used for this  purpose, and must be filed at the location as provided in the  instructions to Forms 8288 and 8288-A. Pursuant to section 7502 and  regulations thereunder, the timely mailing of Forms 8288 and 8228-A will  be treated as their timely filing. Form 8288-A will be stamped by the  IRS to show receipt, and a stamped copy will be mailed by the IRS to the  transferor (at the address reported on the form) for the transferor's  use. See Secs. 1.1445-1(f) and 1.1445-3(f). Forms 8288 and 8288-A are  required to include the identifying numbers of both the transferor and  the transferee, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. If any  identifying number as required by such forms is not provided, the  transferee must still report and pay over any tax withheld on Form 8288,  although the transferor cannot obtain a credit or refund of tax on the  basis of a Form 8288-A that does not include the transferor's  identifying number (see paragraph (f)(2) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pending application for withholding certificate--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Delayed reporting and payment with respect to application submitted  by transferee. If an application for a withholding certificate with  respect to a transfer of a U.S. real property interest is submitted to  the Internal Revenue Service by the transferee on the day of or at any  time prior to the transfer, the transferee must withhold 10 percent of  the amount realized as required by paragraph (b) of this section.  However, the amount withheld, or a lesser amount as determined by the  Service, need not be reported and paid over to the Service until the  20th day following the Service's final determination with respect to the  application for a withholding certificate. For this purpose, the  Service's final determination occurs on the day when the withholding  certificate is mailed to the transferee by the Service or when a  notification denying the request for a withholding certificate is mailed  to the transferee by the Service. An application is submitted to the  Service on the day it is actually received by the Service at the address  provided in Sec. 1.1445-1(g)(10) or, under the rules of section 7502, on  the day it is mailed to the Service at the address provided in  Sec. 1.1445-1(g)(10).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Delayed reporting and payment with respect to application  submitted by transferor. If an application for a withholding certificate  with respect to a transfer of a U.S. real property interest is submitted  to the Internal Revenue Service by the Transferor on the day of or any  time prior to the transfer, such transferor must provide notice to the  transferee prior to the transfer. No particular form is required but the  notice must set forth the name, address, and taxpayer identification  number of the transferor, a brief description of the property which is  the subject of the application, and the date the application was  submitted to the Service. The   transferee must withhold 10 percent of the amount realized as required  in paragraph (b) of this section but need not report or pay over to the  Service such amount (or a lesser amount as determined by the Service)  until the 20th day following the Service's final determination with  respect to the application. The Service will send a copy of the  withholding certificate or copy of the notification denying the request  for a withholding certificate to the transferee. For this purpose, the  Service's final determination will be deemed to occur on the day when  the copy of the withholding certificate or the copy of the notification  denying the request for a withholding certificate is mailed by the  Service to the transferee (or transferees). An application is submitted  to the Service on the day it is actually received by the Service at the  address provided in Sec. 1.1445-1(g)(10) or, under the rules of  Sec. 7502, on the day it is mailed to the Service at the address  provided in Sec. 1.1445-1(g)(10).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Anti-abuse rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. A transferee that in reliance  upon the rules of this paragraph (c)(2) fails to report and pay over  amounts withheld by the 20th day following the date of the transfer,  shall be subject to the payment of interest and penalties if the  relevant application for a withholding certificate (or an amendment to  the application for a withholding certificate) was submitted for a  principal purpose of delaying the transferee's payment to the IRS of the  amount withheld. Interest and penalties shall be assessed on the amount  that is ultimately paid over (or collected pursuant to the agreement)  with respect to the period between the 20th day after the date of the  transfer and the date on which payment is made (or collected).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Presumption. A principal purpose of delaying payment of the  amount withheld shall be presumed if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The transferee applies for a withholding certificate pursuant to  Sec. 1.1445-3(c) based on a determination of the transferor's maximum  tax liability, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such liability is ultimately determined to be equal to 90  percent or more of the amount that was otherwise required to be withheld  and paid over. However, the presumption created by the previous sentence  may be rebutted by evidence establishing that delaying payment of the  amount withheld was not a principal purpose of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Contents of Forms 8288 and 8288-A--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Transactions subject to  section 1445(a). Any person that is required to file Forms 8288 and  8288-A pursuant to section 1445(a) and the rules of this section must  set forth thereon the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The name, identifying number, and home address (in the case of  an individual) or office address (in the case of any entity) of the  transferee(s) filing the return;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The name, identifying number, and home address (in the case of  an individual) or office address (in the case of any entity) of the  transferor(s);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A brief description of the U.S. real property interest  transferred, including its location and the nature of any substantial  improvements in the case of real property, and the class or type and  amount of interests transferred in the case of interests in a  corporation that constitute U.S. real property interests;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The date of the transfer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The amount realized by the transferor, as defined in paragraph  (g)(5) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The amount withheld by the transferee and whether withholding  is at the statutory or reduced rate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Such other information as the Commissioner may require.</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) (i) and (ii), mailing addresses may  be provided in addition to, but not in lieu of, home addresses or office  addresses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transactions subject to section 1445(e). Any person that is  required to file Forms 8288 and 8288-A pursuant to the rules of  Sec. 1.1445-5 must set forth thereon the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The name, identifying number, and office address of the entity  or fiduciary filing the return;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount withheld by the entity or fiduciary;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The date of the transfer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of a transaction subject to withholding pursuant to  section 1445(e)(1) and Sec. 1.1445-5(c):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A brief description of the U.S. real property interest  transferred, as   described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The name, identifying number, and home address (in the case of  an individual) or office address (in the case of an entity) of each  holder of an interest in the entity that is a foreign person; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Each such interest-holder's pro rata share of the amount  withheld;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In the case of a distribution subject to withholding pursuant to  section 1445(e)(2) and Sec. 1.1445-5(d):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A brief description of the U.S. real property interest  transferred, as described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount of gain recognized upon the distribution by the  corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> In the case of a distribution subject to withholding pursuant  to section 1445(e)(3) and Sec. 1.1445-5(e):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A brief description of the property distributed by the  corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The name, identifying number, and home address (in case of an  individual) or office address (in the case of an entity) of each holder  of an interest in the entity that is a foreign person;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The amount realized upon the distribution by each such foreign  interest holder; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Each foreign interest-holder's pro rata share of the amount  withheld; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Such other information as the Commissioner may require.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Liability of transferee upon failure to withhold--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. Every person required to deduct and withhold tax under section  1445 is made liable for that tax by section 1461. Therefore, a person  that is required to deduct and withhold tax but fails to do so may be  held liable for the payment of the tax and any applicable penalties and  interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transferor's liability not otherwise satisfied--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Tax and  penalties. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, if a  transferee is required to deduct and withhold tax under section 1445 but  fails to do so, then the tax shall be assessed against and collected  from that transferee. Such person may also be subject to any of the  civil and criminal penalties that apply. Corporate officers or other  responsible persons may be subject to a civil penalty under section 6672  equal to the amount that should have been withheld and paid over.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interest. If a transferee is required to deduct and withhold  tax under section 1445 but fails to do so, then such transferee shall be  liable for the payment of interest pursuant to section 6601 and the  regulations thereunder. Interest shall be payable with respect to the  period between--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The last date on which the tax imposed under section 1445 was  required to be paid over by the transferee, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The date on which such tax is actually paid. Interest shall be  payable with respect to the entire amount that is required to be  deducted and withheld. However, if the Service issues a withholding  certificate providing for withholding of a reduced amount, then, for the  period after the issuance of the certificate, interest shall be payable  with respect to that reduced amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Transferor's liability otherwise satisfied--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Tax and  penalties. If a transferee is required to deduct and withhold tax under  section 1445 but fails to do so, and the transferor's tax liability with  respect to the transfer was satisfied (or was established to be zero)  by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The transferor's filing of an income tax return (and payment of  any tax due) with respect to the transfer, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The issuance of a withholding certificate by the Internal  Revenue Service establishing that the transferor's maximum tax liability  is zero,  then the tax required to be withheld under section 1445 shall not be  collected from the transferee. Such transferee's liability for tax, and  the requirement that such person file Forms 8288 and 8288-A, shall be  deemed to have been satisfied as of the date on which the transferor's  income tax return was filed or the withholding certificate was issued.  No penalty shall be imposed on or collected from such person for failure  to return or pay the tax, unless such failure was fraudulent and for the  purpose of evading payment. A transferee that seeks to avoid liability  for tax and penalties pursuant to the rule of paragraph (e)(3)(i) must  provide sufficient information for the Service to determine whether the  transferor's   tax liability was satisfied (or was established to be zero).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interest. If a transferee is required to deduct and withhold  tax under section 1445 but fails to do so, then such person shall be  liable for the payment of interest under section 6601 and regulations  thereunder. Such transferee's liability for the payment of interest  shall not be excused by reason of the deemed satisfaction, pursuant to  subdivision (i) of this paragraph (e)(3), of the transferee's liability  under section 1445, because the deemed satisfaction of that liability is  the equivalent of the late payment of a liability, on which interest  must be paid. Interest shall be payable with respect to the period  between--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The last date on which the tax imposed under section 1445 was  required to be paid over, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The date (established from information supplied to the Service  by the transferee) on which any tax due is paid with respect to the  transferor's relevant income tax return, or the date the withholding  certificate is issued establishing that the transferor's maximum tax  liability is zero.  Interest shall be payable with respect to the entire amount that is  required to be deducted and withheld. However, if the Service issues a  withholding certificate providing for withholding of a reduced amount,  then for the period after the issuance of the certificate interest shall  be payable with respect to that reduced amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Coordination with entity with holding rules. For purposes of  section 1445(e) and Secs. 1.1445-5, 1.1445-6, 1.1445-7, and 1.1445-8T,  the rules of this paragraph (e) shall be applied by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Substituting the words ``person required to withhold'' for the  word ``transferee'' each place it appears in this paragraph (e), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Substituting the words ``person subject to withholding'' for  the word ``transferor'' each place it appears in this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effect of withholding on transferor--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  withholding of tax under section 1445(a) does not excuse a foreign  person that disposes of a U.S. real property interest from filing a U.S.  tax return with respect to the income arising from the disposition. Form  1040NR, 1041, or 1120F, as appropriate, must be filed, and any tax due  must be paid, by the filing deadline generally applicable to such  person. (The return may be filed by such later date as is provided in an  extension granted by the Internal Revenue Service.) Any tax withheld  under section 1445(a) shall be credited against the amount of income tax  as computed in such return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Manner of obtaining credit or refund. A stamped copy of Form  8288-A will be provided to the transferor by the Service (under  paragraph (c) of this section) if the Form 8288-A is complete, including  the transferor's identifying number. Except as provided in paragraph  (f)(3) of this section, a stamped copy of Form 8288-A must be attached  to the transferor's return to establish the amount withheld that is  available as a credit. If the amount withheld under section 1445(a)  constitutes less than the full amount of the transferor's U.S. tax  liability for that taxable year, then a payment of estimated tax may be  required to be made pursuant to section 6154 or 6654 prior to the filing  of the income tax return for that year. Alternatively, if the amount  withheld under section 1445(a) exceeds the transferor's maximum tax  liability with respect to the disposition (as determined by the IRS),  then the transferor may seek an early refund of the excess pursuant to  Sec. 1.1445-3(g), or a normal refund upon the filing of a tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Failure to receive Form 8288-A. If a stamped  copy of Form 8288-A has not been provided to the transferor by the  Service, the transferor may establish the amount of tax withheld by the  transferee by attaching to its return substantial evidence (e.g.,  closing documents) of such amount. Such a transferor must attach to its  return a statement which supplies all of the information required by  Sec. 1.1445-1(d), including the transferor's identifying number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> U.S. persons subjected to withholding. If a transferee  withholds tax under section 1445(a) with respect to a person who is not  a foreign person, such person may credit the amount of any tax withheld  against his income tax liability in accordance with the   provisions of this Sec. 1.1145-1(f) or apply for an early refund under  Sec. 1.1445-3(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Refund in case of installment sale. A transferor that takes  gain into account in accordance with the provisions of section 453 shall  not be entitled to a refund of the amount withheld, unless a withholding  certificate providing for such a refund is obtained from the Internal  Revenue Service pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 1.1445-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Joint foreign transferors. If two or more foreign persons  jointly transfer a U.S. real property interest, each transferor shall be  credited with such portion of the amount withheld as such transferors  mutually agree. Such transferors must request that the transferee  reflect the agreed-upon crediting of the amount withheld on the Forms  8288-A filed by the transferee. If the foreign transferors fail to  request that the transferee reflect the agreed-upon crediting of the  amount withheld by the 10th day after the date of transfer, the  transferee must credit the amount withheld equally between (or among)  the foreign transferors. In such case, the transferee is indemnified  pursuant to section 1461 against any claim by a transferor objecting to  the resulting division of credits. For rules regarding the amount  realized allocated to joint foreign and non-foreign transferors, see  Sec. 1.1445-1(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em>. In addition, the term  ``residence'' is defined in 1.1445-2(d)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>, the terms ``transferor's  agent'' and ``transferee's agent'' are defined in 1.1445-4(f), and the  term ``relevant taxpayer'' is defined in 1.1445-6(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transfer. The term ``transfer'' means any transaction that would  constitute a disposition for any purpose, of the Internal Revenue Code  and regulations thereunder. For purposes of Secs. 1.1445-5 and 1.1445-6,  the term includes distribution to shareholders of a corporation,  partners of a partnership and beneficiaries of a trust or estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Transferor. The term ``transferor'' means any person, foreign or  domestic, that disposes of a U.S. real property interest by sale,  exchange, gift, or any other transfer. The term ``U.S. real property  interest'' is defined in Sec. 1.897-1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transferee. The term ``transferee'' means any person, foreign or  domestic, that acquires a U.S. real property interest by purchase,  exchange, gift, or any other transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Amount realized. The amount realized by the transferor for the  transfer of a U.S. real property interest is the sum of.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The cash paid, or to be paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The fair market value of other property transferred, or to be  transferred, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The outstanding amount of any liability assumed by the  transferee or to which the U.S. real property interest is subject  immediately before and after the transfer.  The term ``cash paid or to be paid'' does not include stated or unstated  interest or original issue discount (as determined under the rules of  sections 1271 through 1275).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Contract price. The contract price of a U.S. real property  interest is the sum that is agreed to by the transferee and transferor  as the total amount of consideration to be paid for the property. That  amount will generally be equal to the amount realized by the transferor,  as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Fair market value. The fair market value of property means the  price at which the property would change hands between an unrelated  willing buyer and willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to  buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of all relevant  facts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em>, the payment of   consideration does not include the payment, prior to the passage of  legal or equitable title (other than pursuant to an initial contract for  purchase), of earnest money, a good-faith deposit, or any similar sum  that is primarily intended to bind the transferee or transferor to the  entering or performance of a contract. Such a payment will not  constitute a payment of consideration solely because it may ultimately  be applied against the amount owed to the transferor by the transferee.  Such a payment is presumed to be earnest money, a good faith deposit, or  a similar sum if it is subject to forfeiture in the event of a failure  to enter into a contract or a breach of contract. However, a payment  that is not forefeitable may nevertheless be found to constitute earnest  money, a good faith deposit, or a similar sum.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Identifying number. Pursuant to Sec. 1.897-1(p), an individual's  identifying number is the social security number or the identification  number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (see Sec. 301.6109-1 of  this chapter). The identifying number of any other person is its United  States employer identification number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Address of the Director, Philadelphia Service Center.
