                                Sec. 48.4041-5  Sales of diesel and special motor fuels and fuel for use
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Taxability of liquid fuel delivered into purchaser's tanks--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Fuel supply tanks. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The sale of diesel fuel to an owner, lessee, or  other operator of a diesel-powered highway vehicle, or of special motor  fuel to an owner, lessee, or other operator of a motor vehicle or  motorboat, or of fuel to an owner, lessee, or other operator of an  aircraft used in noncommercial aviation is considered a taxable sale of  the liquid fuel if the liquid fuel is delivered by the seller into the  fuel supply tank of the vehicle, motorboat, or aircraft. For purpose of  this paragraph (a), liquid fuel sold at a location unattended by   the seller (such as under a cardlock or meter system) on or after  January 2, 1986, is considered to be delivered into the fuel supply tank  by the seller except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this  section. In this regard, see section 6427(a) for credit or refund of tax  if liquid fuel acquired in a transaction subject to tax is used in a  nontaxable use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the seller maintains special devices at the unattended  location to account accurately for sales of liquid fuel for nontaxable  uses (such as assigning a separate ``nontaxable'' meter or, in a  cardlock system, issuing a special ``nontaxable'' card to a customer who  regularly purchases fuel for nontaxable uses), then such sales of liquid  fuel shall be considered nontaxable. The seller must maintain sufficient  records of such nontaxable sales and include in these records the name  of the purchaser, the date of the purchase, and the quantity of fuel  purchased in each sale.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Bulk tanks. The sale of diesel fuel to an owner, lessee, or  other operator of a diesel-powered highway vehicle, or of special motor  fuel to an owner, lessee, or other operator of a motor vehicle or  motorboat, or of fuel to an owner, lessee, or other operator of an  aircraft used in noncommercial aviation is considered a taxable sale of  the liquid fuel if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The liquid fuel is delivered by the seller into a bulk supply  tank (or other container) that is not the fuel supply tank of a vehicle,  motorboat, or aircraft; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this section will  relate to the fuel to be used for taxable purposes if proper records are  kept by the purchaser that sufficiently identify the tanks (or  containers) into which tax-paid fuel is delivered and the quantities of  fuel delivered into those tanks (or containers). If only occasional  sales for delivery into a bulk storage tank (or other container) are  made to a purchaser, a separate statement must be furnished for each  order. However, if sales are regularly or frequently made to a  purchaser, a written statement covering all orders for a specified  period not to exceed 12 calendar quarters is acceptable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sales for resale and to consignees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A sale to a dealer for  resale is not subject to tax even if it is known at the time of the sale  that the liquid fuel will be resold by the dealer for use as a fuel in a  diesel-powered highway vehicle, motor vehicle, motorboat, or aircraft.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The tax is payable by the person who makes the taxable sale. If  a taxable liquid fuel is consigned to a person for sale and the  consignor retains ownership in the liquid fuel until it is disposed of  by the consignee, the consignor is the person liable for the tax when a  taxable sale of the liquid fuel is made by the consignee. If the  consignor transfers ownership in the taxable liquid fuel to the  consignee before sale of the liquid fuel by the consignee, the consignee  is the person liable for the tax upon a subsequent taxable sale of the  liquid. However, if ownership of the liquid fuel is transferred back to  the consignor or to another person before a taxable sale is made, as  described in paragraph (a) of this section, and thereafter a taxable  sale of the liquid fuel is made by such person or by another person  acting as the person's agent, such person is liable for the tax. See  paragraph (d) of Sec. 48.4041-8 for definition of the term ``taxable  liquid fuel.''  [T.D. 8066, 51 FR 15, Jan. 2, 1986, as amended by T.D. 8154, 52 FR  32008, Aug. 25, 1987]</p>
