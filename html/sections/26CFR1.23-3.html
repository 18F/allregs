                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When expenditures are treated as made--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Timeliness of an  expenditure for the energy credit. In general, for the purpose of  determining whether an expenditure qualifies as being timely for the  residential energy credit under section 23 or former section 44C (i.e.,  is made after April 19, 1977, and before   January 1, 1986), the expenditure is treated as made when original  installation of the item is completed. Thus, solely for that purpose,  the time of payment or accrual is irrelevant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for renewable energy source expenditures in the  case of construction or reconstruction of a dwelling. In the case of  renewable energy source expenditures in connection with the construction  or reconstruction of a dwelling that becomes the taxpayer's new  principal residence, the expenditures are to be treated as made (for the  purpose of determining the timeliness of an expenditure for the  residential energy credit) when the taxpayer commences use of the  dwelling as his or her principal residence following its construction or  reconstruction. The term ``reconstruction'' means the replacement of  most of a dwelling's major structural components such as floors, walls,  and ceiling. When a taxpayer reoccupies a reconstructed dwelling that  was the taxpayer's principal residence prior to reconstruction, a  renewable energy source expenditure is considered made when the original  installation of the renewable energy source property is completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Taxable year in which credit is allowable. For the purpose of  determining the taxable year in which the credit for an expenditure is  allowable (once it has qualified as timely under subparagraph (1) or  (2)), an expenditure is treated as made on the later of (i) the date on  which it qualifies as timely; or (ii) the date on which it is paid or  incurred by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Expenditures in 1977. No credit under section 23 or former  section 44C shall be allowed for any taxable year beginning before 1978.  However, the amount of any credit under section 23 or former section 44C  for the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1977,  shall take into account qualified energy conservation expenditures and  qualified renewable energy source expenditures made during the period  beginning April 20, 1977, and ending on the last day of such first  taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cross reference. For rules relating to expenditures financed  with Federal, State, or local government grants or subsidized financing  see paragraph (d)(3) of Sec.  1.23-1 and paragraph (i) of Sec.  1.23-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Expenditures qualifying both as energy conservation expenditures  and renewable source expenditures. In the case of an expenditure which  meets both the definition of an energy conservation expenditure (as  defined in Sec.  1.23-2(a)) and a renewable energy source expenditure  (as defined in Sec.  1.23-2(b)), the taxpayer may claim either a credit  under Sec.  1.23-1(b) (relating to qualified energy conservation  expenditures) or Sec.  1.23-1(c) (relating to qualified renewable energy  source expenditures) but may not claim both credits with respect to the  same expenditure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Principal residence. For purposes of section 23 or former  section 44C the determination of whether a dwelling unit is the  taxpayer's principal residence shall be made under principles similar to  those applicable to section 1034 and the regulations thereunder  (relating to sale or exchange of a principal residence) except that  ownership of the dwelling unit is not required. In making this  determination, the period for which a dwelling is treated as a  taxpayer's principal residence includes the 30-day period ending on the  first day on which the dwelling unit would (but for this sentence) be  treated as being used as the taxpayer's principal residence under  principles similar to those applicable to section 1034. Thus,  installation that are completed within that 30-day period may be  eligible for the credit although, in the absence of the 30-day rule, the  date of habitation of the dwelling unit by the taxpayer would mark the  beginning of the taxpayer's use of the unit as a principal residence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Construction substantially completed. Construction of a dwelling  unit is substantially completed when construction has progressed to the  point where the unit could be put to use as a personal residence, even  though comparatively minor items remain to be finished or performed in  order to conform to the plans or specifications of the completed  building. For this purpose, construction includes reconstruction as  defined in paragraph (a)(2). This rule may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth2">Example. On January 1, 1979, A purchases a dwelling that is to  become A's principal residence. The dwelling unit was originally  constructed in 1950. A spends $50,000 to reconstruct the dwelling by  replacing most of the dwelling's major structural components such as  floors, walls, and ceilings. Included in the cost is $3,000 attributable  to energy-conserving components. Reconstruction is substantially  completed on April 1, 1979, and A moves into the reconstructed residence  on May 1, 1979. Since construction includes reconstruction, A's  reconstructed residence is not considered substantially completed before  April 20, 1977. Thus, amounts spent with respect to A's reconstructed  residence for energy-conserving components do not qualify as energy  conservation expenditures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Residential use of property. To be eligible for the residential  energy credit, expenditures must be made for personal residential  purposes. If at least 80 percent of the use of a component or item of  property is for personal residential purposes, the entire amount of the  energy conservation expenditure or the renewable energy source  expenditure is taken into account in computing the credit under this  section. If less than 80 percent of the use of a component or item of  property is for personal residential purposes, the amount of an  expenditure taken into account is the amount that bears the same ratio  to the amount of the expenditure as the amount of personal residential  use of the component or item bears to its total use. For purposes of  this paragraph, use of a component or an item of property with respect  to a swimming pool is not a use for a personal residential purpose. The  rules with respect to residential use of property are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. In 1978 A makes an expenditure of $3,000 for the  installation of storm windows of which 50 percent is on the portion of  A's dwelling used as the principal family residence and 50 percent is on  the portion of the dwelling used as an office. A has made no other  energy conservation expenditures for the residence. The allowable energy  conservation expenditure is $1,500 (50 percent of $3,000), the portion  attributable to residential use. Therefore, the residential energy  credit is $225 (the qualified conservation expenditure of 15 percent of  $1.500).</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. During 1979, B makes $10,000 of renewable energy source  expenditures on solar energy property for B's principal residence.  Approximately 60 percent of the use of the solar energy property will be  for heating B's swimming pool; the other 40 percent will be for heating  the dwelling unit. B had not previously made renewable energy source  expenditures with respect to the residence. Since use for a swimming  pool is not considered a residential use, less than 80 percent of the  use of B's solar energy property is considered used for personal  residential purposes. Therefore, only $4,000 (40 percent of $10,000),  the proportionate part of B's expenditures representing personal  residential use, is treated as a renewable energy source expenditure. B  is allowed a $1,000 residential energy credit (30 percent of $2,000 plus  20 percent of $2,000) for 1979.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Joint occupancy--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. If two or more individuals  jointly occupied and used a dwelling unit as their principal residence  during any portion of a calendar year--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount of the credit allowable under section 23 or former  section 44C by reason of energy conservation expenditures or by reason  of renewable energy source expenditures shall be determined by treating  all of the joint occupants as one taxpayer whose taxable year is such  calendar year; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The credit under section 23 or former section 44C allowable to  each joint occupant for the taxable year with which or in which such  calendar year ends shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the  amount determined under paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section as the  amount of energy conservation expenditures or renewable energy source  expenditures made by that occupant bears to the total amount of each  type of such expenditures made by all joint occupants during such  calendar year.  The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following  example:</p><p class="depth4">Example. A, a calendar year taxpayer, and B, a June 1 fiscal year  taxpayer, make energy conservation exenditures of $2,000 (A making  expenditures of $500 and B making expenditures of $1,500) on their  principal and jointly occupied residence in 1978. A and B have not  previously make energy conservation expenditures with respect to this  residence. Of the $300 credit (15 percent of $2,000), $75 will be  allocated to A ($500 / $2,000 x $300) and $225 to B ($1,500 / $2,000 x  300). A will claim the allocable share of the credit on A's 1978 tax  return and B will claim the allocable share of the credit on B's tax  return for the fiscal year ending May 31, 1979.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Minimum credit. The fact that one joint occupant may be unable  to claim all or part of the credit under section 23 of former section  44C because of insufficient tax liability or because that occupant's  allowable credit does not exceed the $10 minimum credit (as set forth in  paragraph (d)(1) of Sec.  1.23-1) shall have no effect upon the  computation of the amount of the allowable credits for the other joint  occupants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Prior expenditures. Because joint occupants are treated as one  taxpayer for purposes of determining the residential energy credit, the  maximum amount of energy conservation expenditures or renewable energy  source expenditures must be reduced by the total amount of such  expenditures made in connection with the dwelling unit during prior  calendar years in which any one of the residents of the unit during the  current calendar year was a resident (whether made by the current  resident or by an individual previously occupying the dwelling with the  current resident). However, the preceding sentence shall not apply to  prior expenditures no part of which was taken into account in computing  the credits under section 23 of former section 44C for such years. Prior  years' expenditures are not to be allocated among joint occupants to  take into account the specific expenditures of each of the occupants in  prior years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The rules of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following  examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Assume A and B have together made prior years' energy  conservation expenditures of $1,600 (A having made $1,200 of  expenditures and B having made $400) on their principal and jointly  occupied residence. In the current year, each makes energy conservation  expenditures of $300 with respect to the same residence. The maximum  qualified expenditure with respect to the residence is reduced by the  $1,600 of prior expenditures made by A and B. Therefore, only $400 of  the $600 current expenditures are eligible as energy conservation  expenditures. The resulting residential energy credit is $60 (15 percent  of $400) of which $30 apiece will be allocated to A and B ($300/$600 x  $60). The fact that A had previously computed the credit in prior years  with respect to $1,200 of the total $1,600 of expenditures is irrelevant  to the apportionment of the credit in the current year.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. In 1978, spouses C and D make $10,000 of renewable energy  source expenditures with respect to their principal residence, half of  which is paid by each spouse. No prior renewable energy source  expenditures have been taken into account with respect to that residence  by either C or D. C and D file separate returns for the calendar year.  Under the joint occupancy rule, the maximum allowable renewable energy  source credit with respect to C and D's principal residence is $2,200  (30 percent of the first $2,000, and 20 percent of the next $8,000 of  expenditures). Half of this amount or $1,100, will be allowed to each  spouse. If either spouse makes renewable energy source expenditures with  respect to the same principal residence in future years, none of those  expenditures would be qualified renewable energy source expenditures for  which a credit can be claimed. That is, not more than $2,200 may be  taken in the aggregate by C and D as a renewable energy source credit  with respect to their principal residence.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. In 1978, E and F make energy conservation expenditures of  $1,500 on their principal and jointly occupied residence. In 1979, E  moves away and G becomes the other joint occupant of the residence. F  and G make energy conservation expenditures of $1,000 in 1979. In 1980 F  moves away and H moves in with G. G and H make energy conservation  expenditures of $500. The maximum qualified expenditure made by F and G  with respect to the residence is reduced by the $1,500 of prior  expenditures made in 1978 by E and F. The maximum qualified expenditures  made by G and H with respect to the residence is reduced only by the  expenditures in prior years in connection with the residence during  which either G or H was a joint occupant. Accordingly, the maximum  qualified expenditures made by G and H with respect to the residence is  reduced only by the $1,000 of prior expenditures made in 1979 by F and  G.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Condominiums and cooperative housing corporations. An individual  who is a tenant stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation (as  defined in section 216) or who is a member of a condominium management  association with respect to a condominium which he or she owns shall be  treated as having made a proportionate share of the energy conservation  expenditures or renewable energy source expenditures of such corporation  or association. The cooperative stockholder's allocable share of the  expenditures is to be the same as his or her proportionate share of the  cooperative's total outstanding stock (including any stock held by the  corporation). However, in the case   where only certain cooperative stockholders are assessed for the  expenditures made by the cooperative housing corporation, only those  cooperative stockholders that are assessed shall be treated as having  made a share of the expenditures of such corporation. In such case, the  cooperative stockholder's share of the expenditures is the amount that  the stockholder is assessed. The allocable share of a condominium  management association member's energy conservation of renewable energy  source expenditures is the amount that the member is assessed (or would  be assessed in the case where expenditures are from general funds) by  the association as a result of such expenditures. The residential energy  credit for a qualified expenditure is allowable for the year in which  the association or corporation has completed original installation of  the item (or has paid or incurred the expenditure, if later). For  purposes of this paragraph, the term ``condominium management  association'' means an organization meeting the requirements of section  528(c)(1) of the Code (other than subparagraph (E) of that section),  with respect to a condominium project substantially all the units of  which are used as residences.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Joint ownership of energy conservation property or renewable  energy source property--(1) In general. Energy conservation property  renewable energy source property include property which is jointly owned  by the taxpayer and another person (or persons) and installed in  connection with two or more dwelling units. For example, the fact that a  windmill, solar collector, or geothermal well and distribution system is  owned by two or more individuals does not preclude its qualification as  renewable energy source property. The amount of the credit allowable  under section 23 shall be computed separately with respect to the amount  of the expenditures made by each individual, subject to the limitations  of $2,000 imposed by section 23(b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and $10,000 imposed by section  23(b)(2), per dwelling units of jointly owned property. For example, in  1982, A, B, and C purchased as joint owners renewable energy source  property that serviced two houses. One of the houses is jointly owned  and occupied by A and B and the other is owned and occupied by C alone.  The renewable energy source property cost $30,000 of which A paid  $9,000, B paid $6,000, and C paid $15,000. A and B must share the $4,000  credit (40% of $10,000 maximum) with respect to the expenditures for the  jointly owned house. Therefore, A is allowed a $2,400 credit ($4,000  times $9,000 divided by $9,000 plus $6,000) and B is allowed a $1,600  credit ($4,000 times $6,000 divided by $9,000 plus $6,000) with respect  to the expenditures attributable to the jointly owned house. C is  entitled to a credit of $4,000 with respect to the expenditures  attributable to the other house.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Example. The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated  by the following example:</p><p class="depth3">Example. A, B, and C each has a separate principal residence. They  agree to finance jointly the construction of a solar collector, each  providing one-third of the costs and taking one-third of the output of  the collector. Each will separately pay for the costs of connecting the  solar collector with his or her principal residence. Provided the solar  collector and connection equipment otherwise qualify as renewable energy  source property, A, B, and C will each be considered to have made  renewable energy source expenditures equal to one-third of the cost of  the collector plus his or her separate connection costs. Such  expenditures will be subject to the limitations and other rules  separately applicable to A, B, and C with respect to each principal  residence, such as those with respect to the $10 minimum (Sec.  1.23- 1(d)(1)), prior expenditures (Sec.  1.23-1(d)(2)), residential use  (paragraph (g) of this section), and joint occupancy (paragraph (h) of  this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Basic adjustments. If a credit is allowed under section 23 or  former section 44C for any expenditure with respect to any property, the  increase in the basis of that property which would (but for this  paragraph) result from such expenditure shall be reduced by the amount  of the credit allowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Recordkeeping--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. No residential energy credit is  allowable unless the taxpayer maintains the records described in  paragraph (l)(2) of this section. The records shall be retained so long  as the contents thereof may become material in the administration of any  internal revenue law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Records. The taxpayer must maintain records that clearly  identify the   energy-conserving components and renewable energy source property with  respect to which a residential energy credit is claimed, and  substantiate their cost to the taxpayer, any labor costs properly  allocable to them paid for by the taxpayer, and the method used for  allocating such labor costs.
