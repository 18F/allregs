                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Fixed (stationary, or built in) protective breathing equipment  must be installed for the use of the flightcrew, and at least one  portable protective breathing equipment shall be located at or near the  flight deck for use by a flight crewmember. In addition, portable  protective breathing equipment must be installed for the use of  appropriate crewmembers for fighting fires in compartments accessible in  flight other than the flight deck. This includes isolated compartments  and upper and lower lobe galleys, in which crewmember occupancy is  permitted during flight. Equipment must be installed for the maximum  number of crewmembers expected to be in the area during any operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For protective breathing equipment required by paragraph (a) of  this section or by the applicable Operating Regulations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The equipment must be designed to protect the appropriate  crewmember from smoke, carbon dioxide, and other harmful gases while on  flight deck duty or while combating fires.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The equipment must include--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Masks covering the eyes, nose and mouth, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Masks covering the nose and mouth, plus accessory equipment to  cover the eyes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Equipment, including portable equipment, must allow  communication with other crewmembers while in use. Equipment available  at flightcrew assigned duty stations must also enable the flightcrew to  use radio equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The part of the equipment protecting the eyes shall not cause  any appreciable adverse effect on vision and must allow corrective  glasses to be worn.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The equipment must supply protective oxygen of 15 minutes  duration per crewmember at a pressure altitude of 8,000 feet with a  respiratory minute volume of 30 liters per minute BTPD. The equipment  and system must be designed to prevent any inward leakage to the inside  of the device and prevent any outward leakage causing significant  increase in the oxygen content of the local ambient atmosphere. If a  demand oxygen system is used, a supply of 300 liters of free oxygen at  70 [deg]F. and 760 mm. Hg. pressure is considered to be of 15-minute  duration at the prescribed altitude and minute volume. If a continuous  flow open circuit protective breathing system is used, a flow rate of 60  liters per minute at 8,000 feet (45 liters per minute at sea level) and  a supply of 600 liters of free oxygen at 70 [deg]F. and 760 mm. Hg.  pressure is considered to be of 15-minute duration at the prescribed  altitude and minute volume. Continuous flow systems must not increase  the ambient oxygen content of the local atmosphere above that of demand  systems. BTPD refers to body temperature conditions (that is, 37  [deg]C., at ambient pressure, dry).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The equipment must meet the requirements of Sec. 25.1441.  [Doc. No. FAA-2002-13859, 69 FR 40528, July 2, 2004]</p>
