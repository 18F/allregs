                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. If you believe that you meet the requirements in  Sec. 408.234 and that you should continue to receive SVB payments even  though you have been in the United States for more than 1 full calendar  month, you must give us evidence that you had good cause for staying in  the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Circumstances prevent you from returning to your home abroad. To  prove that you had good cause for staying in   the United States for more than 1 full calendar month, you must give us  evidence of your good faith effort to return to your home abroad before  the 1-month period had elapsed and of the circumstances/event which  prevented your return to your home abroad.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Evidence of your good faith effort to return to your home  abroad. Evidence of your plans to return to your home abroad can  include, but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A plane ticket showing that you intended to return to your home  abroad before the expiration of 1 full calendar month; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notice from a travel agency or airline confirming the  cancellation of your reservation to return to your home abroad on a date  within 1 full calendar month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evidence of the circumstances preventing your return to your  home abroad. The evidence we will accept from you to support the  circumstance or event that prevented you from returning to your home  abroad will depend on the reason you are staying in the United States.  It can include, but is not limited to, a:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Newspaper article or other publication describing the event or  natural disaster which prevented your return; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Doctor's statement, etc. showing that you are unable to travel;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Death certificate or notice if you are staying in the United  States to attend the funeral of a member of your family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You are appealing a decision we made. To establish that you had  good cause to stay in the United States for more than 1 full calendar  month because you want to appear in person at the appeal of a decision  on a claim filed under a program administered by the Social Security  Administration, you must submit evidence of this. The evidence must  identify the appeal proceeding and the dates you are scheduled to  attend.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When we may ask for more evidence. If you stay in the United  States for several months, we may ask you to give us more evidence to  prove that you are still unable to return to your home abroad.</p>
