                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Where a transfer of property is in part a sale and  in part a gift, the unadjusted basis of the property in the hands of the  transferee is the sum of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whichever of the following is the greater:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount paid by the transferee for the property, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The transferor's adjusted basis for the property at the time of  the transfer, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and Sec.  1.170A-4(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The rule of paragraph (a) of this section is  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. If A transfers property to his son for $30,000, and such  property at the time of the transfer has an adjusted basis of $30,000 in  A's hands (and a fair market value of $60,000), the unadjusted basis of  the property in the hands of the son is $30,000.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. If A transfers property to his son for $60,000, and such  property at the time of transfer has an adjusted basis of $30,000 in A's  hands (and a fair market value of $90,000), the unadjusted basis of such  property in the hands of the son is $60,000.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. If A transfers property to his son for $30,000, and such  property at the time of transfer has an adjusted basis in A's hands of  $60,000 (and a fair market value of $90,000), the unadjusted basis of  such property in the hands of the son is $60,000.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. If A transfers property to his son for $30,000 and such  property at the time of transfer has an adjusted basis of $90,000 in A's  hands (and a fair market value of $60,000), the unadjusted basis of the  property in the hands of the son ins $90,000. However, since the  adjusted basis of the property in A's hands at the time of the transfer  was greater than the fair market value at that time, for the purpose of  determining any loss on a later sale or other disposition of the  property by the son its unadjusted basis in his hands is $60,000.
