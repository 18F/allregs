                                Sec. 417.155  How the HMO option must be included in the health
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> HMO access to employees--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Purpose and timing--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Purpose.  The employing entity must provide each HMO included in its health  benefits plan fair and reasonable access to all employees specified in  Sec. 417.153(b), so that the HMO can explain its program in accordance  with Sec. 417.124(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Timing. The employing entity must provide access beginning at  least 30 days before, and continuing during, the group enrollment  period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nature of access. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Access must include, at a minimum,  opportunity to distribute educational literature, brochures,  announcements of meetings, and other relevant printed materials that  meet the requirements of Sec. 417.124(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Access may not be more restrictive or less favorable than the  access the employing entity provides to other offerors of options  included in the health benefits plan, whether or not those offerors  elect to avail themselves of that access.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Review of HMO offering materials. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The HMO must give the  employing entity or designee opportunity to review, revise, and approve  HMO educational and offering materials before distribution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Revisions must be limited to correcting factual errors and  misleading or ambiguous statements, unless--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The HMO and the employing entity agree otherwise; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Other revisions are required by law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The employing entity or designee must complete revision of the  materials promptly so as not to delay or otherwise interfere with their  use during the group enrollment period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Group enrollment period; prohibition of restrictions; effective  date of HMO coverage--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prohibition of restrictions. If an employing  entity or designee includes the option of enrollment in a qualified HMO  in the health benefits plan offered to its eligible employees, it must  provide a group enrollment period before the effective date of HMO  coverage. The employing entity may not impose waiting periods as a  condition of enrollment in the HMO or of transfer from HMO to non-HMO  coverage, or exclusions, or limitations based on health status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effective date of coverage. Unless otherwise agreed to by the  employing entity, or designee, and the HMO, coverage under the HMO  contract for employees selecting the HMO option begins on the day the  non-HMO contract expires or is renewed without lapse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Coordination of benefits. Nothing in this subpart precludes the  uniform application of coordination of benefits agreements between the  HMOs and the other carriers that are included in the health benefits  plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Continued eligibility for ``free-standing'' health benefits--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Basic requirement. At the request of a qualified HMO, the employing  entity or its designee must provide that employees selecting the option  of HMO membership will not, because of this selection, lose their  eligibility for free-standing dental, optical, or prescription drug  benefits for which they were previously eligible or would be eligible if  selecting a non-HMO option and that are not included in the services  provided by the HMO to its enrollees as part of the HMO prepaid benefit  package.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``Free-standing'' defined. For purposes of this paragraph, the  term ``free-standing'' refers to a benefit that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is not integrated or incorporated into a basic health benefits  package or major medical plan, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Offered by a carrier other than the one offering the basic  health benefits package or major medical plan; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Subject to a premium separate from the premium for the basic  health benefits package or major medical plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples of the employing entity's obligation with respect to  the continued eligibility. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The health benefits plan includes a free- standing dental benefit. The HMO does not offer any dental coverage as  part of its health services provided to members on a prepaid basis. The  employing entity must provide that employees who select the HMO option  continue to be eligible for dental coverage. (If the dental coverage is  not optional for employees selecting the non-HMO option, nothing in this  regulation requires that the coverage be   made optional for employees selecting the HMO option. Conversely, if  this coverage is optional for employees selecting the non-HMO option,  nothing in this regulation requires that the coverage be mandatory for  employees selecting the non-HMO option.) -</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The non-HMO option provides free-standing coverage for optical  services (such as refraction and the provision of eyeglasses), and the  HMO does not. The employing entity must provide that employees who  select the HMO option continue to be eligible for optical coverage.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The non-HMO option includes dental coverage in its major  medical package, with a common deductible applied to dental as well as  non-dental benefits. The HMO provides no dental coverage as part of its  pre-paid health services. Because the dental coverage is not free- standing, the employing entity is not required to provide that employees  who select the HMO option continue to be eligible for dental coverage,  but is free to do so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Opportunity to select among coverage options: Requirement for  affirmative written selection--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Opportunity other than during a group  enrollment period. The employing entity or designee must provide  opportunity (in addition to the group enrollment period) for selection  among coverage options, by eligible employees who meet any of the  following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Are new employees.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Have been transferred or have changed their place of residence,  resulting in--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Eligibility for enrollment in a qualified HMO for which they  were not previously eligible by place of residence; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Residence outside the service area of a qualified HMO in which  they were previously enrolled.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Are covered by any coverage option that ceases operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prohibition of restrictions. When the employees specified in  paragraph (e)(1) of this section are eligible to participate in the  health benefits plan, the employing entity or designee must make  available, without waiting periods or exclusions based on health status  as a condition, the opportunity to enroll in an HMO, or transfer from  HMO coverage to non-HMO coverage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Affirmative written selection. The employing entity or designee  must require that the eligible employee make an affirmative written  selection in any of the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Enrollment in a particular qualified HMO is offered for the  first time.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The eligible employee elects to change from one option to  another.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The eligible employee is one of those specified in paragraph  (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Determination of copayment levels and supplemental health  services. The selection of a copayment level and of supplemental health  services to be contracted for must be made as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For employees represented by a collective bargaining  representative, the selection of copayment levels and supplemental  health services is subject to the collective bargaining process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For employees not represented by a bargaining representative,  the selection of copayment levels and supplemental health services is  subject to the same decisionmaking process used by the employing entity  with respect to the non-HMO option in its health benefits plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In all cases, the HMO has the right to include, with the basic  benefits package it provides to its enrollees for a basic health  services payment, on a non-negotiable basis, those supplemental health  services that meet the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Are required to be offered under State law.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Are included uniformly by the HMO in its prepaid benefit  package.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Are available to employees who select the non-HMO option but  not available to those who select the HMO option.
