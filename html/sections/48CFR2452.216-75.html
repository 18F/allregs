The Contracting Officer may authorize  commencement of work prior to final agreement on cost or price. In such  case, the contractor shall immediately commence performance of the  services specified in the order and shall submit a pricing proposal  within 15 days of receipt of the task order. Upon completion of  negotiations, the final negotiated cost or price will be set forth in a  supplemental agreement that is executed by the contractor and the  Contracting Officer. Failure to agree upon the cost or price shall be  considered a dispute subject to the Disputes clause of this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unpriced task orders shall indicate a ``not-to-exceed'' amount  for the order; however, such amount shall not exceed 50 percent of the  estimated cost of the task order. The task order shall only require the  Contracting Officer's signature, but shall also comply with all other  task order requirements. Unpriced task orders shall indicate the date by  which the government anticipates that the cost or price of the order  will be definitized.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)  [71 FR 2439, Jan. 13, 2006]</p>
