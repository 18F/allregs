                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. Potential national natural landmarks are  identified in the following manner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Natural region studies. The NPS conducts inventories of the  characteristic biological and geological features in each natural region  to provide a scientific basis for identifying potential national natural  landmarks. The NPS is responsible for the completion of these studies,  which are generally done by qualified scientists under contract. A study  provides a classification and description of biological and geological  features in that natural region and an annotated list of areas that  illustrate those features. During a study, the NPS or any representative  of the NPS may enter onto land only after receiving written permission  from the owner(s) of that land, except when the land is publicly owned  land and otherwise open to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other entities. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any public or private entity may suggest an  area for study and possible national natural landmark designation. The  entities include:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Federal agency programs that conduct inventories in order to  identify areas of special interest, for example, essential wildlife  habitat, research natural areas, and areas of critical environmental  concern; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> State natural area programs that systematically and  comprehensively classify, identify, locate and assess the protective  status of the biological and geological features located in a State.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If an individual, agency or organization that suggests an area  for national natural landmark consideration is not the owner of the  area, written permission of the owner(s) is required to enter onto the  PNNL to gather information, except when the land is publicly owned and  otherwise open to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After receiving the suggestions from a natural region study and  suggestions from other sources, the NPS determines which PNNL merit  further study for possible national natural landmark designation. This  determination is based on comparison with existing national natural  landmarks in the natural region, the national natural landmark criteria  (see Sec. 62.5) and other information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> First Notification. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before a potential national natural  landmark is evaluated by scientists as described in paragraph (c) of  this section, the NPS notifies the owner(s) in writing, except as  specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> This notice advises the owner(s) that the PNNL is being  considered for study for possible national natural landmark designation  and provides information on the National Natural Landmarks Program,  including an explanation of the effects of national natural landmark  designation as described in Sec. 62.3.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The notice also provides the owner with available information  on the area and its tentatively identified significance, solicits the  owner's comments on the area, including any information on current or  anticipated land use or activities that may affect the area's natural  values, integrity, or other matters of concern, and informs the owner of  the source of the suggestion for consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The notice also requests owner permission to enter the  property, unless the area is otherwise open to the public, so the NPS or  its representative can conduct an on-site evaluation of the PNNL as  described under paragraph (c) of this section, and advises the owner of  the procedures the NPS will follow in considering the PNNL for possible  designation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before a potential national natural landmark having 50 or more  owners is evaluated by scientists as described in paragraph (c) of this  section, the NPS provides general notice to property owners. This  general notice is published in one or more local newspapers of general  circulation in the area in which the potential national natural landmark  is located. The notice provides the same information listed under  paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> During an on-site evaluation as described in paragraph (c) of  this section, the NPS or any representative of the NPS will not enter  onto land without permission from the owner(s), except when the land is  publicly owned and otherwise open to the public. The NPS may complete  evaluations of PNNL by using other information, including information  that was previously gathered by other Federal or State agencies or  gained from other scientific studies. The NPS notifies owners if areas  are evaluated from existing information not requiring land entry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The described procedures for providing written notification to  owners and receiving responses from owners about the first notification  are the responsibility of the NPS and cannot be delegated to any  representative of the NPS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Evaluation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The NPS uses the national natural landmark  criteria in Sec. 62.5 to evaluate the potential natural landmark.  Potential national natural landmarks are evaluated on a natural region  basis; i.e., similar areas that represent a particular type of feature  located in the same natural region are compared to identify examples  that are most illustrative and have the most intact, undisturbed  integrity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evaluations are done by qualified scientists who are familiar  with the natural region and its types of biological and geological  features. Evaluators make a detailed description of the area, including  a proposed boundary map, and assess its regional standing using the  national natural landmark criteria (see Sec. 62.5) and any additional  information provided by the NPS. Evaluation reports must have been  completed or updated within the previous 2 years in order to be  considered by the NPS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Completed evaluation reports are reviewed by no fewer than three  peer reviewers, who are scientists familiar with the biological or  geological features of the area or natural region. These reviewers  provide the NPS with information on the scientific merit and strength of  supportive documentation in the evaluation report. On the basis of  evaluation report(s) and the findings of the peer reviewers, the NPS  makes a determination that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The PNNL does or does not appear to qualify for national natural  landmark designation; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Additional information is required before a decision can be  made about the status of the PNNL.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When a PNNL does not seem to qualify for national natural  landmark designation, the NPS notifies the owner(s) as prescribed in  paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Second Notification. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the Director determines that an  area meets the criteria for national significance, the NPS notifies the  owner(s) in writing, except as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The notice references the rules in this part, advises the owners  of the procedures the NPS follows and of the effects of national natural  landmark designation as described in Sec. 62.3, provides the owner(s)  with a copy of the evaluation report, and provides the   owner(s) with the opportunity to comment. The list of owners must be  obtained from official land or tax records, whichever is most  appropriate, within 90 days before issuing the second notification.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If in any State the land or tax records are not helpful, the  NPS can seek alternative sources to identify the owners.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The NPS is responsible for notifying only owners whose names  appear on the list.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an area has more than 50 owners, the NPS provides a general  notice to the property owners. NPS will publish a general notice in one  or more local newspapers of general circulation in the region in which  the area is located. A copy of the evaluation report is made available  on request. In addition, the NPS may conduct a public information  meeting, if widespread local public interest warrants it or if requested  by the executive of the local governmental jurisdiction in which the  area is located.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In addition, NPS notifies appropriate authorities, organizations  and individuals. The notices reference these rules and advise the  recipient of the proposed action, of the procedures the NPS follows, and  of the effects of national natural landmark designation as described in  Sec. 62.3. Notice of the proposed action is published also in the  Federal Register. NPS will notify:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The executive of the local governmental jurisdiction in which  the area (PNNL) is located;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The governor of the State;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Other appropriate State officials;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Senators and members of Congress who represent the district in  which the area is located;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Native American tribal governments and native villages and  corporations in the region; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Other interested authorities, organizations and individuals as  deemed appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All notified entities, including non-owners, have 60 days to  provide comments before NPS decides whether the area meets the criteria  for national significance. To assist in the evaluation of an area,  comments should, among other factors, discuss the area's features and  integrity. Information is also welcome on current or anticipated land  use or threats that could effect the area. Any party may request a  reasonable extension of the comment period when additional time is  required to study and comment on a landmark proposal. The Director may  grant these requests if he or she determines they are in the public  interest. All comments received are considered in the national natural  landmark designation process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Upon individual or general notification, any owner of private  property within a PNNL who wishes to object to national natural landmark  designation must submit a notarized statement to the Director to certify  that he or she is the sole or partial owner of record and he or she  objects to the designation. These statements will be submitted during  the 60-day comment period. Upon receipt of objections to the designation  of a PNNL consisting of multiple parcels of land, the NPS must determine  how much of it consists of owners who object to designation. If an owner  whose name is not on the ownership list developed by the NPS certifies  in a notarized statement that he or she is the sole or partial owner of  the area, NPS will take into account his or her views about designation.  In circumstances where a single parcel of land within a PNNL has more  than one fee simple owner, an objection to designation of that property  must be submitted by a majority of the owners.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> All described procedures for the notification of owners and  receiving responses from owners in the second notification process are  the responsibility of the NPS and cannot be delegated to any  representative of the NPS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Significance determination. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NPS will review all  documentation including, but not limited to, evaluation reports, peer  reviews, and received comments. If NPS determines that a PNNL does not  meet the criteria for national significance (see Sec. 62.5), the NPS  will notify the owner(s) in writing that their land is no longer under  consideration for national natural landmark designation. If PNNL are  owned by 50 or more parties, the NPS will publish a general notice as  described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. In addition, the NPS will  notify in writing officials,   individuals and organizations notified under paragraph (d)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the NPS determines that a PNNL meets the criteria for  national significance, the NPS determines whether any private property  owners submitted valid written objection to designation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Areas meeting criteria. When the Director of NPS determines by  all available information that a PNNL meets the criteria for national  significance, but some private property owners submitted written  objections to the proposed national natural landmark designation, the  NPS maintains all this information about the area and which shall be  available as part of the environmental analysis for any major federal  action for purposes of NEPA which impacts the NNL or these other lands.  Notice of this action is provided by the NPS to the owners as specified  in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section and to officials,  individuals and organizations notified under paragraph (d)(3) of this  section. If some but not all of the property owners within a PNNL object  to designation, the NPS will exclude the objecting properties and  proceed with the process only if enough area remains of non-objecting  properties to allow sufficient representation of the significant natural  features.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> National Park System Advisory Board. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Director of the NPS  reviews the documentation of each area that meets the criteria for  national significance. When the Director determines that the  requirements of this part were met and that enough non-objecting valid  private property owners exist to encompass an adequate portion of the  nationally significant features, the Director submits the information on  the area (PNNL) to the National Park System Advisory Board. The board  reviews the information and recommends whether or not the land with  consenting owners qualifies for national natural landmark designation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice of Advisory Board meetings to review national natural  landmark nominations and meeting agendas are provided at least 60 days  in advance of the meeting by publication in the Federal Register. The  NPS also mails copies of the notice directly to consenting owners of  areas that are to be considered at each meeting. Interested parties are  encouraged to submit written comments and recommendations that will be  presented to the board. Interested parties may also attend the board  meeting and upon request may address the board concerning an area's  national significance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Submission to the Secretary. The Director submits the  recommendation of the Advisory Board and materials that the Director  developed to the Secretary for consideration of the nominated area for  national natural landmark designation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Designation. The Secretary reviews the materials that the  Director submitted and any other documentation and makes a decision on  national natural landmark designation. Areas that the Secretary  designates as national natural landmarks are added to the National  Registry of Natural Landmarks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Third notification. When the Secretary designates an area as a  national natural landmark, the Secretary notifies in writing the  landmark owner(s) of areas with fewer than 50 owners. A general notice  of designated areas with 50 or more owners is published in one or more  local newspapers of general circulation in the area. The Secretary also  notifies the executive of the local governmental jurisdiction in which  the landmark is located, Native American tribal governments and native  villages and corporations in the area, the governor of the State, the  congressional members who represent the district and State in which the  landmark is located, and other interested authorities, organizations and  individuals as deemed appropriate. The NPS prepares the notifications  and is responsible for their distribution. Notices of new designations  are also published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Presentation of plaque and certificate. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After the Secretary  designates an area as a national natural landmark, the NPS may provide  each owner who so requests with a certificate signed by the Secretary of  the Interior and the Director of the NPS at no cost to the owner(s).  This certificate recognizes the owner's interest in protecting and  managing the area in a   manner that prevents the loss or deterioration of the natural values on  which landmark designation is based.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If appropriate, NPS may also provide without charge a bronze  plaque for display in or near the national natural landmark. Upon  request, and to the extent NPS resources permit, the NPS may help  arrange and participate in a presentation ceremony. In accepting a  plaque or certificate, owners give up none of the rights and privileges  of ownership or use of the landmark and the Department of the Interior  does not acquire any interest in the designated property. After a  presentation, the plaque remains the property of NPS. If the landmark  designation is removed in accordance with the procedures in Sec. 62.8,  NPS may reclaim the plaque.</p>
