                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon receipt of a request, DC3 shall evaluate the request to  determine the fee category or status of the requester, as well as the  appropriateness of a waiver or reduction of fees if requested. There are  no fees associated with a Privacy Act request, except as stated in NSA/ CSS Regulation 10-35, Implementation of the Privacy Act of 1974. If fees  are assessable, a search   cost estimate shall be sent to the Directorate(s) and Associate  Directorate(s) expected to maintain responsive records. If DC3 assigns a  fee category to a requester which differs from that claimed by the  requester or determines that a waiver or reduction of fees is not  appropriate, DC3 shall notify the requester of this discrepancy and of  the estimated cost of processing the request. The requester shall be  given 60 days to provide additional substantiation for the fee status  claimed or for a fee waiver or reduction. The requester shall be advised  that his/her request shall not be processed until the discrepancy over  the fee category, fee waiver or reduction, or both are resolved. He/she  shall also be advised of his/her right to appeal/DC3's determination. A  fee waiver or reduction shall be granted or denied in accordance with  DoD 5400.7-R and based on information provided by the requester. If the  requester does not respond to DC3's initial notification of the  discrepancy in fee assessment within the 60 days, DC3's determination  about that requester's fee status shall be final.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fees shall reflect only direct search, review (in the case of  commercial requesters) and duplication costs, recovery of which are  permitted by 5 U.S.C. 552. Fees shall not be used to discourage  requesters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No minimum fee may be charged. Fees under $25.00 shall be  waived.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fees shall be based on estimates provided by appropriate  organizational focal points. Upon completion of the processing of the  request and computation of all assessable fees, the request shall be  handled as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the earlier cost estimate was under $250.00 and the requester  has not yet paid and has no payment history, the requester shall be  notified of the actual cost and shall be sent a bill under separate  cover. Upon receipt of payment, processing results and non-exempt  information shall be provided to the requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In cases where the requester paid prior to processing, if the  actual costs exceed the estimated costs, the requester shall be notified  of the remaining fees due. Processing results and non-exempt information  shall be provided to the requester upon payment of the amount in excess  or, if less than $250.00, receipt of the requester's agreement to pay.  If the requester refuses to pay the amount in excess, processing of the  request will be terminated with notice to the requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In cases where the requester paid prior to processing, if the  actual costs are less than estimated fees which have been collected from  the requester, processing results and the non-exempt information shall  be provided to the requester, and the FOIA office shall advise  Accounting and Financial Services of the need to refund funds to the  requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Fees for manual searches, review time and personnel costs  associated with computer searches shall be computed according to the  following schedule:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Hourly</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Clerical.........................

Duplication costs shall be the actual,  direct cost of reproducing the material, including the wage of the  person doing the work. Audiovisual materials provided to a requester  need not be in reproducible format or quality.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Duplication fees shall be assessed according to the following  schedule:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Cost per</p><p class="depth2">Type                                 page ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (1) Office Copy..............................................       $.15 (2) Microfiche...............................................        .25 (3) Printed Material.........................................        .02 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
