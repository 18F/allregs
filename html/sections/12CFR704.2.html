Mortgage-backed securities are a type of asset-backed security.</p><p class="depth0">Available to cover losses that exceed retained earnings means that the funds are available to cover operating losses realized, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), by the corporate credit union that exceed retained earnings and equity acquired in a combination. Likewise, available to cover losses that exceed retained earnings and perpetual contributed capital (PCC) means that the funds are available to cover operating losses realized, in accordance with GAAP, by the corporate credit union that exceed retained earnings and equity acquired in a combination and PCC. Any such losses must be distributed pro rata at the time the loss is realized first among the holders of PCC, and when all PCC is exhausted, then pro rata among all nonperpetual capital accounts (NCAs) and unconverted membership capital accounts, all subject to the optional prioritization described in appendix A of this part. To the extent that any contributed capital funds are used to cover losses, the corporate credit union must not restore or replenish the affected capital accounts under any circumstances. In addition, contributed capital that is used to cover losses in a calendar year previous to the year of liquidation has no claim against the liquidation estate.</p><p class="depth0">CLF-related bridge loan means interim financing, extending up to ten business days, that a corporate credit union provides for a natural person credit union from the time the CLF approves a loan to the natural person credit union until the CLF funds the loan.

Compensation also includes expense accounts and other allowances (for example, the value of the personal use of housing, automobiles or other assets owned by the corporate credit union; expense allowances or reimbursements that recipients must report as income on their separate income tax return; payments made under indemnification arrangements; and payments made for the benefit of friends or relatives). In calculating required compensation disclosures, reasonable estimates may be used if precise cost figures are not readily available.</p><p class="depth0">Consolidated Credit Union Service Organization (Consolidated CUSO) means any corporation, partnership, business trust, joint venture, association or similar organization in which a corporate credit union directly or indirectly holds an ownership interest (as permitted by Sec. 704.11 of this part) and the assets of which are consolidated with those of the corporate credit

Options include, but are not limited to, calls, caps, and prepayment options.</p><p class="depth0">Enterprise risk management means the process of addressing risk on an entity-wide basis.

Auditing standards differ from auditing procedures in that procedures address acts to be performed, whereas standards measure the quality of the performance of those acts and the objectives to be achieved by use of the procedures undertaken. In addition, auditing standards address the auditor's professional qualifications as well as the judgment exercised in performing the audit and in preparing the report of the audit.</p><p class="depth0">Immediate family member means a spouse or other family member living in the same household.</p><p class="depth0">Independent public accountant (IPA) means a person who is licensed by, or otherwise authorized by, the appropriate State or jurisdiction to practice public accounting. An IPA must be able to exercise fairness toward credit union officials, members, creditors and others who may rely upon the report of a supervisory committee audit and to demonstrate the impartiality necessary to produce dependable findings.

Reliable financial reporting refers to preparation of Call Reports as well as financial data published and presented to members that meet management's financial reporting objectives.
