                            <p class="depth0">To comply with its obligations under the Order, a contractor must ensure that facilities provided for employees are provided in such a manner that segregation on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin cannot result. The contractor may neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such use by employee custom. The contractor's obligation extends further to ensuring that its employees are not assigned to perform their services at any location, under the contractor's control, where the facilities are segregated. This obligation extends to all contracts containing the equal opportunity clause regardless of the amount of the contract. The term ``facilities,'' as used in this section, means waiting rooms, work areas, restaurants and other eating areas, time clocks, restrooms, wash rooms, locker rooms, and other storage

or dressing areas, parking lots, drinking fountains, recreation or entertainment areas, transportation, and housing provided for employees; Provided, That separate or single-user restrooms and necessary dressing or sleeping areas shall be provided to assure privacy between the sexes.
