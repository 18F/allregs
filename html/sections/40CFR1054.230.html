                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of certification, divide your product line into  families of   engines that are expected to have similar emission characteristics  throughout their useful life as described in this section. Your emission  family is limited to a single model year. For evaporative emissions,  group engines into emission families as described in 40 CFR 1060.230.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Group engines into the same emission family for exhaust  emissions if they are the same in all the following aspects:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The combustion cycle and fuel. See paragraph (g) of this section  for special provisions that apply for dual-fuel engines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cooling system (liquid-cooled vs. air-cooled).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Valve configuration (for example, side-valve vs. overhead  valve).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Method of air aspiration (for example, turbocharged vs.  naturally aspirated).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The number, location, volume, and composition of catalytic  converters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The number and arrangement of cylinders (such as in-line or vee  configuration) and approximate total displacement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Engine class, as defined in Sec.  1054.801.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Method of control for engine operation, other than governing  (mechanical or electronic).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The numerical level of the applicable emission standards. For  example, an engine family may not include engines certified to different  family emission limits, though you may change family emission limits  without recertifying as specified in Sec.  1054.225.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Useful life.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You may subdivide a group that is identical under paragraph (b)  of this section into different emission families if you show the  expected emission characteristics are different during the useful life.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may group engines that are not identical with respect to the  things listed in paragraph (b) of this section into the same emission  family, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In unusual circumstances, you may group such engines into the  same emission family if you show that their emission characteristics  during the useful life will be similar.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you are a small-volume engine manufacturer, you may group any  nonhandheld engines with the same useful life that are subject to the  same emission standards into a single emission family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The provisions of this paragraph (d) do not exempt any engines  from meeting all the applicable standards and requirements in subpart B  of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Select test engines from the emission family as described in 40  CFR 1065.401.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> You may combine engines from different classes into a single  emission family under paragraph (d)(1) of this section if you certify  the emission family to the more stringent set of standards from the two  classes in that model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> You may certify dual-fuel or flexible-fuel engines in a single  engine family. You may include dedicated-fuel versions of this same  engine model in the same engine family, as long as they are identical to  the engine configuration with respect to that fuel type for the dual- fuel or flexible-fuel version of the engine. For example, if you produce  an engine that can alternately run on gasoline and natural gas, you can  include the gasoline-only and natural gas-only versions of the engine in  the same engine family as the dual-fuel engine if engine operation on  each fuel type is identical with or without installation of components  for operating on the other fuel.
