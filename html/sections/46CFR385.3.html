                            <p class="depth0">Sections 385.2 through 385.9 establish the MarAd assistance  regulations which codify, implement, and publish uniform assistance  policies and selected procedures applicable to MarAd and recipients of  MarAd assistance awards. The MarAd assistance regulations do not, in and  of themselves, provide authority for the use of assistance instruments  nor the making of assistance awards where statutory authority has not  been otherwise provided. Generic authority to award grants and  cooperative agreements is provided in Pub. L. 95-224, the Federal Grant  and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977. The assistance regulations are  distinct from the Federal and MarAd and Department of Transportation  procurement regulations.</p>
