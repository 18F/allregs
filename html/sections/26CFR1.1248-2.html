(i) For each taxable year of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, the earnings and profits accumulated for each such taxable year by the corporation shall be computed in the manner prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section, and (ii) for the period the person held (or is considered to have held by reason of the application

of section 1223, taking into account Sec. 1.1248-8) the block, the amount of earnings and profits attributable to the block shall be computed in the manner prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Step 2. If the conditions of paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section must be satisfied in respect of stock in a lower tier foreign corporation which such person owns within the meaning of section 958(a)(2), then (i) the earnings and profits accumulated for each such taxable year by such lower tier corporation shall be computed in the manner prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section, and (ii) for the period the person held (or is considered to have held by reason of the application of section 1223, taking into account Sec. 1.1248-8) the block, the amount of earnings and profits of the lower tier corporation attributable to the block shall be computed in the manner prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section applied as if such person owned directly the percentage of such stock in such lower tier corporation which such person owns within the meaning of section 958(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Step 3. The amount of earnings and profits attributable to the block shall be the sum of the amounts computed under steps 1 and 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Block of stock.

If the stock in the corporation is sold or exchanged before any action is taken by or on behalf of the corporation under paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.964-1, the computation of earnings and profits under Sec. 1.964-1 for purposes of this section shall be made as if no elections had been made and no accounting method had been adopted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. For purposes of this section, the earnings and profits accumulated for a taxable year of a foreign corporation shall be the earnings and profits for such year computed in accordance with the rules prescribed in Sec. 1.964-1 (relating to determination of earnings and profits for a taxable year of a controlled foreign corporation) and reduced by any distributions therefrom. If the stock in the corporation is sold or exchanged before any action is taken by or on behalf of the corporation under paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.964-1, the computation of earnings and profits under Sec. 1.964-1 for purposes of this section shall be made as if no elections had been made and no accounting method had been adopted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules. (i) The earnings and profits of the corporation accumulated:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1967 (computed without any reduction for distributions), shall not include the excess of any item includible in gross income of the foreign corporation under section 882(b) as gross income derived from sources within the United States, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1966 (computed without any reduction for distributions), shall not include the excess of any item includible in gross income of the foreign corporation under section 882(b)(2) as income effectively connected for that year with the conduct by such corporation of a trade or business in the United States, whether derived from sources within or from sources without the United States,
Over any deductions allocable to such item under section 882(c). However, if the sale or exchange of stock in the foreign corporation by the United States person occurs before January 1, 1967, the provisions of (a) of this subdivision apply with respect to such sale or exchange even though the taxable year begins after December 31, 1966. See section 1248(d)(4). Any item which is required to be excluded from gross income, or which is taxed at a reduced rate, under an applicable treaty obligation of the United States shall not be excluded under this subdivision from earnings and profits accumulated for a taxable year (computed without any reduction for distributions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a foreign corporation adopts a plan of complete liquidation in a taxable year of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, and if because of the application of section 337(a) gain or loss would not be recognized by the corporation from the sale or exchange of property if the corporation were a domestic corporation, then the earnings and profits of the corporation accumulated for the taxable year (computed without any reduction for distributions) shall be determined without regard to the amount of such gain or loss. See section 1248(d)(2).

portion which bears the same ratio to (i) the total earnings and profits for such taxable year (computed under paragraph (d) of this section), as (ii) the number of days during such taxable year the block was held (or is considered as so held), bears to (iii) the total number of days in such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amounts included in gross income under section 951.

The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On May 26, 1965, Green, a United States person, purchases at its fair market value a block of 25 of the 100 outstanding shares of the only class of stock of controlled foreign corporation F. He sells the block on January 1, 1968. In respect of the block, Green did not include any amount in his gross income under section 951. F uses the calendar year as its taxable year and does not own stock in any lower tier corporation referred to in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section. All of the conditions of paragraph (c) of this section are satisfied in respect of the block. The earnings and profits accumulated by F (computed under paragraph (d) of this section) are $10,000 for 1965, $13,000 for 1966, and $11,000 for 1967. The earnings and profits of F attributable to the block are $7,500, determined as follows:
Sum of earnings and profits accumulated by F during period</p><p class="depth0">block was held:</p><p class="depth0">For 1965 (219/365x$10,000)..............................      $6,000</p><p class="depth0">For 1966................................................     $13,000</p><p class="depth0">For 1967................................................     $11,000</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Sum...................................................     $30,000Multiplied by:</p><p class="depth0">Number of shares in block (25), divided by total number          25%</p><p class="depth0">of shares outstanding (100)............................</p><p class="depth0">===========</p><p class="depth0">Earnings and profits attributable to block............      $7,500</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that in respect of the block Green includes in his gross income under section 951 the total amount of $2,800 for 1965 and 1966, and because of such inclusion the amount of $2,800 which was distributed to Green by F on January 15, 1967, is excluded from his gross income under section 959(a)(1). Accordingly, the earnings and profits of F attributable to the block are $7,000, determined as follows:
Earnings and profits attributable to the block, as computed       $7,500</p><p class="depth0">in example (1).............................................Minus:</p><p class="depth0">Excess of amount included in Green's gross income under            500</p><p class="depth0">section 951 ($2,800), over portion thereof which resulted</p><p class="depth0">in an exclusion under section 959(a)(1) ($2,300).........</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Earnings and profits attributable to block............       7,000</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that on each day beginning on January 1, 1966 (the date controlled foreign corporation G was organized) through January 1, 1968, F owns 80 of the 100 outstanding shares of the only class of G stock. Since, by reason of his ownership of 25 shares of F stock, Green owns within the meaning of section 958(a)(2) the equivalent of 20 shares of G stock (\25/100\ of 80 shares), G is a lower tier corporation referred to in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(a) of this section. If Green had sold the 20 shares of G stock on January 1, 1968, the date he actually sold the block of F stock, the conditions of paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.1248-1 would be satisfied in respect of the G stock, and, accordingly, the conditions of paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section must be satisfied. Assume further that such conditions are satisfied, that G uses the calendar year as its taxable year, and that the earnings and profits accumulated by G (computed under paragraph (d) of this section) are

$19,000 for 1966 and $21,000 for 1967. The earnings and profits of F and of G attributable to the block are $15,500, determined as follows:
Sum of earnings and profits accumulated by G for period          $40,000</p><p class="depth0">Green owned G stock within the meaning of section 958(a)(2)</p><p class="depth0">($19,000 plus $21,000).....................................Multiplied by:</p><p class="depth0">Number of G shares deemed owned within the meaning of              20%</p><p class="depth0">section 958(a)(2) by Green (20), divided by total number</p><p class="depth0">of G shares outstanding (100)............................</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Earnings and profits of G attributable to block...........      $8,000</p><p class="depth0">Earnings and profits of F attributable to block, as             $7,500</p><p class="depth0">determined in example (1)................................</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Total earnings and profits attributable to block......     $15,000</p><p class="depth0">[T.D. 6779, 29 FR 18131, Dec. 22, 1964, as amended by T.D. 7293, 38 FR 32803, Nov. 28, 1973; T.D. 9345, 72 FR 41445, July 30, 2007]</p>
