                            <p class="depth0">The tier II annuity component of a survivor annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act is increased by 32.5 percent of the percentage increase under section 215(i) of the Social Security Act at the same time that any such increase is payable. The amount of the increase is published in the Federal Register annually. The cost-of-living is payable beginning with the benefit payable for the month of December of the year for which the increase is due. The increase is paid in the January payment. In addition, in determining the amount of the tier II component at the time the survivor annuity begins, all cost-of-living increases that were applied or would have been applied after the employee's annuity beginning date or death and prior to the surviving annuity beginning date are taken into consideration.</p>
