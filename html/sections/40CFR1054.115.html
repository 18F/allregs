                            <p class="depth0">The following requirements apply with respect to engines that are  required to meet the emission standards of this part:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Crankcase emissions. Crankcase emissions may not be discharged  directly into the ambient atmosphere from any engine throughout its  useful life, except as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Snowthrower engines may discharge crankcase emissions to the  ambient atmosphere if the emissions are added to the exhaust emissions  (either physically or mathematically) during all emission testing. If  you take advantage of this exception, you must do the following things:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Manufacture the engines so that all crankcase emissions can be  routed into the applicable sampling systems specified in 40 CFR part  1065.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Account for deterioration in crankcase emissions when  determining exhaust deterioration factors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (a), crankcase emissions that are  routed to the exhaust upstream of exhaust aftertreatment during all  operation are not considered to be discharged directly into the ambient  atmosphere.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adjustable parameters. Engines that have adjustable parameters  must meet all the requirements of this part for any adjustment in the  physically adjustable range. An operating parameter is not considered  adjustable if you permanently seal it or if it is not normally  accessible using ordinary tools. We may require that you set adjustable  parameters to any specification within the adjustable range during any  testing, including certification testing, production-line testing, or  in-use testing. You may ask us to limit idle-speed or carburetor  adjustments to a smaller range than the physically adjustable range if  you show us that the engine will not be adjusted outside of this smaller  range during in-use operation without significantly degrading engine  performance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> for  special provisions that apply for handheld engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prohibited controls. You may not design your engines with  emission-control devices, systems, or elements of design that cause or  contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety  while operating. For example, this would apply if the engine emits a  noxious or toxic substance it would otherwise not emit that contributes  to such an unreasonable risk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Defeat devices. You may not equip your engines with a defeat  device. A defeat device is an auxiliary emission control device that  reduces the effectiveness of emission controls under conditions that the  engine may reasonably be expected to encounter during normal operation  and use. This does not apply for altitude kits installed or removed  consistent with Sec.  1054.655. This also does not apply to auxiliary  emission control devices you identify in your application for  certification if any of the following is true:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The conditions of concern were substantially included in the  applicable duty-cycle test procedures described in subpart F of this  part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You show your design is necessary to prevent engine (or  equipment) damage or accidents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The reduced effectiveness applies only to starting the engine.</p>
