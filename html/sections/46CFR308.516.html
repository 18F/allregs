If the failure was in fact inadvertent, the assured shall file a declaration on Form MA-314, prescribed in Sec. 308.536, executed in duplicate, with the Underwriting Agent within seven (7) days from the time knowledge comes to the assured of the insufficiency of the collateral deposit fund or surety bond unless the time for filing such declaration is extended by permission of the Maritime Administrator. If the space provided in the declaration, Form MA-314, for an explanation of the circumstances whereby the assured first had knowledge that the collateral was not sufficient, the assured shall attach to the declaration a detailed statement and include the same by reference in the declaration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If any policy becomes void by reason of the failure of the assured to deposit additional collateral or increase the amount of its surety bond under the provisions of Clause 21, the Maritime Administrator reserves the right to refuse to issue another policy to such assured for a period of ninety (90) days.</p>
