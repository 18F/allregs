The Board may establish, with the approval of the Secretary, such minimum quality and inspection requirements applicable to cherries as will contribute to orderly marketing or be in the public interest. If such requirements are adopted, no handler shall process cherries into manufactured products or sell manufactured products in the current of commerce unless such cherries and/or

such cherries used in the manufacture of products meet the applicable requirements as evidenced by certification acceptable to the Board. The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish rules and regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inspection and certification. Whenever the handling of any cherries requires inspection pursuant to this part, each handler who handles cherries shall cause such cherries to be inspected by the appropriate division of USDA, and certified by it as meeting the applicable requirements of such regulation: Provided, That inspection and certification shall be required for cherries which previously have been so inspected and certified only if such cherries have been regraded, resorted, repackaged, or in any other way further prepared for market. Promptly after inspection and certification, each such handler shall submit, or cause to be submitted, to the Board a copy of the certificate of inspection issued with respect to such cherries.</p><p class="depth2">Research, Market Development and Promotion</p>
