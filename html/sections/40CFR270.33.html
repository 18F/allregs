Any schedules of compliance under this section shall require compliance as soon as possible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interim dates. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, if a permit establishes a schedule of compliance which exceeds 1 year from the date of permit issuance, the schedule shall set forth interim requirements and the dates for their achievement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The time between interim dates shall not exceed 1 year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the time necessary for completion of any interim requirement is more than 1 year and is not readily divisible into stages for completion, the

permit shall specify interim dates for the submission of reports of progress toward completion of the interim requirements and indicate a projected completion date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reporting.
