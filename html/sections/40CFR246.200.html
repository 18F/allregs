                                Sec. 246.200  High-grade paper recovery.

Sec. 246.200-1  Requirements.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">High-grade paper generated by office facilities of over 100 office workers shall be separated at the source of generation, separately collected, and sold for the purpose of recycling.



Sec. 246.200-2  Recommended procedures: High-grade paper recovery fromsmaller offices.</p><p class="depth0">The recovery of high-grade paper generated by office facilities of less than 100 office workers should be investigated in conformance with the following recommended procedures and implemented where feasible.


Sec. 246.200-3  Recommended procedures: Market study.</p><p class="depth0">An investigation of markets should be made by the organization responsible for the sale of recyclable materials in each Federal agency and should include at a minimum:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identifying potential purchasers of the recovered paper through standard market research techniques;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Directly contacting buyers, and determining the buyers' quality specifications, the exact types of paper to be recycled, potential transportation agreements and any minimum quantity criteria; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determining the price that the buyer will pay for the recovered paper and the willingness of the buyer to sign a contract for purchase of the paper at a guaranteed minimum price.


Sec. 246.200-4  Recommended procedures: Levels of separation.</p><p class="depth0">A two-level separation is recommended for most facilities. This separation should consist of (a) high-grade wastepaper and (b) all other waste. Facilities that produce large enough quantities of waste computer paper and cards to make their separation into a separate category cost effective may choose to implement three levels of separation: (1) Computer papers, (2) other high-grade papers, (3) all other wastes.


Sec. 246.200-5  Recommended procedures: Methods of separation and collection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Systems designed to recover high grades of office paper at the source of generation, i.e., the desk, are the desktop system, the two-wastebasket system, and the office centralized container system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> With the desk-top system, recyclable paper is placed by the generator in a container on his desk, while other waste is placed in a wastebasket. With the two-wastebasket system, recyclable paper is placed by the generator in one desk-side wastebasket, and all other waste is placed in another. In the centralized container system, large containers for the collection of recyclables are placed in centralized locations within the office areas of the building. Nonrecyclable waste is placed in desk-side wastebaskets.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The recommended system is the desk-top system because it is designed to maximize recovery of high value material in an economically feasible manner. While the two-wastebasket system and centralized container system have been implemented with success in isolated instances, data indicate that, on the whole, these systems have experienced high levels of contamination, low levels of participation, and low revenues. The desk-top system has been designed to minimize these problems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The precise method of separation and collection used to implement the desk-top system will depend upon such things as the physical layout of the individual facility, the ease of collection, and the projected cost effectiveness of using various methods. The recommended desk-top system is carried out in the following manner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Workers are to deposit high-grade paper into a desk-top tray or other small desk-top holder to be supplied by the agency. This holder should be designed in such a way as to prevent it holding contaminants, such as food or beverage containers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At the office worker's convenience or when the tray is filled, the worker carries the paper to a conveniently located bulk container within the office area. This large container should be located in an area the worker frequents in the normal course of business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In locations where computer cards and printouts are to be collected separately, the receptacle for these wastes should be near the computer terminal or in some other logical, centrally located place.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Collection of the high-grade paper from the bulk containers in the office area should be performed by the janitorial or general maintenance service.


The number of locations and the frequency of collection of these containers will be determined by office size and maintenance staff capacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Mixed paper and some high-grade office papers have also been recovered for recycling by hand-picking in an individual building's trash room or at a centralized facility serving several buildings. With these hand-picking systems, recyclable waste is not separated at the source of generation, but is mixed with other waste in the usual manner and removed to a centralized location where recyclable paper is picked out of the mixed waste by hand. Facilities may choose to use this method of high-grade paper recovery if it is shown by analysis to be economically preferable to source separation.


Sec. 246.200-6  Recommended procedures: Storage.</p><p class="depth2">Among the alternatives for paper storage are on-site bailing, the use of stationary compactors, or storage in corrugated boxes or normal waste containers. Stored paper should be protected from fire, inclement weather, theft, and vandalism.


Sec. 246.200-7  Recommended procedures: Transportation.</p><p class="depth2">Transportation to market may be supplied by the facility, by a private hauler, or by the purchaser. Collection of the recyclable paper should be on a regular, established schedule.


Sec. 246.200-8  Recommended procedures: Cost analysis.</p><p class="depth2">After potential markets have been located (but prior to initiation of formal bidding procedures), preliminary determinations of various separation methods, storage, and transportation costs have been made, and estimated tonnages of both recoverable high-grade paper and residual solid waste have been established, an analysis should be conducted which compares the costs of the present waste collection and disposal system with the proposed segregated systems. At a minimum, the study should include all capital, operating and overhead costs and take into account credits for revenue from paper sales and savings from diverting recycled materials from disposal. Potential costs to upgrade collection and disposal practices to comply with EPA's Guidelines for the Storage and Collection of Residential, Commercial and Institutional Solid Wastes (40 CFR part 243) and Thermal Processing and Land Disposal Guidelines (40 CFR parts 240 and 241) should be included in the analysis. In formulating a separation system and evaluating its costs, every effort should be made to use janitorial and waste collection resources efficiently. This cost analysis should enable the facility to determine the most cost effective method of implementing the requirement of this part.


Sec. 246.200-9  Recommended procedures: Contracts.</p><p class="depth2">Formal bids should be requested for purchase of the recovered materials, such bids being solicited in conformance with bidding procedures established for the responsible agency. Contracts should include the buyer's quality specifications, quantity and transportation agreements, a guarantee that the material will be accepted for one year or more, and a guaranteed minimum purchase price.


Sec. 246.200-10  Recommended procedures: Public information and education.</p><p class="depth2">A well-organized and well-executed public information and education program explaining the justification, goals, methods and level of separation should be conducted to inform and motivate office personnel and secure their cooperation in separating their waste. This public information and education program should precede the program and continue on a regular basis for its duration.</p>
