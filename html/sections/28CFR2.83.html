                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All grants of parole shall be conditioned on the development of  a suitable release plan and the approval of that plan by the Commission.  A parole certificate shall not be issued until a release plan has been  approved by the Commission. In the case of mandatory release, the  Commission shall review each prisoner's release plan to determine  whether the imposition of any special conditions should be ordered to  promote the prisoner's rehabilitation and protect the public safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a parole date has been granted, but the prisoner has not  submitted a proposed release plan, the appropriate correctional or  supervision staff shall assist the prisoner in formulating a release  plan for investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> After investigation by a Supervision Officer, the proposed  release plan shall be submitted to the Commission 30 days prior to the  prisoner's parole or mandatory release date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A Commissioner may retard a parole date for purposes of release  planning for up to 120 days without a hearing. If efforts to formulate  an acceptable release plan prove futile by the expiration of such  period, or if the Offender Supervision staff reports that there are  insufficient resources to provide effective supervision for the  individual in question, the Commission shall be promptly notified in a  detailed report. If the Commission does not order the prisoner to be  paroled, the Commission shall suspend the grant of parole and conduct a  reconsideration hearing on the next available docket. Following such  reconsideration hearing, the Commission may deny parole if it finds that  the release of the prisoner without a suitable plan would fail to meet  the criteria set forth in Sec.  2.73. However, if the prisoner  subsequently presents an acceptable release plan, the Commission may  reopen the case and issue a new grant of parole.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The following shall be considered in the formulation of a  suitable release plan:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Evidence that the parolee will have an acceptable residence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evidence that the parolee will be legitimately employed as soon  as released; provided, that in special circumstances, the requirement  for immediate employment upon release may be waived by the Commission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Evidence that the necessary aftercare will be available for  parolees who are ill, or who have any other demonstrable problems for  which special care is necessary, such as hospital facilities or other  domiciliary care; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Evidence of availability of, and acceptance in, a community  program in those cases where parole has been granted conditioned upon  acceptance or participation in a specific community program.</p>
