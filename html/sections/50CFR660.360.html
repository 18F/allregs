                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Federal recreational groundfish regulations are not  intended to supersede any more restrictive state recreational groundfish  regulations relating to federally-managed groundfish. The bag limits  include fish taken in both state and Federal waters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Gear restrictions. The only types of fishing gear authorized for  recreational fishing are hook-and-line and spear. Spears may be  propelled by hand or by mechanical means. More fishery-specific gear  restrictions may be required by state as noted in paragraph (c) of this  section (e.g. California's recreational ``other flatfish'' fishery).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> State-specific recreational fishery management measures. Federal  recreational groundfish regulations are not intended to supersede any  more restrictive State recreational groundfish regulations relating to  federally-managed groundfish. Off the coast of Washington, Oregon, and  California, boat limits apply, whereby each fisher aboard a vessel may  continue to use angling gear until the combined daily limits of  groundfish for all licensed and juvenile anglers aboard has been  attained (additional state restrictions on boat limits may apply).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(iv)</em> of this section. In the Pacific halibut  fisheries, retention of groundfish is governed in part by annual  management measures for Pacific halibut fisheries, which are published  in the Federal Register. The following seasons, closed areas, sub-limits  and size limits apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Recreational groundfish conservation areas off Washington--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  North coast recreational yelloweye rockfish conservation area.  Recreational fishing for groundfish and halibut is prohibited within the  North Coast Recreational Yelloweye Rockfish Conservation Area (YRCA). It  is unlawful for recreational fishing vessels to take and retain,  possess, or land groundfish taken with recreational gear within the  North Coast Recreational YRCA. A vessel fishing in the North Coast  Recreational YRCA may not be in possession of any groundfish.  Recreational vessels may transit through the North Coast Recreational  YRCA with or without groundfish on board. The North Coast Recreational  YRCA is defined by latitude and longitude coordinates specified at Sec.  660.70, subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> South coast recreational yelloweye rockfish conservation area.  Recreational fishing for groundfish and halibut is prohibited within the  South Coast Recreational YRCA. It is unlawful for recreational fishing  vessels to take and retain, possess, or land groundfish taken with  recreational gear within the South Coast Recreational YRCA. A vessel  fishing in the South Coast Recreational YRCA may not be in possession of  any groundfish.

A vessel fishing in  the Westport Offshore Recreational YRCA may not be in possession of any  groundfish. Recreational vessels may transit through the Westport  Offshore Recreational YRCA with or without groundfish on board. The  Westport Offshore Recreational YRCA is defined by latitude and longitude  coordinates specified at Sec. 660.70, subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Recreational rockfish conservation area.

It is unlawful to take and retain, possess, or land  groundfish taken with recreational gear within the recreational RCA  unless otherwise stated. A vessel fishing in the recreational RCA may  not be in possession of any groundfish unless otherwise stated. [For  example, if a vessel participates in the recreational salmon fishery  within the RCA, the vessel cannot be in possession of groundfish while  in the RCA. The vessel may, however, on the same trip fish for and  retain groundfish shoreward of the RCA on the return trip to port.]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> West of the Bonilla-Tatoosh line between the U.S. border with  Canada and the Queets River (Washington state Marine Area 3 and 4),  recreational fishing for groundfish is prohibited seaward of a boundary  line approximating the 20 fm (37 m) depth contour from May 9 through  Labor Day, except on days when the Pacific halibut fishery is open in  this area it is lawful to retain, lingcod, Pacific cod and sablefish  seaward of the 20 fm (37 m) boundary.

It is unlawful to take and retain, possess, or  land groundfish taken with recreational gear within the recreational  RCA. A vessel fishing in the recreational RCA may not be in possession  of any groundfish. [For example, if a vessel fishes in the recreational  salmon fishery within the RCA, the vessel cannot be in possession of  groundfish while in the RCA. The vessel may, however, on the same trip  fish for and retain groundfish shoreward of the RCA on the return trip  to port.] Off Oregon, from April 1 through September 30, recreational  fishing for groundfish is prohibited seaward of a recreational RCA  boundary line approximating the 40 fm (73 m) depth contour.

Between the  Columbia River and Humbug Mountain, during days open to the ``all- depth'' sport halibut fisheries, when Pacific halibut are onboard the  vessel, no groundfish may be taken and retained, possessed or landed,  except sablefish and Pacific cod. ``All-depth'' season days are  established in the annual management measures for Pacific halibut  fisheries, which are published in the Federal Register and are announced  on the NMFS Pacific halibut hotline, 1-800-662-9825.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Taking and retaining yelloweye rockfish is prohibited at all  times and in all areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(i)</em> of this section. Recreational spearfishing for all federally- managed groundfish, is exempt from closed areas and seasons, consistent  with Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations. This exemption  applies only to recreational vessels and divers provided no other  fishing gear, except spearfishing gear, is on board the vessel.  California state law may provide regulations similar to Federal  regulations for the following state-managed species: Ocean whitefish,  California sheephead, and all greenlings of the genus Hexagrammos. Kelp  greenling is the only federally-managed greenling. Retention of cowcod,  yelloweye rockfish, bronzespotted rockfish, and canary rockfish is  prohibited in the recreational fishery seaward of California all year in  all areas. For each person engaged in recreational fishing in the EEZ  seaward of California, the following closed areas, seasons, bag limits,  and size limits apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Recreational groundfish conservation areas off California. A  Groundfish Conservation Area (GCA), a type of closed area, is a  geographic area defined by coordinates expressed in degrees latitude and  longitude. The following GCAs apply to participants in California's  recreational fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Recreational rockfish conservation areas.

Fishing for groundfish with recreational gear is prohibited within the  recreational RCA, except that recreational fishing for ``other  flatfish'' is permitted within the recreational RCA as specified in  paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section. It is unlawful to take and retain,  possess, or land groundfish taken with recreational gear within the  recreational RCA, unless otherwise authorized in this section. A vessel  fishing in the recreational RCA may not be in possession of any species  prohibited by the   restrictions that apply within the recreational RCA. [For example, if a  vessel fishes in the recreational salmon fishery within the RCA, the  vessel cannot be in possession of rockfish while in the RCA.
