                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Secretary may designate as an experimental population a population of endangered or threatened species that has been or will be released

into suitable natural habitat outside the species' current natural range (but within its probable historic range, absent a finding by the Director in the extreme case that the primary habitat of the species has been unsuitably and irreversibly altered or destroyed), subject to the further conditions specified in this section; provided, that all designations of experimental populations must proceed by regulation adopted in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553 and the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Before authorizing the release as an experimental population of any population (including eggs, propagules, or individuals) of an endangered or threatened species, and before authorizing any necessary transportation to conduct the release, the Secretary must find by regulation that such release will further the conservation of the species. In making such a finding the Secretary shall utilize the best scientific and commercial data available to consider:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any possible adverse effects on extant populations of a species as a result of removal of individuals, eggs, or propagules for introduction elsewhere;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The likelihood that any such experimental population will become established and survive in the foreseeable future;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The relative effects that establishment of an experimental population will have on the recovery of the species; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The extent to which the introduced population may be affected by existing or anticipated Federal or State actions or private activities within or adjacent to the experimental population area.
The Secretary may issue a permit under section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Act, if appropriate under the standards set out in subsections 10(d) and (j) of the Act, to allow acts necessary for the establishment and maintenance of an experimental population.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any regulation promulgated under paragraph (a) of this section shall provide:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appropriate means to identify the experimental population, including, but not limited to, its actual or proposed location, actual or anticipated migration, number of specimens released or to be released, and other criteria appropriate to identify the experimental population(s);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A finding, based solely on the best scientific and commercial data available, and the supporting factual basis, on whether the experimental population is, or is not, essential to the continued existence of the species in the wild;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Management restrictions, protective measures, or other special management concerns of that population, which may include but are not limited to, measures to isolate and/or contain the experimental population designated in the regulation from natural populations; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A process for periodic review and evaluation of the success or failure of the release and the effect of the release on the conservation and recovery of the species.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Fish and Wildlife Service shall consult with appropriate State fish and wildlife agencies, local governmental entities, affected Federal agencies, and affected private landowners in developing and implementing experimental population rules. When appropriate, a public meeting will be conducted with interested members of the public. Any regulation promulgated pursuant to this section shall, to the maximum extent practicable, represent an agreement between the Fish and Wildlife Service, the affected State and Federal agencies and persons holding any interest in land which may be affected by the establishment of an experimental population.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any population of an endangered species or a threatened species determined by the Secretary to be an experimental population in accordance with this subpart shall be identified by special rule in Sec. Sec. 17.84-17.86 as appropriate and separately listed in Sec. 17.11(h) (wildlife) or Sec. 17.12(h) (plants) as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Secretary may designate critical habitat as defined in section (3)(5)(A) of the Act for an essential experimental population as determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Any designation of critical habitat for an essential experimental population will be made in accordance with section 4 of the Act. No designation of

critical habitat will be made for nonessential populations. In those situations where a portion or all of an essential experimental population overlaps with a natural population of the species during certain periods of the year, no critical habitat shall be designated for the area of overlap unless implemented as a revision to critical habitat of the natural population for reasons unrelated to the overlap itself.</p>
