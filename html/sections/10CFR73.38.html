Records maintained in any database(s) must be available for  the NRC review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a licensee administratively withdraws an individual's  unescorted access or access authorization status caused by a delay in  completing any portion of the background investigation or for a licensee  initiated evaluation, or re-evaluation that is not under the  individual's control, the licensee shall record this administrative  action to withdraw the individual's unescorted access or unescorted  access authorization and shall share this information with other  licensees subject to this section. However, licensees shall not document  this administrative withdrawal as denial or unfavorable termination and  shall not respond to a suitable inquiry conducted under the provisions  of 10 CFR part 26, a background investigation conducted under the  provisions of this section, or any other inquiry or investigation as  denial nor unfavorable termination. Upon favorable completion of the  background investigation element that caused the   administrative withdrawal, the licensee shall immediately ensure that  any matter that could link the individual to the administrative action  is eliminated from the subject individual's access authorization or  personnel record and other records, except if a review of the  information obtained or developed causes the reviewing official to  unfavorably terminate or deny the individual's unescorted access.
