                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of overcurrent protection for conductors is  to open the electric circuit if the current reaches a value that will  cause an excessive or dangerous temperature in the conductor or  conductor insulation. A grounded conductor is protected from overcurrent  if a protective device of a suitable rating or setting is in each  ungrounded conductor of the same circuit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Overcurrent protection of conductors. Each conductor must be  protected in accordance with its current carrying capacity, except a  conductor for the following circuits which must meet the following  listed subparts of this chapter:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Propulsion circuits, Subpart 111.35.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Steering circuits, subchapter F of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Motor circuits, Subpart 111.70.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Flexible cord and fixture wire for lighting circuits, Subpart  111.75.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Switchboard circuits, Subpart 111.30.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fuses and circuitbreakers. If the allowable current-carrying  capacity of the conductor does not correspond to a standard rating for  fuses or circuitbreakers that meets Section 240.6 of NFPA NEC 2002 or  IEC 60092-202 (both incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 110.10-1),  then the next larger such rating is acceptable, except that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This rating must not be larger than 150 percent of the current- carrying capacity of the conductor; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The effect of temperature on the operation of fuses and  thermally controlled circuitbreakers must be taken into consideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Parallel overcurrent protective devices. An overcurrent  protective device must not be connected in parallel with another  overcurrent protective device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Thermal devices. No thermal cutout, thermal relay, or other  device not designed to open a short circuit may be used for protection  of a conductor against overcurrent due to a short circuit or ground,  except in a motor circuit as described in Article 430 of NFPA NEC 2002  or in IEC 60092-202.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Ungrounded conductors. A fuse or overcurrent trip unit of a  circuit breaker must be in each ungrounded conductor. A branch switch or  circuit breaker must open all conductors of the circuit, except grounded  conductors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Grounded conductor. An overcurrent device must not be in a  permanently grounded conductor, except:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An overcurrent device that simultaneously opens all conductors  of the circuit, unless prohibited by Sec.  111.05-17 for the bus-tie  feeder connecting the emergency and main switchboards; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For motor-running protection described in Article 430 of NFPA  NEC 2002 or in IEC 60092-202.
