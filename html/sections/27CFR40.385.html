The appropriate TTB officer may approve an alternate method or procedure, subject to stated conditions, when the appropriate TTB officer finds that--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Good cause has been shown for the use of the alternate method or procedure,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed method or procedure, and affords equivalent security to the revenue, and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any provision of law, and will not result in an increase in cost to the Government or hinder the effective administration of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2">No alternate method or procedure relating to the giving of any bond or to the assessment, payment, or collection of tax, shall be authorized under this section. A manufacturer who desires to employ an alternate method or procedure shall submit a written application, in triplicate, to the appropriate TTB officer. The application shall specifically describe the proposed alternate method or procedure, and shall set forth the reasons therefor. Alternate methods or procedures shall not be employed until the application has been approved by the appropriate TTB officer. The manufacturer shall, during the period of authorization of an alternate method or procedure, comply with the terms of the approved application. Authorization for any alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever, in the judgment of the appropriate TTB officer, the revenue is jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is hindered. Any authorization of the appropriate TTB officer under this section shall be retained as part of the manufacturer's record in accordance with this subpart.</p>
