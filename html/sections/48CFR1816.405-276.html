                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Interim award fee payments. The amount of an interim award fee  payment (see 1816.405-273(b)) is limited to the lesser of the interim  evaluation score or 80 percent of the fee allocated to that interim  period less any provisional payments (see paragraph (b) of this  subsection) made during the period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Provisional award fee payments. Provisional award fee payments  are payments made within evaluation periods prior to an interim or final  evaluation for that period. Provisional payments may be included in the  contract and should be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. For a service  contract, the total amount of award fee available in an evaluation  period that may be provisionally paid is the lesser of a percentage  stipulated in the contract (but not exceeding 80 percent) or the prior  period's evaluation score. For an end item contract, the total amount of  provisional payments in a period is limited to a percentage not to  exceed 80 percent of the prior interim period's evaluation score.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fee payment. The Fee Determination Official's rating for both  interim and final evaluations will be provided to the contractor within  45 calendar days of the end of the period being evaluated. Any fee,  interim or final, due the contractor will be paid no later than 60  calendar days after the end of the period being evaluated.  [63 FR 13134, Mar. 18, 1998]</p>
