(1) [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Hose--four specimens each 6 inches long by \1/2\-inch wide by thickness of the hose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Flame-test apparatus. The principal parts of the apparatus within and/or appended to a 21-inch cubical test gallery are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A support stand with a ring clamp and wire gauze.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A Pittsburgh-Universal Bunsen-type burner (inside diameter of burner tube 11 mm.), or equivalent, mounted in a burner placement guide in such a manner that the burner may be placed beneath the test specimen, or pulled away from it by an external knob on the front panel of the test gallery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A variable-speed electric fan and an ASME flow nozzle (16-8\1/2\ inches reduction) to attain constant air velocities at any speed between 50-500 feet a minute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An electric timer or stopwatch to measure the duration of the tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A mirror mounted inside the test gallery to permit a rear view of the test specimen through the viewing door.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Mounting of test specimen. The specimen shall be clamped in a support with its free end centered 1 inch above the burner top. The longitudinal axis shall be horizontal and the transverse axis inclined at 45[deg] to the horizontal. Under the test specimen shall be clamped a piece of 20-mesh iron-wire gauze, 5 inches square, in a horizontal position \1/4\-inch below the pulley cover edge of the specimen and with about \1/2\-inch of the specimen extending beyond the edge of the gauze.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedure for flame tests. (1) The Bunsen burner, retracted from the test position, shall be adjusted to give a blue flame 3 inches in height with natural gas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Bunsen burner, retracted from the test position, shall be adjusted to give a blue flame 3 inches in height with natural gas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The observation door of the gallery shall be closed for the entire test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The burner flame shall be applied to the free end of the specimen for 1 minute in still air.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> At the end of 1 minute the burner flame shall be removed, the ventilating fan turned on to give an air current having a velocity of 300 feet per minute, and the duration of flame measured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> After the test specimen ceases to flame, it shall remain in the air current for at least 3 minutes to determine the presence and duration of afterglow. If a glowing specimen exhibits flame within 3 minutes the duration of flame shall be added to the duration of flame obtained according to paragraph (d) (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Test requirements. The tests of the four specimens cut from any sample shall not result in either duration of flame exceeding an average of 1 minute after removal of the applied flame or afterglow exceeding an average of 3 minutes duration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Acceptance markings. (1) [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Hose--hose conduit accepted by MSHA as flame-resistant shall be marked as follows: Impressed letters, raised letters on depressed background, or printed letters with the words ``Flame-Resistant, USMSHA No. ----'' at intervals not exceeding 3 feet. This number will be assigned to the manufacturer after the sample has passed the tests. The letters and numbers shall be at least \1/4\-inch high.
