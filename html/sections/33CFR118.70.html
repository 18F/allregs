                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Swing span lights on through bridges. Each swing span of every  through swing bridge shall be lighted with three lanterns so that when  viewed from an approaching vessel the swing span when closed will  display three red lights on top of the span structure, one at each end  of the span on the same level and one at the center of the span no less  than 10 feet above the other two lights, and when open for navigation  will display three green lights on top of the span structure in a line  parallel to and directly above the long axis of the span, one at each  end of the span on the same level, and one at the center of the span no  less than 10 feet above the other two lights. Each lantern shall show  through alternate red and green horizontal arcs of 60[deg] each, the  axis of adjacent arcs to be 90[deg] from each other; each light shall be  securely mounted with the axis of the green arcs parallel to the long  axis of the swing span.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Swing span lights on deck and half-through bridges. Each swing  span of every deck, half-through, girder, or similar type swing bridge  shall be lighted with four lanterns so that when viewed from an  approaching vessel the swing span when closed will display one red light  at each end, and when open to navigation will display two green lights  from each end. Each lantern shall show through one red and two green  horizontal arcs of 60[deg] each, the axis of each green arc to be  90[deg] from the axis of the red arc; each light shall be securely  mounted at the floor level of the span as near to the side of the span  as practicable with the axis of the red light normal to the long axis of  the swing span and so that the red light will be visible from an  approaching vessel when the span is closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pier lights. Every swing bridge shall be lighted so that each  end of the piers adjacent to the navigable channel (draw piers) or each  end of their protection piers (draw pier protection piers) and each end  of the piers protecting the pivot pier (pivot protection pier) will be  marked by a red light. Each of these lights shall show through a  horizontal arc of 180[deg] and shall be mounted as low as practicable  below the floor level of the swing span to show 90[deg] on either side  of a line parallel to the axis of the channel so as to be visible from  an approaching vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Axis lights. Every swing bridge shall be lighted so that the  intersection of the bridge axis with each side of the pivot pier and the  channel side of each draw pier which has a protection pier will be  marked by a red light: Provided, That if the draw and draw protection  piers are straight along their channel faces these lights shall not be  required. Each such light shall show through a horizontal arc of  180[deg], and shall be mounted on the navigable channel face of the pier  as low as practicable below the floor level of the swing span to show  90[deg] either side of a line normal to the axis of the navigable  channel so as to be visible from an approaching vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Omission of lights. Where the permanent navigable channel passes  on only one side of the pivot pier of any swing span, the District  Commander may authorize the omission of lighting of the unused channel.</p>
