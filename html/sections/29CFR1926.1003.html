                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General--(1) Purpose. When overhead protection is provided on wheel-type agricultural and industrial tractors, the overhead protection shall be designed and installed according to the requirements contained in this section. The provisions of 29 CFR 1926.1001 for rubber-tired dozers and rubber-tired loaders may be used instead of the standards contained in this section. The purpose of this standard is to minimize the possibility of operator injury resulting from overhead hazards such as flying and falling objects, and at the same time to minimize the possibility of operator injury from the cover itself in the event of accidental upset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Purpose. When overhead protection is provided on wheel-type agricultural and industrial tractors, the overhead protection shall be designed and installed according to the requirements contained in this section. The provisions of 29 CFR 1926.1001 for rubber-tired dozers and rubber-tired loaders may be used instead of the standards contained in this section. The purpose of this standard is to minimize the possibility of operator injury resulting from overhead hazards such as flying and falling objects, and at the same time to minimize the possibility of operator injury from the cover itself in the event of accidental upset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applicability. This standard applies to wheel-type agricultural and industrial tractors used in construction work (see 29 CFR 1926.1002(b) and (j)). In the case of machines to which 29 CFR 1926.604 (relating to site clearing) also applies, the overhead protection may be either the type of protection provided in 29 CFR 1926.604, or the type of protection provided by this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Overhead protection. When overhead protection is installed on wheel-type agricultural or industrial tractors used in construction work, it shall meet the requirements of this paragraph. The overhead protection may be constructed of a solid material. When grid or mesh is used, the largest permissible opening shall be such that the maximum circle that can be inscribed between the elements of the grid or mesh is 1.5 in. (38 mm) in diameter. The overhead protection shall not be installed in such a way as to become a hazard in the case of upset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Test procedures--general. (1) The requirements of 29 CFR 1926.1002(d), (e), and (f) shall be met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The requirements of 29 CFR 1926.1002(d), (e), and (f) shall be met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Static and dynamic rear load application shall be distributed uniformly along a maximum projected dimension of 27 in. (686 mm), and a maximum area of 160 sq. in. (1,032 sq. cm), normal to the direction of load application. The load shall be applied to the upper extremity of the frame at the point that is midway between the centerline of the seat and the inside of the frame upright.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The static and dynamic side load application shall be distributed uniformly along a maximum projected dimension of 27 in. (686 mm), and a maximum area of 160 sq. in. (1,032 sq. cm), normal to the direction of load application. The direction of load application is the same as in 29 CFR 1926.1002 (g) and (h). To simulate the characteristics of the structure during an upset, the center of load application may be located from a point 24 in. (610 mm) (K) forward to 12 in. (305 mm) (L) rearward of the front of the seat backrest, to best use the structural strength (see Figure W-25).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Drop test procedures. (1) The same frame shall be subjected to the drop test following either the static or dynamic test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The same frame shall be subjected to the drop test following either the static or dynamic test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A solid steel sphere or material of equivalent spherical dimension weighing 100 lb (45.4 kg) shall be dropped once from a height 10 ft (3.08 m) above the overhead cover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The point of impact shall be on the overhead cover at a point within the zone of protection as shown in Figure W-26, which is furthest removed from major structural members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Crush test procedure. (1) The same frame shall be subjected to the crush test following the drop test and static or dynamic test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The same frame shall be subjected to the crush test following the drop test and static or dynamic test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The test load shall be applied as shown in Figure W-27, with the seat positioned as specified in 29 CFR 1926.1002(d)(4). Loading cylinders shall be mounted pivotally at both ends. Loads applied by each cylinder shall be equal within two percent, and the sum of the loads of the two cylinders shall be two times the tractor weight as set

forth in 29 CFR 1926.1002(e)(1). The maximum width of the beam illustrated in Figure W-27 shall be 6 in. (152 mm).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Performance requirements (1)--General. The performance requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1926.1002(i)(2), (3), and (4) shall be met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Drop test performance requirements. (i) Instantaneous deformation due to impact of the sphere shall not enter the protected zone as illustrated in Figures W-25, W-26, and W-28.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Instantaneous deformation due to impact of the sphere shall not enter the protected zone as illustrated in Figures W-25, W-26, and W-28.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In addition to the dimensions set forth in 29 CFR 1926.1002(i)(1)(i), the following dimensions apply to Figure W-28:
H = 17.5 in. (444 mm); andJ = 2 in. (50.8 mm), measured from the outer periphery of the steering wheel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Crush test performance requirements. The protected zone as described in Figure W-28 must not be violated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Source of standard. This standard is derived from, and restates, in part, the portions of Society of Automotive Engineers (``SAE'') standard J167-1970 (``Protective frame with overhead protection--test procedures and performance requirements''), which pertain to overhead protection requirements. The SAE standard appears in the 1971 SAE Handbook, which may be examined at any OSHA regional office.
