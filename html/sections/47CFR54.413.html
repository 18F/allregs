                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. For purposes of this subpart, the term ``Tribal Link  Up'' means an assistance program for eligible residents of Tribal lands  seeking telecommunications service from a telecommunications carrier  that is receiving high-cost support on Tribal lands, pursuant to subpart  D of this part, that provides:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A 100 percent reduction, up to $100, of the customary charge for  commencing telecommunications service for a single telecommunications  connection at a subscriber's principal place of residence imposed by an  eligible telecommunications carrier that is also receiving high-cost  support on Tribal lands, pursuant to subpart D of this part. For  purposes of this subpart, a ``customary charge for commencing  telecommunications service'' is the ordinary charge an eligible  telecommunications carrier imposes and collects from all subscribers to  initiate service with that eligible telecommunications carrier. A charge  imposed only on qualifying low-income consumers to initiate service is  not a customary charge for commencing telecommunications service.  Activation charges   routinely waived, reduced, or eliminated with the purchase of additional  products, services, or minutes are not customary charges eligible for  universal service support; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A deferred schedule of payments of the customary charge for  commencing telecommunications service for a single telecommunications  connection at a subscriber's principal place of residence imposed by an  eligible telecommunications carrier that is also receiving high-cost  support on Tribal lands, pursuant to subpart D of this part, for which  the eligible resident of Tribal lands does not pay interest. The  interest charges not assessed to the eligible resident of tribal lands  shall be for a customary charge for connecting telecommunications  service of up to $200 and such interest charges shall be deferred for a  period not to exceed one year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An eligible resident of Tribal lands may receive the benefit of  the Tribal Link Up program for a second or subsequent time only for  otherwise qualifying commencement of telecommunications service at a  principal place of residence with an address different from the address  for which Tribal Link Up assistance was provided previously.
