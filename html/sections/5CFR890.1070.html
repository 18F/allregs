                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Debarring official reviews entire administrative record. After  the provider submits the information and evidence authorized or required  by Sec. 890.1069, the debarring official shall review the entire  official record to determine if the contest can be decided without  additional administrative proceedings, or if an evidentiary hearing is  required to resolve disputed material facts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Previously determined facts. Any facts relating to the basis for  the proposed penalties and assessments that were determined in prior due  process proceedings are binding on the debarring official in deciding  the contest. ``Prior due process proceedings'' are those set forth in  Sec. 890.1025(a)(1) through (4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Deciding the contest without further proceedings. To decide the  contest without further administrative proceedings, the debarring  official must determine that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The preponderance of the evidence in the administrative record  as a whole demonstrates that the provider committed a sanctionable  violation described in Sec. 890.1061; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The evidentiary record contains no bona fide dispute of any fact  material to the proposed financial sanction. A ``material fact'' is a  fact essential to determining whether a provider committed a  sanctionable violation for which penalties and assessments may be  imposed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Final decision without further proceedings. If the debarring  official determines that paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section  both apply, a final decision may be issued, imposing financial sanctions  in amounts not exceeding those proposed in the notice to the provider  described in Sec. 890.1066.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Insufficient evidence. If the debarring official determines that  a preponderance of the evidence does not demonstrate that the provider  committed a sanctionable violation described in Sec. 890.1061, the  notice of proposed sanctions described in Sec. 890.1066 must be  withdrawn.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Disputed material facts. If the debarring official determines  that the administrative record contains a bona fide dispute about any  fact material to the proposed sanction, he must refer the case for a  fact-finding hearing to resolve the disputed fact or facts. The  provisions of Sec. 890.1027(b) and (c), 890.1028, and 890.1029(a) and  (b) will govern such a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Final decision after fact-finding hearing. After receiving the  report of the fact-finding hearing, the debarring official must apply  the provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section to reach  a final decision on the provider's contest.</p>
