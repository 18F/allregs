                            <p class="depth0">A majority of the members of the Board, or alternates acting for members, shall constitute a quorum and any action of the Board shall require the concurring votes of at least a majority of those present and voting. At assembled meetings all votes shall be cast in person. For routine and noncontroversial matters which do not require deliberation and the exchange of views, and in matters of an emergency nature when there is not enough time to call an assembled meeting of the Board, the Board may also take action upon the concurring votes of a majority of its members by mail, telegraph or telephone, but any such action by telephone shall be confirmed promptly in writing.
