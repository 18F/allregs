                                Sec. 1.1014-3  Other basis rules.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Fair market value. For purposes of this section and Sec.  1.1014-1, the value of property as of the date of the decedent's death  as appraised for the purpose of the Federal estate tax or the alternate  value as appraised for such purpose, whichever is applicable, shall be  deemed to be its fair market value. If no estate tax return is required  to be filed under section 6018 (or under section 821 or 864 of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1939), the value of the property appraised as  of the date of the decedent's death for the purpose of State inheritance  or transmission taxes shall be deemed to be its fair market value and no  alternate valuation date shall be applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Property acquired from a decedent dying before March 1, 1913. If  the decedent died before March 1, 1913, the fair market value on that  date is taken in lieu of the fair market value on the date of death, but  only to the same extent and for the same purposes as the fair market  value on March 1, 1913, is taken under section 1053.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reinvestments by a fiduciary. The basis of property acquired  after the death of the decedent by a fiduciary as an investment is the  cost or other basis of such property to the fiduciary, and not the fair  market value of such property at the death of the decedent. For example,  the executor of an estate purchases stock of X company at a price of  $100 per share with the proceeds of the sale of property acquired from a  decedent. At the date of the decedent's death the fair market value of  such stock was $98 per share. The basis of such stock to the executor or  to a legatee, assuming the stock is distributed, is $100 per share.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reinvestments of property transferred during life. Where  property is   transferred by a decedent during life and the property is sold,  exchanged, or otherwise disposed of before the decedent's death by the  person who acquired the property from the decedent, the general rule  stated in paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1014-1 shall not apply to such  property. However, in such a case, the basis of any property acquired by  such donee in exchange for the original property, or of any property  acquired by the donee through reinvesting the proceeds of the sale of  the original property, shall be the fair market value of the property  thus acquired at the date of the decedent's death (or applicable  alternate valuation date) if the property thus acquired is properly  included in the decedent's gross estate for Federal estate tax purposes.  These rules also apply to property acquired by the donee in any further  exchanges or in further reinvestments. For example, on January 1, 1956,  the decedent made a gift of real property to a trust for the benefit of  his children, reserving to himself the power to revoke the trust at  will. Prior to the decedent's death, the trustee sold the real property  and invested the proceeds in stock of the Y company at $50 per share. At  the time of the decedent's death, the value of such stock was $75 per  share. The corpus of the trust was required to be included in the  decedent's gross estate owing to his reservation of the power of  revocation. The basis of the Y company stock following the decedent's  death is $75 per share. Moreover, if the trustee sold the Y Company  stock before the decedent's death for $65 a share and reinvested the  proceeds in Z company stock which increased in value to $85 per share at  the time of the decedent's death, the basis of the Z company stock  following the decedent's death would be $85 per share.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Alternate valuation dates. Section 1014(a) provides a special  rule applicable in determining the basis of property described in Sec.  1.1014-2 where--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The property is includible in the gross estate of a decedent who  died after October 21, 1942, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The executor elects for estate tax purposes under section 2032,  or section 811(j) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, to value the  decedent's gross estate at the alternate valuation date prescribed in  such sections.  In those cases, the value applicable in determining the basis of the  property is not the value at the date of the decedent's death but (with  certain limitations) the value at the date one year after his death if  not distributed, sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of in the  meantime. If such property was distributed, sold, exchanged, or  otherwise disposed of within one year after the date of the decedent's  death by the person who acquired it from the decedent, the value  applicable in determining the basis is its value as of the date of such  distribution, sale, exchange, or other disposition. For illustrations of  the operation of this paragraph, see the estate tax regulations under  section 2032.</p>
