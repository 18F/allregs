                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. 794(d)], as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, (Section 508) specifies the accessibility standards that apply to all new solicitations and new or existing contracts or orders, regardless of dollar amount, for communications products and services that require a contractor or consultant to produce content in any format that is specifically intended for publication on, or delivery via, an HHS-owned or -funded Web site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Accordingly, before forwarding a request to the contracting/ordering office for the acquisition of communications products and services, including content in any format, such as reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint), or video material that is specifically intended for publication on, or delivery via, an HHS-owned or -funded Web site, the Project Officer shall consult with the OPDIV/STAFF Division (DIV) Section 508 Official or Coordinator, as necessary, to determine the applicability of Section 508, identify applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and resolve any related issues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Based on those discussions, the Project Officer shall provide a statement in the AP (or other acquisition request document)--see 307.7101, as to the applicability of Section 508. If Section 508 applies to an acquisition, the Project Officer shall include the following ``HHS Section 508 Accessibility Standards Notice'' language in a separate, clearly designated section of the SOW/PWS, and any additional information applicable to the acquisition's Section 508 accessibility standards [e.g., the list of applicable accessibility standards of the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) Final Rule (36 CFR Part 1194)]. If an AP does not address these issues, and it appears an acquisition involves Section 508, or if the discussion of Section 508 applicability to the acquisition is inadequate or incomplete, the Contracting Officer shall request that the Project Officer modify the AP accordingly.</p><p class="depth2">HHS Section 508 Accessibility Standards Notice (September 2009)</p><p class="depth2">This contract is subject to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (the Act) of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) Electronic and Information Accessibility Provisions (36 CFR Part 1194). Section 508 of the Act requires that, unless an exception applies, all communications products and services that require a contractor or consultant to produce content in any format that is specifically intended for publication on, or delivery via, a Federally owned or Federally funded Web site permit the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from a Federal agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities.</p><p class="depth4">Note: Information about Section 508 of the Act is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/provisions.htm.</p><p class="depth4">Accordingly, regardless of format, all Web content or communications materials specifically produced for publication on, or delivery via, HHS Web sites, including text, audio, or video, under this contract shall conform to applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. Remediation of any materials that do not comply with the applicable accessibility standards of 36 CFR Part 1194 as set forth herein shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.</p><p class="depth4">The following Section 508 accessibility standards apply to the content or communications material identified in this SOW or PWS:</p><p class="depth4">Note: The Project Officer shall list the applicable accessibility standards of the Access Board Final Rule (36 CFR Part 1194) (e.g., ``36 CFR 1194.21(a)-(j).'' Most Web-based text and communication must meet the accessibility standards in 36 CFR 1194.22, ``Web-based intranet and Internet information and applications.'' Additionally, 36 CFR 1194.41, ``Information, documentation and support,'' and 36 CFR 1194.24 ``Video and multimedia products'' apply to all written, graphical, or broadcast video materials or products produced for HHS, including training. 36 CFR 1194.41(c) specifies that support services for products shall accommodate the communication needs of end-users with disabilities.</p>
