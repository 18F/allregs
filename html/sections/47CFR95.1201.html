                            <p class="depth0">Operation in the MedRadio service is permitted by rule and without  an individual license issued by the FCC. Duly authorized health care  professionals are permitted to operate MedRadio transmitters. Persons  may also operate MedRadio transmitters to the extent the transmitters  are incorporated into implanted or body-worn medical devices that are  used by the person at the direction of a duly authorized health care  professional; this includes medical devices that have been implanted in  that person or placed on the body of that person by or under the  direction of a duly authorized health care professional. Manufacturers  of medical devices that include MedRadio transmitters, and their  representatives, are authorized to operate transmitters in this service  for the purpose of demonstrating such equipment to duly authorized  health care professionals. No entity that is a foreign government or  which is acting in its capacity as a representative of a foreign  government is eligible to operate a MedRadio transmitter. The term  ``duly authorized health care professional'' means a physician or other  individual authorized under state or federal law to provide health care  services. Operations that comply with the requirements of this part may  be conducted under manual or automatic control.</p>
