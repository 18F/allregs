                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Lighting. Each habitable room shall be provided with exterior  windows and/or doors having a total glazed area of not less than 8  percent of the gross floor area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Kitchens, bathrooms, toilet compartments, laundry areas, and  utility rooms may be provided with artificial light in place of windows.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rooms and areas may be combined for the purpose of providing the  required natural lighting provided that at least one half of the common  wall area is open and unobstructed, and the open area is at least equal  to 10 percent of the combined floor area or 25 square feet whichever is  greater.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whole-house ventilation. Each manufactured home must be provided  with whole-house ventilation having a minimum capacity of 0.035 ft\3\/ min/ft\2\ of interior floor space or its hourly average equivalent. This  ventilation capacity must be in addition to any openable window area. In  no case shall the installed ventilation capacity of the system be less  than 50 cfm nor more than 90 cfm. The following criteria must be adhered  to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The ventilation capacity must be provided by a mechanical system  or a combination passive and mechanical system. The ventilation system  or provisions for ventilation must not create a positive pressure in Uo  Value Zone 2 and Zone 3 or a negative pressure condition in Uo Value  Zone 1. Mechanical systems must be balanced. Combination passive and  mechanical systems must have adequately sized inlets or exhaust to  release any unbalanced pressure. Temporary pressure imbalances due to  gusting or high winds are permitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The ventilation system or provisions for ventilation must  exchange air directly with the exterior of the home, except the  ventilation system, or provisions for ventilation must not draw or expel  air with the space underneath the home. The ventilation system or  provisions for ventilation must not draw or expel air into the floor,  wall, or ceiling/roof systems, even if those systems are vented. The  ventilation system must be designed to ensure that outside air is  distributed to all bedrooms and main living areas. The combined use of  undercut doors or transom grills connecting those areas to the room  where the mechanical system is located is deemed to meet this  requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The ventilation system or a portion of the system is permitted  to be integral with the home's heating or cooling system. The system  must be capable of operating independently of the heating or cooling  modes. A ventilation system that is integral with the heating or cooling  system is to be listed as part of the heating and cooling system or  listed as suitable for use with that system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A mechanical ventilation system, or mechanical portion thereof,  must be provided with a manual control, and must be permitted to be  provided with automatic timers or humidistats.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A whole-house ventilation label must be attached to the whole- house ventilation control, must be permanent, and must state: ``WHOLE- HOUSE VENTILATION''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Instructions for correctly operating and maintaining whole-house  ventilation systems must be included with the homeowner's manual. The  instructions must encourage occupants to operate these systems whenever  the home is occupied, and must refer to the labeled whole-house  ventilation control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additional ventilation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least half of the minimum  required glazed area in paragraph (a) of this section shall be openable  directly to the outside of the manufactured home for unobstructed  ventilation. These same ventilation requirements apply to rooms combined  in accordance with Sec. 3280.103(a)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Kitchens shall be provided with a mechanical ventilation system  that is capable of exhausting 100 cfm to the outside of the home. The  exhaust fan shall be located as close as possible to the range or cook  top, but in no case farther than 10 feet horizontally from the range or  cook top.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each bathroom and separate toilet compartment shall be provided  with a mechanical ventilation system capable of exhausting 50 cfm to the  outside of the home. A separate toilet compartment may be provided with  1.5 square feet of openable glazed area in place of mechanical  ventilation, except in Uo value Zone 3.
