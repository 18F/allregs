                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Mineral leases. A lender may consent to the lease of mineral rights and subordinate its lien to the lessee's rights and interests in the mineral activity if the security property will remain suitable as a residence, the lender's security interest will not be adversely affected, and Rural Development's environmental requirements are met. Concurrence by Rural Development prior to consenting to the lease of mineral rights is required, unless otherwise provided by the Agency. Subordination of guaranteed loans to a mineral lease does not entitle the leaseholder to any proceeds from the sale of the security property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the proposed activity is likely to decrease the value of the security property, the lender may consent to the lease only if the borrower assigns 100 percent of the income from the lease to the lender to be applied to reduce the principal balance, and the total rent to be paid is at least equal to the estimated decrease in the market value of the security property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the proposed activity is not likely to decrease the value of the security property, the lender may consent to the lease if the borrower agrees to use any damage compensation received from the lessee to repair damage to the site or dwelling, or to assign it to the lender to be applied to reduce the principal balance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Partial release of security property. A lender may consent to transactions affecting a security property, such as selling or exchanging security property or granting of a right-of-way across the security property, and grant a partial release, provided that the following conditions are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The borrower will receive adequate compensation, and either make a reduction to the principal balance or make improvements to the security property, in order to maintain the current loan-to-value ratio for the guaranteed loan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For sale of security property, the borrower must receive cash in an amount equal to or greater than the value of the security property being sold or interests being conveyed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For exchange of security property, the borrower must receive another parcel of property with value equal to or greater than that being disposed of.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For granting an easement or right-of-way, the borrower must receive benefits that are equal to or greater than the value of the security property being disposed of or interests being conveyed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An appraisal of the security property will be conducted by the lender if the most current appraisal is more than 1 year old or if it does not reflect current market value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The security property, after the transaction is completed, will continue to be an adequate, safe, and sanitary dwelling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Repayment of the guaranteed debt will not be jeopardized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When exchange of all or part of the security property is involved, title clearance will be obtained before release of the existing security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Proceeds from the sale of a portion of the security property, granting an easement or right-of-way, damage compensation, and all similar transactions requiring the lender's consent, will be used in the following order:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To pay customary and reasonable costs related to the transaction that must be paid by the borrower.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To be applied on a prior lien debt, if any.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To be applied to the guaranteed indebtedness or used for improvements to the security property consistent with the purposes and limitations applicable for use of guaranteed loan

funds. The lender must ensure that the proceeds are used as planned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The lender will seek Agency concurrence, unless otherwise provided by the Agency, by submitting documentation supporting the borrower's reason for request, the proposed use of the land with supporting plans, specifications, cost estimates, surveys, disclosures of restrictions, legal description modification, title clearance related to the transaction request, as applicable, and any other documents necessary for the Agency to make a determination.</p>
