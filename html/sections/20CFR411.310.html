                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An entity other than a State VR agency applies by responding to  our Request for Proposal (RFP), which we published in the Commerce  Business Daily and which is available online through the Federal  government's electronic posting system (http://www.eps.gov). This RFP  also is available through SSA's website, http://www.ssa.gov/work. Since  recruitment of ENs will be an ongoing process, the RFP is open and  continuous. The entity must respond in a format prescribed in the RFP  announcement. In its response, the entity must assure SSA that it is  qualified to provide employment services, vocational rehabilitation  services, or other support services to disabled beneficiaries, either  directly or through arrangements with other entities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The PM will solicit service providers and other qualified  entities to respond to the RFP on an ongoing basis. (See Sec. 411.115(k)  for a definition of the PM.) The PM will conduct a preliminary review of  responses to the RFP from applicants located in the PM's service  delivery area and make recommendations to the Commissioner regarding  selection. The Commissioner will decide which applicants will be  approved to serve as ENs under the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> State VR agencies must comply with the requirements in subpart F  of this part to participate as an EN in the Ticket to Work program. (See  Secs. 411.360ff).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> One-stop delivery systems established under subtitle B of title  I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. 2811 et seq.) may  participate in the Ticket to Work program as ENs and do not need to  respond to the RFP. However, in order to participate in the Ticket to  Work program, the one-stop delivery system must enter into an agreement  with the Commissioner to be an EN and must maintain compliance with  general and specific selection criteria as described in Sec. 411.315 in  order to remain an EN.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Organizations administering Vocational Rehabilitation Services  Projects for American Indians with Disabilities authorized under section  121 of part C of title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended  (29 U.S.C. 741), may participate in the Ticket to Work program as ENs  and do not need to respond to the RFP.
