CMS notifies the responsible entity in writing of any  penalty that has been assessed and of the means by which the responsible  entity may satisfy the judgment. The responsible entity has no right to  appeal a penalty with respect to which it has not requested a hearing in  accordance with Sec. 150.405 unless the responsible entity can show  good cause, as determined under Sec. 150.405(b), for failing to timely  exercise its right to a hearing.</p>
