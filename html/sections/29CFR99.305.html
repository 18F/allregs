                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Auditor procurement. In procuring audit services, auditees shall  follow the procurement standards prescribed by OMB Circular A-102,  ``Grants and Cooperative Agreements with State and Local Governments;''  29 CFR part 97, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and  Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments;'' OMB Circular A- 110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements  with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-Profit  Organizations;'' (codified at 2 CFR part 215); or the FAR (48 CFR part  42), as applicable. (OMB Circulars are available on-line at http:// www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/index.html.) Whenever possible,  auditees shall make positive efforts to utilize small businesses,  minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, in procuring  audit services as stated in OMB Circular A-102, OMB Circular A-110 (2  CFR part 215), or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable. In requesting  proposals for audit services, the objectives and scope of the audit  should be made clear. Factors to be considered in evaluating each  proposal for audit services include the responsiveness to the request  for proposal, relevant experience, availability of staff with  professional qualifications and technical abilities, the results of  external quality control reviews, and price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Restriction on auditor preparing indirect cost proposals. An  auditor who prepares the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan  may not also be selected to perform the audit required by this part when  the indirect costs recovered by the auditee during the prior year  exceeded $1 million. This restriction applies to the base year used in  the preparation of the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan  and any subsequent years in which the resulting indirect cost agreement  or cost allocation plan is used to recover costs. To minimize any  disruption in existing contracts for audit services, this paragraph  applies to audits of fiscal years beginning after June 30, 1998.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use of Federal auditors. Federal auditors may perform all or  part of the work required under this part if they comply fully with the  requirements of this part.  [64 FR 14541, Mar. 25, 1999, as amended at 72 FR 37105, July 9, 2007]</p>
