                            <p class="depth0">The Northern Potato Crop Insurance Provisions for the 2008 and  succeeding crop years are as follows:  FCIC Policies</p><p class="depth0">United States Department of Agriculture</p><p class="depth0">Federal Crop Insurance Corporation</p><p class="depth0">Reinsured Policies</p><p class="depth0">(Appropriate title for insurance provider)  Both FCIC and reinsured policies:</p><p class="depth0">Northern Potato Crop Provisions</p><p class="depth0">These provisions will be applicable in: Alaska; Humboldt, Modoc, and  Siskiyou Counties, California; Colorado; Connecticut; Idaho; Indiana;  Iowa; Kansas; Maine; Massachusetts; Michigan; Minnesota; Montana;  Nebraska; Nevada; San Juan County, New Mexico; New York; North Dakota;  Ohio; Oregon; Pennsylvania; Rhode Island; South Dakota; Utah;  Washington; Wisconsin; and Wyoming; and any other states or counties if  allowed by the Special Provisions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Buyer. A business entity in the business of buying or processing  potatoes, that possesses all the licenses and permits required by the  state in which it operates, and has the facilities to accept the  potatoes purchased.</p><p class="depth0">Certified seed. Potatoes that were entered into the potato certified  seed program and that meet all requirements for production to be used to  produce a seed crop for the next crop year or a potato crop for harvest  for commercial uses in the next crop year.</p><p class="depth0">Discard. Disposal of production by you, or a person acting for you,  without receiving any value for it.</p><p class="depth0">Disposed. Any disposition of the crop including but not limited to  sale or discard.</p><p class="depth0">Grade inspection. An inspection in which samples of production are  obtained by us, or a party approved by us, prior to the sale, storage,  or disposal of any lot of potatoes, or any portion of a lot and the  potatoes are evaluated and quality (grade) determinations are made by  us, a laboratory approved by us, or a potato grader licensed or  certified by the applicable State or the United States   Department of Agriculture, in accordance with the United States  Standards for Grades of Potatoes. The United States standards used to  determine the quality (grade) deficiencies will be: For potatoes  produced for chipping, the United States Standards for Grades of  Potatoes for Chipping; for potatoes produced for processing, the United  States Standards for Grades of Potatoes for Processing; for potatoes  produced for seed, the United States Standards for Grades of Seed  Potatoes; and for all other potatoes, the United States Standards for  Grades of Potatoes. The quantity and number of samples required will be  determined in accordance with procedure issued by FCIC.</p><p class="depth0">Harvest. Lifting potatoes from within the soil to the soil surface.</p><p class="depth0">Hundredweight. One hundred (100) pounds avoirdupois.</p><p class="depth0">Local market. The area in which the insured potatoes are normally  sold.</p><p class="depth0">Lot. A quantity of production that can be separated from other  quantities of production by grade characteristics, load, location or  other distinctive features.</p><p class="depth0">Potato certified seed program. The state program administered by a  public agency responsible for the seed certification process within the  state in which the seed is produced.</p><p class="depth0">Tuber rot. Any soft, mushy, or leaky condition of potato tissue  (soft rot or wet breakdown as defined in the United States Standards for  Grades of Potatoes), including, but not limited to, breakdown caused by  Southern Bacterial Wilt, Ring Rot, or Late Blight.</p><p class="depth0">2. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining</p><p class="depth0">Indemnities</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic  Provisions, you may select only one price election for all the potatoes  in the county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions  provide different price elections by type. If the Special Provisions  provide for different price elections by type, you may select one price  election for each potato type designated in the Special Provisions. The  price elections you choose for each type must have the same percentage  relationship to the maximum price election offered by us for each type.  For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for  one type, you must also choose 100 percent of the maximum price election  for all other types.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the production from any acreage of the insured crop is not  harvested, the price used to determine your indemnity will be 90 percent  of your price election. This requirement is not applicable to the  certified seed endorsement price election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The price election for unharvested acreage will apply to any  acreage of potatoes damaged to the extent that similarly situated  producers in the area would not normally care for the potatoes even if  you choose to continue to care for or harvest them. Potatoes that are  lifted to the soil surface and not removed from the field will also  receive the price election for unharvested acreage.</p><p class="depth0">3. Contract Changes</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract  change date is November 30 preceding the cancellation date.</p><p class="depth0">4. Cancellation and Termination Dates</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the  cancellation and termination dates are March 15.</p><p class="depth0">5. Annual Premium</p><p class="depth0">In lieu of the premium computation method contained in section 7 of  the Basic Provisions, the annual premium amount (y) is computed by  multiplying (a) the production guarantee by (b) the price election for  harvested acreage, by (c) the premium rate, by (d) the insured acreage,  by (e) your share at the time of planting, and by (f) any applicable  premium adjustment factors contained in the actuarial documents  (axbxcxdxexf=y).</p><p class="depth0">6. Insured Crop</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop  insured will be all the potatoes in the county for which a premium rate  is provided by the actuarial documents:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In which you have a share;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Planted with certified seed (unless otherwise permitted by the  Special Provisions);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Planted for harvest as certified seed stock, or for human  consumption, (unless specified otherwise in the Special Provisions);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> That are not (unless allowed by the Special Provision or by  written agreement):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Interplanted with another crop; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Planted into an established grass or legume.</p><p class="depth0">7. Insurable Acreage</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions,  we will not insure any acreage that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Does not meet the rotation requirements contained in the Special  Provisions for the crop; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Is damaged before the final planting date to the extent that  similarly situated producers in the area would normally not further care  for the crop, unless it is replanted or we agree that it is not  practical to replant.</p><p class="depth0">8. Insurance Period</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic  Provisions, the calendar date for the end of the insurance period is   the date immediately following planting as follows (exceptions, if any,  for specific counties, varieties or types are contained in the Special  Provisions):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> October 1, in Alaska;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> October 10 in Nebraska and Wyoming;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> October 15 in Colorado; Indiana; Iowa; Michigan; Minnesota;  Montana; Nevada; North Dakota; South Dakota; Utah; and Wisconsin;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> October 20 in Maine;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> October 25 in Kansas; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> October 31 in Humboldt, Modoc, and Siskiyou Counties,  California; Connecticut; Idaho; Massachusetts; San Juan County, New  Mexico; New York; Ohio; Oregon; Pennsylvania; Rhode Island; and  Washington.</p><p class="depth0">9. Causes of Loss</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic  Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of  loss that occur within the insurance period:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Adverse weather conditions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fire;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Insects, but only if sufficient and proper pest control measures  are used;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Plant disease, but only if sufficient and proper disease control  measures are used;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Wildlife;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Earthquake;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Volcanic eruption; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured  peril that occurs during the insurance period (see section 9(a)(1)  through (7)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the causes of loss not insured against as  contained in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure  against any loss of production due to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Damage that occurs or becomes evident after the end of the  insurance period, including, but not limited to, damage that occurs or  becomes evident in storage; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Causes, such as freeze after certain dates, as limited by the  Special Provisions.</p><p class="depth0">10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic  Provisions, you must leave representative samples at least 10 feet wide  and extending the entire length of each field in the unit if you are  going to destroy any acreage of the insured crop that will not be  harvested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> We must be given the opportunity to perform a grade inspection  on the production from any unit for which you have given notice of  damage.</p><p class="depth0">11. Settlement of Claim</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you  are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for  which acceptable production records were not provided; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production  to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage  for the units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will  settle your claim by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production  guarantee (If there is unharvested acreage in the unit, the harvested  and unharvested acreage will be determined separately);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Multiplying each result in section 11(b)(1) by the respective  price election (The price election may be limited as specified in  section 3.);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Totaling the results of section 11(b)(2);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Multiplying the total production to be counted of each type, if  applicable (see section 11(d)), by the respective price election;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Totaling the results of section 11(b)(4);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Subtracting the results of section 11(b)(5) from the result in  section 11(b)(3); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Multiplying the result of section 11(b)(6) by your share.</p><p class="depth0">For example:</p><p class="depth0">You have a 100 percent share in 100 harvested acres of potatoes in  the unit, with a guarantee of 150 hundredweight per acre and a price  election of $4.00 per hundredweight. You are only able to harvest 10,000  hundredweight. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 100 acres x 150 hundredweight = 15,000 hundredweight guarantee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 15,000 hundredweight x $4.00 price election = $60,000.00 value  of guarantee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> 10,000 hundredweight x $4.00 price election = $40,000.00 value  of production to count;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> $60,000.00 - $40,000.00 = $20,000.00 loss; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> $20,000.00 x 100 percent = $20,000.00 indemnity payment.</p><p class="depth0">You also have a 100 percent share in 100 unharvested acres of  potatoes in the same unit, with a guarantee of 150 hundredweight per  acre and a price election of $3.60 per hundredweight. (The price  election for unharvested acreage is 90.0 percent of your elected price  election ($4.00 x 0.90 = $3.60.)) This unharvested acreage was appraised  at 35 hundredweight per acre for a total of 3500 hundredweight as  production to count. Your total indemnity for the harvested and  unharvested acreage would be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 100 acres x 150 hundredweight = 15,000 hundredweight guarantee  for the harvested acreage, and</p><p class="depth0">100 acres x 150 hundredweight = 15,000 hundredweight guarantee for  the unharvested acreage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 15,000 hundredweight guarantee x $4.00 price election =  $60,000.00 value of guarantee for the harvested acreage, and</p><p class="depth0">15,000 hundredweight guarantee x $3.60 price election = $54,000.00  value of guarantee for the unharvested acreage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> $60,000.00 + $54,000.00 = $114,000.00 total value of guarantee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> 10,000 hundredweight x $4.00 price election = $40,000.00 value  of production to count for the harvested acreage, and 3500 hundredweight  x $3.60 = $12,600.00 value of production to count for the unharvested  acreage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> $40,000.00 + $12,600.00 = $52,600.00 total value of production  to count;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> $114,000.00 - $52,600.00 = $61,400.00 loss; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> $61,400.00 loss x 100 percent = $61,400.00 indemnity payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The extent of any quality loss must be determined based on  samples obtained no later than the time the potatoes are placed in  storage, if the production is stored prior to sale, or the date they are  delivered to a buyer, wholesaler, packer, broker, or other handler if  production is not stored.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The total production to count (in hundredweight) from all  insurable acreage on the unit will include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All appraised production as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That is abandoned;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> That is put to another use without our consent;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> That is damaged solely by uninsured causes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> From which any production is disposed of without a grade  inspection; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Production lost due to uninsured causes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Production lost due to harvest prior to full maturity.  Production to count from such acreage will be determined by increasing  the amount of harvested production by 2 percent per day for each day the  potatoes were harvested prior to the date the potatoes would have  reached full maturity. The date the potatoes would have reached full  maturity will be considered to be 45 days prior to the calendar date for  the end of the insurance period, unless otherwise specified in the  Special Provisions. This adjustment will not be made if the potatoes are  damaged by an insurable cause of loss, and leaving the crop in the field  would either reduce production or decrease quality;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Unharvested production, including unharvested production on  insured acreage you intend to put to another use or abandon, or acreage  damaged by insurable causes and for which you cease to provide further  care, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon  such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you  put the acreage to another use or cease providing care for the crop.  This unharvested production may be adjusted in accordance with sections  11(e), (f), and (g); and the value of all unharvested production will be  calculated using the reduced price election determined in section 2(b).  If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may  give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave  intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the  crop in locations acceptable to us (The price used to determine the  amount of any indemnity will be limited as specified in section 2 even  if the representative samples are harvested. The amount of production to  count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or  appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If  you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide  sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you  consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the  amount of production to count); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of  production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or  our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not  harvested; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All harvested production from the insurable acreage (the amount  of production prior to the sorting or discarding of any production).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Potato production is eligible for quality adjustment if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The potatoes have freeze damage or tuber rot that is evident at,  or prior to, the end of the insurance period; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A grade inspection is completed no later than 21 days after the  end of the insurance period (if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage  Endorsement is applicable, samples must be obtained within 60 days after  the end of the insurance period and quality (grade) determinations must  be completed with 21 days of sampling); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Prior to any grade inspection, you must notify us of the  intended use of the potatoes so the appropriate United States standards  will be applied (We may request previous sales records to verify your  claimed intended use or base the intended use on the type of potato  grown if such potatoes are not usually grown for the intended use you  reported).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Potato production to count that is eligible for quality  adjustment, as specified in section 11(e), with 5 percent damage or less  (by weight) will be adjusted 0.1 percent for each 0.1 percent of damage  through 5.0 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Potato production to count that is eligible for quality  adjustment, as specified in   section 11(e), with 5.1 percent damage or more (by weight) will be  determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a price is agreed upon between you and a buyer within 21 days  (60 days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage endorsement is  applicable), after the end of the insurance period, or the production is  delivered to a buyer within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato  Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable), after the end of the  insurance period, the amount of production will be determined by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Dividing the price per hundredweight received or that will be  received by the highest price election designated in the Special  Provisions or addendum thereto for the insured potato type (if the  production is sold for a price lower than the value appropriate to and  representative of the local market, we will determine the value of the  production based on the price you could have received in the local  market); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Multiplying the result (not to exceed 1.0) by the number of  hundredweight of sold or to be sold production (We may verify this after  the production has actually been sold); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a price is not agreed upon between you and a buyer and the  production is not delivered within 21 days (60 days if the Northern  Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable) after the end of the  insurance period, and that remain in storage 22 or more days (61 or more  days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable),  after the end of the insurance period, the amount of production will be  the greater of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount determined by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Dividing the price per hundredweight that is received, or will  be received after the end of the applicable insurance period, by the  highest price election designated in the Special Provisions or addendum  thereto for the insured potato type (if the production is sold for a  price lower than the value appropriate to and representative of the  local market, we will determine the value of the production based on the  price you could have received in the local market); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Multiplying the result of section 11(g)(2)(i)(A) (not to exceed  1.0) by the number of hundredweight of sold or to be sold production (We  may verify this after the production has actually been sold); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of production determined by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Reducing any harvested or appraised production:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> By 0.1 percent for each 0.1 percent damage through 5.0 percent;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> By 0.5 percent for each 0.1 percent of damage from 5.1 percent  through 6.0 percent;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> By 1.0 percent for each 0.1 percent of damage from 6.1 through  13.5 percent;

Prevented Planting</p><p class="depth0">Your prevented planting coverage will be 25 percent of your  production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have limited or  additional coverage, as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart T, and pay  an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage  to a level specified in the actuarial documents.
