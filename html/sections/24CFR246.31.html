area in which the project is located that it is considering increasing the rents for a project within the scope of this subpart, and that the increases are expected to become effective after the expiration of thirty (30) days' notice to the tenants, subject to whatever rights a tenant may have under a lease. The local HUD office will also notify the board that, pursuant to this subpart, the Department has exclusive jurisdiction over the rents for the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After the increases have become effective, the local HUD office will furnish the board a schedule of the new rents that are being charged by HUD.

The sole purpose of the notice is to inform the board of the lawful rents that may be charged for projects covered by this subpart.
