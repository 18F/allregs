                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. An offeror's or contractor's assertion(s) of  restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce,  release, or disclose computer software or computer software  documentation do not, by themselves, determine the extent of the  Government's rights in such software or documentation. The Government  may require an offeror or contractor to submit sufficient information to  permit an evaluation of a particular asserted restriction and may  challenge asserted restrictions when there are reasonable grounds to  believe that an assertion is not valid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requests for information. Contracting officers should have a  reason to suspect that an asserted restriction might not be correct  prior to requesting information. When requesting information, provide  the offeror or contractor the reason(s) for suspecting that an asserted  restriction might not be correct. A need for additional license rights  is not, by itself, a sufficient basis for requesting information  concerning an asserted restriction. Follow the procedures at 227.7203- 5(d) when additional license rights are needed but there is no basis to  suspect that an asserted restriction might not be valid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transacting matters directly with subcontractors. The clause at  252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software,  obtains the contractor's agreement that the Government may transact  matters under the clause directly with a subcontractor or supplier, at  any tier, without creating or implying privity of contract. Contracting  officers should permit a subcontractor or supplier to transact challenge  and validation matters directly with the Government when--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A subcontractor's or supplier's business interests in its  technical data   would be compromised if the data were disclosed to a higher tier  contractor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is reason to believe that the contractor will not respond  in a timely manner to a challenge and an untimely response would  jeopardize a subcontractor's or supplier's right to assert restrictions;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Requested to do so by a subcontractor or supplier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Major systems. When the contracting officer challenges an  asserted restriction regarding noncommercial computer software for a  major system or a subsystem or component thereof on the basis that the  computer software was not developed exclusively at private expense, the  contracting officer shall sustain the challenge unless information  provided by the contractor or subcontractor demonstrates that the  computer software was developed exclusively at private expense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Challenging asserted restrictions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pre-award considerations.  The challenge procedures in the clause at 252.227-7019 could  significantly delay competitive procurements. Therefore, avoid  challenging asserted restrictions prior to a competitive contract award  unless resolution of the assertion is essential for successful  completion of the procurement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> is strongly encouraged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Computer software. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Asserted restrictions should be reviewed  before acceptance of the computer software deliverable under a contract.  The Government's right to challenge an assertion expires three years  after final payment under the contract or three years after delivery of  the software, whichever is later. Those limitations on the Government's  challenge rights do not apply to software that is publicly available,  has been furnished to the Government without restrictions, or has been  otherwise made available without restrictions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contracting officers must have reasonable grounds to challenge  the current validity of an asserted restriction. Before challenging an  asserted restriction, carefully consider all available information  pertaining to the asserted restrictions. Resolution of questions  regarding the validity of asserted restrictions using the process  described at 227.7203-12(b)(2) is strongly encouraged. After  consideration of the situations described in paragraph (c) of this  subsection, contracting officers may request the person asserting a  restriction to furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting  documentation for the assertion in sufficient detail to enable the  contracting officer to determine the validity of the assertion.  Additional supporting documentation may be requested when the  explanation provided by that person does not, in the contracting  officer's opinion, establish the validity of the assertion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Assertions may be challenged whether or not supporting  documentation was requested. Challenges must be in writing and issued to  the person asserting the restriction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Extension of response time. The contracting officer, at his or  her discretion, may extend the time for response contained in a  challenge, as appropriate, if the contractor submits a timely written  request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Validating or denying asserted restrictions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contracting  officers must promptly issue a final decision denying or sustaining the  validity of each challenged assertion unless the parties have agreed on  the disposition of the assertion. When a final decision denying the  validity of an asserted restriction is made following a timely response  to a challenge, the Government is obligated to continue to respect the  asserted restrictions through final disposition of any appeal unless the  agency head notifies the person asserting   the restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit  the Government to continue to respect the asserted restriction. See  252.227-7019(g) for restrictions applicable following a determination of  urgent and compelling circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Only a contracting officer's final decision, or actions of an  agency Board of Contract Appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction,  that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute  validation of the restriction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Multiple challenges to an asserted restriction. When more than  one contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction, the  contracting officer who made the earliest challenge is responsible for  coordinating the Government challenges. That contracting officer shall  consult with all other contracting officers making challenges, verify  that all challenges apply to the same asserted restriction and, after  consulting with the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier asserting the  restriction, issue a schedule that provides that person a reasonable  opportunity to respond to each challenge.
