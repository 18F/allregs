                            <p class="depth0">An applicant's income is computed by calculating the includable  income received by the applicant during the 12-month period ending on  the date an individual submits an application to participate in the  SCSEP, or the annualized income for the 6-month period ending on the  application date. The Department requires grantees to use whichever  method is more favorable to the individual. (OAA Sec. 518(a)(4)).</p>
