In determining what type of auxiliary aid or service is appropriate and necessary, such recipient must give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with a disability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where a recipient communicates by telephone with beneficiaries, registrants, applicants, eligible applicants/registrants, participants, applicants for employment, and/or employees, the recipient must use telecommunications devices for individuals with hearing impairments (TDDs/TTYs), or equally effective communications systems, such as telephone relay services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A recipient must ensure that interested individuals, including individuals with visual or hearing impairments, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> A recipient must provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The signage provided must meet the most current standards prescribed by the General Services Administration under the Architectural Barriers Act at 41 CFR 101-19.6. Alternative standards for the signage may be adopted when it is clearly evident that such alternative standards provide equivalent or greater access to the information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A recipient must provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities.
