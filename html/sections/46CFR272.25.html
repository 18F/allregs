                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Repayment of M&R; subsidy for compensated marine or other loss.  If an Operator eventually receives compensation from an insurer or any  other person for a marine loss or any other loss for which M&R; subsidy  has been paid, the Operator shall repay to MARAD an amount equal to the  amount of subsidy paid with respect to that loss.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Repayment of M&R; subsidy for Improvements--three year service  requirement. If, within three years after the completion of an  Improvement for which M&R; subsidy was paid, the Operator permanently  withdraws the Eligible Vessel from the ODSA, the Operator shall repay to  MARAD an amount equal to the amount of M&R; subsidy paid with respect to  that Improvement unless MARAD shall have determined that such action was  beyond the control of the Operator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Repayment of M&R; subsidy due to allocation of costs. If the  allocation of total M&R; costs required by Sec. 272.41(e) of this part  results in the allocation of a lesser amount of subsidizable M&R; costs  than were actually paid for during the calendar year, the Operator shall  repay to MARAD the amount of ODS which was paid in excess of the  allocated subsidizable costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Administrative action. If an Operator fails to repay an M&R;  subsidy required to be repaid by this section, MARAD may either reduce  any ODS payable by the amount of M&R; subsidy required to be repaid by  this section, or take any other action necessary to secure repayment.</p>
