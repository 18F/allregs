Unless, as a result of such hearing, the Administrator withdraws such determination of nonconformity, the Administrator shall, within 60 days after the completion of such hearing, order the manufacturer to provide prompt notification of such nonconformity in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The manufacturer shall comply in all respects with the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any notification required to be given by the manufacturer under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to any class or category of engines shall be given to dealers, ultimate purchasers, and subsequent purchasers (if known) in such manner and containing such information as required in subparts I and M of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> Prior to an EPA ordered recall, the manufacturer may perform a voluntary emissions recall pursuant to regulations at Sec. 90.804.
