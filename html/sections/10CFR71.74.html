                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Test conditions--Sequence of tests. A package must be physically  tested to the following conditions in the order indicated to determine  their cumulative effect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Impact at a velocity of not less than 129 m/sec (422 ft/sec) at  a right angle onto a flat, essentially unyielding, horizontal surface,  in the orientation (e.g., side, end, corner) expected to result in  maximum damage at the conclusion of the test sequence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A static compressive load of 31,800 kg (70,000 lbs) applied in  the orientation expected to result in maximum damage at the conclusion  of the test sequence. The force on the package must be developed between  a flat steel surface and a 5 cm (2 in) wide, straight, solid, steel bar.  The length of the bar must be at least as long as the diameter of the  package, and the longitudinal axis of the bar must be parallel to the  plane of the flat surface. The load must be applied to the bar in a  manner that prevents any members or devices used to support the bar from  contacting the package.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Packages weighing less than 227 kg (500 lbs) must be placed on a  flat, essentially unyielding, horizontal surface, and subjected to a  weight of 227   kg (500 lbs) falling from a height of 3 m (10 ft) and striking in the  position expected to result in maximum damage at the conclusion of the  test sequence. The end of the weight contacting the package must be a  solid probe made of mild steel. The probe must be the shape of the  frustum of a right circular cone, 30 cm (12 in) long, 20 cm (8 in) in  diameter at the base, and 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter at the end. The  longitudinal axis of the probe must be perpendicular to the horizontal  surface. For packages weighing 227 kg (500 lbs) or more, the base of the  probe must be placed on a flat, essentially unyielding horizontal  surface, and the package dropped from a height of 3 m (10 ft) onto the  probe, striking in the position expected to result in maximum damage at  the conclusion of the test sequence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The package must be firmly restrained and supported such that  its longitudinal axis is inclined approximately 45[deg] to the  horizontal. The area of the package that made first contact with the  impact surface in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be in the  lowermost position. The package must be struck at approximately the  center of its vertical projection by the end of a structural steel angle  section falling from a height of at least 46 m (150 ft). The angle  section must be at least 1.8 m (6 ft) in length with equal legs at least  13 cm (5 in) long and 1.3 cm (0.5 in) thick. The angle section must be  guided in such a way as to fall end-on, without tumbling. The package  must be rotated approximately 90[deg] about its longitudinal axis and  struck by the steel angle section falling as before.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The package must be exposed to luminous flames from a pool fire  of JP-4 or JP-5 aviation fuel for a period of at least 60 minutes. The  luminous flames must extend an average of at least 0.9 m (3 ft) and no  more than 3 m (10 ft) beyond the package in all horizontal directions.  The position and orientation of the package in relation to the fuel must  be that which is expected to result in maximum damage at the conclusion  of the test sequence. An alternate method of thermal testing may be  substituted for this fire test, provided that the alternate test is not  of shorter duration and would not result in a lower heating rate to the  package. At the conclusion of the thermal test, the package must be  allowed to cool naturally or must be cooled by water sprinkling,  whichever is expected to result in maximum damage at the conclusion of  the test sequence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Immersion under at least 0.9 m (3 ft) of water.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Individual free-fall impact test. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An undamaged package must  be physically subjected to an impact at a velocity not less than the  calculated terminal free-fall velocity, at mean sea level, at a right  angle onto a flat, essentially unyielding, horizontal surface, in the  orientation (e.g., side, end, corner) expected to result in maximum  damage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This test is not required if the calculated terminal free-fall  velocity of the package is less than 129 m/sec (422 ft/sec), or if a  velocity not less than either 129 m/sec (422 ft/sec) or the calculated  terminal free-fall velocity of the package is used in the sequential  test of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Individual deep submersion test. An undamaged package must be  physically submerged and physically subjected to an external water  pressure of at least 4 MPa (600 lbs/in \2\).</p>
