                            <p class="depth0">The Northern Potato Crop Insurance Storage Coverage Endorsement  Provisions for the 2008 and succeeding crop years are as follows:  FCIC Policies</p><p class="depth0">United States Department of Agriculture</p><p class="depth0">Federal Crop Insurance Corporation</p><p class="depth0">Reinsured Policies</p><p class="depth0">(Appropriate title for insurance provider)  Both FCIC and reinsured policies:</p><p class="depth0">Northern Potato Crop Insurance Storage Coverage Endorsement</p><p class="depth0">1. In return for payment of the required additional premium as  contained in the actuarial documents, this endorsement is attached to  and made part of your Northern Potato Crop Provisions subject to the  terms and conditions described herein. In the event of a conflict  between the Northern Potato Crop Provisions and this endorsement, this  endorsement will control.</p><p class="depth0">2. You must elect this endorsement on or before the sales closing  date for the initial crop year in which you wish to insure your potatoes  under this endorsement. This endorsement will continue in effect until  canceled. It may be canceled by either you or us for any succeeding crop  year by giving written notice to the other party on or before the  cancellation date.</p><p class="depth0">3. Potato production grown under a contract that requires the  production to be delivered to a buyer within three days of harvest will  not be insured under this endorsement. When such contract requires  delivery of a stated amount of production, rather than all of the  production from a stated amount of acres, the number of acres not  insured under this endorsement will be determined by dividing the stated  amount of production by the approved yield for the acreage. All other  potato production insured   under the Northern Potato Crop Provisions must be insured under this  endorsement unless the Special Provisions allow you to exclude certain  potato varieties, types, or groups from this endorsement, and you elect  to exercise this option. If you elect this endorsement, such exclusions  must be shown annually on your acreage report and will be applicable to  all acreage of the excluded varieties, types, or groups for the crop  year.</p><p class="depth0">4. When production from separate insurance units, basic or optional,  is commingled in storage, the production to count for each unit will be  allocated pro rata based on the production placed in storage from each  unit. Such allocation will be allowed only if verifiable records of  production placed in storage are available by unit. If you do not have  verifiable records, all units without verifiable records will be  combined in accordance with section 11 of the Northern Potato Crop  Provisions. For example, if 500 hundredweight from one unit are  commingled with 1,500 hundredweight from another unit and the production  to count from the stored production is 1,000 hundredweight, 250  hundredweight of production to count will be allocated to the unit  contributing 500 hundredweight and 750 hundredweight to the unit  contributing 1500 hundredweight to the stored production. This provision  does not eliminate or change any other requirement contained in this  policy to provide or maintain separate records of acreage or production  by unit.</p><p class="depth0">5. In lieu of section 9(b)(1) of the Northern Potato Crop  Provisions, the extended coverage provided by this endorsement will be  applicable but only if:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Insured potatoes are damaged within the insurance period by an  insured cause other than freeze that later results in:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tuber rot as defined in the Northern Potato Crop Provisions, to  the extent that 5.1 percent (by weight) or more of the insured  production is affected;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Internal defects to the extent that such defects are in excess  of the amount allowed for the U.S. grade standard you elected for  purposes of coverage under the Northern Potato Crop Insurance Quality  Endorsement. Such defects must not be separable from undamaged  production using methods used by the packers or processors to which you  normally deliver your potato production. This coverage is applicable  only to production covered under the Northern Potato Crop Insurance  Quality Endorsement; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The potatoes damaged by an insurance cause of loss fail to meet  any of the following standards or a less stringent standard for the same  quality factors specified below, contained in the processor contract, if  applicable, (this coverage is applicable only to production covered  under the Northern Potato Processing Quality Endorsement):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A specific gravity lower than 1.074;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A fry color of No. 3 or darker due to either sugar exceeding 10  percent or sugar ends exceeding 19 percent; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An Agtron rating lower than 58.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You notify us within 72 hours of your initial discovery of any  damage that has or that may later result in the quality deficiencies  specified in section 5(a);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The percentage of production with any of the quality  deficiencies specified in section 5(a) is determined based on samples  obtained no later than 60 days after the end of the insurance period and  the potatoes are evaluated and quality (grade) determinations are made  by us, a laboratory approved by us, a potato grader licensed or  certified by the applicable State or the United States Department of  Agriculture, or us, in accordance with the United States Standards for  Grades of Potatoes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Samples of damaged production must be obtained by us or a party  approved by us prior to the sale or disposal of any lot of potatoes; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If production is not sold or disposed of within 60 days after  the end of the insurance period, samples must be obtained within 60 days  after the end of the insurance period and a quality (grade)  determination must be completed within 21 days of sampling.
