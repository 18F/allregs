                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The rules of this section shall apply in cases where  a partnership (lower-tier partnership) that has effectively connected  taxable income (ECTI), has a partner that is a partnership (upper-tier  partnership). Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if an  upper-tier domestic partnership directly owns an interest in a lower- tier partnership, the lower-tier partnership is not required to pay the  section 1446 withholding tax (1446 tax) with respect to the upper-tier  partnership's allocable share of net income, regardless of whether the  upper-tier domestic partnership's partners are foreign. Paragraph (b) of  this section prescribes the reporting requirements for upper-tier and  lower-tier partnerships subject to section 1446. Paragraph (c) of this  section prescribes rules requiring a lower-tier partnership to look  through an upper-tier foreign partnership to a partner of such upper- tier partnership to the extent it has sufficient documentation to  determine the status of such partner and determine such partner's  indirect share of the lower-tier partnership's effectively connected  taxable income (ECTI). Paragraph (d) of this section prescribes rules  applicable to a publicly traded partnership in a tiered partnership  structure. Paragraph (e) of this section prescribes rules permitting a  domestic upper-tier partnership to elect to apply the look through rules  of paragraph (c) of this section. Paragraph (f) of this section sets  forth examples illustrating the rules of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> and Sec. 1.1446-3(d).  To the extent required in Sec. 1.1446-   3(d)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(iii)</em>, the upper-tier partnership will file Form 8804, ``Annual  Return for Partnership Withholding Tax (Section 1446),'' and Form 8805,  ``Foreign Partner's Information Statement of Section 1446 Withholding  Tax,'' for each of its foreign partners with respect to its 1446 tax  obligation. To the extent the upper-tier partnership does not claim a  refund of the 1446 tax it paid (or is considered to have paid), the  upper-tier partnership will pass the credit for the 1446 tax paid to its  partners on the Forms 8805 it issues. See Sec. 1.1446-3(d). The rules of  this paragraph (b) shall apply to an upper-tier and lower-tier  partnership to the extent that an election has been made and consented  to under paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Publicly traded partnerships. In the case of an upper-tier  foreign partnership that is a publicly traded partnership, the rules of  Sec. 1.1446-4(c) shall apply. See also paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Look through rules for foreign upper-tier partnerships. For  purposes of computing the 1446 tax obligation of a lower-tier  partnership, if an upper-tier foreign partnership owns an interest in  the lower-tier partnership, the upper-tier partnership's allocable share  of ECTI from the lower-tier partnership shall be treated as allocable to  a partner of the upper-tier partnership, to the extent of such partner's  indirect share of such ECTI (as if such partner were a direct partner in  the lower-tier partnership), if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The upper-tier foreign partnership furnishes the lower-tier  partnership a valid Form W-8IMY, ``Certificate of Foreign Intermediary,  Flow Through Entity, or Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax  Withholding,'' indicating that it is a look-through foreign partnership  for purposes of section 1446; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> for the treatment of any income or gain  potentially subject to a preferential rate. If a lower-tier partnership  has not received a valid Form W-8IMY from the upper-tier partnership,  the lower-tier partnership shall withhold on the upper-tier  partnership's entire allocable share of ECTI at the higher of the  applicable percentages in section 1446(b). The look through regime set  forth in this paragraph (c) is for purposes of computing the lower-tier  partnership's 1446 tax obligation only and does not alter the persons  considered to be partners in the lower-tier partnership for partnership  reporting purposes (e.g., issuing Form 8805, Schedule K-1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Publicly traded partnerships--(1) Upper-tier publicly traded  partnership. The rules set forth in paragraph (c) shall not apply to  look through an upper-tier partnership whose interests   are publicly traded (as defined in Sec. 1.1446-4(b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1))</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(vii)</em> and paragraph (c) of  this section have been furnished.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(1)</em> shall not apply to a publicly traded partnership  described in Sec. 1.1446-4(b)(1). See paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(vii))</em> at  least a portion of the upper-tier partnership's allocable share of ECTI  with one or more foreign partners of the upper-tier partnership. The  election statement must identify the upper-tier partnership by name,  address, and TIN, and specify the percentage interest the domestic  partnership holds in the lower-tier partnership. The statement may also  include such information the upper-tier partnership deems necessary to  enable the lower-tier partnership to apply the provisions of this  section. If at any time the upper-tier partnership determines that the  information or documentation previously provided to the lower-tier  partnership is no longer correct, the upper-tier partnership shall  update such information and documentation. Except as provided in  paragraph (e)(3) of this section, an election that is effective under  this paragraph (e) shall apply for subsequent taxable years until such  upper-tier partnership revokes the election in writing. A revocation  under this section shall be effective for any installment due date  arising more than 15 days subsequent to the date that the lower-tier  partnership receives such revocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Consent of lower-tier partnership. An election made under this  paragraph (e) is not effective until the lower-tier partnership consents  in writing to the upper-tier partnership that it agrees to apply the  provisions of this section. A lower-tier partnership may not consent to  an election submitted under this paragraph (e) for any installment date  or Form 8804 filing date arising within 15 days of the lower-tier  partnership's receipt of such election. The lower-tier partnership's  written consent must specify the extent to which it will look through  the upper-tier partnership in computing its 1446 tax (or any installment  of such tax). To the extent that the lower-tier partnership does not  consent to an election to apply the look through provisions of paragraph   (c) of this section, the lower-tier partnership shall consider such  portion of the upper-tier partnership's allocable share of ECTI as  allocable to a domestic person for purposes of computing its 1446 tax  obligation. A lower-tier partnership that has consented to an election  under this paragraph (e) may revoke or modify its consent, in writing,  at any time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this section. In considering the examples, disregard the potential  application of Sec. 1.l446-3(b)(2)(v)(F) (relating to the de minimis  exception to paying 1446 tax). The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Nonresident alien (NRA) and foreign corporation (FC) are partners in  PRS, a foreign partnership, and share profits and losses in PRS 70 and  30 percent, respectively. All of PRS's partnership items are allocated  based upon each partner's respective ownership interest and it is  assumed that these allocations are respected under section 704(b) and  the regulations thereunder. NRA and FC each furnish PRS with a valid  Form W-8BEN establishing themselves as a foreign individual and foreign  corporation, respectively. PRS holds a 40 percent interest in the  profits, losses and capital of LTP, a lower-tier partnership. NRA holds  the remaining 60 percent interest in profits, losses and capital of LTP.  All of LTP's partnership items are allocated based upon each partner's  respective ownership interest and it is assumed that these allocations  are respected under section 704(b) and the regulations thereunder. LTP  has $100 of annualized ECTI for the relevant installment period. All of  this income is ordinary income and there is no potential application of  a preferential rate applicable percentage under Sec. 1.1446-3(a)(2).  Further, Sec. 1.1446-6 does not apply. PRS has no income other than the  income allocated from LTP. PRS provides LTP with a valid Form W-8IMY  indicating that it is a foreign partnership and attaches the valid Form  W-8BENs executed by NRA and FC, as well as a statement describing the  allocation of PRS's effectively connected items among its partners. The  information that PRS submits to LTP is sufficient to permit LTP to  reliably associate (within the meaning of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii))  PRS's allocable share of effectively connected items with NRA and FC  pursuant to this section. Further, NRA provides a valid Form W-8BEN to  LTP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> LTP must pay 1446 tax on the $60 allocable to its direct  partner NRA using the applicable percentage for non-corporate partners  (the highest rate in section 1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> With respect to the effectively connected partnership items  that LTP can reliably associate with NRA through PRS (70 percent of  PRS's 40 percent allocable share ($40), or $28), LTP will pay 1446 tax  on NRA's allocable share of LTP's ECTI (as determined by looking through  PRS) using the applicable percentage for non-corporate partners (the  highest rate in section 1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> With respect to the effectively connected partnership items  that LTP can reliably associate with FC through PRS (30 percent of PRS's  40 percent allocable share ($40), or $12), LTP will pay 1446 tax on FC's  allocable share of LTP's ECTI (as determined by looking through PRS)  using the applicable percentage for corporate partners (the highest rate  in section 11).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> LTP's payment of the 1446 tax is treated as a distribution to  NRA and PRS, its direct partners, that those partners may credit against  their respective tax obligations. PRS will report its 1446 tax  obligation with respect to its direct foreign partners, NRA and FC, on  the Form 8804 and Forms 8805 that it files with the Internal Revenue  Service pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section and will credit the  amount withheld by LTP on its Form 8804. This credit will satisfy PRS's  1446 tax liability as reported on the Form 8804 it files because PRS's  only income is from LTP, and LTP paid 1446 tax with respect to all of  PRS's allocable share in LTP by looking through to PRS's partners NRA  and FC. Further, PRS will pass along the credit for the 1446 tax  withheld by LTP to its partners, NRA and FC on the Form 8805 issued to  each partner. The credit passed to each partner on Form 8805 will be  treated as a distribution to the respective partners under section  1446(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> LTP is a domestic partnership that has two equal partners A and PRS.  A is a nonresident alien and PRS is a foreign partnership that has two  equal foreign partners, C and D. Neither A nor PRS provides LTP with a  valid Form W-8 or Form W-9. Neither C nor D provides PRS with a valid  Form W-8 or Form W-9. Pursuant to Sec. 1.1446-1(c)(3), LTP must presume  that PRS is a foreign person subject to withholding under section 1446  at the higher of the highest rate under section 1 or section 11(b)(1).  LTP has also not received any documentation with respect to A. LTP must  presume that A is a foreign person, and, if LTP knows that A is an  individual, compute and pay 1446 tax, subject to Sec. 1.1446-3(a)(2),  based on that knowledge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assume a change of facts where C provides a form W-8 (e.g.,  Form W-8BEN) to PRS, and PRS in turn, furnishes that form to LTP along  with its Form W-8IMY, and information regarding how effectively  connected items   are allocated to C and D. Based upon the additional facts, LTP can  reliably associate one-half of PRS's allocable share of ECTI with  documentation related with C. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(2) of this  section, LTP will look through PRS to C when computing its 1446 tax to  the extent of C's indirect share and will not look through with respect  to the remainder of PRS's allocable share (D's indirect share).
