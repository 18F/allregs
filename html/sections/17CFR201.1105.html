An administrator may be removed at any time by order of the Commission or hearing officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assistance by respondent.

If the administrator is not a Commission employee, the administrator shall be required to obtain a bond in the manner prescribed in 11 U.S.C. 322, in an amount to be approved by the Commission.
