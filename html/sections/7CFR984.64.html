                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Substandard walnuts may be disposed of only for manufacture into  oil, livestock feed, or such other uses as the Board determines to be  noncompetitive with existing domestic and export markets for  merchantable walnuts and with proper safeguards to prevent such walnuts  from thereafter entering channels of trade in such markets. Wherever  free and reserve percentages are in effect, the kernelweight of any  walnuts meeting the minimum kernel content requirements effective  pursuant to Sec. 984.50(e), may be pooled and the disposition credited  to the handler's reserve obligation pursuant to Sec. 984.56. Each  handler shall submit, in such form and at such intervals as the Board  may determine, reports of (a) his production and holdings of substandard  walnuts and (b) the disposition of all substandard walnuts to any other  person, showing the quantity, lot, date, name and address of the person  to whom delivered, the approved use and such other information  pertaining thereto as the Board may specify.
