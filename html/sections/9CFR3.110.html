                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Newly acquired marine mammals must be isolated from resident  marine mammals. Animals with a known medical history must be isolated  unless or until the newly acquired animals can be reasonably determined  to be in good health by the attending veterinarian. Animals without a  known medical history must be isolated until it is determined that the  newly acquired animals are determined to be in good health by the  attending veterinarian. Any communicable disease condition in a newly  acquired marine mammal must be remedied before it is placed with  resident marine mammals, unless, in the judgment of the attending  veterinarian, the potential benefits of a resident animal as a companion  to the newly acquired animal outweigh the risks to the resident animal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Holding facilities must be in place and available to meet the  needs for isolation, separation, medical treatment, and medical training  of marine mammals. Marine mammals that are isolated or separated for  nonmedical purposes must be held in facilities that meet minimum space  requirements as outlined in Sec. 3.104. Holding facilities used only  for medical treatment and medical training need not meet the minimum  space requirements as outlined in Sec. 3.104. Holding of a marine  mammal in a medical treatment or medical training enclosure that does  not meet minimum space requirements for periods longer than 2 weeks must  be noted in the animal's medical record and the attending veterinarian  must provide a justification in the animal's medical record. If holding  in such enclosures for medical treatment and/or medical training is to  last longer than 2 weeks, such extension must be justified in writing by  the attending veterinarian on a weekly basis. In natural lagoon or  coastal enclosures where isolation cannot be accomplished, since water  circulation cannot be controlled or isolated, separation of newly  acquired marine mammals must be accomplished using separate enclosures  situated within the facility to prevent direct contact and to minimize  the risk of potential airborne and water cross-contamination between  newly acquired and resident animals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any holding facility used for medical purposes that has  contained a marine mammal with an infectious or contagious disease must  be cleaned and/or sanitized in a manner prescribed by the attending  veterinarian. No healthy animals may be introduced into this holding  facility prior to such cleaning and/or sanitizing procedures. Any marine  mammal exposed to a contagious animal must be evaluated by the attending  veterinarian and monitored and/or isolated for an appropriate period of  time as determined by the attending veterinarian.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Individual animal medical records must be kept and made  available for APHIS inspection. These medical records must include at  least the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Animal identification/name, a physical description, including  any identifying markings, scars, etc., age, and sex; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Physical examination information, including but not limited to  length, weight, physical examination results by body system,  identification of all medical and physical problems with proposed plan  of action, all diagnostic test results, and documentation of treatment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A copy of the individual animal medical record must accompany  any marine mammal upon its transfer to another facility, including  contract or satellite facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> All marine mammals must be visually examined by the attending  veterinarian at least semiannually and must be physically examined under  the supervision of and when determined to be necessary by the attending  veterinarian. All cetaceans and sirenians must be physically examined by  the attending veterinarian at least annually, unless APHIS grants an  exception from this requirement based on considerations related to the  health and safety   of the cetacean or sirenian. These examinations must include, but are  not limited to, a hands-on physical examination, hematology and blood  chemistry, and other diagnostic tests as determined by the attending  veterinarian.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A complete necropsy, including histopathology samples,  microbiological cultures, and other testing as appropriate, must be  conducted by or under the supervision of the attending veterinarian on  all marine mammals that die in captivity. A preliminary necropsy report  must be prepared by the veterinarian listing all pathologic lesions  observed. The final necropsy report must include all gross and  histopathological findings, the results of all laboratory tests  performed, and a pathological diagnosis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Necropsy records will be maintained at the marine mammal's home  facility and at the facility at which it died, if different, for a  period of 3 years and must be presented to APHIS inspectors when  requested.
