                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. RLF Capital shall be used for the purpose of making RLF loans that are consistent with an RLF Plan or such other purposes approved by EDA. To ensure that RLF funds are used as intended, each loan agreement must clearly state the purpose of each loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Restrictions on use of RLF Capital. RLF Capital shall not be used to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Acquire an equity position in a private business;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subsidize interest payments on an existing RLF loan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide for borrowers' required equity contributions under other Federal Agencies' loan programs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Enable borrowers to acquire an interest in a business either through the

purchase of stock or through the acquisition of assets, unless sufficient justification is provided in the loan documentation. Sufficient justification may include acquiring a business to save it from imminent closure or to acquire a business to facilitate a significant expansion or increase in investment with a significant increase in jobs. The potential economic benefits must be clearly consistent with the strategic objectives of the RLF;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Provide RLF loans to a borrower for the purpose of investing in interest-bearing accounts, certificates of deposit or any investment unrelated to the RLF; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Refinance existing debt, unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The RLF Recipient sufficiently demonstrates in the loan documentation a ``sound economic justification'' for the refinancing (e.g., the refinancing will support additional capital investment intended to increase business activities). For this purpose, reducing the risk of loss to an existing lender(s) or lowering the cost of financing to a borrower shall not, without other indicia, constitute a sound economic justification; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> RLF Capital will finance the purchase of the rights of a prior lien holder during a foreclosure action which is necessary to preclude a significant loss on an RLF loan. RLF Capital may be used for this purpose only if there is a high probability of receiving compensation from the sale of assets sufficient to cover an RLF's costs plus a reasonable portion of the outstanding RLF loan within a reasonable period of time, as determined by EDA, following the date of refinancing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Compliance and Loan Quality Review. To ensure that the RLF Recipient makes eligible RLF loans consistent with its RLF Plan or such other purposes approved by EDA, EDA may require an independent third party to conduct a compliance and loan quality review for the RLF Grant every three years. The RLF Recipient may undertake this review as an administrative cost associated with the RLF's operations provided the requirements set forth in Sec. 307.12 are satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use of In-Kind Contributions. In-Kind Contributions may satisfy Matching Share requirements when specifically authorized in the terms and conditions of the RLF Grant and may be used to provide technical assistance to borrowers or for eligible RLF administrative costs.
