RLF Capital may be used for this  purpose only if there is a high probability of receiving compensation  from the sale of assets sufficient to cover an RLF's costs plus a  reasonable portion of the outstanding RLF loan within a reasonable  period of time, as determined by EDA, following the date of refinancing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Compliance and Loan Quality Review. To ensure that the RLF  Recipient makes eligible RLF loans consistent with its RLF Plan or such  other purposes approved by EDA, EDA may require an independent third  party to conduct a compliance and loan quality review for the RLF Grant  every three years. The RLF Recipient may undertake this review as an  administrative cost associated with the RLF's operations provided the  requirements set forth in Sec. 307.12 are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p>
