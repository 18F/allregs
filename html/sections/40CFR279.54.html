Used oil processors/re-refiners are also subject to the Underground Storage Tank (40 CFR part 280) standards for used oil stored

in underground tanks whether or not the used oil exhibits any characteristics of hazardous waste, in addition to the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Management units. Used oil processors/re-refiners may not store used oil in units other than tanks, containers, or units subject to regulation under part 264 or 265 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Condition of units. Containers and aboveground tanks used to store or process used oil at processing and re-refining facilities must be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In good condition (no severe rusting, apparent structural defects or deterioration); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Not leaking (no visible leaks).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Secondary containment for containers. Containers used to store or process used oil at processing and re-refining facilities must be equipped with a secondary containment system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The secondary containment system must consist of, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Dikes, berms or retaining walls; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A floor. The floor must cover the entire area within the dike, berm, or retaining wall; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An equivalent secondary containment system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The entire containment system, including walls and floor, must be sufficiently impervious to used oil to prevent any used oil released into the containment system from migrating out of the system to the soil, groundwater, or surface water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Secondary containment for existing aboveground tanks. Existing aboveground tanks used to store or process used oil at processing and re-refining facilities must be equipped with a secondary containment system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The secondary containment system must consist of, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Dikes, berms or retaining walls; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A floor. The floor must cover the entire area within the dike, berm, or retaining wall except areas where existing portions of the tank meet the ground; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An equivalent secondary containment system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The entire containment system, including walls and floor, must be sufficiently impervious to used oil to prevent any used oil released into the containment system from migrating out of the system to the soil, groundwater, or surface water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Secondary containment for new aboveground tanks. New aboveground tanks used to store or process used oil at processing and re-refining facilities must be equipped with a secondary containment system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The secondary containment system must consist of, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Dikes, berms or retaining walls; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A floor.

(1) Containers and aboveground tanks used to store or process used oil at processing and re-refining facilities must be labeled or marked clearly with the words ``Used Oil.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fill pipes used to transfer used oil into underground storage tanks at processing and re-refining facilities must be labeled or marked clearly with the words ``Used Oil.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Response to releases. Upon detection of a release of used oil to the environment that is not subject to the requirements of part 280, subpart F of this chapter and which has occurred after the effective date of the recycled used oil management program in effect in the State in which the release is located, an owner/operator must perform the following cleanup steps:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Stop the release;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contain the released used oil;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Clean up and manage properly the released used oil and other materials; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If necessary, repair or replace any leaking used oil storage containers or tanks prior to returning them to service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Closure--(1) Aboveground tanks. Owners and operators who store or process used oil in aboveground tanks must comply with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At closure of a tank system, the owner or operator must remove or decontaminate used oil residues in tanks, contaminated containment system components, contaminated soils, and structures and equipment contaminated with used oil, and manage them as hazardous waste, unless the materials are not hazardous waste under this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the owner or operator demonstrates that not all contaminated soils can be practicably removed or decontaminated as required in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, then the owner or operator must close the tank system and perform post-closure care in accordance with the closure and post-closure care requirements that apply to hazardous waste landfills (Sec.  265.310 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Containers. Owners and operators who store used oil in containers must comply with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At closure, containers holding used oils or residues of used oil must be removed from the site;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator must remove or decontaminate used oil residues, contaminated containment system components, contaminated soils, and structures and equipment contaminated with used oil, and manage them as hazardous waste, unless the materials are not hazardous waste under part 261 of this chapter.
