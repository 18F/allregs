                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After FDA's approval of a PMA, an applicant shall submit a PMA  supplement for review and approval by FDA before making a change  affecting the safety or effectiveness of the device for which the  applicant has an approved PMA, unless the change is of a type for which  FDA, under paragraph (e) of this section, has advised that an alternate  submission is permitted or is of a type which, under section  515(d)(6)(A) of the act and paragraph (f) of this section, does not  require a PMA supplement under this paragraph. While the burden for  determining whether a supplement is required is primarily on the PMA  holder, changes for which an applicant shall submit a PMA supplement  include, but are not limited to, the following types of changes if they  affect the safety or effectiveness of the device:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> New indications for use of the device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Labeling changes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The use of a different facility or establishment to manufacture,  process, or package the device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Changes in sterilization procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Changes in packaging.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Changes in the performance or design specifications, circuits,  components, ingredients, principle of operation, or physical layout of  the device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Extension of the expiration date of the device based on data  obtained under a new or revised stability or sterility testing protocol  that has not been approved by FDA. If the protocol has been approved,  the change shall be reported to FDA under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An applicant may make a change in a device after FDA's approval  of a PMA for the device without submitting a PMA supplement if the  change does not affect the device's safety or effectiveness and the  change is reported to FDA in postapproval periodic reports required as a  condition to approval of the device, e.g., an editorial change in  labeling which does not affect the safety or effectiveness of the  device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All procedures and actions that apply to an application under  Sec. 814.20 also apply to PMA supplements except that the information  required in a supplement is limited to that needed to support the  change. A summary under Sec. 814.20(b)(3) is required for only a  supplement submitted for new indications for use of the device,  significant changes in the performance or design specifications,  circuits, components, ingredients, principles of operation, or physical  layout of the device, or when otherwise required by FDA. The applicant  shall submit three copies of a PMA supplement and shall include  information relevant to the proposed changes in the device. A PMA  supplement shall include a separate section that identifies each change  for which approval is being requested and explains the reason for each  such change. The applicant shall submit additional copies and additional  information if requested by FDA. The time frames for review of, and FDA  action on, a PMA supplement are the same as those provided in Sec.  814.40 for a PMA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The supplement must include the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Information concerning pediatric uses as required under Sec.  814.20(b)(13).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If information concerning the device that is the subject of the  supplement was previously submitted under Sec. 814.20(b)(13) or under  this section in a previous supplement, that information may be included  by referencing a previous application or submission that contains the  information. However, if additional information required under Sec.  814.20(b)(13) has become readily available to the applicant since the  previous submission, the applicant must submit that information as part  of the supplement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After FDA approves a PMA, any change described in paragraph  (d)(2) of this section to reflect newly acquired information that  enhances the safety of the device or the safety in the use of the device  may be placed into effect by the applicant prior to the receipt under  Sec. 814.17 of a written FDA order approving the PMA supplement  provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The PMA supplement and its mailing cover are plainly marked  ``Special PMA Supplement--Changes Being Effected'';</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The PMA supplement provides a full explanation of the basis for  the changes;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The applicant has received acknowledgement from FDA of receipt  of the supplement; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The PMA supplement specifically identifies the date that such  changes are being effected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following changes are permitted by paragraph (d)(1) of this  section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Labeling changes that add or strengthen a contraindication,  warning, precaution, or information about an adverse reaction for which  there is reasonable evidence of a causal association.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Labeling changes that add or strengthen an instruction that is  intended to enhance the safe use of the device.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Labeling changes that delete misleading, false, or unsupported  indications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Changes in quality controls or manufacturing process that add a  new specification or test method, or otherwise provide additional  assurance of purity, identity, strength, or reliability of the device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FDA will identify a change to a device for which an applicant  has an approved PMA and for which a PMA supplement under paragraph (a)  is not required. FDA will identify such a change in an advisory opinion  under Sec. 10.85, if the change applies to a generic type of device, or  in correspondence to the applicant, if the change applies only to the  applicant's device. FDA will require that a change for which a PMA  supplement under paragraph (a) is not required be reported to FDA in:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A periodic report under Sec. 814.84 or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A 30-day PMA supplement under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> FDA will identify, in the advisory opinion or correspondence,  the type of information that is to be included in the report or 30-day  PMA supplement. If the change is required to be reported to FDA in a  periodic report, the change may be made before it is reported to FDA. If  the change is required to be reported in a 30-day PMA supplement, the  change may be made 30 days after FDA files the 30-day PMA supplement  unless FDA requires the PMA holder to provide additional information,  informs the PMA holder that the supplement is not approvable, or  disapproves the supplement. The 30-day PMA supplement shall follow the  instructions in the correspondence or advisory opinion. Any 30-day PMA  supplement that does not meet the requirements of the correspondence or  advisory opinion will not be filed and, therefore, will not be deemed  approved 30 days after receipt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Under section 515(d) of the act, modifications to manufacturing  procedures or methods of manufacture that affect the safety and  effectiveness of a device subject to an approved PMA do not require  submission of a PMA supplement under paragraph (a) of this section and  are eligible to be the subject of a 30-day notice. A 30-day notice shall  describe in detail the change, summarize the data or information  supporting the change, and state that the change has been made in  accordance with the requirements of part 820 of this chapter. The  manufacturer may distribute the device 30 days after the date on which  FDA receives the 30-day notice, unless FDA notifies the applicant within  30 days from receipt of the notice that the notice is not adequate. If  the notice is not adequate, FDA shall inform the applicant in writing  that a 135-day PMA supplement is needed and shall describe what further  information or action is required for acceptance of such change. The  number of days under review as a 30-day notice shall be deducted from  the 135-day PMA supplement review period if the notice meets appropriate  content requirements for a PMA supplement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The submission and grant of a written request for an exception  or alternative under Sec. 801.128 or Sec. 809.11 of this chapter  satisfies the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section.
