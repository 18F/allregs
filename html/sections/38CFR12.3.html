                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Immediately upon the death or the absence without leave of any beneficiary at a field facility, as defined in Sec.  12.0(b), a survey and inventory of the funds and effects of such beneficiary will be taken in the following manner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the death or absence without leave occurred during hospitalization, a complete inventory (VA Form 10-2687, Inventory of Funds and Effects) will be made of all personal effects (including those in the custody of the hospital, jewelry being worn by the deceased person, or jewelry and other effects in pockets of clothing he or she may have been wearing) and all funds found and moneys on deposit in Personal Funds of Patients. In the case of death of incompetent veterans after November 30, 1959, the inventory will be completed to show separately those funds deposited by VA in Personal Funds of Patients that were derived from VA benefits. For purpose of determining the source of funds, expenditures from the account will be considered as having been made from VA benefits, not to exceed the extent of deposits of such benefits. In the event death occurred during other than official working hours, the officer of the day and/or a representative of Nursing Service will collect and inventory all funds and personal effects on the person of the deceased beneficiary and on the ward, will carefully safeguard such property and, upon completion of the tour of duty, will turn the funds and effects over to the properly designated employees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the death or absence without leave occurred while the beneficiary was assigned to a domiciliary section, or while receiving hospitalization and at time of death or absence without leave any effects are in the section, a like inventory will be made by representatives of the Chief, Domiciliary Operations and/or Medical Administration Division.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The inventory report will be executed in triplicate, original and two copies. All will be signed by the employee making the inventory, and disposed of as provided for in pertinent procedural instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Personally owned clothing or other effects (such as tooth brushes, false teeth not containing gold, etc.), which are unserviceable by reason of wear or tear or insanitary condition, and clothing that had been supplied by the Government, will not be included in this inventory; instead, the unserviceable personally owned articles will be listed on a separate list, with their condition briefly described, and their disposition recommended in a separate report to the facility head. The facility head, if approving this recommendation, will order destruction or utilization in occupational therapy, or as wipe rags, etc., of such unserviceable articles and, when they are so destroyed or utilized, will have entered on the papers the date and nature of the disposition. The completed papers will then be placed in the correspondence file of the beneficiary. Clothing that had been supplied by the Government will be reconditioned if possible and returned to stock for issue to other eligible beneficiaries. When Government-owned clothing cannot be reconditioned it will be disposed of.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When the nearest relative requests that the deceased beneficiary be clad for burial in clothing he or she personally owned, instead of burial clothing to be supplied under the contract for mortuary services, such request will be honored. A receipt in such cases will be obtained from the undertaker, specifying the articles of clothing so used. Adjustment of the undertaker's bill in the case will correspondingly be made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In accomplishing such inventories, detailed description will be given of items of material value or importance, for example:
Watch--Yellow metal (make, movement, and case number, if available without damage to watch).Ring--Yellow metal (probably gold-plated or stamped 14-K., setting if any).Discharge certificate.Adjusted service certificate (number).

Bonds or stocks (name of company, registered or nonregistered, identifying number, recited par value, if any).Bank books or other asset evidence (name of bank or other obligor, apparent value, identifying numbers, etc.).Clothing (brief description and statement of condition). Etc.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon completion of the survey and inventory, the effects will be turned over to the designated employee for safekeeping. Any funds found in excess of $100 which apparently were the property of the deceased will be turned over to the details clerk and delivered immediately to the agent cashier, who shall deposit same in the account ``Personal Funds of Patients''. Unendorsed checks other than Treasury checks and funds not in excess of $100 will be considered personal effects and not funds and will be handled accordingly.
