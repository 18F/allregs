                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The overtime pay exemption provided by section 7(b)(3) is  ``limited to 12 hours a day and 56 hours a week'' in any workweek; the  exemption is provided ``for employment up to 12 hours in any workday and  up to 56 hours in any workweek'' without any payment for overtime hours  at one and one-half times the regular rate being required. However, the  exemption from any such time-and-one-half payment is limited to  workweeks when ``no more'' than the specified hours are worked and is  contingent on payment to the employee in such a workweek of  ``compensation for hours between 40 and 56'' at a rate ``not less than  one and one-half times the applicable minimum wage.'' (H. Rept. No.  1366, pp. 12-13, 43, and S. Rept. No. 1487, p. 32, 89th Cong., second  sess.) Thus, the exemption will be applicable to an employee otherwise  eligible under the principles previously discussed in this part in any  workweek when his hours of work do not exceed   12 in any day or 56 in the week if, and only if, his ``compensation for  employment in excess of forty hours'' is ``at a rate not less than one  and one-half times the minimum wage rate applicable to him under section  6'', as provided in section 7(b)(3). This means that in addition to the  requirement of section 6, under which the first 40 hours of work must be  paid for at a rate not less than the minimum hourly wage rate therein  specified, the compensation requirements applicable to such an employee  for whom the 7(b)(3) exemption is claimed include any increase in his  regular straight-time pay rate for the hours worked in excess of 40  which may be necessary in order to raise the wage rate for such hours to  a level of 50 percent above the rate required under section 6. Of  course, if the employee is employed at a regular straight-time rate for  all his hours of work which is as great or greater than one and one-half  times the minimum wage applicable to him under section 6, no increase  for the hours in excess of 40 will be required under the provisions of  section 7(b)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)</em> was accordingly  $1.95 an hour; for those subject to the $1.45 rate beginning February 1,  1970, such rate is $2.175. A discussion of the present and prior  coverage of the Act will be found in part 776 of this chapter, when a  revision of such part discussing enterprise coverage is published.</p>
