                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prevented planting is the inability to plant an eligible crop with proper equipment during the planting period as a result of an eligible cause of loss, as determined by CCC. The eligible cause of loss that prevented the planting must have:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Occurred after a previous planting period for the crop;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Occurred before the final planting date for the crop in the applicable crop year or, in the case of multiple plantings, the harvest date of the first planting in the applicable planting period, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Similarly affected other producers in the area, as determined by CCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> FSA may approve acreage as ``prevented planted acreage'' if all other conditions for such approval are met and provided the conditions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, producers must report the acreage, on forms specified by FSA, within 15 calendar days after the final planting date determined for the crop by FSA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the acreage is reported after the period identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the application must be filed in time to permit:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The county committee or its authorized representative to make a farm visit to verify eligible disaster conditions that prevented the specified acreage or crop from being planted; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The county committee or its authorized representative the opportunity to determine, based on visual inspection, that the acreage or crop in question was affected by eligible disaster conditions such as damaging weather or other adverse natural occurrences that prevented the acreage or crop from being planted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A farm visit to inspect the acreage or crop is required for all late-filed acreage reports where prevented planting credit is sought. Under no circumstance may acreage reported after the 15-day period referenced in paragraph (b)(1) of this section be deemed acceptable unless the criteria in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are met. State and county committees do not have the authority to waive the field inspection and verification provisions for late-filed reports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All determinations made during field inspections must be documented on each late-filed acreage report, with results also recorded in county committee minutes to support the documentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The acreage must have been prevented from being planted as the result of a natural disaster and not a management decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The prevented planted acreage report was approved by the county committee. The county committee may disapprove prevented planted acreage credit if it is not satisfied with the documentation provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To receive prevented planted credit for acreage, the producer must show to the satisfaction of FSA that the producer intended to plant the acreage. Documentation supporting such intent includes documents related to field preparation, seed purchase, and any other information that shows the acreage could and would have been planted and harvested absent the natural disaster or eligible cause of loss that prevented the planting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prevented planted acreage credit will not be given to crops where the prevented-planted acreage was affected by drought, unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On the final planting date for non-irrigated acreage, the area that is prevented from being planted has insufficient soil moisture for germination of seed and progress toward crop maturity because of a prolonged period of dry weather, as determined by CCC; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prolonged precipitation deficiencies exceeded the D2 level as determined using the U.S. Drought Monitor; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Verifiable information is collected from sources whose business or purpose it is to record weather conditions, as determined by CCC, and including but not limited to the local weather reporting stations of the U.S. National Weather Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Prevented planted acreage credit under this part applies to irrigated crops where the acreage was prevented from being planted due to a lack of

water resulting from drought conditions or contamination by saltwater intrusion of an irrigation supply resulting from drought conditions if there was not a reasonable probability of having adequate water to carry out an irrigation practice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Acreage ineligible for prevented planting coverage includes, but is not limited to, acreage:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With respect to which the planting history or conservation plans indicate it would remain fallow for crop rotation purposes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Used for conservation purposes or intended to be or considered to have been left unplanted under any program administered by USDA, including the Conservation Reserve and Wetland Reserve Programs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Not planted because of a management decision;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Affected by the containment or release of water by any governmental, public, or private dam or reservoir project, if an easement exists on the acreage affected for the containment or release of water;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where any other person receives a prevented planted payment for any crop for the same crop year, unless the acreage meets all the requirements for double cropping under this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Where pasture or other forage crop is in place on the acreage during the time that planting of the crop generally occurs in the area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Where another crop is planted (previous or subsequent) that does not meet the double cropping definition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Where any volunteer or cover crop is hayed, grazed, or otherwise harvested on the acreage for the same crop year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Where there is an inadequate supply of irrigation water beginning on the Federal crop insurance sale closing date for the previous crop year or the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) application closing date for the crop as specified in part 1437 of this title through the final planting date of the current year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> On which a failure or breakdown of irrigation equipment or facilities, unless the failure or breakdown is due to a natural disaster;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> That is under quarantine imposed by a county, State, or Federal government agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> That is affected by chemical or herbicide residue, unless the residue is due to a natural disaster;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> That is affected by drifting herbicide;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> On which a crop was produced, but the producer was unable to obtain a market for the crop;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Involving a planned planting of a ``value loss crop'' as that term is defined for NAP as specified in part 1437 of this title, including, but not limited to, Christmas trees, aquaculture, or ornamental nursery, for which NAP assistance is provided under value loss procedure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> For which the claim for prevented planted credit relates to trees or other perennials unless the producer can prove resources were available to plant, grow, and harvest the crop, as applicable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> That is affected by wildlife damage;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> Upon which, the reduction in the water supply for irrigation is due to participation in an electricity buy-back program, or the sale of water under a water buy-back or legislative changes regarding water usage, or any other cause which is not a natural disaster; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(19)</em> That is devoted to non-cropland.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> CCC may allow exceptions to acreage ineligible for prevented planting coverage when surface water or ground water is reduced because of a natural disaster (as determined by CCC).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Failed acreage is acreage that was planted with the proper equipment during the planting period but failed as a result of an eligible cause of loss, as determined by CCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> To be approved by CCC as failed acreage the acreage must have been reported as failed acreage before disposition of the crop, and the acreage must have been planted under normal conditions but failed as the result of a natural disaster and not a management decision. Producers who file a failed acreage report must have the request acted on by the county committee. The county committee may will deny the

acreage report if it is not satisfied with the documentation provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> To receive failed acreage credit the producer must show all of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the acreage was planted under normal conditions using the proper equipment with the intent to harvest the acreage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide documentation that the crop was planted using farming practices consistent for the crop and area, but could not be brought to harvest because of disaster-related conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The eligible cause for failed acreage must have:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Occurred after the crop was planted, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before the normal harvest date for the crop in the applicable crop year or in the case of multiple plantings, the harvest date of the first planting in the applicable planting period, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other producers in the area were similarly affected as determined by CCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Eligible failed acreage will be determined on the basis of the producer planting the crop under normal conditions with the expectation to take the crop to harvest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Acreage ineligible for failed acreage credit includes, but is not limited to acreage:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Which was planted using methods that could not be considered normal for the area and without the expectation of harvest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Used for conservation purposes or intended to be or considered to have been un-harvested under any program administered by USDA, including the Conservation Reserve and Wetland Reserve Programs; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That failed because of a management decision.
