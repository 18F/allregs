                                Sec. 1.9005-2  Effect of election.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. If a taxpayer makes the election described in  paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.9005-1, he shall be deemed to have consented to  the application of section 2 of the Act with respect to all the clay and  quartzite described in that paragraph for all taxable years for which  the election is effective whether or not the taxpayer is litigating the  issue for any of such years. Thus, in applying section 613(c) of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and corresponding provisions of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1939) to those years:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term ``ordinary treatment processes'' shall include  crushing, grinding, and separating the mineral from waste, but shall not  include any subsequent process; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The gross income from mining for each short ton of quartzite or  clay mined by the taxpayer and used by him in the production of all  refractory products sold during the taxable year shall be equal to 87\1/ 2\ percent of the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The average lowest published or advertised price, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The average lowest actual selling price at which the mine owner  or operator offered to sell or sold any such quartzite or clay during  the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Rules for applying paragraph (a) of this section. (1) The price  described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and any price described in  this paragraph shall be determined with reference to quartzite or clay  in the form and condition of such products after the application of only  the processes described in paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section and before  transportation from the plant in which such processes were applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If quartzite and clay were mined and used by the taxpayer in the  production of refractory products, a separate price shall be used with  respect to each mineral.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> There shall be used for each mineral the lowest price at which  it was sold or offered for sale by the taxpayer during the taxable year.  Thus, only one price shall be used with respect to each mineral  regardless of variations in type or grade.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of this paragraph, exceptional, unusual, or nominal  sales of quartzite or clay shall be disregarded. Thus, for example, if  the taxpayer made an accommodation sale during the taxable year at other  than the regular price, such sale is to be disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the taxpayer made no sales during the taxable year of  quartzite or clay in the form and condition described in subparagraph  (1) of this paragraph, or if his sales were exceptional, unusual, or  nominal, there shall be used the lowest recognized selling price for the  taxpayer's marketing area for quartzite or clay (of the same grade and  type as that used by him) which was published for the taxable year in a  trade journal or other industry publication.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If subparagraph (5) of this paragraph does not apply for the  reason that there is no recognized selling price published in a trade  journal or other industry publication for the taxpayer's marketing area,  there shall be used the lowest price at which quartzite or clay  comparable to that used by the taxpayer was sold or offered for sale  during the taxable year in that area by other producers similarly  circumstanced as the taxpayer or, if appropriate, the lowest price paid  by   the taxpayer for purchased quartzite or clay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> If the lowest selling price otherwise applicable under the  preceding provisions of this paragraph fluctuated during the taxable  year, the two or more lowest selling prices shall be averaged according  to the number of days during the taxable year that each such price was  in effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Taxpayer A, a calendar year taxpayer, mined  quartzite and clay and used them in the production of recognized  refractory products. During the taxable year, the lowest price for which  A sold clay after the application of crushing and grinding was $13.75  per short ton. He also sold some ground clay of a different type at  $20.00 per short ton. A sold quartzite after the application of crushing  and grinding for various prices, depending upon type, ranging from  $14.00 per short ton to $20.00 per short ton. During the taxable year,  the prices for the various types of ground clay and quartzite did not  change. None of the sales by A of ground clay or quartzite were  exceptional, unusual, or nominal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determination of gross income from mining. If A makes the  election described in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.9005-1, the gross income  from mining per short ton of clay mined by A and used in the production  of refractory products sold during the taxable year is $12.03 (87\1/2\  percent of $13.75), and the gross income from mining per short ton of  quartzite mined by A and used in the production of refractory products  sold during the taxable year is $12.25 (87\1/2\ percent of $14.00). To  determine his gross income from mining, A must compute the sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> $12.03 multiplied by the number of short tons of clay which were  mined by A (whether or not during the taxable year) and which were used  by A in the production of refractory products (refractory bonding  mortar, fire brick, etc.) sold during the taxable year; plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> $12.25 multiplied by the number of short tons of quartzite which  were mined by A (whether or not during the taxable year) and which were  used by A in the production of refractory products sold during the  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that on  October 1 of the taxable year A's lowest price for clay after the  application of crushing and grinding increased to $14.40 per short ton.  In this case, the average lowest price for which A sold ground clay  during the taxable year must be determined by taking into account the  price adjustment of October 1. Under these circumstances, the average  lowest price for the ground clay would be $13.91, that is $13.75x273/365  plus $14.40x92/365.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effect on depletion rates and other items. The election shall  have no effect on the applicable rate of percentage depletion for the  taxable years for which the election is effective. In applying the  election to the years affected there shall be taken into account the  effect that any adjustments resulting from the election shall have on  other items affected thereby, such as charitable contributions, foreign  tax credit, net operating loss, and the effect that adjustments to any  such items shall have on other taxable years. The provisions of section  2 of the Act are applicable with respect to taxable years subject to the  Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for purposes of applying sections 450 and  453 of that Code. The election shall have no effect on the determination  of the treatment processes which are to be considered as mining or on  the determination of gross income from mining for any taxable year  beginning after December 31, 1960.  (Sec. 2(f), 75 Stat. 683; 26 U.S.C. 613 note)  [T.D. 6583, 26 FR 12078, Dec. 16, 1961]</p>
