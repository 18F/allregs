Once every 30 days, the control unit team, comprised of the control unit manager and other members designated by the Warden (ordinarily to include the officer-in-charge or lieutenant, case manager, and education staff member assigned to the unit), shall meet with an inmate in the control unit. The inmate is required to attend the team meeting in order to be eligible for the previous month's stay in the control unit to be credited towards the projected duration of confinement in that unit. The unit team shall make an assessment of the inmate's progress within the unit and may make a recommendation as to readiness for release after considering the inmate's:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unit status;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adjustment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Readiness for release from the unit. (See Sec. 541.50(a))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Warden shall serve as the review authority at the institutional level for unit team actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An inmate may appeal the Warden's decision to the Executive Panel within five working days of receipt of that decision. The inmate will receive a response to this appeal at the inmate's next appearance before the Executive Panel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> At least once every 60 to 90 days, the Executive Panel shall review the status of an inmate in a control unit to determine the inmate's readiness for release from the Unit. The Executive Panel shall consider those factors specified in Sec. 541.50(a), along with any recommendations by the unit team and Warden.
The decision of the Executive Panel is communicated to the inmate. Ordinarily, the inmate is interviewed in person at this review. If the inmate refuses to appear for this review, or if there is other reason for not having an in-person review, this will be documented.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An inmate may appeal a decision of the Executive Panel, through the Administrative Remedy Procedure, directly to the Office of General Counsel, Bureau of Prisons within 30 calendar days from the date of the Executive Panel's response.
