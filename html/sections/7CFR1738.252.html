For this construction to be eligible for reimbursement with loan funds, all construction procedures contained in this part must be followed. Note, however, that the Agency's extension of a loan offer is not a guarantee that a loan will be made, unless and until a loan contract has been entered into between the applicant and RUS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The build-out must be complete within three years and 4 months from the date of the loan contract.
