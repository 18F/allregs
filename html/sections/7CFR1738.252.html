For this construction to be eligible for reimbursement with loan funds, all construction procedures contained herein must be followed. The Agency's determination that an application is complete is not a commitment that a loan will be approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The borrower must begin construction within six months from the date the Agency notifies the applicant that loan funds are available. This is the final step in closing the loan with the applicant. If the borrower fails to begin construction, the Agency may cancel the loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The build-out must be complete within three years from the day the Agency notifies the applicant that loan funds are available. Build-out is considered complete when the network design has been fully implemented, the service operations and management systems infrastructure is operational, and the borrower is ready to support the activation and commissioning of individual customers to the new system.</p>
