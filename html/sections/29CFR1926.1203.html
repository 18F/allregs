                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before it begins work at a worksite, each employer must ensure  that a competent person identifies all confined spaces in which one or  more of the employees it directs may work, and identifies each space  that is a permit space, through consideration and evaluation of the  elements of that space, including testing as necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the workplace contains one or more permit spaces, the  employer who identifies, or who receives notice of, a permit space must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inform exposed employees by posting danger signs or by any other  equally effective means, of the existence and location of, and the  danger posed by, each permit space; and</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (b)(1). A sign reading ``DANGER--PERMIT-REQUIRED  CONFINED SPACE, DO NOT ENTER'' or using other similar language would  satisfy the requirement for a sign.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inform, in a timely manner and in a manner other than posting,  its employees' authorized representatives and the controlling contractor  of the existence and location of, and the danger posed by, each permit  space.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each employer who identifies, or receives notice of, a permit  space and has not authorized employees it directs to work in that space  must take effective measures to prevent those employees from entering  that permit space, in addition to complying with all other applicable  requirements of this standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If any employer decides that employees it directs will enter a  permit space, that employer must have a written permit space program  that complies with Sec. 1926.1204 implemented at the construction site.  The written program must be made available prior to and during entry  operations for inspection by employees and their authorized  representatives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An employer whose employees enter a permit space need not comply  with Sec. Sec. 1926.1204 through 1206 and Sec. Sec. 1926.1208 through  1211, provided that all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The employer can demonstrate that all physical hazards in the  space are eliminated or isolated through engineering controls so that  the only hazard posed by the permit space is an actual or potential  hazardous atmosphere;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employer can demonstrate that continuous forced air  ventilation alone is sufficient to maintain that permit space safe for  entry, and that, in the event the ventilation system stops working,  entrants can exit the space safely;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The employer develops monitoring and inspection data that  supports the demonstrations required by paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of  this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If an initial entry of the permit space is necessary to obtain  the data required by paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, the entry is  performed in compliance with Sec. Sec. 1926.1204 through 1926.1211;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The determinations and supporting data required by paragraphs  (e)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section are documented by the  employer and are made available to each employee who enters the permit  space under the terms of paragraph (e) of this section or to that  employee's authorized representative; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Entry into the permit space under the terms of paragraph (e)(1)  of this section is performed in accordance with the requirements of  paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth4">Note to paragraph (e)(1). See paragraph (g) of this section for  reclassification of a permit space after all hazards within the space  have been eliminated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following requirements apply to entry into permit spaces  that meet   the conditions set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any conditions making it unsafe to remove an entrance cover must  be eliminated before the cover is removed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When entrance covers are removed, the opening must be  immediately guarded by a railing, temporary cover, or other temporary  barrier that will prevent an accidental fall through the opening and  that will protect each employee working in the space from foreign  objects entering the space.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Before an employee enters the space, the internal atmosphere  must be tested, with a calibrated direct-reading instrument, for oxygen  content, for flammable gases and vapors, and for potential toxic air  contaminants, in that order. Any employee who enters the space, or that  employee's authorized representative, must be provided an opportunity to  observe the pre-entry testing required by this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> No hazardous atmosphere is permitted within the space whenever  any employee is inside the space.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Continuous forced air ventilation must be used, as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An employee must not enter the space until the forced air  ventilation has eliminated any hazardous atmosphere;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The forced air ventilation must be so directed as to ventilate  the immediate areas where an employee is or will be present within the  space and must continue until all employees have left the space;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The air supply for the forced air ventilation must be from a  clean source and must not increase the hazards in the space.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em>.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> If a hazard is detected during entry:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Each employee must leave the space immediately;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The space must be evaluated to determine how the hazard  developed; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The employer must implement measures to protect employees from  the hazard before any subsequent entry takes place.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The employer must ensure a safe method of entering and  exiting the space. If a hoisting system is used, it must be designed and  manufactured for personnel hoisting; however, a job-made hoisting system  is permissible if it is approved for personnel hoisting by a registered  professional engineer, in writing, prior to use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> The employer must verify that the space is safe for entry and  that the pre-entry measures required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section  have been taken, through a written certification that contains the date,  the location of the space, and the signature of the person providing the  certification. The certification must be made before entry and must be  made available to each employee entering the space or to that employee's  authorized representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When there are changes in the use or configuration of a non- permit confined space that might increase the hazards to entrants, or  some indication that the initial evaluation of the space may not have  been adequate, each entry employer must have a competent person  reevaluate that space and, if necessary, reclassify it as a permit- required confined space.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)(1)</em>   through (4) of this section have been met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the permit space poses no actual or potential atmospheric  hazards and if all hazards within the space are eliminated or isolated  without entry into the space (unless the employer can demonstrate that  doing so without entry is infeasible), the permit space may be  reclassified as a non-permit confined space for as long as the non- atmospheric hazards remain eliminated or isolated;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The entry employer must eliminate or isolate the hazards without  entering the space, unless it can demonstrate that this is infeasible.  If it is necessary to enter the permit space to eliminate or isolate  hazards, such entry must be performed under Sec. Sec. 1926.1204 through  1926.1211. If testing and inspection during that entry demonstrate that  the hazards within the permit space have been eliminated or isolated,  the permit space may be reclassified as a non-permit confined space for  as long as the hazards remain eliminated or isolated;</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (g)(2). Control of atmospheric hazards through  forced air ventilation does not constitute elimination or isolation of  the hazards. Paragraph (e) of this section covers permit space entry  where the employer can demonstrate that forced air ventilation alone  will control all hazards in the space.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The entry employer must document the basis for determining that  all hazards in a permit space have been eliminated or isolated, through  a certification that contains the date, the location of the space, and  the signature of the person making the determination. The certification  must be made available to each employee entering the space or to that  employee's authorized representative; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If hazards arise within a permit space that has been  reclassified as a non-permit space under paragraph (g) of this section,  each employee in the space must exit the space. The entry employer must  then reevaluate the space and reclassify it as a permit space as  appropriate in accordance with all other applicable provisions of this  standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Permit space entry communication and coordination. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before  entry operations begin, the host employer must provide the following  information, if it has it, to the controlling contractor:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The location of each known permit space;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The hazards or potential hazards in each space or the reason it  is a permit space; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any precautions that the host employer or any previous  controlling contractor or entry employer implemented for the protection  of employees in the permit space.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before entry operations begin, the controlling contractor must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Obtain the host employer's information about the permit space  hazards and previous entry operations; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide the following information to each entity entering a  permit space and any other entity at the worksite whose activities could  foreseeably result in a hazard in the permit space:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The information received from the host employer;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any additional information the controlling contractor has about  the subjects listed in paragraph (h)(1) of this section; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The precautions that the host employer, controlling contractor,  or other entry employers implemented for the protection of employees in  the permit spaces.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Before entry operations begin, each entry employer must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Obtain all of the controlling contractor's information regarding  permit space hazards and entry operations; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Inform the controlling contractor of the permit space program  that the entry employer will follow, including any hazards likely to be  confronted or created in each permit space.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The controlling contractor and entry employer(s) must coordinate  entry operations when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> More than one entity performs permit space entry at the same  time; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Permit space entry is performed at the same time that any  activities that could foreseeably result in a hazard in the permit space  are performed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> After entry operations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The controlling contractor must debrief each entity that entered  a permit space regarding the permit space program followed and any  hazards confronted or created in the permit space(s) during entry  operations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The entry employer must inform the controlling contractor in a  timely manner of the permit space program followed and of any hazards  confronted or created in the permit space(s) during entry operations;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The controlling contractor must apprise the host employer of  the information exchanged with the entry entities pursuant to this  subparagraph.</p><p class="depth4">Note to paragraph (h). Unless a host employer or controlling  contractor has or will have employees in a confined space, it is not  required to enter any confined space to collect the information  specified in this paragraph (h).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> If there is no controlling contractor present at the worksite,  the requirements for, and role of, controlling contactors in this  section must be fulfilled by the host employer or other employer who  arranges to have employees of another employer perform work that  involves permit space entry.</p>
