                                Sec. 122.120  Transportation to another port for exportation.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application. Air cargo may be transferred as transit air cargo  at the port of arrival for transportation to another port in the U.S.  and later exportation under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Supervision--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From port of arrival to exportation port. The  director of the port of arrival shall order any supervision found  necessary for the transfer of transit air cargo for transportation to  another port for export.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At exportation port. Customs shall be notified far enough in  advance to be able to make any required supervision of the lading of  cargo, and to enforce any other Federal agency requirements, when  transit air cargo is ready for lading on the exporting aircraft.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time. Transit air cargo covered by this section shall be  delivered to Customs at the port of exportation within 15 days from the  date of receipt by the forwarding airline.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transit air cargo manifest copies. Five copies of the transit  air cargo manifest shall be filed with Customs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Port of arrival. Two copies of the transit air cargo manifest,  marked separately as ``permit'' and ``control'' copies, shall be filed  with Customs at the port of arrival. Filing shall be made when the  arriving aircraft enters, or before the general order period ends, by  the airline which presents a receipt to transport the cargo from the  port of arrival to the port of destination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Port of exportation. Three copies of the transit air cargo  manifest shall be filed at the port of exportation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Carrier manifest copy. The carrier manifest copy shall be  attached to the listing of cargo shipments and submitted when the cargo  arrives at the exportation port.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exportation and clearance copies. Two copies, marked separately  as ``exportation'' and ``clearance'' copies, shall be filed with Customs  at the exportation port.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Delivery to exporting airline. When the transit air cargo  arrives at the exportation port, it may be delivered directly to the  exporting carrier, together with the exportation and clearance copies.  The name of the exporting carrier shall be clearly noted on the carrier  manifest copy, which shall then be delivered to Customs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Storage by exporting airline. The exporting carrier shall keep  all cargo listed on the transit air cargo manifest in one storage space.  This storage space shall be separate from the area in which special  shipments which require a license under paragraph (g) of this section  are stored.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Export license--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Review. A Customs officer shall review the  carrier manifest copy of the transit air cargo manifest to make sure  that the export licensing requirements of other Federal agencies have  been followed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information inadequate. If the manifest information is not  enough for Customs to determine that a license or other requirement  applies, then the transit air cargo shall be checked by examination, or  by inspection of the air waybills or attached invoices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When license or other requirement applies. The exporting airline  shall be notified at once if Customs finds that the shipment cannot be  exported without a license or other approval. The shipment shall then be  put under constructive Customs custody in a special area set aside for  the shipment in the exporting airline's cargo terminal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Filing of exportation and clearance copies--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information.  When filed with Customs, the exportation and clearance copies of the  transit air cargo manifest shall each show:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The aircraft number;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The aircraft flight number; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Filing. The exporting airline shall file the exportation and  clearance copies before the aircraft that carries the transit air cargo  departs. The clearance copies shall be grouped together and not mixed in  with other outward manifest sheets. The exportation copies shall be  grouped together, and kept separate from the outward clearance  documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Cargo not laden at same airport by same airline. If all the  cargo listed on one transit air cargo manifest sheet is not laden for  exportation from the same U.S. airport by the same airline, then  separate entries on Customs Form 7512 are required for each cargo  shipment listed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For transportation and exportation under subpart J of this part;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For direct exportation under Sec. 18.25 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Cargo laden on more than one aircraft of same airline. When any  cargo shipment listed on the same transit air cargo manifest must be  exported on more than one aircraft of the same airline, Sec. 122.118(d)  applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Failure to deliver. If all or part of the cargo listed on the  transit air cargo manifest is not accounted for with an exportation copy  within 40 days, the director of the port of arrival shall take action as  provided in Sec. 122.119(d).
