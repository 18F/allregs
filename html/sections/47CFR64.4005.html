                            <p class="depth0">To the extent that a carrier incurs costs associated with providing  the notifications required by this section, the carrier may recover such  costs, consistent with federal and state laws, through the filing of  tariffs, via negotiated agreements, or by other appropriate mechanisms.  Any cost recovery method must be reasonable and must recover only costs  that are associated with providing the particular information. The  imposition of unreasonable terms or conditions on the provision of  information required by this section may be considered an unreasonable  carrier practice under section 201(b) of the Communications Act of 1934,  as amended, and may subject the carrier to appropriate enforcement  action.</p>
