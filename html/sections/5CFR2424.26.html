                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of the agency's reply is to inform the  Authority and the exclusive representative whether and why it disagrees  with any facts or arguments made for the first time in the exclusive  representative's response. As more fully explained in paragraph (c) of  this section, the Agency is required in the reply to, among other  things, provide the reasons why the proposal or provision does not fit  within any exceptions to management rights that were asserted by the  exclusive representative in its response, and to explain why severance  of the proposal or provision is not appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time limit for filing. Unless the time limit for filing has been  extended pursuant to Sec. 2424.23 or part 2429 of this subchapter,  within fifteen (15) days after the date the agency receives a copy of  the exclusive representative's response to the agency's statement of  position, the agency may file a reply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Content. You must file your reply on a form that the Authority  has provided for that purpose, or in a substantially similar format. You  meet this requirement if you file your reply electronically through use  of the eFiling system on the FLRA's Web site at www.flra.gov. That Web  site also provides copies of reply forms. You must   limit your reply to matters that the exclusive representative raised for  the first time in its response. Your reply must: State the arguments and  authorities supporting your position; cite with specificity any law,  rule, regulation, section of a collective bargaining agreement, or other  authority that you rely on; and provide a copy of any material that the  Authority may not easily access (which you may upload as attachments if  you file your reply electronically through use of the FLRA's eFiling  system). You must date your reply, unless you file it electronically  through use of the FLRA's eFiling system. And, regardless of how you  file your reply, you must ensure that it includes the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any disagreement with the exclusive representative's assertion  that an exception to management rights applies, including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether and why the proposal or provision concerns a matter  included in section 7106(b)(1) of the Federal Service Labor-Management  Relations Statute;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether and why the proposal or provision does not constitute a  negotiable procedure as set forth in section 7106(b)(2) of the Federal  Service Labor-Management Relations Statute;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether and why the proposal or provision does not constitute  an appropriate arrangement as set forth in section 7106(b)(3) of the  Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether and why the proposal or provision does not enforce an  ``applicable law,'' within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2) of the  Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any arguments in reply to an exclusive representative's  allegation in its response that agency rules or regulations relied on in  the agency's statement of position violate applicable law, rule,  regulation or appropriate authority outside the agency; that the rules  or regulations were not issued by the agency or by any primary national  subdivision of the agency, or otherwise are not applicable to bar  negotiations under 5 U.S.C. 7117(a)(3); or that no compelling need  exists for the rules or regulations to bar negotiations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Severance. If the exclusive representative requests severance  for the first time in its response, or if the request for severance in  an exclusive representative's response differs from the request in its  petition for review, and if the agency opposes the exclusive  representative's request for severance, then the agency must explain  with specificity why severance is not appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Service. A copy of the agency's reply, including all  attachments, must be served in accord with Sec. 2424.2(g).  [63 FR 66413, Dec. 2, 1998, as amended at 74 FR 51745, Oct. 8, 2009; 77  FR 26434, May 4, 2012]</p>
