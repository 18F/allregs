                                Sec. 404.260  Special minimum primary insurance amounts.

                            <p class="depth0">Regardless of the method we use to compute your primary insurance  amount, if the special minimum primary insurance amount described in  Sec. 404.261 is higher, then your benefits (and those of your dependents  or survivors) will be based on the special minimum primary insurance  amount. Special minimum primary insurance amounts are not based on a  worker's average earnings, as are primary insurance amounts computed  under other methods. Rather, the special minimum primary insurance  amount is designed to provide higher benefits to people who worked for  long periods in low-paid jobs covered by social security.</p>
