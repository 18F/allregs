Except  for when the exemption pertains to information that should clearly and  demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human  source, or a human intelligence source, or key design concepts of  weapons of mass destruction, the revised ``Declassify On'' line shall  also include the new date for declassification as approved by the Panel,  not to exceed 50 years from the date of origin of the record.
