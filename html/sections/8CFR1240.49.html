                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of the Act and  believes that he or she meets the eligibility requirements for a waiver  of the ground of inadmissibility, he or she may apply to the immigration  judge for such waiver. The immigration judge shall inform the respondent  of his or her apparent eligibility to apply for any of the benefits  enumerated in this paragraph and shall afford the respondent an  opportunity to make application therefor during the hearing. In a  relevant case, the immigration judge may adjudicate the sufficiency of   an Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A (Form I-864), executed on  behalf of an applicant for admission or for adjustment of status, in  accordance with the provisions of section 213A of the Act and 8 CFR part  213a. In exercising discretionary power when considering an application  under this paragraph, the immigration judge may consider and base the  decision on information not contained in the record and not made  available for inspection by the respondent, provided the Commissioner  has determined that such information is relevant and is classified under  the applicable Executive Order as requiring protection from unauthorized  disclosure in the interest of national security. Whenever the  immigration judge believes that he or she can do so while safeguarding  both the information and its source, the immigration judge should inform  the respondent of the general nature of the information in order that  the respondent may have an opportunity to offer opposing evidence. A  decision based in whole or in part on such classified information shall  state that the information is material to the decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Voluntary departure. The respondent may apply to the immigration  judge for voluntary departure in lieu of deportation pursuant to section  244(e) of the Act and Sec. 1240.56.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applications for asylum or withholding of deportation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  immigration judge shall notify the respondent that if he or she is  finally ordered deported, his or her deportation will in the first  instance be directed pursuant to section 243(a) of the Act to the  country designated by the respondent and shall afford him or her an  opportunity then and there to make such designation. The immigration  judge shall then specify and state for the record the country, or  countries in the alternative, to which respondent's deportation will be  directed pursuant to section 243(a) of the Act if the country of his or  her designation will not accept him or her into its territory, or fails  to furnish timely notice of acceptance, or if the respondent declines to  designate a country.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the alien expresses fear of persecution or harm upon return  to any of the countries to which the alien might be deported pursuant to  paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the alien has not previously filed  an application for asylum or withholding of deportation that has been  referred to the immigration judge by an asylum officer in accordance  with Sec. 1208.14(b) of this chapter, the immigration judge shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Advise the alien that he or she may apply for asylum in the  United States or withholding of deportation to those countries; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Make available the appropriate application forms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An application for asylum or withholding of deportation must be  filed with the Immigration Court, pursuant to Sec. 1208.4(b) of this  chapter. Upon receipt of an application, the Immigration Court may  forward a copy to the Department of State pursuant to Sec. 1208.11 of  this chapter and shall calendar the case for a hearing. The reply, if  any, of the Department of State, unless classified under an applicable  Executive Order, shall be given to both the applicant and to DHS counsel  and shall be included in the record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Applications for asylum or withholding of deportation so filed  will be decided by the immigration judge pursuant to the requirements  and standards established in 8 CFR part 1208 after an evidentiary  hearing that is necessary to resolve factual issues in dispute. An  evidentiary hearing extending beyond issues related to the basis for a  mandatory denial of the application pursuant to Sec. 1208.13 or Sec.  1208.16 of this chapter is not necessary once the immigration judge has  determined that such a denial is required.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Evidentiary hearings on applications for asylum or withholding  of deportation will be open to the public unless the applicant expressly  requests that it be closed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Nothing in this section is intended to limit the authority of  the immigration judge properly to control the scope of any evidentiary  hearing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> During the deportation hearing, the applicant shall be  examined under oath on his or her application and may present evidence  and witnesses in his or her own behalf. The applicant has the burden of  establishing that he or she is a refugee as defined in section  101(a)(42) of the Act pursuant to the   standard set forth in Sec. 1208.13 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The Service counsel for the government may call witnesses and  present evidence for the record, including information classified under  the applicable Executive Order, provided the immigration judge or the  Board has determined that such information is relevant to the hearing.  When the immigration judge receives such classified information he or  she shall inform the applicant. The agency that provides the classified  information to the immigration judge may provide an unclassified summary  of the information for release to the applicant, whenever it determines  it can do so consistently with safeguarding both the classified nature  of the information and its source. The summary should be as detailed as  possible, in order that the applicant may have an opportunity to offer  opposing evidence. A decision based in whole or in part on such  classified information shall state whether such information is material  to the decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The decision of an immigration judge to grant or deny asylum or  withholding of deportation shall be communicated to the applicant and to  the Service counsel for the government. An adverse decision will state  why asylum or withholding of deportation was denied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application for relief under sections 241(a)(1)(H) and  241(a)(1)(E)(iii) of the Act. The respondent may apply to the  immigration judge for relief from deportation under sections  241(a)(1)(H) and 241(a)(1)(E)(iii) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> General. An application under this section shall be made only  during the hearing and shall not be held to constitute a concession of  alienage or deportability in any case in which the respondent does not  admit his alienage or deportability. However, nothing in this section  shall prohibit the Service from using information supplied in an  application for asylum or withholding of deportation submitted to an  asylum officer pursuant to Sec. 1208.2 of this chapter on or after  January 4, 1995, as the basis for issuance of an order to show cause or  a notice to appear to establish alienage or deportability in a case  referred to an immigration judge under Sec. 1208.14(b) of this chapter.  The respondent shall have the burden of establishing that he or she is  eligible for any requested benefit or privilege and that it should be  granted in the exercise of discretion. The respondent shall not be  required to pay a fee on more than one application within paragraphs (a)  and (c) of this section, provided that the minimum fee imposed when more  than one application is made shall be determined by the cost of the  application with the highest fee. Nothing contained in this section is  intended to foreclose the respondent from applying for any benefit or  privilege which he or she believes himself or herself eligible to  receive in proceedings under this part.
