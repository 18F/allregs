If the  marriage is dissolved by divorce, procedures in Sec. 19.11-2(b) shall  be followed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the event an annuitant affected by this paragraph remarries,  the annuitant may elect within one year of remarriage to provide a  survivor annuity for the new spouse equal in amount to the survivor  benefit formerly in effect for the previous spouse less any amount  committed for a former spouse. The annuity of a retiree making such an  election shall be reduced effective on the first day of the first month  which begins at least one year after the remarriage to the amount that  would have been payable had there been no recomputation under paragraph  (a) of this section.</p>
