                            <p class="depth0">No payment may be made under this part unless a proper program  application was filed in accordance with the rules for the program that  generated the payment. That application must have been timely and filed  by someone legally authorized to act for the deceased, disappeared, or  declared-incompetent person. The filer can be the party that earned the  payment themselves--such as the case of a person who filed a program  application before they died--or someone legally authorized to act for  the party that earned the payment. All program conditions for payment  must have been met before the death, disappearance, or incompetency  except for the timely filing of the application for payment by the  person legally authorized to act for the party earning the payment. But,  further, for the payment to be released under the rules of this part, a  second application must be filed. That second application is a release  application filed under this section. In particular, as to the latter,  where all other conditions have been met, persons desiring to claim  payment for themselves or an estate in accordance with this part 707  must do so by filing a release application on Form FSA-325,  ``Application for Payment of Amounts Due Persons Who Have Died,  Disappeared or Have Been Declared Incompetent.If the person who died,  disappeared, or was declared incompetent did not apply for payment by  filing the applicable program application for payment form, such program  application for payment must also be filed in accordance with applicable  regulations. If the payment is made under the Naval Stores Conservation  Program, Part II of the Form FSA-325 shall be executed by the local  District Supervisor of the U.S. Forest Service. In connection with  applications for payment under all other programs itemized in Sec.  707.1, Form FSA-325, and program applications for payments where  required, shall be filed with the FSA county office where the person who  earned the payment would have been required to file his application.
