The employee is required to report any changes to  student status in the interim as soon as they occur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Likewise, at least once each year, OWCP will ask an employee who  receives compensation based on a child's physical or mental inability to  support himself or herself, and who is not covered by Sec. 10.417(d) of  this part, to submit a medical report verifying that the child's medical  condition persists and that it continues to preclude self- support. The  employee is required to report any changes to that status in the  interim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If an employee fails to submit proof within 30 days of the date  of the request, OWCP will suspend the employee's right to compensation  until the requested information is received. At that time OWCP will  reinstate compensation retroactive to the date of suspension, provided  the employee is entitled to such compensation.</p><p class="depth2">Reduction and Termination of Compensation</p>
