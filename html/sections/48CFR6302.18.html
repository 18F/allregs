                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General policy and protective orders. The parties are encouraged  to engage in voluntary discovery procedures. In connection with any  deposition or other discovery procedure, the Board may make any order  which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance,  embarrassment, oppression, undue burden or expense. Such orders may  include limitations on the scope, method, time and place for discovery,  or provisions for protecting the secrecy of confidential information or  documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Obtaining a deposition. After an appeal has been docketed, the  parties may voluntarily agree to take, or the Board may, upon  application of either party and for good cause shown, order the taking  of, testimony of any person by deposition upon oral examination or  written interrogatories before any officer authorized to administer  oaths at the place of examination, for use as evidence or for purposes  of discovery. The application for such order shall specify whether the  purpose of the deposition is for discovery or for use as evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Orders on depositions. The time, place, and manner of taking  depositions are as mutually agreed upon by the parties, or failing such  agreement, as ordered by the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use of evidence. No testimony taken by deposition is considered  as part of the evidence in the hearing of an appeal unless and until  such testimony is offered and received in evidence at the hearing.  Testimony by deposition is not ordinarily received in evidence if the  deponent is present and can testify at the hearing. However, any  deposition may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of a  witness at the hearing. In cases submitted on the record, the Board, in  its discretion, may receive depositions as evidence to supplement the  record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Expenses. Each party bears its own expenses associated with  discovery, unless, in the discretion of the Board, the expenses are  apportioned otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Subpoenas. Where appropriate, any party may request that a  subpoena be issued under the provisions of Rule 24.  [52 FR 48631, Dec. 23, 1987, as amended at 53 FR 34106, Sept. 2, 1988]</p>
