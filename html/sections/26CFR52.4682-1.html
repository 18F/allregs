                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Overview. This section provides rules relating to the tax imposed on ozone-depleting chemicals (ODCs) under section 4681, including rules for identifying taxable ODCs and determining when the tax is imposed, and rules prescribing special treatment for certain ODCs. See Sec. 52.4681-1(a)(1) and (c) for general rules and definitions relating to the tax on ODCs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Taxable ODCs; taxable event--(1) Taxable ODCs--(i) In general. Except as

provided in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section, an ODC is taxable if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Taxable ODCs--(i) In general. Except as

provided in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section, an ODC is taxable if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as

provided in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section, an ODC is taxable if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> It is listed in section 4682(a)(2) on the date it is sold or used by its manufacturer or importer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> It is manufactured in the United States or entered into the United States for consumption, use, or warehousing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Storage containers. An ODC described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is taxable without regard to the type or size of storage container in which the ODC is held.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The application of this paragraph (b)(1) may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A brings CFC-12, an ODC listed in section 4682(a)(2), into the customs territory and enters the CFC-12 for transportation and exportation. The ODC is not taxable because it is not entered for consumption, use, or warehousing. The ODC also would not be taxable if it were admitted to a foreign trade zone (rather than brought into the customs territory) for transportation and exportation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Taxable event--(i) In general--(A) General rule. The tax on an ODC is imposed when the ODC is first sold or used (as defined in Sec. 52.4681-1(c)(6) and (7)) by its manufacturer or importer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general--(A) General rule. The tax on an ODC is imposed when the ODC is first sold or used (as defined in Sec. 52.4681-1(c)(6) and (7)) by its manufacturer or importer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. The tax on an ODC is imposed when the ODC is first sold or used (as defined in Sec. 52.4681-1(c)(6) and (7)) by its manufacturer or importer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Example. The application of this paragraph (b)(2)(i) may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A enters CFC-113, an ODC listed in section 4682(a)(2), into the United States for consumption, use, or warehousing. A warehouses the CFC-113 and then decides to ship the ODC to its factory outside the United States (as defined in Sec. 52.4681-1 (c)(2)). The CFC-113 is a taxable ODC because the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section have been met. However, tax is not imposed on the ODC because there is no taxable event. A did not sell the ODC and, under Sec. 52.4681-1(c)(7), warehousing is not a use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Mixtures. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii), (iv), and (v) of this section, the creation of a mixture containing two or more ingredients is treated as a taxable use of the ODCs contained in the mixture. For this purpose, a mixture cannot be represented by a chemical formula, and an ODC is contained in a mixture only if the chemical identity of the ODC is not changed. Thus, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii), (iv), and (v) of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The tax on the post-1989 ODCs (as defined in Sec. 52.4681-1(c)(9)) contained in mixtures created after December 31, 1989, or on the post-1990 ODCs (as defined in Sec. 52.4681-1(c)(9)) contained in mixtures created after December 31, 1990, is imposed when the mixture is created and not on any subsequent sale or use of the mixture; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> No tax is imposed under section 4681 on the post-1989 ODCs contained in mixtures created before January 1, 1990, or on the post-1990 ODCs contained in mixtures created before January 1, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Mixture elections--(A) Permitted elections. The only elections permitted under this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) are--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An election for the first calendar quarter beginning after December 31, 1989, and all subsequent periods (the 1990 election); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An election for the first calendar quarter beginning after December 31, 1990, and all subsequent periods (the 1991 election).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In general. A manufacturer or importer may elect to treat the sale or use of mixtures containing ODCs as the first sale or use of the ODCs contained in the mixtures. If a 1990 election is made under this paragraph (b)(2)(iii), the tax on post-1989 ODCs contained in a mixture sold or used after December 31, 1989 (including any such mixture created before January 1, 1990) is imposed on the date of such sale or use. Similarly, if a 1991 election is made under this paragraph (b)(2)(iii), the tax on post-1990 ODCs contained in a mixture sold or used after December 31, 1990 (including any such mixture created before January 1, 1991) is imposed on the date of such sale or use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Applicability of elections. An election under this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) applies--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a 1990 election, to all post-1989 ODCs contained in mixtures sold or used by the manufacturer or importer after December 31, 1989 (including any such mixture created before January 1, 1990); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a 1991 election, to all post-1990 ODCs contained in mixtures sold or used by the manufacturer or importer after December 31, 1990 (including any such mixture created before January 1, 1991).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Making the election; revocation. An election under this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) shall be made in accordance with the instructions for the return on which the manufacturer or importer reports liability for tax under section 4681. After October 9, 1990, the election may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Special rule for exports. The creation of a mixture for export is not a taxable use of the ODCs contained in the mixture. If a manufacturer or importer sells a mixture for export, Sec. 52.4682-5 applies to the ODCs contained in the mixture. See Sec. 52.4682-5(e) for rules relating to liability of a purchaser for tax if the mixture is not exported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Special rule for use as a feedstock. The creation of a mixture for use as a feedstock (within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section) is not a taxable use of the ODCs contained in the mixture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> ODCs used as a feedstock--(1) Exemption from tax. No tax is imposed on an ODC if the manufacturer or importer of the ODC--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Exemption from tax. No tax is imposed on an ODC if the manufacturer or importer of the ODC--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Uses the ODC as a feedstock in the manufacture of another chemical; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sells the ODC in a qualifying sale (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(4) of this section) for use as a feedstock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Excess payments--(i) In general. Under section 4682(d)(2)(B), a credit or refund is allowed to a person if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Under section 4682(d)(2)(B), a credit or refund is allowed to a person if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The person uses an ODC as a feedstock; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount of any tax paid with respect to the ODC under section 4681 or 4682 was not determined under section 4682(d)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Procedural rules. See section 6402 and the regulations thereunder for rules relating to claiming a credit or refund of tax paid with respect to ODCs that are used as a feedstock. A credit against the income tax is not allowed for the amount determined under section 4682(d)(2)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definition. An ODC is used as a feedstock only if the ODC is entirely consumed (except for trace amounts) in the manufacture of another chemical. Thus, the transformation of an ODC into one or more new compounds (such as the transformation of CFC-113 into chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE or 1113), of CFC-113 into CFC-115 and CFC-116, or of carbon tetrachloride into hydrochloric acid during petroleum refining or incineration) is treated as use as a feedstock. On the other hand, the ODCs used in a mixture (including an azeotrope such as R-500 or R-502) are not used as a feedstock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Qualifying sale. A sale of ODCs for use as a feedstock is a qualifying sale if the requirements of Sec. 52.4682-2(b)(1) are satisfied with respect to such sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> ODCs used in the manufacture of rigid foam insulation--(1) Phase-in of tax--(i) In general. The amount of tax imposed on an ODC is determined under section 4682(g) if the manufacturer or importer of the ODC--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Phase-in of tax--(i) In general. The amount of tax imposed on an ODC is determined under section 4682(g) if the manufacturer or importer of the ODC--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The amount of tax imposed on an ODC is determined under section 4682(g) if the manufacturer or importer of the ODC--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Uses the ODC during 1990, 1991, 1992, or 1993 in the manufacture of rigid foam insulation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Sells the ODC in a qualifying sale (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(5) of this section) during 1990, 1991, 1992, or 1993.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amount of tax. Under section 4682(g), ODCs described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section are not taxed if sold or used during 1990 and are taxed at a reduced rate if sold or used during 1991, 1992, or 1993.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Excess payments--(i) In general. Under section 4682(g)(3), a credit against income tax or a refund is allowed to a person if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Under section 4682(g)(3), a credit against income tax or a refund is allowed to a person if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The person uses an ODC during 1990, 1991, 1992, or 1993 in the manufacture of rigid foam insulation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount of any tax paid with respect to the ODC under section 4681 or 4682 was not determined under section 4682(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Procedural rules--(A) The amount determined under section 4682(g)(3) shall be treated as a credit described in section 34(a) (relating to credits for gasoline and special fuels) unless a claim for refund has been filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount determined under section 4682(g)(3) shall be treated as a credit described in section 34(a) (relating to credits for gasoline and special fuels) unless a claim for refund has been filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> See section 6402 and the regulations thereunder for rules relating to claiming a credit or refund of the tax paid with respect to ODCs that are used in the manufacture of rigid foam insulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definition--(i) Rigid foam insulation. The term ``rigid foam insulation'' means any rigid foam that is designed for use as thermal insulation in buildings, equipment, appliances, tanks,

railcars, trucks, or vessels, or on pipes, including any such rigid foam actually used for purposes other than insulation. Information such as test reports on R-values and advertising material reflecting R-value claims for a particular rigid foam may be used to show that such rigid foam is designed for use as thermal insulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Rigid foam insulation. The term ``rigid foam insulation'' means any rigid foam that is designed for use as thermal insulation in buildings, equipment, appliances, tanks,

The term ``rigid foam'' means any closed cell polymeric foam (whether or not rigid) in which chlorofluorocarbons are used to fill voids within the polymer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Examples of rigid foam products. Rigid foam includes extruded polystyrene foam, polyisocyanurate foam, spray and pour-in-place polyurethane foam, polyethylene foam, phenolic foam, and any other product that the Commissioner identifies as rigid foam in a pronouncement of general applicability. The form of a product identified under this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) does not affect its character as rigid foam. Thus, such products are rigid foam whether in the form of a board, sheet, backer rod, or wrapping, or in a form applied by spraying, pouring, or frothing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Use in manufacture. An ODC is used in the manufacture of rigid foam insulation if it is incorporated into such product or is expended as a propellant or otherwise in the manufacture or application of such product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Qualifying sale. A sale of an ODC for use in the manufacture of rigid foam insulation is a qualifying sale if the requirements of Sec. 52.4682-2(b)(2) are satisfied with respect to such sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Halons; phase-in of tax. The amount of tax imposed on Halon-1211, Halon-1301, or Halon-2402 (Halons) is determined under section 4682(g) if the manufacturer or importer of Halons sells or uses Halons during 1990, 1991, 1992, or 1993. Under section 4682(g), Halons are not taxed if sold or used during 1990 and are taxed at a reduced rate if sold or used during 1991, 1992, or 1993.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Methyl chloroform; reduced rate of tax in 1993. The amount of tax imposed on methyl chloroform is determined under section 4682(g)(5) if the manufacturer or importer of the methyl chloroform sells or uses it during 1993.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> ODCs used as medical sterilants--(1) Phase-in of tax.
