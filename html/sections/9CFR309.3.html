disposition of such livestock is determined. Any livestock so held shall be reinspected on the day it is slaughtered. If, upon such reinspection, or when not held for further observation and taking of temperature, then on the original inspection, the animal has a temperature of 106 [deg]F. or higher in the case of swine, or 105 [deg]F. or higher in the case of other livestock, it shall be condemned and disposed of in accordance with Sec. 309.13.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any livestock found in a comatose or semicomatose condition or affected with any condition not otherwise covered in this part, which would preclude release of the animal for slaughter for human food, shall be identified ``U.S. Condemned'' and disposed of in accordance with Sec. 309.13, except that such animal may be set apart and held for further observation or treatment under supervision of a Program employee or other official designated by the area supervisor and for final disposition in accordance with this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Establishment personnel must notify FSIS inspection personnel when cattle become non-ambulatory disabled after passing ante-mortem inspection.
