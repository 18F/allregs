                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The liquidation rate determined under 32.503-8 shall apply  throughout the period of contract performance unless the contracting  officer adjusts the liquidation rate under the alternate method in this  32.503-9. The objective of the alternate liquidation rate method is to  permit the contractor to retain the earned profit element of the  contract prices for completed items in the liquidation process. The  contracting officer may reduce the liquidation rate if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contractor requests a reduction in the rate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The rate has not been reduced in the preceding 12 months;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The contract delivery schedule extends at least 18 months from  the contract award date;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Data on actual costs are available (i) for the products  delivered, or (ii) if no deliveries have been made, for a performance  period of at least 12 months;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The reduced liquidation rate would result in the Government  recouping under each invoice the full extent of the progress payments  applicable to the costs allocable to that invoice;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The contractor would not be paid for more than the costs of  items delivered and accepted (less allocable progress payments) and the  earned profit on those items;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The unliquidated progress payments would not exceed the limit  prescribed in paragraph (a)(5) of the Progress Payments clause;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The parties agree on an appropriate rate; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The contractor agrees to certify annually, or more often if  requested by the contracting officer, that the alternate rate continues  to meet the conditions of subsections 5, 6, and 7 above. The certificate  must be accompanied by adequate supporting information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The contracting officer shall change the liquidation rate in the  following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The rate shall be increased for both previous and subsequent  transactions, if the contractor experiences a lower profit rate than the  rate anticipated at the time the liquidation rate was established.  Accordingly, the contracting officer shall adjust the progress payments  associated with contract items already delivered, as well as subsequent  progress payments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The rate shall be increased or decreased in keeping with the  successive changes to the contract price or target profit when--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The target profit is changed under a fixed-price incentive  contract with successive targets; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A redetermined price involves a change in the profit element  under a contract with prospective price redetermination at stated  intervals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whenever the liquidation rate is changed, the contracting  officer shall issue a contract modification to specify the new rate in  the Progress Payments clause. Adequate consideration for these contract  modifications is provided by the consideration included in the initial  contract. The parties shall promptly make the payment or liquidation  required in the circumstances.  [48 FR 42328, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 74 FR 40468, Aug. 11, 2009]</p>
