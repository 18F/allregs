Such transfers shall be documented by modifications to both gaining and losing contracts. Once transferred, all property shall be considered Government-furnished property to the gaining contract. The warranties of suitability of use and timely delivery of Government-furnished property do not apply to property acquired or fabricated by the contractor as contractor-acquired property that is subsequently transferred to another contract with the same contractor.</p>
