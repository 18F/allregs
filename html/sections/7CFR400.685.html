If the date of regaining eligibility occurs after the applicable sales closing date for the crop, the person may not participate until the following year unless that crop policy allows for applications to be accepted after the sales closing date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a person who was determined ineligible according to this subpart is subsequently determined to be an eligible person for crop insurance through reinstatement, mediation, arbitration, appeal, or judicial review, such person's policies will be reinstated effective at the beginning of the crop year for which the producer was determined ineligible, and such person will be entitled to all applicable benefits under such policies, provided the person meets all eligibility requirements and complies with the terms of the policy.
