                            <p class="depth0">Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in Sec. 63.2, and in this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Air pollution control device (APCD) means any equipment that reduces the quantity of a pollutant that is emitted to the air.</p><p class="depth0">Bag leak detection system means an instrument that is capable of monitoring PM loadings in the exhaust of a fabric filter in order to detect bag failures. A bag leak detection system includes, but is not limited to, an instrument that operates on triboelectric, light-scattering, light-transmittance, or other effects to monitor relative PM loadings.</p><p class="depth0">Clay ceramics manufacturing facility means a plant site that manufactures pressed floor tile, pressed wall tile, other pressed tile, or sanitaryware (e.g., sinks and toilets). Clay ceramics manufacturing facilities typically process clay, shale, and various additives, form the processed materials into tile or sanitaryware shapes, and dry and fire the ceramic products. Glazes are applied to many tile and sanitaryware products.</p><p class="depth0">Deviation means any instance in which an affected source subject to this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this subpart including, but not limited to, any emission limitation (including any operating limit) or work practice standard;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement an applicable requirement in this subpart for any affected source required to obtain such a permit; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fails to meet any emission limitation (including any operating limit) or work practice standard in this subpart during startup, shutdown, or malfunction, regardless of whether or not such failure is permitted by this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Dry lime injection fabric filter (DIFF) means an APCD that includes continuous injection of hydrated lime or other sorbent into a duct or reaction chamber followed by a fabric filter.</p><p class="depth0">Dry lime scrubber/fabric filter (DLS/FF) means an APCD that includes continuous injection of humidified hydrated lime or other sorbent into a reaction chamber followed by a fabric filter. These systems typically include recirculation of some of the sorbent.</p><p class="depth0">Dry limestone adsorber (DLA) means an APCD that includes a limestone storage bin, a reaction chamber that is essentially a packed tower filled with limestone, and may or may not include a peeling drum that mechanically scrapes reacted limestone to regenerate the stone for reuse.</p><p class="depth0">Emission limitation means any emission limit or operating limit.</p><p class="depth0">Fabric filter means an APCD used to capture PM by filtering a gas stream through filter media; also known as a baghouse.</p><p class="depth0">Initial startup means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For a new or reconstructed tunnel kiln controlled with a DLA, and for a tunnel kiln that would be considered reconstructed but for Sec. 63.8540(f)(1) or Sec. 63.8540(f)(2), the time at which the temperature in the kiln first reaches 260 C (500 F) and the kiln contains product; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a new or reconstructed tunnel kiln controlled with a DIFF, DLS/FF, or WS, the time at which the kiln first reaches a level of production that is equal to 75 percent of the kiln design capacity or 12 months after the affected source begins firing clay ceramics, whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth0">Particulate matter (PM) means, for purposes of this subpart, emissions of PM that serve as a measure of total particulate emissions, as measured by Method 5 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A), and as a surrogate for metal HAP contained in the particulates including, but not limited to, antimony, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, and selenium.</p><p class="depth0">Period of natural gas curtailment or supply interruption means a period of time during which the supply of natural gas to an affected facility is halted for reasons beyond the control of the facility. An increase in the cost or unit price of natural gas does not constitute a period of natural gas curtailment or supply interruption.</p><p class="depth0">Plant site means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under common control, including properties that are separated only by a road or other public right-of-way. Common control includes properties that are owned, leased, or operated by the same entity,

parent entity, subsidiary, or any combination thereof.</p><p class="depth0">Research and development kiln means any kiln whose purpose is to conduct research and development for new processes and products and is not engaged in the manufacture of products for commercial sale, except in a de minimis manner.</p><p class="depth0">Responsible official means responsible official as defined in 40 CFR 70.2.</p><p class="depth0">Startup means the setting in operation of an affected source and starting the production process.</p><p class="depth0">Tunnel kiln means any continuous kiln that is not a roller kiln that is used to fire clay ceramics.</p><p class="depth0">Tunnel kiln design capacity means the maximum amount of clay ceramics, in Mg (tons), that a kiln is designed to produce in one year divided by the number of hours in a year (8,760 hours). If a kiln is modified to increase the capacity, the design capacity is considered to be the capacity following modifications.</p><p class="depth0">Wet scrubber (WS) means an APCD that uses water, which may include caustic additives or other chemicals, as the sorbent. Wet scrubbers may use any of various design mechanisms to increase the contact between exhaust gases and the sorbent.</p><p class="depth0">Work practice standard means any design, equipment, work practice, operational standard, or combination thereof, that is promulgated pursuant to section 112(h) of the Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.
