                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Potential beneficiaries. The following may be beneficiaries of  one of the programs sponsored by the Office of Workers' Compensation  Programs (OWC) under the conditions set forth. They are not  beneficiaries of OWCP until authorized as such by the appropriate  district officer of OWCP. However, they may be carried as potential  beneficiaries pending OWCP determination of eligibility. DOD civilian  employees provided medical services under a Defense or service health  program are not included under this authority (see subpart G).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Members and applicants for membership in the Reserve Officers'  Training Corps of the Navy, Army, and Air Force, provided the condition  necessitating treatment was incurred in line of duty during an off- campus training regimen. Such care is authorized for injury (a disease  or illness which is the proximate result of performance of training is  considered an injury) incurred while engaged in:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Training.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Flight instructions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Travel to or from training or flight instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following employees of the Government of the United States,  regardless of nationality or place of work, are entitled to receive care  as outlined in paragraph (e) of this section for work incurred traumatic  injuries at the expense of OWCP. (In addition to injury by accident, a  disease or illness which is the proximate result of performance of  employment duties is considered an injury.) This category includes but  is not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Civilian student employees in training at Navy and Marine Corps  facilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Civilian seamen in the service of vessels operated by the  Department of the Army (see paragraph (a)(7) of this section and Sec.  728.80(c)(2) for civilian Military Sealift Command (MSC) personnel).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> All civilian employees of the Government except  nonappropriated-fund-activity employees. Nonappropriate fund employees  may be covered under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act  (contact cognizant district office of OWCP).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Civilian members of the Civil Air Patrol (except Civil Air  Patrol Cadets) for injury or disease which is the proximate result of  active service or travel to and from such service, rendered in  performance or support of operational missions of the Civil Air Patrol  under the direction and written authority of the Air Force.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Former Peace Corps enrollees for injury or disease which is the  proximate result of their former employment with the Peace Corps or  which was sustained or contracted while located with the Peace Corps  outside the United States and its territories.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Former Job Crops enrollees for injury or disease which is the  proximate result of employment with the Job Corps.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Former VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) enrollees for  injury or disease which is the proximate result of employment with  VISTA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Military Sealift Command (MSC) civilian marine personnel  (CIVMARPERS or CIVMARS) (including temporary employees, intermittent   employees, and employees with less than 1 year's service) are entitled  to occupationally related care at the expense of OWCP. CIVMARS are in a  crew status only after reporting to their assigned ship. They are in a  travel status from crewing point to ship and return. While in a travel  status, they are entitled to the same health care benefits as other  Federal civil service employees in a travel status (5 U.S.C. 8101).  CIVMARS presenting for treatment with a properly completed CA-16,  Request for Examination and/or Treatment, will:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Enter the naval MTF's system through the occupational medicine  service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Be treated for any injury or disease proximately caused by  their employment. Although the actual determination of whether an  illness or injury is occupationally related is a function of OWCP,  determinations are based on the required injury report along with the  treatment record from the attending physician. Therefore, when doubt  exists as to the relationship of the condition to the potential  patient's employment, the physician should report an unbiased medical  conclusion and the medical rationale therefor, indicating the conditions  which are responsible for the claimant's disability. As a general rule,  the following may be initially considered as occupationally related,  however, it should be emphasized that OWCP is the final approval  authority:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Any injury or illness occurring as a direct result of  employment. May occur on a ship, at a Government installation ashore, or  in an aircraft while performing a requirement of employment.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any injury or illness which becomes manifest while away from  work (on leave or liberty) while in a crew status or travel status as  long as the condition may be directly related to job activities or to  exposures incident to travel to ship assignment.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Required immunizations.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Required physical examinations.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Periodic medical surveillance screening examinations for DOD  occupational and industrial health programs, i.e., asbestos medical  surveillance, hearing conservation, etc.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Be referred to a non-Federal source of care where back-to-work  care may be provided at the CIVMAR's expense after, if necessary, the  immediate emergency is alleviated when a reasonable determination can be  made that the injury or illness is not occupationally related.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Per 5 U.S.C. 7901(c)(3), the health service program for Federal  civilian employees is limited to referral of employees, upon their  request, to private sources of care.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Long term extended care of chronic illnesses such as  hypertension, diabetes, etc., is not authorized in naval MTFs at the  expense of OWCP nor at the CIVMAR's personal expense.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Patients who cannot be referred, because of medical reasons or  because non-Federal sources are not available or available but  inadequate, may be retained in naval MTFs at the expense of the CIVMAR  or of his or her private insurance until transfer becomes possible.  Although the means of access to the naval MTF may have been through the  occupational medicine service, retention in the naval MTF is on a  civilian humanitarian basis. This is also applicable when OWCP disallows  a CIVMAR's claim (see paragraph (c) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Authorization required. Personnel in paragraph (a) (1) through  (6) may be rendered inpatient and outpatient care as outlined in  paragraph (e) of this section, unless otherwise stipulated in this  section, upon presentation of a properly prepared and signed  authorization from CA-16 (Request for Examination and/or Treatment).  District offices of OWCP will honor these authorizations for 60 days  unless written notice of termination of authorization is given earlier.  Whereas the CA-16 is used primarily for traumatic injuries, it may also  be used to authorize examination and treatment for disease or illness  provided the affected agency has obtained prior permission from the  cognizant district office of OWCP. If the condition for which treatment  is requested appears related to employment, treatment of beneficiaries  in paragraph (a) (1) through (7) of this section may be initiated  without presentation of a CA-16. Patients provided   treatment without a CA-16 may be carried as OWCP beneficiaries from the  time of initial treatment, provided the appropriate district office of  OWCP is notified and requested to submit a CA-16 within 48 hours giving  authorization as of the date of actual treatment. OWCP will not be  liable for payment of bills for unauthorized treatment. Post  hospitalization care following authorized inpatient care does not  require an additional authorization. First aid treatment rendered  civilian employees does not require an authorization form</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disallowance by OWCP. When OWCP determines that any claim should  be disallowed, OWCP will advise the naval facility rendering care that  no further treatment should be rendered at OWCP expense. The patient  ceases to be an OWCP beneficiary as of the date of receipt of the notice  of disallowance by the naval MTF and the patient will be so notified.  Any treatment subsequent to the date of receipt of the notice of  disallowance will be at the personal expense of the patient (see Sec.  728.81(a)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Authorization for transfer. Prior approval of OWCP is required  before a transfer can be effected, except in an emergency or when  immediate treatment is deemed more appropriate in another Federal  facility. When transfer is effected without approval, the transferring  facility will immediately request such authorization from the  appropriate district office of OWCP. When authorized by OWCP, evacuation  to the United States can be effected per OPNAVINST 4630.25B. Medical  records and a CA-16 will accompany such patients.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Care authorized--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inpatient care. Medical and surgical care  necessary for the proper treatment of the condition upon which  eligibility is based. Specific OWCP authorization is required before  major surgical procedures can be performed unless the urgency of the  situation is such that time does not permit obtaining said  authorization. All necessary prostheses, hearing aids, spectacles, and  orthopedic appliances will be furnished when required for proper  treatment of the condition upon which eligibility is based. Upon  specific authorization, damaged or destroyed medical braces, artificial  limbs, and other orthopedic and prosthetic devices will be replaced or  repaired, except that eyeglasses and hearing aids will not be replaced  or repaired unless their damage or destruction is incidental to a  personal injury requiring medical services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Outpatient care. Complete medical and surgical care not  requiring hospitalization, and posthospitalization services following  authorized inpatient care in a naval MTF for the proper treatment of the  condition upon which eligibility is based.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dental care. Limit dental treatment to emergencies and that care  necessary as an adjunct to inpatient hospital care authorized in  advance. Such care will not include dental prostheses, unless  specifically authorized, nor orthodontic treatment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Reports and records. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Copies of medical records will  accompany OWCP patients being transferred from one medical treatment  facility to another. Records accompanying OWCP patients to a debarkation  hospital will be the same as for military personnel and will clearly  identify the patient as an OWCP beneficiary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Forward a CA-20 (Attending Physician's Report) to the  appropriate district office of OWCP on discharge of the patient unless  hospitalization exceeds 1 month. In such instances, a report will be  submitted every 30 days. When extensive hospitalization is required, use  an SF 502 or a narrative format in lieu of CA-20. When submitted to  OWCP, the physician's report will include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> History.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Physical findings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Laboratory findings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Abstract of hospital records.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Diagnosis for conditions due to injury and not due to injury.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Rationalized medical opinion for the physician's belief that  the illness or disease treated was causally related to a specific  condition or set of conditions to which the claimant was subjected.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Condition on discharge with opinion as to degree of impairment  due to injury, if any.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Complete and submit, per subpart J, a DD 7 (Report of Treatment  Furnished Pay Patients, Hospitalization   Furnished, part A) or DD 7A (Report of Treatment Furnished Pay Patients,  Outpatient Treatment, part B) when outpatient or inpatient care is  rendered to any OWCP beneficiary.</p>
