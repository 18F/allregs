                            <p class="depth0">Offers and sales of securities by an issuer that satisfy the conditions of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section and the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section shall be deemed to be transactions not involving any public offering within the meaning of section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Sec. Sec. 563g.3(b) and 563g.3(d) of this part. However, an issuer shall not be deemed to be not in compliance with the provisions of this section solely by reason of making an untimely filing of the notice required to be filed by paragraph (c) of this section so long as the notice is actually filed and all other conditions and requirements of this section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Regulation D. The offer and sale of all securities in the transaction satisfies the Commission's Regulation D (17 CFR 230.501-230.506), except for the notice requirements of Commission Rule 503 (17 CFR 230.503) and the limitations on resale in Commission Rule 502(d) (17 CFR 230.502(d)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sales to 35 persons. The offer and sale of all securities in the transaction satisfies each of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sales of the security are not made to more than 35 persons during the offering period, as determined under the integration provisions of Commission Rule 502(a) (17 CFR 230.502(a)). The number of purchasers referred to above is exclusive of any accredited investor, officer, director or affiliate of the issuer. For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, a husband and wife (together with any custodian or trustee acting for the account of their minor children) are counted as one person and a partnership, corporation or other organization which was not specifically formed for the purpose of purchasing the security offered in reliance upon this exemption, is counted as one person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All purchasers either have a preexisting personal or business relationship with the issuer or any of its officers, directors or controlling persons, or by reason of their business or financial experience or the business or financial experience of their professional advisors who are unaffiliated with and who are not compensated by the issuer or any affiliate or selling agent of the issuer, directly or indirectly, could reasonably be assumed to have the capacity to protect their own interests in connection with the transaction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each purchaser represents that the purchaser is purchasing for the purchaser's own account (or a trust account if the purchaser is a trustee) and

not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution of the security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The offer and sale of the security is not accomplished by the publication of any advertisement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Filing of notice of sales. Within 30 days after the first sale of the securities, every six months after the first sale of the securities and not later than 30 days after the last sale of securities in an offering pursuant to this section, the issuer, shall file with the Office a report describing the results of the sale of securities as required by Sec. 563g.12(b) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limitation on resale. The issuer shall exercise reasonable care to assure that the purchasers of the securities are not underwriters within the meaning of Sec. 563g.1(a)(14) of this part, which reasonable care shall include, but not be limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reasonable inquiry to determine if the purchaser is acquiring the securities for the purchaser or for other persons;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Written disclosure to each purchaser prior to the sale that the securities are not offered by an offering circular filed with, and declared effective by, the Office pursuant to Sec. 563g.2 of this part, but instead are being sold in reliance upon the exemption from the offering circular requirement provided for by this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Placement of a legend on the certificate, or other document evidencing the securities, indicating that the securities have not been offered by an offering circular filed with, and declared effective by, the Office and that due care should be taken to ensure that the seller of the securities is not an underwriter within the meaning of Sec. 563g.1(a)(14) of this part.</p>
