                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This paragraph prescribes procedures for the use of the  broad agency announcement (BAA) with Peer or Scientific Review (see  6.102(d)(2)) for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that  part of development not related to the development of a specific system  or hardware procurement. BAAs may be used by agencies to fulfill their  requirements for scientific study and experimentation directed toward  advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding  rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution. The BAA  technique shall only be used when meaningful proposals with varying  technical/scientific approaches can be reasonably anticipated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The BAA, together with any supporting documents, shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Describe the agency's research interest, either for an  individual program requirement or for broadly defined areas of interest  covering the full range of the agency's requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Describe the criteria for selecting the proposals, their  relative importance and the method of evaluation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specify the period of time during which proposals submitted in  response to the BAA will be accepted; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Contain instructions for the preparation and submission of  proposals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The availability of the BAA must be publicized through the  Governmentwide point of entry (GPE) and, if authorized pursuant to  subpart 5.5, may also be published in noted scientific, technical, or  engineering periodicals.   The notice must be published no less frequently than annually.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Proposals received as a result of the BAA shall be evaluated in  accordance with evaluation criteria specified therein through a peer or  scientific review process. Written evaluation reports on individual  proposals will be necessary but proposals need not be evaluated against  each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work  statement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The primary basis for selecting proposals for acceptance shall  be technical, importance to agency programs, and fund availability. Cost  realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Synopsis under subpart 5.2, Synopses of Proposed Contract  Actions, of individual contract actions based upon proposals received  under the BAA is not required. The notice published pursuant to  subparagraph (c), of this section, fulfills the synopsis requirement.
