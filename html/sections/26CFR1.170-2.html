                                Sec. 1.170-2  Charitable deductions by individuals; limitations
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A deduction is allowable to an individual under  section 170 only for charitable contributions actually paid during the  taxable year, regardless of when pledged and regardless of the method of  accounting employed by the taxpayer in keeping his books and records. A  contribution to an organization described in section 170(c) is  deductible even though some portion of the funds of the organization may  be used in foreign countries for charitable or educational purposes. The  deduction by an individual for charitable contributions under section  170 is limited generally to 20 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross  income (computed without regard to any net operating loss carryback to  the taxable year under section 172). If a husband and wife make a joint  return, the deduction for contributions is the aggregate of the  contributions made by the spouses, and the limitation in section 170(b)  is based on the aggregate adjusted gross income of the spouses. The 20- percent limitation applies to amounts contributed during the taxable  year ``to or for the use of'' those recipients described in section  170(c), including amounts treated under section 170(d) as paid for the  use of an organization described in section 170(c) (2), (3), or (4). See  paragraph (f) of this section. The limitation is computed without regard  to contributions qualifying for the additional 10-percent deduction. For  examples of the application of the 10- and 20-percent limitation, see  paragraph (b)(5) of this section. For special rules reducing amount of  certain charitable deductions, see paragraph (c)(2) of Sec. 1.170-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No deduction is allowable for contribution of services. However,  unreimbursed expenditures made incident to the rendition of services to  an organization contributions to which are deductible may constitute a  deductible contribution. For example, the cost of a uniform without  general utility which is required to be worn in performing donated  services is deductible. Similarly, out-of-pocket transportation expenses  necessarily incurred in rendering donated services are deductible.  Reasonable expenditures for meals and lodging necessarily incurred while  away from home in the course of rendering donated services also are  deductible. For the purposes of this section, the phrase while away from  home has the same meaning as that phrase is used for purposes of section  162.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of an annuity or portion thereof purchased from  an organization described in section 170(c), there shall be allowed as a  deduction the excess of the amount paid over the value at the time of  purchase of the annuity or portion purchased.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The value of the annuity or portion is the value of the annuity  determined in accordance with section 101(b) and the regulations  thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(A)</em> to the extent that such  contributions in the aggregate do not exceed 10 percent of his adjusted  gross income (computed without regard to any net operating loss  carryback to the taxable year under section 172). The additional 10- percent deduction may be allowed with respect to contributions to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A church or a convention or association of churches,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An educational organization referred to in section 503(b)(2)  and defined in subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A hospital referred to in section 503(b)(5) and defined in  subparagraph (4)(i) of this paragraph,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Subject to certain conditions and limitations set forth in  subparagraph (4)(ii) of this paragraph, and for taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1955, a medical research organization referred to in  section 503(b)(5),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in  subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph, and for taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1960, an organization referred to in section  503(b)(3) which is organized and operated for the benefit of certain  State and municipal colleges and universities,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, a  governmental unit referred to in section 170(c)(1), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in  subparagraph (5) of this paragraph, and for taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1963, an organization referred to in section  170(c)(2).  To qualify for the additional 10-percent deduction the contributions  must be made ``to'', and not merely ``for the use of'', one of the  specified organizations. A contribution to an organization referred to  in section 170(c)(2) (other than an organization specified in  subdivisions (i) through (vi) of this subparagraph) which, for taxable  years beginning after December 31, 1963, is not ``publicly supported''  under the rules of subparagraph (5) of this paragraph will not qualify  for the additional 10-percent deduction even though such organization  makes the contribution available to an organization which is specified  in section 170(b)(1)(A). The computation of this additional deduction is  not necessary unless the total contributions paid during the taxable  year are in excess of the general 20-percent limitation. Where the total  contributions exceed the 20-percent limitation, the taxpayer should  first ascertain the amount of charitable contributions subject to the  10-percent limitation, and any excess over the 10-percent limitation  should then be added to all other contributions and limited by the 20- percent limitation. For provisions relating to a carryover of certain  charitable contributions made by individuals, see paragraph (g) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Church. For definition of church, see the regulations under  section 511.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Educational organization and organizations for the benefit of  certain State and municipal colleges and universities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Educational  organization. An educational organization within the meaning of section  170(b)(1)(A) is one whose primary function is the presentation of formal  instruction and which normally maintains a regular faculty and  curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of pupils or  students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are  regularly carried on. The term, therefore, includes institutions such as  primary, secondary, preparatory, or high schools, and colleges and  universities. It includes Federal, State, and other public-supported  schools which otherwise come within the definition. It does not include  organizations engaged in both educational and noneducational activities  unless the latter are merely incidental to and growing out of the  educational activities. A recognized university which incidentally  operates a museum or sponsors concerts is an educational organization.  However, the operation of a school by a museum does not necessarily  qualify the museum as an educational organization. A gift to an  educational institution through an alumni association or a class  organization, which acts simply as a fund-raising or collection agency  through which gifts may be made currently to the institution, is a gift  to the educational   organization if the entire gift inures to its benefit, but not if any  part of it inures to the general or operating fund of the agency.  Similarly, a gift to one or more educational institutions through an  association of educational institutions will be considered a gift to the  institutions if it inures entirely to their benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Organizations for the benefit of certain State and municipal  colleges and universities. (a) For taxable years beginning after  December 31, 1960, gifts made to an organization referred to in section  503(b)(3) organized and operated exclusively to receive, hold, invest,  and administer property and to make expenditures to or for the benefit  of certain colleges and universities, may be taken into account in  computing the additional 10-percent limitation. The phrase expenditures  to or for the benefit of certain colleges and universities includes  expenditures made for any one or more of the normally accepted functions  of colleges and universities, for example, for the acquisition and  maintenance of real property comprising part of the campus area, the  erection of or participation in the erection of college or university  buildings, scholarships, libraries, student loans, and the acquisition  and maintenance of equipment and furnishings used for or in conjunction  with normally accepted functions of colleges and universities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The recipient organization must be one which normally receives a  substantial portion of its support from the United States or any State  or political subdivision thereof or from direct or indirect  contributions from the general public, or from a combination of two or  more of such sources. An example of an indirect contribution from the  public would be the receipt by the organization of its share of the  proceeds of an annual collection campaign of a community chest,  community fund, or united fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The college or university (including land grant colleges and  universities) to be benefited must be an educational organization  referred to in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) and subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph; and must be an agency or instrumentality of a State or  political subdivision thereof, or must be owned or operated by a State  or political subdivision thereof or by an agency or instrumentality of  one or more States or political subdivisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Hospital and medical research organization--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Hospital. The  term hospital, as used in section 170(b)(1)(A), means an organization  the principal purposes or functions of which are the providing of  hospital or medical care. The term includes Federal and State hospitals  otherwise coming within the definition but does not include medical  education organizations, or medical research organizations. See,  however, subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, relating to  contributions to certain medical research organizations for taxable  years beginning after December 31, 1955. A rehabilitation institution or  an outpatient clinic may qualify as a hospital if its principal purposes  or functions are the providing of hospital or medical care. The term  hospital does not include convalescent homes or homes for children or  the aged, nor does the term include institutions whose principal  purposes or functions are to train handicapped individuals to pursue  some vocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain medical research organizations. (a) For taxable years  beginning after December 31, 1955, certain charitable contributions made  to certain medical research organizations may be taken into account in  computing the additional 10-percent limitation. To be so taken into  account the charitable contribution must be made to a medical research  organization that is directly engaged in the continuous active conduct  of medical research in conjunction with a hospital (as defined in  subdivision (i) of this subparagraph), and, during the calendar year in  which the contribution is made, the organization must be committed to  spend the contribution for such active conduct of medical research  before January 1 of the fifth calendar year beginning after the date the  contribution is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)(A)</em> and this subparagraph, the term  medical research organization means an organization the principal  purpose or function of which is to engage in medical research. Medical  research may be defined as the conduct of investigations, experiments,  and studies to discover,   develop, or verify knowledge relating to the causes, diagnosis,  treatment, prevention, or control of physical or mental diseases and  impairments of man. To qualify as a medical research organization, the  organization must have the appropriate equipment and professional  personnel necessary to carry out its principal function.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The organization must, at the time of the contribution, be  directly engaged in the continuous active conduct of medical research in  conjunction with a hospital described in subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph. The organization need not be formally affiliated with a  hospital to be considered engaged in the active conduct of medical  research in conjunction with a hospital, but it must be physically  connected, or closely associated, with a hospital. In any case, there  must be a joint effort on the part of the research organization and the  hospital pursuant to an understanding that the two organizations shall  maintain continuing close cooperation in the active conduct of medical  research. For example, the necessary joint effort will normally be found  to exist if the activities of the medical research organization are  carried on in space located within or adjacent to a hospital provided  that the organization is permitted to utilize the facilities (including  equipment, case studies, etc.) of the hospital on a continuing basis in  the active conduct of medical research. A medical research organization  which is closely associated, in the manner described above, with a  particular hospital or particular hospitals, may be considered to be  pursuing research in conjunction with a hospital if the necessary joint  effort is supported by substantial evidence of the close cooperation of  the members of the research organization and the staff of the particular  hospital or hospitals. The active participation in medical research by  the staff of the particular hospital or hospitals will be considered as  evidence of the requisite joint effort. If the organization's primary  purpose is to disburse funds to other organizations for the conduct of  research by them, or, if the organization's primary purpose is to extend  research grants or scholarships to others, it is not directly engaged in  the active conduct of medical research, and contributions to such an  organization may not be taken into account for purposes of the  additional 10-percent limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A charitable contribution to a medical research organization may  be taken into account in computing the additional 10-percent limitation  only if the organization is committed to spend such contribution for  medical research in conjunction with a hospital on or before the first  day of the fifth calendar year which begins after the date the  contribution is made. The organization's commitment that the  contribution will be spent within the prescribed time only for the  prescribed purposes must be legally enforceable. A promise in writing to  the donor in consideration of his making a contribution that such  contribution will be so spent within the prescribed time will constitute  a commitment. The expenditure of contributions received for plant,  facilities, or equipment, used solely for medical research purposes  shall ordinarily be considered to be an expenditure for medical research  for purposes of section 170(b) and this section. If a contribution is  made in other than money, it shall be considered spent for medical  research if the funds from the proceeds of a disposition thereof are  spent by the organization within the five-year period for medical  research; or, if such property is of such a kind that it is used on a  continuing basis directly in connection with such research, it shall be  considered spent for medical research in the year in which it is first  so used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Corporation, trust, or community chest, fund, or foundation--(i)  In general. (a) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963,  gifts made to a corporation, trust, or community chest, fund, or  foundation, referred to in section 170(c)(2) (other than an organization  specified in subparagraph (1) (i) through (vi) of this paragraph), may  be taken into account in computing the additional 10-percent limitation,  provided the organization is a ``publicly supported'' organization. For  purposes of this subparagraph, an organization is ``publicly supported''  if it normally receives a substantial part of its support from a  governmental unit referred to in section 170(c)(1) or from direct or   indirect contributions from the general public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An important factor in determining whether an organization  normally receives a substantial part of its support from ``direct or  indirect contributions from the general public'' is the extent to which  the organization derives its support from or through voluntary  contributions made by persons representing the general public. Except in  unusual situations (particularly in the case of newly created  organizations), an organization is not ``publicly supported'' if it  receives contributions only from the members of a single family or from  a few individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, means all forms of support including (but not  limited to) contributions received by the organization, investment  income (such as, interest, rents, royalties, and dividends), and net  income from unrelated business activities whether or not such activities  are carried on regularly as a trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The term support does not include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any amounts received from the exercise or performance by an  organization of its charitable, educational, or other purpose or  function constituting the basis for its exemption under section 501(a).  In general, such amounts include amounts received from any activity the  conduct of which is substantially related to the furtherance of such  purpose or function (other than through the production of income).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any gain upon the sale or exchange of property which would be  considered under any section of the Code as gain from the sale or  exchange of a capital asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Contributions of services for which a deduction is not  allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The term support from a governmental unit includes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this subdivision (ii), an  amount paid by a governmental unit to an organization is not received  from the exercise or performance of its charitable, educational, or  other purpose or function constituting the basis for its exemption under  section 501(a) if the purpose of the payment is to enable the  organization to provide a service to, or maintain a facility for, the  direct benefit of the public, as, for example, the maintenance of  library facilities which are open to the public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Tax revenues levied for the benefit of the organization and  either paid to or expended on behalf of the organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The value of services or facilities (exclusive of services or  facilities generally furnished, without charge, to the public) furnished  by a governmental unit to the organization without charge, as, for  example, where a city pays the salaries of personnel used to guard a  museum, art gallery, etc., or provides, rent free, the use of a  building. However, the term does not include the value of any exemption  from Federal, State, or local tax or any similar benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The term indirect contributions from the general public includes  contributions received by the organization from organizations which  normally receive a substantial part of their support from direct  contributions from the general public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> and the regulations thereunder shall be treated as made  by one person. The 1-percent limitation shall not apply to support from  governmental units referred to in section 170(c)(1) or to contributions  from ``publicly supported'' organizations. A national organization which  carries out its purposes through local chapters with which it has an  identity of aims and purposes may, for purposes of determining whether  the organization and the local chapters meet the mechanical test, make  the computation on an aggregate basis.</p><p class="depth0">Example. For the years 1964 through 1967, X, an organization  referred to in section 170(c)(2), received support (as defined in  subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) of $600,000 from the following  sources:  Investment income...........................................    $300,000 City Y (a governmental unit referred to in section                40,000</p><p class="depth0">170(c)(1)).................................................

However, under no circumstances will  an organization which normally receives substantially all of its  contributions (directly or indirectly) from the members of a single  family or from a few individuals qualify as a ``publicly supported''  organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of the facts and circumstances test the most  important consideration is the organization's source of support. An  organization will be considered a ``publicly supported'' organization if  it is constituted so as to attract substantial support from  contributions, directly or indirectly, from a representative number of  persons in the community or area in which it operates. In determining  what is a ``representative number of persons,'' consideration must be  given to the type of organization and whether or not the organization  limits its activities to a special field which can be expected to appeal  to a limited number of persons. An organization is so constituted if,  for example, it establishes that it does in fact receive substantial  support from contributions from a representative number of persons; that  pursuant to its organizational structure and method of operation it  makes bona fide solicitations for broad based public support, or, in the  case of a newly created organization, that its organizational structure  and method of operation are such as to require bona fide solicitations  for broad based public support; that it receives substantial support  from a community chest or similar public federated fund raising  organization, such as a United Fund or United Appeal; or that it has a  substantial number of members (in relation to the community it serves,  the nature of its activities, and its total support) who pay annual  membership dues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Although primary consideration will be given to the source of an  organization's support, other relevant factors may be taken into account  in determining whether or not the organization is of a public nature,  such as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whether the organization has a governing body (whether  designated in the organization's bylaws, certificate of incorporation,  deed of trust, etc., as a Board of Directors, Board of Trustees, etc.)  which is comprised of public officials, of individuals chosen by public  officials acting in their capacity as such, or of citizens broadly  representative of the interests and views of the public. This  characteristic does not exist if the membership of an organization's  governing body is such as to indicate that it represents the personal or  private interests of a limited number of donors to the organization (or  persons standing in a relationship to such donors which is described in  section 267(b) and the regulations thereunder), rather than the  interests of the community or the general public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the organization annually or more frequently makes  available to the public financial reports or, in the case of a newly  created organization, is constituted so as to require such reporting.  For this purpose an information or other return made pursuant to a  requirement of a governmental unit shall not be considered a financial  report. An organization shall be considered as making financial reports  of its operations available to the public if it publishes a financial  report in a newspaper which is widely circulated in the community in  which the organization operates or if it makes a bona fide dissemination  of a brochure containing a financial report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the organization is of a type which generally holds open to  the public its buildings (as in the case of a museum) or performances  conducted by it (as in the case of a symphonic orchestra), whether the  organization actually follows such practice, or, in the case of a newly  created organization, is so organized as to require that its facilities  be open to the public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The application of this subdivision (c) may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. M, a community trust, is an organization referred to in  section 170(c)(2). In 1950, M was organized in the X Community by  several leading trusts and financial institutions with the purpose of  serving permanently the educational and charitable needs of the X  Community by providing a means by which the public may establish funds  or   make gifts of various amounts to established funds which are  administered as an aggregate fund with provision for distribution of  income and, in certain cases, principal for educational or charitable  purposes by a single impartial committee. The M Organization, by  distribution of pamphlets to the public through participating trustee  banks, actively solicits members of the X Community and other concerned  parties to establish funds within the trust or to contribute to  established funds within the trust. Under the declaration of trust, a  contributor to a fund may suggest or request (but not require) that his  contribution be used in respect of his preferred charitable,  educational, or other benevolent purpose, and distributions of the  income from the fund, and in certain cases the principal, will be made  by the Distribution Committee with regard to such request unless  changing conditions make such purpose unnecessary, undesirable,  impractical, or impossible in which case income and (where the  contributor has so specified) principal will be distributed by the  Distribution Committee in order to promote the public welfare more  effectively. Where a contributor has not expressed a desire as to a  charitable, educational, or other benevolent purpose, the Distribution  Committee will distribute the entire annual income from the fund to such  a purpose agreed upon by such committee. The Distribution Committee is  composed of representatives of the community chosen one each by the X  Bar Association, the X Medical Society, the mayor of X Community, the  judge of the highest X Court, and the president of the X College, and  two representatives chosen by the participating trustee banks. There are  a number of separate funds within the trust administered by several  participating banks. M has consistently distributed or used its entire  annual income for projects with purposes described in section  170(c)(2)(B) from which members of the public may benefit or to other  organizations described in section 170(b)(1)(A) which so distribute or  use such income. Through its participating trustee banks, M annually  makes available to the public a brochure containing a financial  statement of its operations including a list of all receipts and  disbursements. Under the facts and circumstances, M is a ``publicly  supported'' organization.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that M has  been in existence for only one year and only two contributors have  established funds within the trust. The Distribution Committee has been  chosen and is required by the governing declaration of trust to make  annual distribution of the entire income of the trust to projects with  purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B) from which members of the  public may benefit or to other organizations described in section  170(b)(1)(A) which so distribute or use such income. The declaration of  trust and other governing instruments require (1) that the M Community  Trust actively solicit contributions from members of the X Community  through dissemination of literature and other public appeals, and (2)  that it make available to the members of the X Community, annual  financial reports of its operations. Under the facts and circumstances,  M is a ``publicly supported'' organization.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. N, an art museum, is an organization referred to in  section 170(c)(2). In 1930, N was founded in Y City by the members of a  single family to collect, preserve, interpret, and display to the public  important works of art. N is governed by a self-perpetuating Board of  Trustees limited by the governing instruments to a maximum membership of  20 individuals. The original board consisted almost entirely of members  of the founding family. Since 1945, members of the founding family or  persons standing in a relationship to the members of such family  described in section 267(b) have annually constituted less than one- fifth of the Board of Trustees. The remaining board members are citizens  of Y City from a variety of professions and occupations who represent  the interests and views of the people of Y City in the activities  carried on by the organization rather than the personal or private  interests of the founding family. N solicits contributions from the  general public and for each of its four most recent taxable years has  received total contributions in small sums (less than $100) in excess of  $10,000. For N's four most recent taxable years, investment income from  several large endowment funds has constituted 75 percent of its total  support. N normally expends a substantial part of its annual income for  purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B). N has, for the entire period  of its existence, been open to the public and more than 300,000 people  (from the Y City and elsewhere) have visited the museum in each of its  four most recent taxable years. N annually publishes a financial report  of its operation in the Y City newspaper. Under the facts and  circumstances, N museum is a ``publicly supported'' organization.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. In 1960, the O Philharmonic Orchestra was organized in Z  City through the combined efforts of a local music society and a local  women's club to present to the public a wide variety of musical programs  intended to foster music appreciation in the community. O is an  organization referred to in section 170(c)(2). The orchestra is composed  of professional musicians who are paid by the association. Twelve  performances, open to the public, are scheduled each year. The admission  charge for each of these performances is $3. In addition, several  performances are staged annually without charge. In each of its four  most recent taxable years, O has received separate contributions of  $10,000 from A, B, C, and D (not members of a single   family) and support of $5,000 from the Z Community Chest, a public  federated fund raising organization operating in Z City. O is governed  by a Board of Directors comprised of five individuals. A faculty member  of a local college, the president of a local music society, the head of  a local banking institution, a prominent doctor, and a member of the  governing body of the local Chamber of Commerce currently serve on the  Board and represent the interests and views of the community in the  activities carried on by O. O annually files a financial report with Z  City which makes such report available for public inspection. Under the  facts and circumstances, O is a ``publicly supported'' organization.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. P is a newly created organization of a type referred to  in section 170 (c)(2).

In determining the  applicability of the 10- and 20-percent limitations of section 170(b)  for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, there may be  substituted, in lieu of the amount of income tax paid during any year,  the amount of income tax paid in respect of such year, provided that any  amount so included for the year in respect of which payment was made  shall not be included for any other year. For the purpose of the first  sentence of this paragraph, taxable income under the 1954 Code is  determined without regard to the deductions for charitable contributions  under section 170, for personal exemptions under section 151, or for a  net operating loss carryback under section 172. On the other hand, for  this purpose net income under the 1939 Code is computed without the  benefit only of the deduction for charitable contributions. See section  120 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. The term income tax as used in  section 170(b)(1)(C) means only Federal income taxes, and does not  include the taxes imposed on self-employment income, on employees under  the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, and on railroad employees and  their representatives under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act by Chapters  2, 21, and 22, respectively, or corresponding provisions of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1939. For purposes of section 170(b)(1)(C) and this  paragraph, the amount of income tax paid during a taxable year shall be  determined (except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph)  by including all payments made by the taxpayer during such taxable year  on account of his Federal income taxes (whether for the taxable year or  for preceding taxable years). Such payments would include any amount  paid during the taxable year as estimated tax (exclusive of any portion  of such amount for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966,  which is attributable to the self-employment tax imposed by chapter (2)  for that year, payment of the final installment of estimated tax  (exclusive of any portion of such installment, for taxable years  beginning after December 31, 1966, which is attributable to the self- employment tax imposed by chapter 2) for the preceding taxable year,  final payment for the preceding taxable year, and any payment of a  deficiency for an earlier taxable year, to the extent that such payments  do not exceed the tax for the taxable year for which payment is made.  Any payment of income tax with respect to which the taxpayer receives a  refund or credit shall be reduced by the amount of such refund or  credit. Any such refund or credit shall be applied against the most  recent payments for the taxable year in respect of which the refund or  credit arose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, the  applicability of the 10- and 20-percent limitations of section 170(b)  may be determined either with reference to the income tax paid during  the year or any prior year, or with reference to the income tax paid in  respect of any such year or prior years. The 90-percent test of section  170(b)(1)(C) may be applied for the taxable year, or for any one or more  of the preceding 10 taxable years, by taking into account the income  taxes paid in respect of that year or years, and for the balance of the  10 years by taking into account the income tax payments made during  those years. Thus, a taxable year which qualifies under either of the  two permissible methods shall be considered as a qualifying year  irrespective of whether the taxable year begins before or   after December 31, 1957. However, a particular income tax payment may  only be taken into account once, either with respect to the year of  liability or for the year of payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Joint returns--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Joint return for current taxable year. If a  husband and wife make a joint return for any taxable year, their  deduction for charitable contributions is not subject to the 10- and 20- percent limitations of section 170(b), if, under the rules of  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, in the taxable year and in each of 8  of the 10 preceding taxable years (regardless of whether separate or  joint returns were filed), the aggregate charitable contributions of  both spouses paid during the year, plus their aggregate payments during  the year on account of Federal income taxes (or, if the taxable year  begins after December 31, 1957, the aggregate tax paid in respect of  such taxable year or any preceding taxable year) exceed 90 percent of  their aggregate taxable incomes for the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Separate return by spouse or by unremarried widow or widower.  If a spouse, or the unremarried widow or widower of a deceased spouse,  makes a separate return for any taxable year, his deduction for  charitable contributions is not subject to the 10- and 20-percent  limitations of section 170(b), if, under the rules of subparagraph (1)  of this paragraph, in the taxable year and each of 8 of the 10 preceding  taxable years:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For which the taxpayer filed a joint return with his spouse,  either their aggregate charitable contributions and payments of Federal  income taxes made during the taxable year (or if the taxable year begins  after December 31, 1957, made in respect of such taxable year or any  preceding taxable year) exceed 90 percent of their aggregate taxable  income for that year, or the taxpayer's separate charitable  contributions and payments of Federal income taxes allocable to his  separate income and made during the taxable year (or if the taxable year  begins after December 31, 1957, made in respect of such taxable year or  any preceding taxable year) exceed 90 percent of his separate taxable  income for that year, and (b) For which the taxpayer did not file a  joint return with his spouse, the aggregate of his charitable  contributions and payments of Federal income taxes made during the  taxable year (or, if the taxable year begins after December 31, 1957,  the payments of income taxes made in respect of such taxable year or any  preceding taxable year) exceeds 90 percent of his taxable income for  that year.  For the purpose of the preceding sentence, the word spouse does not  include a spouse from whom the taxpayer has been divorced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Joint return with former spouse for prior taxable year. A  divorced or remarried taxpayer who filed a joint return for a prior  taxable year with a former spouse shall, for purposes of applying this  paragraph, be treated in the same manner as if he had filed a separate  return for such prior taxable year, and as if his Federal income tax  liability and taxable income for such prior taxable year were his  allocable portions of the joint tax liability and combined taxable  income, respectively, for such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Allocation. Whenever it is necessary to allocate the joint tax  liability or the combined taxable income, or both, for a taxable year  for which a joint return was filed, a computation shall be made for the  taxpayer and for his spouse or former spouse showing for each of them  the Federal income taxes and taxable income which would be determined if  separate returns had been filed by them for such taxable year. The joint  tax liability and conbined taxable income for such taxable year shall  then be allocated proportionately to the income taxes and taxable  income, respectively, so computed. Whenever it is necessary to determine  the separate payments made by a taxpayer in respect of a joint tax  liability, the amount paid by him during the taxable year as estimated  tax (exclusive of any portion of such amount for taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1966, which is attributable to the self-employment  tax imposed by Chapter 2) for that year shall be included to the extent  it does not exceed his allocable portion of the joint tax under Chapter  1 (exclusive of tax under section 56) for the taxable year, and any  amount paid by him for a prior year   (whether as the final installment of estimated tax--exclusive of any  portion of such installment, for taxable years beginning after December  31, 1966, which is attributable to the self-employment tax imposed by  Chapter 2--for the preceding taxable year, or a final payment for the  preceding year, or the payment of a deficiency for an earlier year)  shall be included to the extent such amount, when added to amounts  previously paid by him for such prior year, does not exceed his  allocable portion of the joint tax liability for the prior year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Denial of deduction in case of certain transfers in trust--(1)  Reversionary interest in grantor. No charitable deduction will be  allowed for the value of any interest in property transferred to a trust  after March 9, 1954, if the grantor at the time of the transfer has a  reversionary interest in the corpus or income and the value of such  reversionary interest exceeds 5 percent of the total value on which the  charitable deduction would, but for section 170(b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(D)</em>, be determined.  For purposes of this paragraph, the term reversionary interest means a  possibility that after the possession or enjoyment of property or its  income has been obtained by a charitable donee, the property or its  income may revest in the grantor or his estate, or may be subject to a  power exercisable by the grantor or a nonadverse party (within the  meaning of section 672 (b)), or both, to revest in, or return to or for  the benefit of, the grantor or his estate the property or income  therefrom. An interest of the grantor which, in any event, will  terminate before the ripening of the assured charitable gift for which a  deduction is claimed is not considered a reversionary interest for  purposes of this section. For example, assume that a taxpayer conveyed  property to a trust under the terms of which the income is payable to  the taxpayer's wife for her life, and, if she predeceases him, to him  for his life, and after the death of both the property is to be  transferred to a charitable organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Valuation of interests. The present value of the remainder  interest in the property, taking into account the value of the life  estates reserved to the taxpayer and his wife, may be allowed as a  charitable deduction. Where the corpus of the trust is to return to the  grantor after a number of years certain, the value of the reversionary  interest at the time of the transfer may be computed by the use of  tables showing the present value at 3\1/2\ percent a year, compuounded  annually, of $1 payable at the end of a number of years certain. See  paragraph (f), Table II, of Sec. 20.2031-7 of this chapter (Estate Tax  Regulations). Where the value of a reversionary interest is dependent  upon the continuation or termination of the life of one or more persons,  it must be determined on the basis of Table 38 of United States Life  Tables and Actuarial Tables 1939-1941, published by the United States  Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, and interest at the rate  of 3\1/2\ percent a year, compounded annually. See paragraph (f), Table  I, of Sec. 20.2031-7 of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations) for  valuations based on one life, and ``Actuarial Values for Estate and Gift  Tax`` (Internal Revenue Service Publication No. 11, Rev. 5-59) for  values based on more than one life. In an actual case (not merely  hypothetical), the grantor or his legal representative may, upon  request, obtain the information necessary to determine such a value from  the district director with whom the grantor files his return. The  request must be accompanied by a statement showing the date of birth of  each person the duration of whose life may affect the value of the  reversionary interest and by copies of the instruments relevant to the  transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Fiscal years and short taxable years ending after March 9, 1954,  subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. Pursuant to section  7851(a)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the regulations  prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section, to the extent that they  relate to transfers in trust occurring after March 9, 1954, shall apply  to all taxable years ending after March 9, 1954, even though those years  may be subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Amounts paid to maintain certain students as members of the  taxpayer's household--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In General. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1959, the term charitable contribution includes  amounts paid by the taxpayer   during the taxable year to maintain certain students as members of his  household which, under the provisions of section 170(d) and this  paragraph, are treated as amounts paid for the use of an organization  described in section 170(c) (2), (3), or (4), and such amounts, to the  extent they do not exceed the limitations under section 170(d)(2) and  paragraph (f)(2) of this section, are deductible contributions under  section 170. In order for such amounts to be so treated, the student  must be an individual who is neither a dependent (as defined in section  152) of the taxpayer nor related to the taxpayer in a manner described  in any of the paragraphs (1) through (8) of section 152(a), and such  individual must be a member of the taxpayer's household pursuant to a  written agreement between the taxpayer and an organization described in  section 170(c) (2), (3), or (4) to implement a program of the  organization to provide educational opportunities for pupils or students  placed in private homes by such organization. Furthermore, such amounts  must be paid to maintain such individual during the period in the  taxable year he is a member of the taxpayer's household and is a full- time pupil or student in the twelfth or any lower grade at an  educational institution (as defined in section 151(e)(4)) located in the  United States. Amounts paid outside of the period (but within the  taxable year) for expenses necessary for the maintenance of the student  during the period will qualify for the charitable deduction if the other  limitation requirements of the section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of paragraph (i) of this section, amounts treated  as charitable contributions include only those amounts actually paid by  the taxpayer during the taxable year which are directly attributable to  the maintenance of the student while he is a member of the taxpayer's  household and is attending school on a full-time basis. This would  include amounts paid to ensure the well-being of the individual and to  carry out the purpose for which the individual was placed in the  taxpayer's home. For example, a deduction would be allowed for amounts  paid for books, tuition, food, clothing, transportation, medical and  dental care, and recreation for the individual. Amounts treated as  charitable contributions under this paragraph do not include amounts  which the taxpayer would have expended had the student not been in the  household. They would not include, for example, amounts paid in  connection with the taxpayer's home for taxes, insurance, interest on a  mortgage, repairs, etc. Moreover, such amounts do not include any  depreciation sustained by the taxpayer in maintaining such student or  students in his household, nor do they include the value of any services  rendered on behalf of such student or students by the taxpayer or any  member of the taxpayer's household.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of section 170(d) and this paragraph, an  individual will be considered to be a full-time pupil or student at an  educational institution only if he is enrolled for a course of study  (prescribed for a full-time student) at such institution and is  attending classes on a full-time basis. Nevertheless, such individual  may be absent from school due to special circumstances and still be  considered to be in full-time attendance. Periods during the regular  school term when the school is closed for holidays, such as Christmas  and Easter, and for periods between semesters are treated as periods  during which the pupil or student is in full-time attendance at the  school. Also, absences during the regular school term due to illness of  such individual shall not prevent him from being considered as a full- time pupil or student. Similarly, absences from the taxpayer's household  due to special circumstances will not disqualify the student as a member  of the household. Summer vacations between regular school terms are not  considered periods of school attendance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> As in the case of other charitable deductions, any deduction  claimed for amounts described in section 170(d) and this paragraph which  are treated as charitable contributions under section 170(c) is subject  to verification by the district director. When claiming a deduction for  such amounts, the taxpayer should submit a copy of his agreement with  the organization sponsoring the individual placed in the taxpayer's  household together with a summary of   the various items for which amounts were paid to maintain such  individual, and a statement as to the date the individual became a  member of the household and the period of his attendance at school and  the name and location of such school. Substantiation of amounts claimed  must be supported by adequate records of the amounts actually paid. Due  to the nature of certain items, such as food, a record of amounts spent  for all members of the household, with an equal portion thereof  allocated to each member, will be acceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitations. Section 170(d) and this paragraph shall apply to  amounts paid during the taxable year only to the extent that the amounts  paid in maintaining each pupil or student do not exceed $50 multiplied  by the number of full calendar months in the taxable year that the pupil  or student is maintained in accordance with the provisions of this  paragraph. For purposes of such limitation, if 15 or more days of a  calendar month fall within the period to which the maintenance of such  pupil or student relates, such month is considered as a full calendar  month. To the extent that such amounts qualify as charitable  contributions under section 170(c), the aggregate of such amounts plus  other contributions made during the taxable year is deductible under  section 170, subject to the 20-percent limitation provided in section  170(b)(1)(B). Also, see Sec. 1.170-2(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Compensation or reimbursement. Amounts paid during the taxable  year to maintain a pupil or student as a member of the taxpayer's  household, as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, shall not be  taken into account under section 170(d) of this paragraph, if the  taxpayer receives any money or other property as compensation or  reimbursement for any portion of such amounts. The taxpayer will not be  denied the benefits of section 170(d) if he prepays an extraordinary or  nonrecurring expense, such as a hospital bill or vacation trip, at the  request of the individual's parents or the sponsoring organization and  is reimbursed for such prepayment. The value of services performed by  the pupil or student in attending to ordinary chores of the household  will not generally be considered to constitute compensation or  reimbursement. However, if the pupil or student is taken into the  taxpayer's household to replace a former employee of the taxpayer or  gratuitously to perform substantial services for the taxpayer, the facts  and circumstances may warrant a conclusion that the taxpayer received  reimbursement for maintaining the pupil or student.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> No other amount allowed as deduction. Except to the extent that  amounts described in section 170(d) and this paragraph are treated as  charitable contributions under section 170(c) and, therefore, deductible  under section 170(a), no deduction is allowed for any amount paid to  maintain an individual, as a member of the taxpayer's household, in  accordance with the provisions of section 170(d) and this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. Application of the provisions of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. The X organization is an organization described in  section 170(c)(2) and is engaged in a program under which a number of  European children are placed in the homes of United States residents in  order to further the children's high school education. In accordance  with the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the taxpayer,  A, who reports his income on the calendar year basis, agreed with X to  take two of the children, and they were placed in the taxpayer's home on  January 2, 1960, where they remained until January 21, 1961, during  which time they were fully maintained by the taxpayer. The children  enrolled at the local high school for the full course of study  prescribed for tenth grade students and attended the school on a full- time basis for the spring semester starting January 18, 1960, and ending  June 3, 1960, and for the fall semester starting September 1, 1960, and  ending January 13, 1961. The total cost of food paid by A in 1960 for  himself, his wife, and the two children amounted to $1,920, or $40 per  month for each member of the household. Since the children were actually  full-time students for only 8\1/2\ months during 1960, the amount paid  for food for each child during that period amounted to $340. Other  amounts paid during the 8\1/2\ month period for each child for laundry,  lights, water, recreation, and school supplies amounted to $160. Thus,  the amounts treated under section 170(d) and this paragraph as paid for  the use of X would, with respect to each child, total $500 ($340+$160),  or a total for both children of   $1,000, subject to the limitations of subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph. Since, for purposes of such limitations, the children were  full-time students for only 8 full calendar months during 1960 (less  than 15 days in January 1960), the taxpayer may treat only $800 as a  charitable contribution made in 1960, that is, $50 multiplied by the 8  full calendar months, or $400 paid for the maintenance of each child.  Neither the excess payments nor amounts paid to maintain the children  during the period before school opened and for the period in summer  between regular school terms is taken into account by reason of section  170(d). Also, because the children were full-time students for less than  15 days in January 1961 (although maintained in the taxpayer's household  for 21 days), amounts paid to maintain the children during 1961 would  not qualify as a charitable contribution.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A religious organization described in section 170(c)(2)  has a program for providing educational opportunities for children it  places in private homes. In order to implement the program, the  taxpayer, H, who resides with his wife, son, and daughter of high school  age in a town in the United States, signs an agreement with the  organization to maintain a girl sponsored by the organization as a  member of his household while the child attends the local high school  for the regular 1960-61 school year. The child is a full-time student at  the school during the school year starting September 6, 1960, and ending  June 6, 1961, and is a member of the taxpayer's household during that  period. Although the taxpayer pays $200 during the school period falling  in 1960, and $240 during the school period falling in 1961, to maintain  the child, he cannot claim either amount as a charitable contribution  because the child's parents, from time to time during the school year,  send butter, eggs, meat, and vegetables to H to help defray the expenses  of maintaining the child. This is considered property received as  reimbursement under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. Had her parents  not contributed the food, the fact that the child, in addition to the  normal chores she shared with the taxpayer's daughter, such as cleaning  their own rooms and helping with the shopping and cooking, was  responsible for the family laundry and for the heavy cleaning of the  entire house while the taxpayer's daughter had no comparable  responsibilities would also preclude a claim for a charitable deduction.  These substantial gratuitous services are considered property received  as reimbursement under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. A taxpayer resides with his wife in a city in the eastern  United States. He agrees, in writing, with a fraternal society described  in section 170(c)(4) to accept a child selected by the society for  maintenance by him as a member of his household during 1961 in order  that the child may attend the local grammar school as a part of the  society's program to provide elementary education for certain children  selected by it. The taxpayer maintains the child, who has as his  principal place of abode the home of the taxpayer, and is a member of  the taxpayer's household, during the entire year 1961. The child is a  full-time student at the local grammar school for 9 full calendar months  during the year. Under the agreement, the society pays the taxpayer $30  per month to help maintain the child. Since the $30 per month is  considered as compensation or reimbursement to the taxpayer for some  portion of the maintenance paid on behalf of the child, no amounts paid  with respect to such maintenance can be treated as amounts paid in  accordance with section 170(d). In the absence of the $30 per month  payments, if the child qualifies as a dependent of the taxpayer under  section 152(a)(9), that fact would also prevent the maintenance payments  from being treated as charitable contributions paid for the use of the  fraternal society.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Charitable contributions carryover of individuals--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Computation of excess charitable contributions made in contribution  year.

B may claim a charitable contribution deduction of $6,000 in  1966, and the excess of $8,000 (contribution to the church) over $6,000  (30 percent of B's adjusted gross income) or $2,000 constitutes a  charitable contribution carryover which shall be treated as a charitable  contribution paid by B to an organization referred to in section  170(b)(1)(A) in the 5 taxable years succeeding 1966 in order of time. (B  made no excess contributions in 1964 or 1965 which should be treated as  paid in years succeeding 1964 or 1965.) B may claim a charitable  contribution deduction of $9,000 in 1967.

Therefore, even though  the $5,000 contribution made by B in 1969 to a church does not amount to  30 percent of B's adjusted gross income for 1969 (30 percent of  $20,000=$6,000), B may claim a charitable contribution deduction of only  the $5,000 actually paid in 1969 since the entire excess charitable  contribution made in 1966 ($2,000) has been treated as paid in 1967  ($1,500) and 1968 ($500).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3.

In determining the amount of excess charitable contributions that  shall be treated as paid in each of the 5 taxable years succeeding the  contribution year, the excess charitable contributions described in such  subparagraph (1) must be reduced by the amount by which such excess  reduces taxable income (for purposes of determining the portion of a net  operating loss which shall be carried to taxable years succeeding the  contribution year under the second sentence of section 172(b)(2)) and  increases the net operating loss which is carried to a succeeding  taxable year. In reducing taxable income under the second sentence of  section 172(b)(2), an individual who has made charitable contributions  in the contribution year to both organizations specified in section  170(b)(1)(A) (see paragraph (b) of this section) and to organizations  not so specified must first deduct contributions made to the section  170(b)(1)(A) organizations from his adjusted gross income computed  without regard to his net operating loss deduction before any of the  contributions made to organizations not specified in section  170(b)(1)(A) may be deducted from such adjusted gross income. Thus, if  the excess of the contributions made in the contribution year to  organizations specified in section 170(b)(1)(A) over the amount  deductible in such contribution year is utilized to reduce taxable  income (under the provisions of section 172 (b)(2)) for such year,  thereby serving to increase the amount of the net operating loss  carryover to a succeeding year or years, no part of the excess  charitable contributions made in such contribution year shall be treated  as paid in any of the 5 immediately succeeding taxable years. If only a  portion of the excess charitable contributions is so used, the excess  charitable contributions will be reduced only to that extent. The  provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following  examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. B, an individual, reports his income on the calendar year  basis and for the year 1964 has adjusted gross income (computed without  regard to any net operating loss deduction) of $50,000. During 1964 he  made charitable contributions in the amount of $20,000 all of which were  to organizations specified in section 170(b)(1)(A). B has a net  operating loss carryover from 1963 of $50,000. In the absence of the net  operating loss deduction B would have been allowed a deduction for  charitable contributions of $15,000. After the application of the net  operating loss deduction, B is allowed no deduction for charitable  contributions, and there is (before applying the special rule of section  170(b)(5)(B) and this subparagraph) a tentative excess charitable  contribution of $20,000. For purposes of determining the net operating  loss which remains to be carried over to 1965, B computes his taxable  income for his prior taxable year, 1964, under section 172(b)(2) by  deducting the $15,000 charitable contribution. After the $50,000 net  operating loss carryover is applied against the $35,000 of taxable  income for 1964 (computed in accordance with section 172(b)(2), assuming  no deductions other than the charitable contribution deduction are  applicable in making such computation), there remains a $15,000 net  operating loss carryover to 1965. Since the application of the net  operating loss carryover of $50,000 from 1963 reduces the 1964 adjusted  gross income (for purposes of determining 1964 tax liability) to zero,  no part of the $20,000 of charitable contributions in that year is  deductible under section 170(b)(1). However, in determining the amount  of the excess charitable contributions which shall be treated as paid in  taxable years 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, the $20,000 must be reduced  by the portion thereof ($15,000) which was used to reduce taxable income  for 1964 (as computed for purposes of   the second sentence of section 172(b)(2)) and which thereby served to  increase the net operating loss carryover to 1965 from zero to $15,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2.

Under these facts there is a tentative  excess charitable contribution of $15,000, rather than $20,000 as in  Example 1. For purposes of determining the net operating loss which  remains to be carried over to 1965, B computes his taxable income for  his prior taxable year, 1964, under section 172(b)(2) by deducting the  $15,000 of charitable contributions made to organizations specified in  section 170(b)(1)(A). Since the excess charitable contribution of  $15,000 determined in accordance with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph  was used to reduce taxable income for 1964 (as computed for purposes of  the second sentence of section 172(b)(2)) and thereby served to increase  the net operating loss carryover to 1965 from zero to $15,000, no part  of such excess charitable contributions made in the contribution year  shall be treated as paid in any of the five immediately succeeding  taxable years.

Such allocation is computed as follows:  $12,000 (excess charitable contributions made by H (based on separate</p><p class="depth0">return computation) in 1964)/$20,000 (total excess charitable</p><p class="depth0">contributions made by H and W (based on separate return</p><p class="depth0">computation) in 1964)x$10,000=$6,000 $8,000 (excess charitable contributions made by W (based on separate</p><p class="depth0">return computation) in 1964)/$20,000 (total excess charitable</p><p class="depth0">contributions made by H and W (based on separate return</p><p class="depth0">computation) in 1964)x$10,000=$4,000</p><p class="depth0">In 1967 H has adjusted gross income of $70,000 and he contributes  $14,000 to an organization specified in section 170(b)(1)(A). In 1967 W  has adjusted gross income of $50,000, and she contributes $10,000 to an  organization specified in section 170(b)(1)(A). H may claim a charitable  contribution deduction of $20,000 in 1967, and W may claim a charitable  contribution deduction of $14,000 in 1967. H's $20,000 deduction  consists of the $14,000 contribution to the section 170(b)(1)(A)  organization in 1967 and $6,000 carried over from 1964 and treated as a  charitable contribution paid to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in  1967. W's $14,000 deduction consists of the $10,000 contribution made to  a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in 1967 and $4,000 carried over from  1964 and treated as a charitable contribution paid to a section  170(b)(1)(A) organization in 1967. The $6,000 contribution treated as  paid in 1967 by H, and the $4,000 contribution treated as paid in 1967  by W are computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0">H         W</p><p class="depth0">Available charitable contribution carryover (see        $6,000    $4,000</p><p class="depth0">computations above)................................</p><p class="depth0">=================== 30-percent of adjusted gross income.................    21,000    15,000 Contributions made in 1967 to section 170(b)(1)(A)      14,000    10,000</p><p class="depth0">organization (no other contributions)..............</p><p class="depth0">------------------- Amount of allowable deduction unused................     7,000     5,000</p><p class="depth0">=================== Amount of excess contributions treated as paid in        6,000</p><p class="depth0">1967--the lesser of $6,000 (available carryover of</p><p class="depth0">H to 1967) or $7,000 (excess of 30 percent of</p><p class="depth0">adjusted gross income ($21,000) over contributions</p><p class="depth0">actually made in 1967 to section 170(b)(1)(A)</p><p class="depth0">organizations ($14,000))...........................</p><p class="depth0">========== The lesser of $4,000 (available carryover of W to     ........     4,000</p><p class="depth0">1967) or $5,000 (excess of 30 percent of adjusted</p><p class="depth0">gross income ($15,000) over contributions actually</p><p class="depth0">made in 1967 to section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations</p><p class="depth0"><em>($10,000))</em>.........................................</p><p class="depth0">===================</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> From separate returns to joint return and remarried taxpayers.
