                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basis of claim. An importer may make a claim for CAFTA-DR preferential tariff treatment, including an exemption from the merchandise processing fee, based on:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A certification, as specified in Sec. 10.584 of this subpart, that is prepared by the importer, exporter, or producer of the good; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The importer's knowledge that the good qualifies as an originating good, including reasonable reliance on information in the importer's possession that the good is an originating good.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Making a claim. The claim is made by including on the entry summary, or equivalent documentation, the letter ``P'' or ``P+'' as a prefix to the subheading of the HTSUS under which each qualifying good is classified, or by the method specified for equivalent reporting via an authorized electronic data interchange system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Corrected claim. If, after making the claim specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the importer has reason to believe that the claim is based on inaccurate information or is otherwise invalid, the importer must, within 30 calendar days after the date of discovery of the error, correct the claim and pay any duties that may be due. The importer must submit a statement either in writing or via an authorized electronic data interchange system to the CBP office where the original claim was filed specifying the correction (see Sec. Sec. 10.621 and 10.623 of this subpart).
