Although the burden of reasonable description of the records rests with the requestor, FEMA will assist in identification to the extent practicable. Where requested records may be involved in litigation or other judicial proceedings in which the United States is a party, the procedures set forth under Sec. 5.8 shall be followed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon receipt of a request which does not reasonably describe the records requested, FEMA may contact the requestor to seek a more specific description. The 10-day time limit set forth in Sec. 5.52 will not start until a request reasonably describing the records is received in the office of the appropriate official identified in Sec. 5.51.</p>
