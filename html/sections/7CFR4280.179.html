                            <p class="depth0">The Agency will use the following process to determine which feasibility study grants receive funding under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ranking of applications. All scored applications will be ranked by the Agency as soon after the application deadline as possible. All applications that are ranked will be considered for selection for funding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Selection of applications for funding. Using the ranking created under paragraph (a) of this section, the Agency will consider the score an application has received compared to the scores of other ranked applications, with higher scoring applications receiving first consideration for funding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Funding selected applications. As applications are funded, if insufficient funds remain to fund the next highest scoring application, the Agency may elect to fund a lower scoring application. Before this occurs, the Agency will provide the applicant of the higher scoring application the opportunity to reduce the amount of its grant request to the amount of funds available. If the applicant agrees to lower its grant request, it must certify that the purposes of the project can be met, and the Agency must determine the project is financially feasible at the lower amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disposition of ranked applications not funded. Based on the availability of funding, a ranked application may not be funded in the fiscal year in which it was submitted. Such ranked applications will not be carried forward into Fiscal Year 2012 and the Agency will notify the applicant in writing.</p>
