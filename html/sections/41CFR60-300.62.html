The agreement shall provide  for such remedial action as may be necessary to correct the violations  and/or deficiencies noted, including, where appropriate (but not  necessarily limited to) such make whole remedies as back pay and  retroactive seniority. The agreement shall also specify the time period  for completion of the remedial action; the period shall be no longer  than the minimum period necessary to complete the action.</p>
