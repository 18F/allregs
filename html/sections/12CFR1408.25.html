                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any creditor agency which requests the Corporation to impose  an offset against amounts owed to the debtor shall submit to the  Corporation a claim certification which meets the requirements of this  paragraph. The Corporation shall submit the same certification to any  agency that the Corporation requests to effect an offset.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The claim certification shall be in writing. It shall certify  the debtor owes the debt and that all of the applicable requirements of  31 U.S.C. 3716 and 4 CFR part 102 have been met. If the intended offset  is to be a salary offset, a claim certification shall instead certify  that the debtor owes the debt and that the applicable requirements of 5  U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, have been met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A certification that the debtor owes the debt shall state the  amount of the debt, the factual basis supporting the determination of  indebtedness, and the date on which payment of the debt was due. A  certification that the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 4 CFR part 102  have been met shall include a statement that the debtor has been sent a  Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset at least 31  calendar days prior to the date of the intended offset or a statement  that pursuant to 4 CFR 102.3(b)(5) said Notice was not required to be  sent. A certification that the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR  part 550, subpart K, have been met shall include a statement that the  debtor has been sent a Notice of Intent to Collect by Salary Offset at  least 31 calendar days prior to the date of the intended offset or a  statement that pursuant to 4 CFR 102.3(b)(5) said Notice was not  required to be sent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Corporation shall not effect an offset requested by  another Federal agency without first obtaining the claim certification  required by paragraph (a) of this section. If the Corporation receives  an incomplete claim certification, the Corporation shall return the  claim certification with notice that a claim certification   which complies with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section  must be submitted to the Corporation before the Corporation will  consider effecting an offset.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Corporation may rely on the information contained in the  claim certification provided by a requesting creditor agency. The  Corporation is not authorized to review a creditor agency's  determination of indebtedness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Only the creditor agency may agree to enter into an agreement  with the debtor for the repayment of the claim. Only the creditor agency  may agree to compromise, suspend, or terminate collection of the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Corporation may decline, for good cause, a request by  another agency to effect an offset. Good cause includes that the offset  might disrupt, directly or indirectly, essential Corporation operations.  The refusal and the reasons shall be sent in writing to the creditor  agency.</p>
