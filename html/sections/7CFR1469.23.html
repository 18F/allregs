The tier-specific percentage is 5 percent for Tier I payments, 10 percent for Tier II payments, and 15 percent for Tier III payments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other incidental parcels as defined in Sec. 1469.5(d)(1)(iv) may be given a stewardship rate as though they were the land use to which they are contiguous if they are serving a conservation purpose, such as wildlife habitat. Payment is limited to not more than ten percent of the contract acres. Minimum treatment requirements for the contract tier apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other land, as defined in Sec. 1469.5(d)(1)(v), is not included in the stewardship payment computation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> NRCS will publish the stewardship payment rates at the announcement of each program sign-up.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Existing practice component of CSP payments.

The Chief may offer alternative payment methods such as paying a percentage of the stewardship payment as long as the payment will not exceed 75 percent (or, in the case of a beginning farmer or rancher, 90 percent) of the average 2001 county costs of installing the practice in the 2001 crop year. NRCS will post the rates for payment at the time of the sign-up notices on the NRCS website and in USDA Service Centers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> NRCS will not pay for maintenance of equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> NRCS will not pay an existing practice component of CSP payments for any practice that is required to meet conservation compliance requirements found in 7 CFR Part 12.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Existing practice payments are not intended to pay for routine maintenance activities related to production

practices or practices considered typical in farm and ranch operations for a specific location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Existing practice payments will be made only on practices that meet or exceed the practice standards described in the FOTG.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The Chief may reduce the rates in any given sign-up notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> New practice payments.

NRCS will provide the list of approved practices and the percentage cost-share rate for each practice at the time of each CSP sign-up notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Participants may contribute to their share of the cost of installing a new practice through in-kind sources, such as personal labor, use of personal equipment, or donated materials. Contributions for a participant's share of the practice may also be provided from non-Federal sources, as determined by the Chief.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cost-share payments may be provided by other programs; except that payments may not be provided through CSP and another program for the same practice on the same land area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If additional practices are installed or implemented to advance a contract from one tier of participation to a higher tier, the practice must be certified as meeting FOTG practice standards by NRCS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In no instance will the total financial contributions for installing a practice from all public and private entity sources exceed 100 percent of the actual cost of installing the practice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> NRCS will not pay a new practice payment for any practice that is required to meet the conservation compliance plan requirements found in 7 CFR Part 12.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The Chief may reduce the rates in any given sign-up notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Enhancement component of CSP payments.
