                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Reportable event--(1) In general. A reportable event occurs for a plan when--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The plan or any other plan maintained by a person in the plan's controlled group makes a transfer of benefit liabilities to a person, or to a plan or plans maintained by a person or persons, that are not members of the transferor plan's controlled group; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of benefit liabilities transferred, in conjunction with other benefit liabilities transferred during the 12-month period ending on the date of the transfer, is 3 percent or more of the plan's total benefit liabilities. Both the benefit liabilities transferred and the plan's total benefit liabilities shall be valued as of any one date in the plan year in which the transfer occurs, using actuarial assumptions that comply with section 414(l) of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Date of transfer. The date of transfer shall be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the particular situation. For transfers subject to the requirements of section 414(l) of the Code, the date determined in accordance with 26 CFR 1.414(l)-1(b)(11) will be considered the date of transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Initial information required. In addition to the information required in Sec. 4043.3(b), the notice shall include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Identification of the transferee(s) and each contributing sponsor of each transferee plan by name and EIN/PN or EIN, as appropriate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An explanation of the actuarial assumptions used in determining the value of benefit liabilities (and, if appropriate, the value of plan assets) for each transfer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An estimate of the amounts of assets and liabilities being transferred, and the number of participants whose benefits are transferred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Waivers--(1) Complete plan transfer. Notice is waived if the transfer is a transfer of all of the transferor plan's benefit liabilities and assets to one other plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transfer of less than 3 percent of assets. Notice is waived if the value of the assets being transferred--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Equals the present value of the accrued benefits (whether or not vested) being transferred, using actuarial assumptions that comply with section 414(l) of the Code; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In conjunction with other assets transferred during the same plan year, is less than 3 percent of the assets of the transferor plan as of at least one day in that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Section 414(l) safe harbor. Notice is waived if the transfer complies with section 414(l) of the Code using the actuarial assumptions prescribed for valuing benefits in trusteed plans under Sec. 4044.51-57 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fully funded plans. Notice is waived if the transfer complies with section 414(l) of the Code using reasonable actuarial assumptions and, after the transfer, the transferor and transferee plans are fully funded (using the actuarial assumptions prescribed for valuing benefits in trusteed plans under Sec. 4044.51-57) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Who must file. Only the plan administrator and contributing sponsor of the plan that made the transfer described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are required to file a notice of a reportable event under this section. Notice by any other contributing sponsor or plan administrator is waived.</p>
