In order for a State to obtain approval:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A State must submit a written request for approval to the FHWA Division Administrator for each year that a State certifies that the requirements have been met before a State may use these funds to carry out safety projects under any other section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A State must submit a written request that describes how the certification was made, the activities that will be funded, how the activities are consistent with the SHSP, and the dollar amount the State estimates will be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a State has funds set aside from 23 U.S.C. 104(b)(5) for construction and operational improvements on high risk rural roads, in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 148(a)(1), such funds:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Shall be used for safety projects that address priority high risk rural roads as determined by the State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shall only be used for construction and operational improvements on high risk rural roads and the planning, preliminary engineering, and roadway safety audits related to specific high risk rural roads improvements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> May also be used for other highway safety improvement projects if the State certifies that it has met all infrastructure safety needs for construction and operational improvements on high risk rural roads for a given fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Funds set aside pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 148 for apportionment under the 23 U.S.C. 130(f) Railway-Highway Grade Crossing Program, are to be used to implement railway-highway grade crossing safety projects on any public road. At least 50 percent of the funds apportioned under 23 U.S.C. 130(f) must be made available for the installation of highway-rail grade crossing protective devices. The railroad share, if any, of the cost of grade crossing improvements shall be determined in accordance with 23 CFR part 646, subpart B (Railroad-Highway Projects). If a State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the FHWA Division Administrator that the State has met its needs for installation of protective devices at railway-highway grade crossings the State may use funds made available under 23 U.S.C.

130 for highway safety improvement program purposes. In addition, up to 2 percent of the section 130 funds apportioned to a State may be used for compilation and analysis of safety data for the annual report to the FHWA Division Administrator required under Sec. 924.15(a)(2) on the progress being made to implement the railway-highway grade crossing program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Highway safety improvement projects may also be implemented with other funds apportioned under 23 U.S.C. 104(b) subject to the eligibility requirements applicable to each program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Award of contracts for highway safety improvement projects shall be in accordance with 23 CFR part 635 and part 636, where applicable, for highway construction projects, 23 CFR part 172 for engineering and design services contracts related to highway construction projects, or 49 CFR part 18 for non-highway construction projects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> All safety projects funded under 23 U.S.C. 104(b)(5), including safety projects under any other section, shall be accounted for in the statewide transportation improvement program and reported on annually in accordance with Sec. 924.15.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The Federal share of the cost for most highway safety improvement projects carried out with funds apportioned to a State under 23 U.S.C. 104(b)(5) shall be a maximum of 90 percent. In accordance with 23 U.S.C. 120(a) or (b), the Federal share may be increased to a maximum of 95 percent by the sliding scale rates for States with a large percentage of Federal lands. In accordance with 23 U.S.C. 120(c), projects such as roundabouts, traffic control signalization, safety rest areas, pavement markings, or installation of traffic signs, traffic lights, guardrails, impact attenuators, concrete barrier end treatments, breakaway utility poles, or priority control systems for emergency vehicles or transit vehicles at signalized intersections may be funded at up to 100 percent Federal share, except not more than 10 percent of the sums apportioned under 23 U.S.C. 104 for any fiscal year shall be used at this Federal share rate. In addition, for railway-highway grade crossings, the Federal share may amount up to 100 percent for projects for signing, pavement markings, active warning devices, and crossing closures, subject to the 10 percent limitation for funds apportioned under 23 U.S.C. 104 in a fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The implementation of the HSIP in each State shall include a process for implementing highway safety improvement projects in accordance with the procedures set forth in 23 CFR part 630, subpart A (Preconstruction Procedures: Project Authorization and Agreements).</p>
