                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In testing for explosion-proof characteristics of an enclosure,  it shall be filled and surrounded with various explosive mixtures of  natural gas and air. The explosive mixture within the enclosure will be  ignited electrically and the explosion pressure developed therefrom  recorded. The point of ignition within the enclosure will be varied.  Motor armatures and/or rotors will be stationary in some tests and  revolving in others. Coal dust having a minimum of 22 percent dry  volatile matter and a minimum heat constant of 11,000 moist BTU (coal  containing natural bed moisture but not visible surface water) ground to  a fineness of minus 200 mesh U.S. Standard sieve series. At MSHA's  discretion dummies may be substituted for internal electrical components  during some of the tests. Not less than 16 explosion tests shall be  conducted; however, the nature of the enclosure and the results obtained  during the tests will determine whether additional tests shall be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Explosion tests of an enclosure shall not result in:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Discharge of flame.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ignition of an explosive mixture surrounding the enclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Development of afterburning.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Rupture of any part of the enclosure or any panel or divider  within the enclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Permanent distortion of the enclosure exceeding 0.040 inch per  linear foot.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When a pressure exceeding 125 pounds per square inch (gage) is  developed during explosion tests, MSHA reserves the right to reject an  enclosure(s) unless (1) constructional changes are made that result in a  reduction of pressure to 125 pounds per square inch (gage) or less, or  (2) the enclosure withstands a dynamic pressure of twice the highest  value recorded in the initial test.
