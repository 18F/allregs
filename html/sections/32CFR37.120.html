                            <p class="depth0">Your office may award or administer TIAs if it has a delegation of the authorities in 10 U.S.C. 2371, as well as 10 U.S.C. 2358. If your office is in a Military Department, it must have a delegation of the authority of the Secretary of that Military Department under those statutes. If your office is in a Defense Agency, it must have a delegation of the authority of the Secretary of Defense under 10 U.S.C. 2358 and 2371. Your office needs those authorities to be able to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Enter into cooperative agreements to stimulate or support research, using the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2358, as well as assistance transactions other than grants or cooperative agreements, using the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371. The reason that both authorities are needed is that a TIA, depending upon its patent rights provision (see appendix B to this part), may be either a cooperative agreement or a type of assistance transaction other than a grant or cooperative agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Recover funds from a recipient and reuse the funds for program purposes, as authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2371 and described in Sec. 37.580.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exempt certain information received from proposers from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, as authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2371 and described in Sec. 37.420.</p>
