The lock or tag shall not be removed or the valves unblanked until it is determined that this may be done without creating a hazard to the employees working on the system, or until the work on the system is completed, in accordance with Sec. 1915.89. When valves are welded instead of bolted, at least two isolation and shutoff valves connecting the dead system with the live system or systems shall be secured, and then locked or tagged, in accordance with Sec. 1915.89.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Drain connections to the atmosphere on all of the dead interconnecting systems shall be opened for visual observation of drainage.
