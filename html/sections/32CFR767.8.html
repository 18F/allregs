All necessary information to make an objective evaluation of the amendment should be included as well as reference to the original application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Permit holders desiring to continue research activities must reapply for an extension of their current permit before it expires. A pending extension or amendment request does not guarantee extension or amendment of the original permit. Therefore, you must submit an extension request to NHC at least 30 days prior to the original permit's expiration date. Reference to the original application may be given in lieu of a new application, provided the scope of work does not change significantly. Applicants may apply for one-year extensions subject to annual review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Permit holders may appeal denied requests for amendments or extensions to the appeal authority listed in Sec. 767.5.</p>
