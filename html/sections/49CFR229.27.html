                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All testing under this section shall be performed at intervals  that do not exceed 368 calendar days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Load meters that indicate current (amperage) being applied to  traction motors shall be tested. Each device used by the engineer to aid  in the control or braking of the train or locomotive that provides an  indication of air pressure electronically shall be tested by comparison  with a test gauge or self-test designed for this purpose. An error  greater than five percent or greater than three pounds per square inch  shall be corrected. The date and place of the test shall be recorded on  Form FRA F 6180-49A, and the person conducting the test and that  person's supervisor shall sign the form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A microprocessor-based event recorder with a self-monitoring  feature   equipped to verify that all data elements required by this part are  recorded, requires further maintenance and testing only if either of the  following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The self-monitoring feature displays an indication of a failure.  If a failure is displayed, further maintenance and testing must be  performed until a subsequent test is successful. When a successful test  is accomplished, a record, in any medium, shall be made of that fact and  of any maintenance work necessary to achieve the successful result. This  record shall be available at the location where the locomotive is  maintained until a record of a subsequent successful test is filed; or,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A download of the event recorder, taken within the preceding 30  days and reviewed for the previous 48 hours of locomotive operation,  reveals a failure to record a regularly recurring data element or  reveals that any required data element is not representative of the  actual operations of the locomotive during this time period. If the  review is not successful, further maintenance and testing shall be  performed until a subsequent test is successful. When a successful test  is accomplished, a record, in any medium, shall be made of that fact and  of any maintenance work necessary to achieve the successful result. This  record shall be kept at the location where the locomotive is maintained  until a record of a subsequent successful test is filed. The download  shall be taken from information stored in the certified crashworthy  crash hardened event recorder memory module if the locomotive is so  equipped.  [77 FR 21345, Apr. 9, 2012]</p>
