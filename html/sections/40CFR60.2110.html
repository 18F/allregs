                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> through (4) of this section during the  initial performance test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> or (ii), as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For continuous and intermittent units, maximum charge rate is  110 percent of the average charge rate measured during the most recent  performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission  limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For batch units, maximum charge rate is 110 percent of the  daily charge rate measured during the most recent performance test  demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Minimum pressure drop across the wet particulate matter  scrubber, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average pressure drop  across the wet scrubber measured during the most recent performance test  demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter emission  limitations; or minimum amperage to the wet scrubber, which is  calculated as the lowest 1-hour average amperage to the wet scrubber  measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating  compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Minimum scrubber liquid flow rate, which is calculated as the  lowest 1-hour average liquid flow rate at the inlet to the wet acid gas  or particulate matter scrubber measured during the most recent  performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission  limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Minimum scrubber liquor pH, which is calculated as the lowest 1- hour average liquor pH at the inlet to the wet acid gas scrubber  measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating  compliance with the HCl emission limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> You must meet the operating limits established during the  initial performance test 60 days after your CISWI unit reaches the  charge rate at which it will operate, but no later than 180 days after  its initial startup.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If you use a fabric filter to comply with the emission  limitations, you must operate each fabric filter system such that the  bag leak detection system alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of  the operating time during a 6-month period. In calculating this  operating time percentage, if inspection of the fabric filter  demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no   alarm time is counted. If corrective action is required, each alarm  shall be counted as a minimum of 1 hour. If you take longer than 1 hour  to initiate corrective action, the alarm time shall be counted as the  actual amount of time taken by you to initiate corrective action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If you use an electrostatic precipitator to comply with the  emission limitations, you must measure the (secondary) voltage and  amperage of the electrostatic precipitator collection plates during the  particulate matter performance test. Calculate the average electric  power value (secondary voltage x secondary current = secondary electric  power) for each test run. The operating limit for the electrostatic  precipitator is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average secondary  electric power measured during the most recent performance test  demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter emission  limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> If you use activated carbon sorbent injection to comply with the  emission limitations, you must measure the sorbent flow rate during the  performance testing. The operating limit for the carbon sorbent  injection is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average sorbent flow rate  measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating  compliance with the mercury emission limitations. For energy recovery  units, when your unit operates at lower loads, multiply your sorbent  injection rate by the load fraction, as defined in this subpart, to  determine the required injection rate (e.g., for 50 percent load,  multiply the injection rate operating limit by 0.5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> If you use selective noncatalytic reduction to comply with the  emission limitations, you must measure the charge rate, the secondary  chamber temperature (if applicable to your CISWI unit), and the reagent  flow rate during the nitrogen oxides performance testing. The operating  limits for the selective noncatalytic reduction are calculated as the  highest 1-hour average charge rate, lower secondary chamber temperature,  and lowest reagent flow rate measured during the most recent performance  test demonstrating compliance with the nitrogen oxides emission  limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> If you use a dry scrubber to comply with the emission  limitations, you must measure the injection rate of each sorbent during  the performance testing. The operating limit for the injection rate of  each sorbent is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average injection rate  or each sorbent measured during the most recent performance test  demonstrating compliance with the hydrogen chloride emission  limitations. For energy recovery units, when your unit operates at lower  loads, multiply your sorbent injection rate by the load fraction, as  defined in this subpart, to determine the required injection rate (e.g.,  for 50 percent load, multiply the injection rate operating limit by  0.5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> If you do not use a wet scrubber, electrostatic precipitator, or  fabric filter to comply with the emission limitations, and if you do not  determine compliance with your particulate matter emission limitation  with a particulate matter CEMS, you must maintain opacity to less than  or equal to 10 percent opacity (1-hour block average).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(1)</em> through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determine your operating limit as the average PM CPMS output  value recorded during the performance test or at a PM CPMS output value  corresponding to 75% of the emission limit if your PM performance test  demonstrates compliance below 75% of the emission limit. You must verify  an existing or establish a new operating limit after each repeated  performance test. You must repeat the performance test annually and  reassess and adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with  the results of the performance test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Your PM CPMS must provide a 4-20 milliamp output and the  establishment of its relationship to manual reference method  measurements must be determined in units of milliamps.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Your PM CPMS operating range must be capable of reading PM  concentrations from zero to a level equivalent to at least two times  your allowable emission limit. If your PM CPMS   is an auto-ranging instrument capable of multiple scales, the primary  range of the instrument must be capable of reading PM concentration from  zero to a level equivalent to two times your allowable emission limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> During the initial performance test or any such subsequent  performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, record  and average all milliamp output values from the PM CPMS for the periods  corresponding to the compliance test runs (e.g., average all your PM  CPMS output values for three corresponding 2-hour Method 5I test runs).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the average of your three PM performance test runs are below  75% of your PM emission limit, you must calculate an operating limit by  establishing a relationship of PM CPMS signal to PM concentration using  the PM CPMS instrument zero, the average PM CPMS values corresponding to  the three compliance test runs, and the average PM concentration from  the Method 5 or performance test with the procedures in (i)(1) through  (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determine your instrument zero output with one of the following  procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Zero point data for in-situ instruments should be obtained by  removing the instrument from the stack and monitoring ambient air on a  test bench.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Zero point data for extractive instruments should be obtained by  removing the extractive probe from the stack and drawing in clean  ambient air.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The zero point can also can be established obtained by  performing manual reference method measurements when the flue gas is  free of PM emissions or contains very low PM concentrations (e.g., when  your process is not operating, but the fans are operating or your source  is combusting only natural gas) and plotting these with the compliance  data to find the zero intercept.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If none of the steps in paragraphs (i)(2)(i) through (iv) of  this section are possible, you must use a zero output value provided by  the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determine your PM CPMS instrument average in milliamps, and the  average of your corresponding three PM compliance test runs, using  equation 1. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07FE13.000  Where:</p><p class="depth0">X1 = the PM CPMS data points for the three runs  constituting the performance test,</p><p class="depth0">Y1 = the PM concentration value for the three runs  constituting the performance test, and</p><p class="depth0">n = the number of data points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> With your instrument zero expressed in milliamps, your three  run average PM CPMS milliamp value, and your three run average PM  concentration from your three compliance tests, determine a relationship  of lb/Mmbtu per milliamp with equation 2. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07FE13.001  Where:</p><p class="depth0">R = the relative mg/dscm per milliamp for your PM CPMS,</p><p class="depth0">Y1 = the three run average mg/dscm PM concentration,</p><p class="depth0">X1 = the three run average milliamp output from you PM  CPMS, and</p><p class="depth0">z = the milliamp equivalent of your instrument zero determined from  (2)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Determine your source specific 30-day rolling average operating  limit using the mg/dscm per milliamp value from Equation 2 in equation  3, below. This sets your operating limit at the PM CPMS output value  corresponding to 75% of your emission limit. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07FE13.002  Where:</p><p class="depth0">Ol = the operating limit for your PM CPMS on a 30-day  rolling average, in milliamps.</p><p class="depth0">L = your source emission limit expressed in lb/Mmbtu,</p><p class="depth0">z = your instrument zero in milliamps, determined from (2)(a), and</p><p class="depth0">R = the relative mg/dscm per milliamp for your PM CPMS, from  Equation 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the average of your three PM compliance test runs is at or  above 75% of your PM emission limit you must determine your operating  limit by averaging the PM CPMS milliamp output corresponding to your  three PM performance test runs that demonstrate compliance with the  emission limit using equation 4 and you must submit all compliance test  and PM CPMS data according to the reporting requirements in paragraph  (i)(5) of this section. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07FE13.003  Where:</p><p class="depth0">X1 = the PM CPMS data points for all runs i,</p><p class="depth0">n = the number of data points, and</p><p class="depth0">Oh = your site specific operating limit, in milliamps.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> To determine continuous compliance, you must record the PM CPMS  output data for all periods when the process is operating and the PM  CPMS is not out-of-control. You must demonstrate continuous compliance  by using all quality-assured hourly average data collected by the PM  CPMS for all operating hours to calculate the arithmetic average  operating parameter in units of the operating limit (e.g., milliamps, PM  concentration, raw data signal) on a 30-day rolling average basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For PM performance test reports used to set a PM CPMS operating  limit, the electronic submission of the test report must also include  the make and model of the PM CPMS instrument, serial number of the  instrument, analytical principle of the instrument (e.g., beta  attenuation), span of the instruments primary analytical range, milliamp  value equivalent to the instrument zero output, technique by which this  zero value was determined, and the average milliamp signals  corresponding to each PM compliance test run.
