Therefore, under this authority, OPM is excluding  the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Employees serving under appointments limited to 1 year or less,  unless such appointments meet the definition of provisional appointments  contained in Sec. Sec. 316.401 and 316.403 of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Intermittent employees serving under other than career or career  conditional appointments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When an employee who is covered by FERS moves to a position  listed in paragraph (a) of this section without a break in service or  after a separation of 3 days or less, his or her FERS coverage will  continue, except in the case of an employee hired by the Census Bureau  under a temporary, intermittent appointment to perform decennial census  duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Paragraph (a) of this section does not deny FERS coverage to an  employee who receives an interim appointment under Sec. 772.102 of this  chapter and was covered by FERS at the time of the separation for which  interim relief is required.
