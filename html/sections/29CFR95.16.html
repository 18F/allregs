                            <p class="depth0">Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (Pub. L. 94- 580 codified at 42 U.S.C. 6962), any State agency or agency of a  political subdivision of a State which is using appropriated Federal  funds must comply with Section 6002. Section 6002 requires that  preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific  products containing recycled materials identified in guidelines  developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR parts  247-254). Accordingly, State and local institutions of higher education,  hospitals, and non-profit organizations that receive direct Federal  awards or other Federal funds shall give preference in their procurement  programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of recycled products  pursuant to the EPA guidelines.</p>
