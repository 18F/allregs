                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exceptions and request for oral argument. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within 20 days  after the filing of the Administrative Law Judge's initial decision,  each party may take exception to any matter set forth in such decision  or to any adverse order or ruling to which he objected during the  hearing and may appeal such exceptions to the Environmental Appeals  Board for decision by filing them in writing with the hearing clerk,  including a section containing proposed findings of fact, conclusions,  orders, or rulings. Within the same period of time each party filing  exceptions and amicus curiae shall file with the hearing clerk a brief  concerning each of the exceptions being appealed. The party shall  include, in its brief, page references to the relevant portions of the  record and to the Administrative Law Judge's initial decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within 7 days of the service of exceptions, and of a brief under  paragraph (a)(1) of this section, any other party or amicus curiae may  file and serve a brief responding to exceptions or arguments raised by  any other party. Such brief shall include references to the relevant  portions of the record. Such brief shall not, however, raise additional  exceptions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Five copies of all material filed under this section shall be  filed with the hearing clerk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Review by Administrator when no exceptions are filed. If no  exceptions are filed within the time provided, the hearing clerk shall  notify the Administrator 30 days from the date of filing of the  Administrative Law Judge's initial decision. Within 10 days after said  notification, the Environmental Appeals Board shall issue an order  either declining review of the initial decision or expressing its intent  to review said initial decision. Such order may include a statement of  issues to be briefed by the parties and a time schedule concerning  service and filing of briefs adequate to allow the Environmental Appeals  Board to issue a final order within 90 days from the close of the  hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Argument before the Environmental Appeals Board. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A party, if  he files exceptions and a brief, shall state in writing whether he  desires to make an oral argument thereon before the Environmental  Appeals Board; otherwise, he shall be deemed to have waived such oral  argument. The Environmental Appeals Board shall, however, on its own  initiative, have the right to set an appeal for oral argument.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Environmental Appeals Board determines that additional  exceptions should be argued, counsel for the parties shall be given  reasonable written notice of such determination so as to permit  preparation of adequate argument on all of the exceptions to be argued.
