                            <p class="depth0">Employment in ``secondary'' agriculture, under section 3(f),  includes employment in ``delivery to storage or to market or to carriers  for transportation to market'' when performed by a farmer as an incident  to or in conjunction with his own farming operations. To the extent that  such deliveries may be accomplished without leaving the farm where the  commodities delivered are grown, the exemption extends also to employees  of someone other than the farmer who raised them if they are performing  such deliveries for the farmer. However, normally such deliveries  require travel off the farm, and where this is the case, only employees  of a farmer engaged in making them can come within section 3(f). Such  employees would not be engaged in agriculture in any workweek when they  delivered commodities of other farmers, however, because such deliveries  would not be performed as an incident to or in conjunction with ``such''  farming operations, as explained previously. If the ``delivery'' trip is  within section 3(f) the necessary return trip to the farm is also  included.</p>
