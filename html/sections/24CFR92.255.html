                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The participating jurisdiction may permit the owner of HOME- assisted rental units to convert the rental units to homeownership units  by selling, donating, or otherwise conveying the units to the existing  tenants to enable the tenants to become homeowners in accordance with  the requirements of Sec. 92.254. However, refusal by the tenant to  purchase the housing does not constitute grounds for eviction or for  failure to renew the lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If no additional HOME funds are used to enable the tenants to  become homeowners, the homeownership units are subject to a minimum  period of affordability equal to the remaining affordable period if the  units continued as rental units. If additional HOME funds are used to  directly assist the tenants to become homeowners, the minimum period of  affordability is the affordability period under Sec. 92.254(a)(4),  based on the amount of direct homeownership assistance provided.  [78 FR 44676, July 24, 2013]    Sec. 92.256  [Reserved]</p>
