Projects funded under the SRL program are limited to  those activities that specifically reduce or eliminate flood damages to  severe repetitive loss properties. Projects funded under the FMA program  are limited to activities that reduce flood damages to properties  insured under the NFIP. For either program, applications involving any  activities for which implementation has already been initiated or  completed are not eligible for funding, and will not be considered.  Eligible activities are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Acquisition of real property from property owners, and  demolition or relocation of buildings and/or structures to areas outside  of the floodplain to convert the property to open space use in  perpetuity, in accordance with part 80 of this subchapter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Elevation of existing structures to at least base flood levels  or higher, if required by FEMA or if required by any State or local  ordinance, and in accordance with criteria established by the  Administrator;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Floodproofing of existing non-residential structures in  accordance with the requirements of the NFIP or higher standards if  required by FEMA   or if required by any State or local ordinance, and in accordance with  criteria established by the Administrator;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Floodproofing of historic structures as defined in Sec. 59.1  of this subchapter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> For SRL only, demolition and rebuilding of properties to at  least base flood levels or higher, if required by FEMA or if required by  any State or local ordinance, and in accordance with criteria  established by the Administrator; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Minor physical localized flood reduction measures that lessen  the frequency or severity of flooding and decrease predicted flood  damages, and that do not duplicate the flood prevention activities of  other Federal agencies. Major flood control projects such as dikes,  levees, floodwalls, seawalls, groins, jetties, dams and large-scale  waterway channelization projects are not eligible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Minimum project criteria.
