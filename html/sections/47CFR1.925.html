The fees  for such waiver requests are set forth in Sec. 1.1102 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Procedure and format for filing waiver requests. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Requests  for waiver of rules associated with licenses or applications in the  Wireless Radio Services must be filed on FCC Form 601, 603, or 605.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requests for waiver must contain a complete explanation as to  why the waiver is desired. If the information necessary to support a  waiver request is already on file, the applicant may cross-reference the  specific filing where the information may be found.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Commission may grant a request for waiver if it is shown  that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The underlying purpose of the rule(s) would not be served or  would be frustrated by application to the instant case, and that a grant  of the requested waiver would be in the public interest; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In view of unique or unusual factual circumstances of the  instant case, application of the rule(s) would be inequitable, unduly  burdensome or contrary to the public interest, or the applicant has no  reasonable alternative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Applicants requiring expedited processing of their request for  waiver shall clearly caption their request for waiver with the words  ``WAIVER--EXPEDITED ACTION REQUESTED.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Action on Waiver Requests. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Commission, in its  discretion, may give public notice of the filing of a waiver request and  seek comment from the public or affected parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Denial of a rule waiver request associated with an application  renders that application defective unless it contains an alternative  proposal that fully complies with the rules, in which event, the  application will be processed using the alternative proposal as if the  waiver had not been requested. Applications rendered defective may be  dismissed without prejudice.  [63 FR 68926, Dec. 14, 1998]</p>
