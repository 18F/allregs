In selecting sample types, sample locations, and measurement methods, owners and operators must consider the method of closure, the nature of the stored substance, the type of backfill, the depth to ground water, and other factors appropriate for identifying the presence of a release. The requirements of this section are satisfied if one of the external release detection methods allowed in Sec.  280.43 (e) and (f) is operating in accordance with the requirements in Sec.  280.43 at the time of closure, and indicates no release has occurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If contaminated soils, contaminated ground water, or free product as a liquid or vapor is discovered under paragraph (a) of this section, or by any other manner, owners and operators must begin corrective action in accordance with subpart F.</p>
