The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not met because the regional haze plan submitted by Alabama on July 15, 2008, does not include fully approvable measures for meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(d)(3) and 51.308(e) with respect to emissions of NOX and SO2 from electric generating units. EPA has given limited disapproval to the plan provisions addressing these requirements.
