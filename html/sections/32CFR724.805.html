                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General guidance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If any issue submitted by an applicant  contains two or more clearly separate issues, the NDRB should respond to  each issue under the guidance of this paragraph as if it had been set  forth separately by the applicant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an applicant uses a ``building block'' approach (that is,  setting forth a series of conclusions on issues that lead to a single  conclusion purportedly warranting a change in the applicant's  discharge), normally there should be a separate response to each issue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nothing in this paragraph precludes the NDRB from making a  single response to multiple issues when such action would enhance the  clarity of the decisional document, but such response must reflect an  adequate response to each separate issue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Decisional issues. An item submitted as an issue by an applicant  in accordance with this Manual shall be addressed as a decisional issue  in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the NDRB decides that a change in discharge should be  granted, and the NDRB bases its decision in   whole or in part on the applicant's issue; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the NDRB does not provide the applicant with the full  change in discharge requested, and the decision is based in whole or in  part on the NDRB's disagreement on the merits with an issue submitted by  the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Response to items not addressed as decisional issues. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the  applicant receives the full change in discharge requested (or a more  favorable change), that fact shall be noted and the basis shall be  addressed as a decisional issue. No further response is required to  other issues submitted by the applicant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the applicant does not receive the full change in discharge  requested with respect to either the character of or reason for  discharge (or both), the NDRB shall address the items submitted by the  applicant under Sec. 724.806, (Decisional Issues) unless one of the  following responses is applicable:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Duplicate issues. The NDRB may state that there is a full  response to the issue submitted by the applicant under a specified  decisional issue. This response may be used only when one issue clearly  duplicates another or the issue clearly requires discussion in  conjunction with another issue.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Citations without principles and facts. The NDRB may state that  the applicant's issue, which consists of a citation to a decision  without setting forth any principles and facts from the decision that  the applicant states are relevant to the applicant's case, does not  comply with the requirements of Sec. 724.802(b)(4).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Unclear issues. The NDRB may state that it cannot respond to  an item submitted by the applicant as an issue because the meaning of  the item is unclear. An issue is unclear if it cannot be understood by a  reasonable person familiar with the discharge review process after a  review of the materials considered.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Nonspecific issues. The NDRB may state that it cannot respond  to an item submitted by the applicant as an issue because it is not  specific. A submission is considered not specific if a reasonable person  familiar with the discharge review process after a review of the  materials considered cannot determine the relationship between the  applicant's submission and the particular circumstances of the case.  This response may be used only if the submission is expressed in such  general terms that no other response is applicable. For example, if the  NDRB disagrees with the applicant as to the relevance of matters set  forth in the submission, the NDRB normally will set forth the nature of  the disagreement with respect to decisional issues, or it will reject  the applicant's position. If the applicant's submission is so general  that none of those provisions is applicable, then the NDRB may state  that it cannot respond because the item is not specific.</p>
