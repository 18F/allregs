Agencies shall use the criteria for scope (Sec.  1508.25) to determine which proposal(s) shall be the subject of a particular statement. Proposals or parts of proposals which are related to each other closely enough to be, in effect, a single course of action shall be evaluated in a single impact statement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Environmental impact statements may be prepared, and are sometimes required, for broad Federal actions such as the adoption of new agency programs or regulations (Sec.  1508.18). Agencies shall prepare statements on broad actions so that they are relevant to policy and are timed to coincide with meaningful points in agency planning and decisionmaking.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When preparing statements on broad actions (including proposals by more than one agency), agencies may find it useful to evaluate the proposal(s) in one of the following ways:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Geographically, including actions occurring in the same general location, such as body of water, region, or metropolitan area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Generically, including actions which have relevant similarities, such

as common timing, impacts, alternatives, methods of implementation, media, or subject matter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> By stage of technological development including federal or federally assisted research, development or demonstration programs for new technologies which, if applied, could significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Statements shall be prepared on such programs and shall be available before the program has reached a stage of investment or commitment to implementation likely to determine subsequent development or restrict later alternatives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Agencies shall as appropriate employ scoping (Sec.  1501.7), tiering (Sec.  1502.20), and other methods listed in Sec. Sec.  1500.4 and 1500.5 to relate broad and narrow actions and to avoid duplication and delay.</p>
