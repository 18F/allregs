                            <p class="depth0">The FHWA/FTA project must comply with any PM10 and PM2.5 control measures in the applicable implementation plan. This criterion is satisfied if the project-level conformity determination contains a written commitment from the project sponsor to include in the final plans, specifications, and estimates for the project those control measures (for the purpose of limiting PM10 and PM2.5 emissions from the construction activities and/or normal use and operation associated with the project) that are contained in the applicable implementation plan.
