The election must be expressed in whole percentages or whole dollar  amounts. A participant may contribute a percentage for one type of  contribution and a dollar amount for another type of contribution. If a  participant elects to contribute a dollar amount to his or her  traditional balance and a dollar amount to his or her Roth balance, but  the total dollar amount elected is more than the amount available to be  deducted from the participant's basic pay, the employing agency will  deduct traditional contributions first and Roth contributions second.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Uniformed services members may elect to contribute a basic pay  and special or incentive pay (including bonus pay) subject to the limits  described in Sec. 1600.22.
