                            <p class="depth0">It is the usual practice to withhold the release of raw scientific  data received from spacecraft until it can be calibrated, correlated and  properly interpreted by the experimenter under the monitorship of the  cognizant NASA office. During this process, the data are withheld  through administrative measures, and it is not necessary to resort to  security classification to prevent premature release. However, if at any  time during the processing of raw data it becomes apparent that the  results require protection under the criteria set forth in this subpart  D, it is the responsibility of the cognizant NASA office to obtain the  appropriate security classification.</p>
