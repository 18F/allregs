                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> On-scene communications are those between mobile unit in distress and assisting mobile units, and between the mobile units and unit coordinating search and rescue operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Control of on-scene communications is the responsibility of the unit coordinating search and rescue operations. Simplex communications must be used so that all on-scene mobile stations may share relevant information concerning the distress incident. If direct-printing telegraphy is used, it must be in the forward error-correcting mode in accordance with ITU-R Recommendation M.625-3, with Annex, as specified in Sec. 80.1101.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The preferred frequencies in radiotelephony for on-scene communications are 156.8 MHz and 2182 kHz. The frequency 2174.5 kHz may also be used for ship-to-ship on-scene communications using narrow-band direct-printing telegraphy in the forward error correcting mode in accordance with ITU-R M.625-3 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 80.7), as specified in Sec. 80.1101.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In addition to 156.8 MHz and 2182 kHz, the frequencies 3023 kHz, 4125 kHz, 5680 kHz, 123.1 MHz and 156.3 MHz may be used for ship-to-aircraft on-scene communications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The selection or designation of on-scene frequencies is the responsibility of the unit coordinating search and rescue operations. Normally, once an on-scene frequency is established, a continuous aural or teleprinter watch is maintained by all participating on-scene mobile units on the selected frequency.
