                            <p class="depth0">The establishment management shall be responsible for taking all precautions to assure the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Disease control. No person affected by disease in a communicable form, or while a carrier of such disease, or while affected with boils, sores, infected wounds, or other abnormal sources of microbiological contamination, shall work in a food plant in any capacity in which there is a reasonable possibility of food ingredients becoming contaminated by such person, or of disease being transmitted by such person to other individuals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cleanliness. All persons, while working in direct contact with food preparation, food ingredients, or surfaces coming into contact therewith shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wear clean outer garments, maintain a high degree of personal cleanliness, and conform to hygenic practices while on duty, to the extent necessary to prevent contamination of food products.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Wash and sanitize their hands thoroughly to prevent contamination by undesirable microorganisms before starting work, after each absence from the work station, and at any other time when the hands may have become soiled or contaminated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Remove all insecure jewelry and, when food is being manipulated by hand, remove from hands any jewelry that cannot be adequately sanitized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If gloves are used in food handling, maintain them in an intact, clean, and sanitary condition. Such gloves shall be of an impermeable material except where their usage would be inappropriate or incompatible with the work involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Wear hair nets, caps, masks, or other effective hair restraints. Other persons that may incidentally enter the processing areas shall comply with this requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Not store clothing or other personal belongings, eat food, drink beverages, chew gum, or use tobacco in any form in areas where food or food ingredients are exposed or in areas used for washing equipment or utensils.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Take any other necessary precautions to prevent contamination of foods with microorganisms or foreign substances including, but not limited to perspiration, hair, cosmetics, tobacco, chemicals, and medicants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Education and training. Personnel responsible for identifying sanitation failures or food contamination should have a background of education or experience, or a combination thereof, to provide a level of competency necessary for production of clean wholesome food. Food handlers and supervisors should receive appropriate training in proper food-handling techniques and food-protection principles and should be cognizant of the danger of poor personal hygiene and unsanitary practices, and other vectors of contamination.
