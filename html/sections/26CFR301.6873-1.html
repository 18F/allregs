                                Sec. 301.6873-1  Unpaid claims in bankruptcy or receivership
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If any portion of the claim allowed by the court in a  receivership proceeding, or in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act  (11 U.S.C. chs. 1-14) remains unpaid after the termination of such  proceeding, the district director will send notice and demand for  payment thereof to the taxpayer. Such unpaid portion with interest as  provided in section 6601 may be collected from the taxpayer by levy or  proceeding in court within the period of limitation for collection after  assessment. For the general rule as to such period of limitation, see  section 6502, and for suspension of the running of the period provided  in section 6502, see, for example, section 6503. For suspensions under  other provisions of law, see, for example, section 11f of the Bankruptcy  Act (11 U.S.C. 29(f)). Extension of time for the payment of such unpaid  amount may be granted in the same manner and subject to the same  provisions and limitations as provided in section 6161(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 6873 is applicable only where a claim for taxes is  allowed in a receivership proceeding or in a proceeding under the  Bankruptcy Act. Claims for taxes, interest, additional amounts, or  additions to the tax may be collectible in equity or under other  provisions of law although no claim was allowed in the proceeding  because,   for example, such items were not included in a proof of claim filed in  the proceeding or no proof of claim was filed. Except in the case of a  proceeding under section 77 or chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, a tax or  a liability in respect thereof is not discharged by a proceeding under  such act, whether or not a claim is filed in such proceeding, and  provisions suspending the running of the period of limitation on the  collection of taxes are applicable, whether or not a claim is filed in  such proceeding.</p><p class="depth2">Transferees and Fiduciaries</p>
