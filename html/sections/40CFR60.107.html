                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each owner or operator subject to Sec. 60.104(b) shall notify the Administrator of the specific provisions of Sec. 60.104(b) with which the owner or operator seeks to comply. Notification shall be submitted with the notification of initial startup required by Sec. 60.7(a)(3). If an owner or operator elects at a later date to comply with an alternative provision of Sec. 60.104(b), then the Administrator shall be notified by the owner or operator in the report described in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each owner or operator subject to Sec. 60.104(b) shall record and maintain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If subject to Sec. 60.104(b)(1),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All data and calibrations from continuous monitoring systems located at the inlet and outlet to the control device, including the results of the daily drift tests and quarterly accuracy assessments required under appendix F, Procedure 1;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Measurements obtained by supplemental sampling (refer to Sec. 60.105(a)(13) and Sec. 60.106(k)) for meeting minimum data requirements; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The written procedures for the quality control program required by appendix F, Procedure 1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If subject to Sec. 60.104(b)(2), measurements obtained in the daily Method 8 testing, or those obtained by alternative measurement methods, if Sec. 60.106(i)(12) applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If subject to Sec. 60.104(b)(3), data obtained from the daily feed sulfur tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each 7-day rolling average compliance determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each owner or operator subject to Sec. 60.104(b) shall submit a report except as provided by paragraph (d) of this section.

The average percent reduction and average sulfur dioxide concentration shall be determined using the procedures specified under Sec. 60.106(h);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The average emission rate of sulfur dioxide in the gases discharged to the atmosphere from any fluid catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerator for which the owner or operator seeks to comply with Sec. 60.104(b)(2) exceeds 9.8 kg SOX per 1,000 kg coke burn-off, as measured by the daily testing prescribed under Sec. 60.106(i). The average emission rate shall be determined using the procedures specified under Sec. 60.106(i); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The average sulfur content of the fresh feed for which the owner or operator seeks to comply with Sec. 60.104(b)(3) exceeds 0.30 percent by weight.

full span of the continuous monitoring system; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Description of any modifications to the continuous monitoring system that could affect the ability of the continuous monitoring system to comply with Performance Specifications 2 or 3.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Results of daily drift tests and quarterly accuracy assessments as required under appendix F, Procedure 1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If subject to Sec. 60.104(b)(2), for each day in which a Method 8 sample result required by Sec. 60.106(i) was not obtained, the date for which and brief explanation as to why a Method 8 sample result was not obtained, for approval by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If subject to Sec. 60.104(b)(3), for each 8-hour period in which a feed sulfur measurement required by Sec. 60.106(j) was not obtained, the date for which and brief explanation as to why a feed sulfur measurement was not obtained, for approval by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For any periods for which sulfur dioxide or oxides emissions data are not available, the owner or operator of the affected facility shall submit a signed statement indicating if any changes were made in operation of the emission control system during the period of data unavailability which could affect the ability of the system to meet the applicable emission limit. Operations of the control system and affected facility during periods of data unavailability are to be compared with operation of the control system and affected facility before and following the period of data unavailability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For each fuel gas stream combusted in a fuel gas combustion device subject to Sec. 60.104(a)(1), if an owner or operator determines that one of the exemptions listed in Sec. 60.105(a)(4)(iv) applies to that fuel gas stream, the owner or operator shall maintain records of the specific exemption chosen for each fuel gas stream. If the owner or operator applies for the exemption described in Sec. 60.105(a)(4)(iv)(D), the owner or operator must keep a copy of the application as well as the letter from the Administrator granting approval of the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The owner or operator of an affected facility shall submit the reports required under this subpart to the Administrator semiannually for each six-month period.
