                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">If you are participating in premium conversion you may change your  FEHB enrollment from self and family to self only under either of the  following circumstances:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> During the annual open season. A change to self only made during  the annual open season takes effect on the 1st day of the first pay  period that begins in the next year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Within 60 days after you have a qualifying life event. A change  to self only made because of a qualifying life event takes effect on the  first day of the first pay period that begins after the date your  employing office receives your appropriate request. Your change in  enrollment must be consistent with and correspond to your qualifying  life event. For example, if you get divorced and have no dependent  children, changing to self only would be consistent with that qualifying  life event. If both you and your spouse are Federal employees, and your  youngest dependent turns age 26, changing from a self and family to two  self only enrollments would be consistent and appropriate for that  event.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you are subject to a court or administrative order as  discussed in Sec. 890.301(g)(3) of this chapter, you may not change  your enrollment to self only as long as the court or administrative  order is still in effect and you have at least one child identified in  the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, unless you  provide documentation to your agency that you have other coverage for  your child   or children.
