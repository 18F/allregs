                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the requirements of subparts 101-42.2 through 101-42.4, drugs, biologicals, and reagents which are fit for human use shall be reported as provided in this Sec. 101-42.1102-5. Drugs, biologicals, and reagents that

are controlled substances are subject to the provisions of Sec. 101-42.1102-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Utilization requirements. Excess drugs, biologicals, and reagents shall be reported or otherwise made available to GSA as provided in Sec. 101-42.204 and subpart 101-43.3. Drugs, biologicals, and reagents other than controlled substances may be separately packaged or may be components of a drug kit. Drug kits shall be clearly labeled to identify components unfit for human use. The holding agency shall destroy, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, both separately packaged items and kit components which have been determined by the holding agency to be unfit for human use. However, items determined unfit because of expired shelf life may be transferred for animal experimental use on a case-by-case basis subject to prior approval by GSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Donation requirements. Surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents other than controlled substances which are not required to be destroyed as provided in paragraph (d) and which are not transferred pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section may be donated to eligible organizations as provided in subpart 101-42.3 and part 101-44. Drugs, biologicals, and reagents which are unfit for human use will not be offered for donation. However, items determined unfit because of expired shelf life may be donated for animal experimental use on a case-by-case basis subject to prior approval by GSA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents are considered for donation, a letter of clearance shall be obtained by the State agency or designated donee from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indicating that the items requested may be safely donated. The letter of clearance must accompany the SF 123. Items which do not fall within the purview of FDA, or which FDA indicates are unsuitable, will not be considered by GSA for donation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of obtaining the letter of clearance from FDA, the State agency or designated donee shall be responsible for obtaining samples from the holding agency, providing these samples to FDA, and ensuring the security of the samples while in transit. Before laboratory examinations are undertaken by FDA, an estimate of the expected cost of the quality assurance examination shall be furnished by FDA to the State agency or donee. Payment of any costs for laboratory examinations for quality assurance of samples shall be arranged by the State agency or donee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents requested for donation by State agencies shall not be transported by the State agency or stored in its warehouse prior to distribution to donees. Arrangements will be made by the State agency for the donee to make direct pickup at the holding agency after approval by GSA and after notification by the holding agency that the property is ready for pickup.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Standard Forms 123 from a State agency requesting surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents for donation shall not be processed or approved by GSA until it has been determined by the GSA donation representative that the specific donee is legally licensed to administer, dispense, store, or distribute such property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The SF 123 shall also contain a statement that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The property is being requested for donation to a specific donee whose complete name and address, including the name and telephone number of the donee's authorized representative, appear on the front of the SF 123 in block 12, and that a copy of the donee's license, registration, or other legal authorization to administer, dispense, store, or distribute such property is attached and made a part of the SF 123;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The items will be distributed only to institutions licensed and authorized to administer and dispense such items or to organizations authorized to store such items; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In addition to the normal certifications required to be executed by authorized representatives of donee institutions or organizations when property is acquired by donation, the State agency shall obtain a certification from the donee indicating that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The items transferred to the donee institution or organization will be safeguarded, dispensed, and administered under competent supervision;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Adequate facilities are available to effect full accountability and proper

storage of the items under the Federal, State, and local statutes governing their acquisition, storage, and accountability;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The administration or use of the items requested shall be in compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (21 U.S.C. 301-394).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sales requirements. Surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents other than controlled substances which are not required to be destroyed as provided in paragraph (d) and which are not transferred pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section may be offered for sale by sealed bid under the provisions of subparts 101-45.3 and 101-42.4. The following safeguards and instructions shall be observed to ensure stability, potency, and suitability of the product and its labeling for use in civilian channels:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before reporting the surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents to the selling agency pursuant to the provisions of Sec. Sec. 101-45.303 and 101-42.402, holding agencies shall request that an examination be made by the Field Scientific Coordination Staff, ACFA-CF-30, located in the appropriate FDA district office, of surplus unexpired drugs and reagents, having an acquisition cost of $500 or more per manufacturer's lot/batch number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When requesting such an examination, FDA requires the submission of a list and one sample of each of the drugs to be examined.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Additional samples may be requested if necessary for laboratory examination. Reimbursement for examination of the surplus drugs or reagents may be required by FDA. Before laboratory examinations are undertaken, FDA will give the inquiring agency an estimate of the expected costs. If, under subpart 101-45.9, the cost of the quality assurance is not justified by the value of the material involved, the lot or lots may be destroyed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The reporting document prescribed in Sec. 101-45.303(b) shall have attached to it a copy of the letter received by the reporting agency from FDA stating that the articles offered have been reviewed and may appropriately be distributed or sold, subject when necessary to specified limitations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents normally shall not be physically transferred to the selling agency but should remain at the holding agency for precautionary and safety measures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents shall be sold only to those entities which are legally qualified to engage in the sale, manufacture, or distribution of such items.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Sales of surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents other than controlled substances shall be processed as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The invitation for bids (IFB) shall:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Consist only of surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Contain the expiration date of material being offered for sale;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Describe the composition of the material being offered for sale;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Require the normal bid deposit prescribed in Sec. 101-45.304-10; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Contain the following special condition of sale:</p><p class="depth5">The bidder shall complete, sign, and return with his/her bid the certification as contained in this invitation. No award will be made or sale consummated until after this agency has determined that the bidder is legally licensed to engage in the manufacture, sale, or distribution of drugs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The following certification shall be made a part of the invitation for bids (and contract), to be completed and signed by the bidder, and returned with the bid with a copy of his/her license. Failure to sign the certification may result in the bid being rejected as nonresponsive.</p><p class="depth4">The bidder certifies that he/she is legally licensed to engage in the manufacture, sale, or distribution of drugs, and proof of his/her license to deal in such materials is furnished with this bid.
