                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you are using any add-on controls to meet an organic HAP  emissions limit in this subpart, you must conduct each performance test,  performance evaluation, and design evaluation in 40 CFR part 63, subpart  SS, that applies to you. The basic requirements for performance tests,  performance evaluations, and design evaluations are presented in Table 6  to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each performance test must be conducted according to the  requirements in Sec. 63.7(e)(1) and under the specific conditions that  40 CFR part 63, subpart SS, specifies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each performance evaluation must be conducted according to the  requirements in Sec. 63.8(e) as applicable and under the specific  conditions that 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS, specifies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may not conduct performance tests or performance evaluations  during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, as specified in  Sec. 63.7(e)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> through (5)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use either Method 1 or 1A of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as  appropriate, to select the sampling sites.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F or 2G of appendix A to 40 CFR part  60, as appropriate, to measure gas volumetric flow rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use Method 18 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 to measure organic  HAP emissions or use Method 25A of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 to  measure total gaseous organic emissions as a surrogate for total organic  HAP emissions. If you use Method 25A, you must assume that all gaseous  organic emissions measured as carbon are organic HAP emissions. If you  use Method 18 and the number of organic HAP in the exhaust stream  exceeds five, you must take into account the use of multiple  chromatographic columns and analytical techniques to get an accurate  measure of at least 90 percent of the total organic HAP mass emissions.  Do not use Method 18 to measure organic HAP emissions from a combustion  device; use instead Method 25A and assume that all gaseous organic mass  emissions measured as carbon are organic HAP emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em>  through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the target compound(s) is listed in Section 1.1 of ASTM  D6420-99 and the target concentration is between 150 parts per billion  by volume and 100 parts per million by volume.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the target compound(s) is not listed in Section 1.1 of ASTM  D6420-99, but is potentially detected by mass spectrometry, an  additional system continuing calibration check after each run, as  detailed in Section 10.5.3 of ASTM D6420-99, must be followed, met,  documented, and submitted with the performance test report even if you  do not use a moisture condenser or the compound is not considered  soluble.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a minimum of one sample/analysis cycle is completed at  least every 15 minutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Use the procedures in EPA Method 3B of appendix A to 40 CFR part  60 to determine an oxygen correction factor if required by Sec.  63.997(e)(2)(iii)(C). You may use American Society of Mechanical  Engineers (ASME) PTC 19-10-1981-Part 10 (available for purchase from  ASME, P.O. Box 2900, 22 Law Drive, Fairfield, New Jersey, 07007-2900, or  online at www.asme.org/catalog) as an alternative to EPA Method 3B of  appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The control device performance test must consist of three runs  and each run must last at least 1 hour. The production conditions during  the test runs must represent normal production conditions with respect  to the types of parts being made and material application methods. The  production conditions during the test must also represent maximum  potential emissions with respect to the organic HAP content of the  materials being applied and the material application rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If you are using a concentrator/oxidizer control device, you  must test the combined flow upstream of the concentrator, and the  combined outlet flow from both the oxidizer and the concentrator to  determine the overall control device efficiency. If the outlet flow from  the concentrator and oxidizer are exhausted in separate stacks, you must  test both stacks simultaneously with the inlet to the concentrator to  determine the overall control device efficiency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> During the test, you must also monitor and record separately the  amounts of production resin, tooling resin, pigmented gel coat, clear  gel coat, and tooling gel coat applied inside the enclosure that is  vented to the control device.</p>
