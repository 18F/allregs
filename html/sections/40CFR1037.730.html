                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If any of your vehicle families are certified using the ABT  provisions of this subpart, you must send an end-of-year report within  90 days after the end of the model year and a final report within 270  days after the end of the model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Your end-of-year and final reports must include the following  information for each vehicle family participating in the ABT program:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Vehicle-family and subfamily designations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The regulatory subcategory and emission standards that would  otherwise apply to the vehicle family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The FEL for each pollutant. If you change the FEL after the  start of production, identify the date that you started using the new  FEL and/or give the vehicle identification number for the first vehicle  covered by the new FEL. In this case, identify each applicable FEL and  calculate the positive or negative emission credits as specified in  Sec.  1037.225.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The projected and actual U.S.-directed production volumes for  the model year. If you changed an FEL during the model year, identify  the actual production volume associated with each FEL.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Useful life.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Calculated positive or negative emission credits for the whole  vehicle family. Identify any emission credits that you traded, as  described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If you have a negative credit balance for the averaging set in  the given model year, specify whether the vehicle family (or certain  subfamilies with the vehicle family) have a credit deficit for the year.  Consider for example, a manufacturer with three vehicle families (``A'',  ``B'', and ``C'') in a given averaging set. If family A generates enough  credits to offset the negative credits of family B but not enough to  also offset the negative credits of family C (and the manufacturer has  no banked credits in the averaging set), the manufacturer may designate  families A and B as having no deficit for the model year, provided it  designates family C as having a deficit for the model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Your end-of-year and final reports must include the following  additional information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Show that your net balance of emission credits from all your  participating vehicle families in each averaging set in the applicable  model year is not negative, except as allowed under Sec.  1037.745.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State whether you will reserve any emission credits for banking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> State that the report's contents are accurate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If you trade emission credits, you must send us a report within  90 days after the transaction, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As the seller, you must include the following information in  your report:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The corporate names of the buyer and any brokers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A copy of any contracts related to the trade.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The vehicle families that generated emission credits for the  trade, including the number of emission credits from each family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As the buyer, you must include the following information in your  report:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The corporate names of the seller and any brokers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A copy of any contracts related to the trade.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> How you intend to use the emission credits, including the  number of emission credits you intend to apply to each vehicle family  (if known).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Send your reports electronically to the Designated Compliance  Officer using an approved information format. If you want to use a  different format, send us a written request with justification for a  waiver.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Correct errors in your end-of-year report or final report as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may correct any errors in your end-of-year report when you  prepare the final report, as long as you send us the final report by the  time it is due.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you or we determine anytime that errors mistakenly increased  your balance of emission credits, you must correct the errors and  recalculate the balance of emission credits.</p>
