A physician shall be present on the premises when blood is being collected, except that blood may be collected when a physician is not present on the premises, provided the establishment (1) maintains on the premises, and files with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, a manual of standard procedures and methods, approved by the Director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, that shall be followed by employees who collect blood, and (2) maintains records indicating the name and qualifications of the person immediately in charge of the employees who collect blood when a physician is not present on the premises.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The donor center.

Blood containers and donor sets shall be pyrogen-free, sterile and identified by lot number. The amount of anticoagulant required for the quantity of blood to be collected shall be in the blood container when it is sterilized. In addition, all container and donor set surfaces that come in contact with blood used in the processing of Heparin Whole Blood shall be water repellent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The anticoagulant solution. The anticoagulant solution shall be sterile and pyrogen-free. Anticoagulant solutions shall be compounded and used according to a formula approved by the Director, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Donor identification. Each unit of blood shall be so marked or identified by number or other symbol as to relate it to the individual donor whose identity shall be established to the extent necessary for compliance with Sec. 640.3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Prevention of contamination of the blood. The skin of the donor at the site of phlebotomy shall be prepared thoroughly and carefully by a method that gives maximum assurance of a sterile container of blood. The blood shall be collected by aseptic methods in a sterile system which may be closed or may be vented if the vent protects the blood against contamination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Samples and segments for laboratory tests. Samples and segments for laboratory tests shall meet the following standards:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One or more segments shall be provided with each unit of blood when issued or reissued except as provided in Sec. 640.2(c)(2) and all segments shall be from the donor who is the source of the unit of blood.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All samples for laboratory tests performed by the manufacturer and all segments accompanying a unit of blood shall be collected at the time of filling the original blood container.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All containers for all samples shall bear the donor's identification before collecting the samples.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All segments accompanying a unit of blood shall be attached to the whole blood container before blood collection, in a tamperproof manner that will conspicuously indicate removal and reattachment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Segments for compatibility testing shall contain blood mixed with the appropriate anticoagulant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Storage. Whole Blood must be placed in storage at a temperature between 1 and 6 [deg]C immediately after collection unless the blood is to be further processed into another component or the blood must be transported from the donor center to the processing laboratory. If transported, the blood must be placed in temporary storage having sufficient refrigeration capacity to cool the blood continuously toward a temperature range between 1 and 10 [deg]C until arrival at the processing laboratory. At the processing laboratory, the blood must be stored at a temperature between 1 and 6 [deg]C. Blood from which a component is to be prepared must be held in an environment maintained at a temperature range specified for that component in the directions for use for

the blood collecting, processing, and storage system approved for such use by the Director, CBER.
