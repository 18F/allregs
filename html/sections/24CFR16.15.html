                            <p class="depth0">Whenever the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines it to be necessary and proper, with respect to any system of records maintained by the Department, to exercise the right to promulgate rules to exempt such systems in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k), each specific exemption, including the parts of each system to be exempted, the provisions of the Act from which they are exempted, and the justification for each exemption shall be published in the Federal Register as part of the Department's Notice of Systems of Records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), (I), and

(f). This exemption allows the Department to withhold records compiled for law enforcement purposes. The reasons for adopting this exemption are to prevent individuals, who are the subjects of investigation, from frustrating the investigatory process, to ensure the integrity of the investigatory process, to ensure the integrity of law enforcement activities, to prevent disclosure of investigative techniques, and to protect the confidentiality of sources of information. The names of systems correspond to those published in the Federal Register as part of the Department's Notice of Systems of Records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> HUD/DEPT-15. Equal Opportunity Housing Complaints.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> HUD/DEPT-24. Investigation Files in the Office of the Inspector General.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> HUD/DEPT-25. Legal Action Files.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552(k)(5) from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4), (G), (H), and (I), and (f). This exemption allows the Department to withhold records compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal contracts, or access to classified material. The reasons for adopting this exemption are to insure the proper functioning of the investigatory process, to insure effective determination of suitability, eligibility and qualification for employment and to protect the confidentiality of sources of information. The names of systems correspond to those published in the Federal Register as part of the Department's Notice of Systems of Records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> HUD/DEPT-24. Investigation Files in the Office of the Inspector General.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> HUD/DEPT-25. Legal Action Files.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The system of records entitled ``HUD/PIH-1. Tenant Eligibility Verification Files'' consists in part of investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes. Relevant records will be used by appropriate Federal, state or local agencies charged with the responsibility for investigating or prosecuting violations of law. Therefore, to the extent that information in the system falls within the coverage of subsection (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the system is exempt from the requirements of the following subsections of the Privacy Act, for the reasons stated below.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From subsection (c)(3) because release of an accounting of disclosures to an individual who may be the subject of an investigation could reveal the nature and scope of the investigation and could result in the altering or destruction of evidence, improper influencing of witnesses, and other evasive actions that could impede or compromise the investigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From subsection (d)(1) because release of the records to an individual who may become or has become the subject of an investigation could interfere with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings, constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties, reveal the identity of confidential sources, or reveal sensitive investigative techniques and procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> From subsection (d)(2) because amendment or correction of the records could interfere with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings, or could impose an impossible administrative and investigative burden by requiring the office that maintains the records to continuously retrograde its verifications of tenant eligibility attempting to resolve questions of accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> From subsection (e)(1) because it is often impossible to determine relevance or necessity of information in pre-investigative early stages. The value of such information is a question of judgment and timing; what appears relevant and necessary when collected may ultimately be evaluated and viewed as irrelevant and unnecessary to an investigation. In addition, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, or investigators, may obtain information concerning the violation of laws other than those within the scope of its jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, or investigators, should retain this information because it may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful activity and provide leads for other law enforcement agencies. Further, in obtaining the evidence, information may

be provided which relates to matters incidental to the main purpose of the inquiry or investigation but which may be pertinent to the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. Such information cannot readily be identified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The system of records entitled ``HUD/PIH-1. Tenant Eligibility Verification Files'' consists in part of material that may be used for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal civilian employment or Federal contracts, the release of which would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence. Therefore, to the extent that information in this system falls within the coverage of subsection (k)(5) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), the system is exempt from the requirements of the following subsection of the Privacy Act, for the reasons stated below.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From subsection (d)(1) because release would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise of confidentiality. Revealing the identity of a confidential source could impede future cooperation by sources, and could result in harassment or harm to such sources.
