                                Sec.  73.758  System specifications for digitally modulated emissions
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For digitally modulated emissions, the Digital Radio Mondiale  (DRM) standard shall be employed. Both digital audio broadcasting and  datacasting are authorized. The RF requirements for the DRM system are  specified in paragraphs (b) and (c), of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> System parameters--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Channel spacing. The initial spacing for  digitally modulated emissions shall be 10 kHz. However, interleaved  channels with a separation of 5 kHz may be used in accordance with the  appropriate protection criteria appearing in Resolution 543 (WRC-03),  provided that the interleaved emission is not to the same geographical  area as either of the emissions between which it is interleaved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Channel utilization. Channels using digitally modulated  emissions may share the same spectrum or be interleaved with analog  emissions in the same high frequency broadcasting (HFBC) band, provided  the protection afforded to the analog emissions is at least as great as  that which is currently in force for analog-to-analog protection.  Accomplishing this may require that the digital spectral power density  (and total power) be lower by several dB than is currently used for  either DSB or SSB emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Emission characteristics--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Bandwidth and center frequency. A  full digitally modulated emission will have a 10 kHz bandwidth with its  center frequency at any of the 5 kHz center frequency locations in the  channel raster currently in use within the HFBC bands. Among several  possible ``simulcast'' modes are those having a combination of analog  and digital emissions of the same program in the same channel, that may  use a digital emission of 5 kHz or 10 kHz bandwidth, next to either a 5  kHz or 10 kHz analog emission. In all cases of this type, the 5 kHz  interleaved raster used in HFBC shall be adhered to in placing the  emission within these bands.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, notes 1 and 2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Audio-frequency band. The quality of service, using digital  source coding within a 10 kHz bandwidth, taking into account the need to  adapt the emission coding for various levels of error avoidance,  detection and correction, can range from the equivalent of monophonic FM  (approximately 15 kHz) to the low-level performance of a speech codec  (of the order of 3 kHz). The choice of audio quality is connected to the  needs of the broadcaster and listener, and includes the consideration of  such characteristics as the propagation conditions expected. There is no  single specification, only the upper and lower bounds noted in this  paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Modulation. Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) with  orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) shall be used. 64-QAM  is feasible under many propagation conditions; others such as 32-, 16-  and 8-QAM are specified for use when needed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> RF protection ratio values. The protection ratio values for  analogue and digital emissions for co-channel and adjacent channel  conditions shall be in accordance with Resolution 543 (WRC-03) as  provisional RF protection ratio values subject to revision or  confirmation by a future competent conference.
