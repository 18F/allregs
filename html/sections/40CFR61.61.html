                            <p class="depth0">Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Act, in subpart A of  this part, or in this section as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ethylene dichloride plant includes any plant which produces  ethylene dichloride by reaction of oxygen and hydrogen chloride with  ethylene.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Vinyl chloride plant includes any plant which produces vinyl  chloride by any process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plant includes any plant where vinyl  chloride alone or in combination with other materials is polymerized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Slip gauge means a gauge which has a probe that moves through  the gas/liquid interface in a storage or transfer vessel and indicates  the level of vinyl chloride in the vessel by the physical state of the  material the gauge discharges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Type of resin means the broad classification of resin referring  to the basic manufacturing process for producing that resin, including,  but not limited to, the suspension, dispersion, latex, bulk, and  solution processes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Grade of resin means the subdivision of resin classification  which describes it as a unique resin, i.e., the most exact description  of a resin with no further subdivision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Dispersion resin means a resin manufactured in such a way as to  form fluid dispersions when dispersed in a plasticizer or plasticizer/ diluent mixtures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Latex resin means a resin which is produced by a polymerization  process which initiates from free radical catalyst sites and is sold  undried.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Bulk resin means a resin which is produced by a polymerization  process in which no water is used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Inprocess wastewater means any water which, during manufacturing  or processing, comes into direct contact with vinyl chloride or  polyvinyl chloride or results from the production or use of any raw  material, intermediate product, finished product, by-product,   or waste product containing vinyl chloride or polyvinyl chloride but  which has not been discharged to a wastewater treatment process or  discharged untreated as wastewater. Gasholder seal water is not  inprocess wastewater until it is removed from the gasholder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Wastewater treatment process includes any process which modifies  characteristics such as BOD, COD, TSS, and pH, usually for the purpose  of meeting effluent guidelines and standards; it does not include any  process the purpose of which is to remove vinyl chloride from water to  meet requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> In vinyl chloride service means that a piece of equipment either  contains or contacts a liquid that is at least 10 percent vinyl chloride  by weight or a gas that is at least 10 percent by volume vinyl chloride  as determined according to the provisions of Sec. 61.67(h). The  provisions of Sec. 61.67(h) also specify how to determine that a piece  of equipment is not in vinyl chloride service. For the purposes of this  subpart, this definition must be used in place of the definition of ``in  VHAP service'' in subpart V of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Standard operating procedure means a formal written procedure  officially adopted by the plant owner or operator and available on a  routine basis to those persons responsible for carrying out the  procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Run means the net period of time during which an emission sample  is collected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Ethylene dichloride purification includes any part of the  process of ethylene dichloride purification following ethylene  dichloride formation, but excludes crude, intermediate, and final  ethylene dichloride storage tanks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Vinyl chloride purification incudes any part of the process of  vinyl chloride production which follows vinyl chloride formation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Reactor includes any vessel in which vinyl chloride is partially  or totally polymerized into polyvinyl chloride.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Reactor opening loss means the emissions of vinyl chloride  occurring when a reactor is vented to the atmosphere for any purpose  other than an emergency relief discharge as defined in Sec. 61.65(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Stripper includes any vessel in which residual vinyl chloride is  removed from polyvinyl chloride resin, except bulk resin, in the slurry  form by the use of heat and/or vacuum. In the case of bulk resin,  stripper includes any vessel which is used to remove residual vinyl  chloride from polyvinyl chloride resin immediately following the  polymerization step in the plant process flow.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> Standard temperature means a temperature of 20 C (69 F).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> Standard pressure means a pressure of 760 mm of Hg (29.92 in. of  Hg).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(v)</em> Relief valve means each pressure relief device including  pressure relief valves, rupture disks and other pressure relief systems  used to protect process components from overpressure conditions.  ``Relief valve'' does not include polymerization shortstop systems,  referigerated water systems or control valves or other devices used to  control flow to an incinerator or other air pollution control device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(w)</em> Leak means any of several events that indicate interruption of  confinement of vinyl chloride within process equipment. Leaks include  events regulated under subpart V of this part such as:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An instrument reading of 10,000 ppm or greater measured  according to Method 21 (see appendix A of 40 CFR part 60);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A sensor detection of failure of a seal system, failure of a  barrier fluid system, or both;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Detectable emissions as indicated by an instrument reading of  greater than 500 ppm above background for equipment designated for no  detectable emissions measured according to Method 21 (see appendix A of  40 CFR part 60); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the case of pump seals regulated under Sec. 61.242-2,  indications of liquid dripping constituting a leak under Sec. 61.242-2.  Leaks also include events regulated under Sec. 61.65(b)(8)(i) for  detection of ambient concentrations in excess of background  concentrations. A relief valve discharge is not a leak.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(x)</em> Exhaust gas means any offgas (the constituents of which may  consist of any fluids, either as a liquid and/or gas) discharged  directly or ultimately to   the atmosphere that was initially contained in or was in direct contact  with the equipment for which gas limits are prescribed in Secs. 61.62(a)  and (b); 61.63(a); 61.64 (a)(1), (b), (c), and (d); 61.65 (b)(1)(ii),  (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(5), (b)(6)(ii), (b)(7), and (b)(9)(ii); and  61.65(d). A leak as defined in paragraph (w) of this section is not an  exhaust gas. Equipment which contains exhaust gas is subject to  Sec. 61.65(b)(8), whether or not that equipment contains 10 percent by  volume vinyl chloride.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(y)</em> Relief valve discharge means any nonleak discharge through a  relief valve.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(z)</em> 3-hour period means any three consecutive 1-hour periods (each  commencing on the hour), provided that the number of 3-hour periods  during which the vinyl chloride concentration exceeds 10 ppm does not  exceed the number of 1-hour periods during which the vinyl chloride  concentration exceeds 10 ppm.
