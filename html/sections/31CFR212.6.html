                            <p class="depth0">The following provisions apply if an account review shows that a  benefit agency deposited a benefit payment into an account during the  lookback period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Protected amount. The financial institution shall immediately  calculate and establish the protected amount for an account. The  financial institution shall ensure that the account holder has full and  customary access to the protected amount, which the financial  institution shall not freeze in response to the garnishment order. An  account holder shall have no requirement to assert any right of  garnishment exemption prior to accessing the protected amount in the  account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Separate protected amounts. The financial institution shall  calculate and establish the protected amount separately for each account  in the name of an account holder, consistent with the requirements in  Sec. 212.5(f) to conduct distinct account reviews.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No challenge of protection. A protected amount calculated and  established by a financial institution pursuant to this section shall be  conclusively considered to be exempt from garnishment under law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Funds in excess of the protected amount. For any funds in an  account in excess of the protected amount, the financial institution  shall follow its otherwise customary procedures for handling garnishment  orders, including the freezing of funds, but consistent with paragraphs  (f) and (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice. The financial institution shall issue a notice to the  account holder named in the garnishment order, in accordance with Sec.  212.7.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> One-time account review process. The financial institution shall  perform the account review only one time upon the first service of a  given garnishment order. The financial institution shall not repeat the  account review or take any other action related to the order if the same  order is subsequently served again upon the financial institution. If  the financial institution is subsequently served a new or different  garnishment order against the same account holder, the financial  institution shall perform a separate and new account review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> No continuing or periodic garnishment responsibilities. The  financial institution shall not continually garnish amounts deposited or  credited to the account following the date of account review, and shall  take no action to freeze any funds subsequently deposited or credited,  unless the institution is served with a new or different garnishment  order, consistent with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Impermissible garnishment fee. The financial institution may not  charge or collect a garnishment fee against a protected amount. The  financial institution may charge or collect a garnishment fee up to five  business days after the account review if funds other than a benefit  payment are deposited to the account within this period, provided that  the fee may not exceed the amount of the non-benefit deposited funds.
