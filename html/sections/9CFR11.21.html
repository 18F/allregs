                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the preshow inspection, the DQP shall direct the  custodian of the horse to walk and turn the horse in a manner that  allows the DQP to determine whether the horse exhibits signs of  soreness. The DQP shall determine whether the horse moves in a free and  easy manner and is free of any signs of soreness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The DQP shall digitally palpate the front limbs of the horse  from knee to hoof, with particular emphasis on the pasterns and  fetlocks. The DQP shall examine the posterior surface of the pastern by  picking up the foot and examining the posterior (flexor) surface. The  DQP shall apply digital pressure to the pocket (sulcus), including the  bulbs of the heel, and continue the   palpation to the medial and lateral surfaces of the pastern, being  careful to observe for responses to pain in the horse. While continuing  to hold onto the pastern, the DQP shall extend the foot and leg of the  horse to examine the front (extensor) surfaces, including the coronary  band. The DQP may examine the rear limbs of all horses inspected after  showing, and may examine the rear limbs of any horse examined preshow or  on the showgrounds when he deems it necessary, except that the DQP shall  examine the rear limbs of all horses exhibiting lesions on, or unusual  movement of, the rear legs. While carrying out the procedures set forth  in this paragraph, the DQP shall also inspect the horse to determine  whether the provisions of Sec. 11.3 of this part are being complied  with, and particularly whether there is any evidence of inflammation,  edema, or proliferating granuloma tissue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The DQP shall observe and inspect all horses for compliance with  the provisions set forth in Sec. 11.2(a) through Sec. 11.2(c) of this  part. All action devices, pads, and other equipment shall be observed  and/or examined to assure that they are in compliance with the  regulations. All such equipment on horses examined postshow, and on  horses examined preshow that are not clearly in compliance, shall be  weighed and/or measured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The DQP shall instruct the custodian of the horse to control it  by holding the reins approximately 18 inches from the bit shank. The DQP  shall not be required to examine a horse if it is presented in a manner  that might cause the horse not to react to a DQP's examination, or if  whips, cigarette smoke, or other actions or paraphernalia are used to  distract a horse during examination. All such incidents shall be  reported to the show management and the DQP licensing organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The DQP shall inspect horses no more than three classes ahead of  the time the inspected horses are to be shown, except that, in shows  with fewer than 150 horses, the DQP shall inspect horses no more than 2  classes ahead of the time the inspected horses are to be shown.  Inspected horses shall be held in a designated area that is under  observation by the DQP or APHIS representative. Horses shall not be  permitted to leave the designated area before showing. Only the horse,  the rider, the groom, the trainer, the DQP(s) and APHIS representatives  shall be allowed in the designated area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The DQP may carry out additional inspection procedures as he  deems necessary to determine whether the horse is sore.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The HIO that licensed the DQP shall assess and enforce penalties  for violations in accordance with Sec. 11.25 and shall report all  violations in accordance with Sec. 11.20(b)(3).
