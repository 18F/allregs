                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Losses not allowed. A loss sustained on the sale of residential property purchased or constructed by the taxpayer for use as his personal residence and so used by him up to the time of the sale is not deductible under section 165(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Property converted from personal use. (1) If property purchased or constructed by the taxpayer for use as his personal residence is, prior to its sale, rented or otherwise appropriated to income-producing purposes and is used for such purposes up to the time of its sale, a loss sustained on the sale of the property shall be allowed as a deduction under section 165(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If property purchased or constructed by the taxpayer for use as his personal residence is, prior to its sale, rented or otherwise appropriated to income-producing purposes and is used for such purposes up to the time of its sale, a loss sustained on the sale of the property shall be allowed as a deduction under section 165(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The loss allowed under this paragraph upon the sale of the property shall be the excess of the adjusted basis prescribed in Sec. 1.1011-1 for determining loss over the amount realized from the sale. For this purpose, the adjusted basis for determining loss shall be the lesser of either of the following amounts, adjusted as prescribed in Sec. 1.1011-1 for the period subsequent to the conversion of the property to income-producing purposes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The fair market value of the property at the time of conversion, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The adjusted basis for loss, at the time of conversion, determined under Sec. 1.1011-1 but without reference to the fair market value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For rules relating to casualty losses of property converted from personal use, see paragraph (a)(5) of Sec. 1.165-7. To determine the basis for depreciation in the case of such property, see Sec. 1.167(g)-1. For limitations on the loss from the sale of a capital asset, see paragraph (c)(3) of Sec. 1.165-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The application of paragraph (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Residential property is purchased by the taxpayer in 1943 for use as his personal residence at a cost of $25,000, of which $15,000 is allocable to the building. The taxpayer uses the property as his personal residence until January 1, 1952, at which time its fair market value is $22,000, of which $12,000 is allocable to the building. The taxpayer rents the property from January 1, 1952, until January 1, 1955, at which time it is sold for $16,000. On January 1, 1952, the building has an estimated useful life of 20 years. It is assumed that the building has no estimated salvage value and that there are no adjustments in respect of basis other than depreciation, which is computed on the straight-line method. The loss to be taken into account for purposes of section 165(a) for the taxable year 1955 is $4,200, computed as follows:

See example (2) of this paragraph wherein the adjusted basis of the building is required to be used for such purpose.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Residential property is purchased by the taxpayer in 1940 for use as his personal residence at a cost of $23,000, of which $10,000 is allocable to the building. The taxpayer uses the property as his personal residence until January 1, 1953, at which time its fair market value is $20,000, of which $12,000 is allocable to the building. The taxpayer rents the property from January 1, 1953, until January 1, 1957, at which time it is sold for $17,000. On January 1, 1953, the building has an estimated useful life of 20 years. It is assumed that the building has no estimated salvage value and that there are no adjustments in respect of basis other than depreciation, which is computed on the straight-line method. The loss to be taken into account for purposes of section 165(a) for the taxable year 1957 is $1,000, computed as follows:
Basis of property at time of conversion for purposes of this     $20,000</p><p class="depth2">section (that is, the lesser of $23,000 cost or $20,000 fair</p><p class="depth2">market value)................................................Less: Depreciation allowable from January 1, 1953, to January      2,000</p><p class="depth2">1, 1957 (4 years at 5 percent based on $10,000, the cost of</p><p class="depth2">the building, as prescribed by Sec. 1.167(g)-1.............</p><p class="depth2">---------</p><p class="depth2">Adjusted basis prescribed in Sec. 1.1011-1 for determining     $18,000</p><p class="depth2">loss on sale of the property.................................Less: Amount realized on sale.................................    17,000</p><p class="depth2">---------</p><p class="depth2">Loss to be taken into account for purposes of section 165(a)..     1,000</p><p class="depth2">[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6712, 29 FR 3652, Mar. 24, 1964]</p>
