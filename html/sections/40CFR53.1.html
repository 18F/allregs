some combination thereof, is performed manually. A method for PM 10 or PM 2.5 which utilizes a sampler that requires manual preparation, loading, and weighing of filter samples is considered a manual method even though the sampler may be capable of automatically collecting a series of sequential samples.</p><p class="depth2">NO means nitrogen oxide.</p><p class="depth2">NO2 means nitrogen dioxide.</p><p class="depth2">NOX means oxides of nitrogen and is defined as the sum of the concentrations of NO2 and NO.</p><p class="depth2">O3 means ozone.</p><p class="depth2">Operated simultaneously means that two or more collocated samplers or analyzers are operated concurrently with no significant difference in the start time, stop time, and duration of the sampling or measurement period.</p><p class="depth2">Pb means lead.</p><p class="depth2">PM means PM 10, PM 10C, PM 2.5, PM 10-2.5, or particulate matter of unspecified size range.</p><p class="depth2">PM2.5 means particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 micrometers as measured by a reference method based on appendix L of part 50 of this chapter and designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter, by an equivalent method designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter, or by an approved regional method designated in accordance with appendix C to this part.</p><p class="depth2">PM10 means particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers as measured by a reference method based on appendix J of part 50 of this chapter and designated in accordance with this part or by an equivalent method designated in accordance with this part.</p><p class="depth2">PM10C means particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers as measured by a reference method based on appendix O of part 50 of this chapter and designated in accordance with this part or by an equivalent method designated in accordance with this part.</p><p class="depth2">PM10	2.5 means particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers and greater than a nominal 2.5 micrometers as measured by a reference method based on appendix O to part 50 of this chapter and designated in accordance with this part or by an equivalent method designated in accordance with this part.</p><p class="depth2">PM2.5 sampler means a device, associated with a manual method for measuring PM 2.5, designed to collect PM 2.5 from an ambient air sample, but lacking the ability to automatically analyze or measure the collected sample to determine the mass concentrations of PM 2.5 in the sampled air.</p><p class="depth2">PM10 sampler means a device, associated with a manual method for measuring PM 10, designed to collect PM 10 from an ambient air sample, but lacking the ability to automatically analyze or measure the collected sample to determine the mass concentrations of PM 10 in the sampled air.</p><p class="depth2">PM10C sampler means a PM 10 sampler that meets the special requirements for a PM 10C sampler that is part of a PM 10-2.5 reference method sampler, as specified in appendix O to part 50 of this chapter, or a PM 10 sampler that is part of a PM 10-2.5 sampler that has been designated as an equivalent method for PM 10-2.5.</p><p class="depth2">PM10	2.5 sampler means a sampler, or a collocated pair of samplers, associated with a manual method for measuring PM 10-2.5 and designed to collect either PM 10-2.5 directly or PM 10C and PM 2.5 separately and simultaneously from concurrent ambient air samples, but lacking the ability to automatically analyze or measure the collected sample(s) to determine the mass concentrations of PM 10-2.5 in the sampled air.</p><p class="depth2">Sequential samples for PM samplers means two or more PM samples for sequential (but not necessarily contiguous) time periods that are collected automatically by the same sampler without the need for intervening operator service.</p><p class="depth2">SO2 means sulfur dioxide.</p><p class="depth2">Test analyzer means an analyzer subjected to testing as part of a candidate method in accordance with subparts B, C, D, E, or F of this part, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2">Test sampler means a PM 10 sampler, PM 2.5 sampler, or PM 10-2.5 sampler subjected to testing as part of a candidate method in accordance with subparts C, D, E, or F of this part.</p><p class="depth2">Ultimate purchaser means the first person or entity who purchases a Federal reference method or a Federal equivalent method for purposes other than resale.
