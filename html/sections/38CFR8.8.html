If the insurance to be reinstated was issued under 38 U.S.C. 1925(a) and application is made within 1 year of the date of lapse, any nonservice-connected disability, or service-connected disability which combined with a non-service-connected disability rendered the insured uninsurable as of October 13, 1964, will be waived for the purpose of reinstatement (including natural progression).
