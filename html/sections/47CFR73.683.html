                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the authorization of TV stations, two field strength contours  are considered. These are specified as Grade A and Grade B and indicate  the approximate extent of coverage over average terrain in the absence  of interference from other television stations. Under actual conditions,  the true coverage may vary greatly from these estimates because the  terrain over any specific path is expected to be different from the  average terrain on which the field strength charts were based. The  required field strength, F (50,50), in dB above one micro-volt per meter  (dBu) for the Grade A and Grade B contours are as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Grade A     Grade B</p><p class="depth2"><em>(dBu)</em>       (dBu) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Channels 2-6....................................          68          47 Channels 7-13...................................          71          56 Channels 14-69..................................          74          64 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It should be realized that the F (50,50) curves when used for  Channels 14-69 are not based on measured data at distances beyond about  48.3 kilometers (30 miles). Theory would indicate that the field  strengths for Channels 14-69 should decrease more rapidly with distance  beyond the horizon than for Channels 2-6, and modification of the curves  for Channels 14-69 may be expected as a result of measurements to be  made at a later date. For these reasons, the curves should be used with  appreciation of their limitations in estimating levels of field  strength. Further, the actual extent of service will usually be less  than indicated by these estimates due to interference from other  stations. Because of these factors, the predicted field strength  contours give no assurance of service to any specific percentage of  receiver locations within the distances indicated. In licensing  proceedings these variations will not be considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The field strength contours will be considered for the following  purposes only:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the estimation of coverage resulting from the selection of a  particular transmitter site by an applicant for a TV station.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In connection with problems of coverage arising out of  application of Sec.  73.3555.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In determining compliance with Sec.  73.685(a) concerning the  minimum field strength to be provided over the principal community to be  served.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(10)(A)</em>, field strength  shall be determined by the Individual Location Longley-Rice (ILLR)  propagation prediction model. Such eligibility determinations shall  consider only the signals of network stations located in the  subscriber's Designated Market Area. Guidance for use of the ILLR model  in predicting the field strength of analog television signals for such  determinations is provided in OET Bulletin No. 72 (stations operating  with analog signals include some Class A stations licensed under part 73  of this chapter and some licensed low power TV and TV translator  stations that operate under part 74 of this chapter). Guidance for use  of the ILLR model in predicting the field strength of digital television  signals for such determinations is provided in OET Bulletin No. 73  (stations operating with digital signals include all full service  stations and some Class A stations that operate under part 73 of this  chapter and some low power TV and TV translator stations that operate  under Part 74 of this chapter). OET Bulletin No. 72 and OET Bulletin No.  73 are available at the FCC's Headquarters Building, 445 12th St., SW.,  Reference Information Center, Room CY-A257, Washington, DC, or at the  FCC's Office of Engineering and Technology (OET) Web site: http:// www.fcc.gov/oet/info/documents/bulletins/.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a location was predicted to be unserved by a local network  station using a version of the ILLR model specified in OET Bulletin No.  72 or OET Bulletin No. 73, as appropriate, and the satellite subscriber  at that location is receiving a distant signal affiliated with the same  network from its satellite provider, the satellite subscriber shall  remain eligible for receiving the   distant signal from its satellite provider if that location is  subsequently predicted to be served by the local station due to either a  change in the ILLR model or a change in the station's operations that  change its coverage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em>.
