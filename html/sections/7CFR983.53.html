Handlers who handle less than 1 million pounds of  assessed weight per year have the option of utilizing both of the  following methods for testing for aflatoxin:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The handler may have an inspector sample and test his or her  entire inventory of hulled and dried pistachios for the aflatoxin  certification before further processing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The handler may segregate receipts into various lots at the  handler's discretion and have an inspector sample and test each specific  lot. Any lots that are found to have less aflatoxin than the level  established by the committee and approved by the Secretary can be  certified by an inspector to be negative as to aflatoxin. Any lots that  are found to have aflatoxin exceeding the level established by the  committee and approved by the Secretary may be tested after reworking in  the same manner as specified in Sec. 983.52.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Quality. The committee may, with the approval of the Secretary,  establish regulations regarding the testing of minimal quantities of  pistachios for quality.
