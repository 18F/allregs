                            <p class="depth0">IRPs, small customer plans, minimum investment reports and EE/RE  reports and associated data submitted to Western are subject to the  Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and may be made available to the  public upon request. IRPs must be posted on a customer's publicly  available Web site or on Western's Web site. Customers posting their  IRPs on their own Web site must notify Western of this decision when  they submit their IRP. A hotlink on Western's Web site to IRPs posted on  customer Web sites gives interested parties ready access to those IRPs.  Western will post on its Web site the IRPs of customers that do not post  on their own Web sites. Prior to posting, Western will provide the  customer the opportunity to submit its views on whether information  contained in the IRP is exempt from the FOIA's mandatory public  disclosure requirements. Customers may request confidential treatment of  all or part of a submitted document consistent with FOIA exemptions.  Western will determine whether particular information is exempt from  public access. Western will not disclose to the public information it  has determined to be exempt, recognizing that certain competition- related customer information may be proprietary.
