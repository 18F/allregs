                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. As used in part I (section 861 and following) and  part II (section 871 and following), subchapter N, chapter 1 of the  Code, and chapter 3 (section 1441 and following) of the Code, and the  regulations thereunder, the term ``engaged in trade or business within  the United States'' does not include the activities described in  paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, but includes the performance of  personal services within the United States at any time within the  taxable year except to the extent otherwise provided in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Performance of personal services for foreign employer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Excepted services. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the  term ``engaged in trade or business within the United States'' does not  include the performance of personal services--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For a nonresident alien individual, foreign partnership, or  foreign corporation, not engaged in trade or business within the United  States at any time during the taxable year, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For an office or place of business maintained in a foreign  country or in a possession of the United States by an individual who is  a citizen or resident of the United States or by a domestic partnership  or a domestic corporation, by a nonresident alien individual who is  temporarily present in the United States for a period or periods not  exceeding a total of 90 days during the taxable year and whose  compensation for such services does not exceed in the aggregate gross  amount of $3,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rules of application. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> As a general rule, the term ``day'',  as used in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, means a calendar day  during any portion of which the nonresident alien individual is  physically present in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Solely for purposes of applying this paragraph, the nonresident  alien individual, foreign partnership, or foreign corporation for which  the nonresident alien individual is performing personal services in the  United States shall not be considered to be engaged in trade or business  in the United States by reason of the performance of such services by  such individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In applying subparagraph (1) of this paragraph it is  immaterial whether the services performed by the nonresident alien  individual are performed as an employee for his employer or under any  form of contract with the person for whom the services are performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In determining for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph whether compensation received by the nonresident alien  individual exceeds in the aggregate a gross amount of $3,000, any  amounts received by the individual   from an employer as advances or reimbursements for travel expenses  incurred on behalf of the employer shall be omitted from the  compensation received by the individual, to the extent of expenses  incurred, where he was required to account and did account to his  employer for such expenses and has met the tests for such accounting  provided in Sec. 1.162-17 and paragraph (e)(4) of Sec. 1.274-5. If  advances or reimbursements exceed such expenses, the amount of the  excess shall be included as compensation for personal services for  purposes of such subparagraph. Pensions and retirement pay attributable  to personal services performed in the United States are not to be taken  into account for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> See section 7701(a)(5) and Sec. 301.7701-5 of this chapter  (Procedure and Administration Regulations) for the meaning of  ``foreign'' when applied to a corporation or partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> As to the source of compensation for personal services, see  Sec. Sec. 1.861-4 and 1.862-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Illustrations. The application of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. During 1967, A, a nonresident alien individual, is  employed by the London office of a domestic partnership. A, who uses the  calendar year as his taxable year, is temporarily present in the United  States during 1967 for 60 days performing personal service in the United  States for the London office of the partnership and is paid by that  office a total gross salary of $2,600 for such services. During 1967, A  is not engaged in trade or business in the United States solely by  reason of his performing such personal services for the London office of  the domestic partnership.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that A's  total gross salary for the services performed in the United States  during 1967 amounts to $3,500, of which $2,625 is received in 1967 and  $875 is received in 1968. During 1967, is engaged in trade or business  in the United States by reason of his performance of personal services  in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Trading in stocks or securities. For purposes of paragraph (a)  of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term ``engaged in trade or business within the  United States'' does not include the effecting of transactions in the  United States in stocks or securities through a resident broker,  commission agent, custodian, or other independent agent. This  subparagraph shall apply to any taxpayer, including a broker or dealer  in stocks or securities, except that it shall not apply if at any time  during the taxable year the taxpayer has an office or other fixed place  of business in the United States through which, or by the direction of  which, the transactions in stocks or securities are effected. The volume  of stock or security transactions effected during the taxable year shall  not be taken into account in determining under this subparagraph whether  the taxpayer is engaged in trade or business within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Trading for taxpayer's own account--(i) In general. The term  ``engaged in trade or business within the United States'' does not  include the effecting of transactions in the United States in stocks or  securities for the taxpayer's own account, irrespective of whether such  transactions are effected by or through--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The taxpayer himself while present in the United States,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Employees of the taxpayer, whether or not such employees are  present in the United States while effecting the transactions, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A broker, commission agent, custodian, or other agent of the  taxpayer, whether or not such agent while effecting the transactions is  (1) dependent or independent, or (2) resident, nonresident, or present,  in the United States, and irrespective of whether any such employee or  agent has discretionary authority to make decisions in effecting such  transactions. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``securities''  means any note, bond, debenture, or other evidence of indebtedness, or  any evidence of an interest in or right to subscribe to or purchase any  of the foregoing; and the effecting of transactions in stocks or  securities includes buying, selling (whether or not by entering into  short sales), or trading in stocks, securities, or contracts or options  to buy or sell stocks or securities, on margin or otherwise, for the  account and risk of the taxpayer, and any other activity closely related  thereto (such as obtaining credit for   the purpose of effectuating such buying, selling, or trading). The  volume of stock of security transactions effected during the taxable  year shall not be taken into account in determining under this  subparagraph whether the taxpayer is engaged in trade or business within  the United States. The application of this subdivision may be  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A, a nonresident alien individual who is not a dealer in  stocks or securities, authorizes B, an individual resident of the United  States, as his agent to effect transactions in the United States in  stocks and securities for the account of A. B is empowered with complete  authority to trade in stocks and securities for the account of A and to  use his own discretion as to when to buy or sell for A's account. This  grant of discretionary authority from A to B is also communicated in  writing by A to various domestic brokerage firms through which A  ordinarily effects transactions in the United States in stocks or  securities. Under the agency arrangement B has the authority to place  orders with the brokers, and all confirmations are to be made by the  brokers to B, subject to his approval. The brokers are authorized by A  to make payments to B and to charge such payments to the account of A.  In addition, B is authorized to obtain and advance the necessary funds,  if any, to maintain credits with the brokerage firms. Pursuant to his  authority B carries on extensive trading transactions in the United  States during the taxable year through the various brokerage firms for  the account of A. During the taxable year A makes several visits to the  United States in order to discuss with B various aspects of his trading  activities and to make necessary changes in his trading policy. A is not  engaged in trade or business within the United States during the taxable  year solely because of the effecting by B of transactions in the United  States in stocks or securities during such year for the account of A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Partnerships. A nonresident alien individual, foreign  partnership, foreign estate, foreign trust, or foreign corporation shall  not be considered to be engaged in trade or business within the United  States solely because such person is a member of a partnership (whether  domestic or foreign) which, pursuant to discretionary authority granted  to such partnership by such person, effects transactions in the United  States in stocks or securities for the partnership's own account or  solely because an employee of such partnership, or a broker, commission  agent, custodian, or other agent, pursuant to discretionary authority  granted by such partnership, effects transactions in the United States  in stocks or securities for the account of such partnership. This  subdivision shall not apply, however, to any member of (a) a partnership  which is a dealer in stocks or securities or (b) a partnership (other  than a partnership in which, at any time during the last half of its  taxable year, more than 50 percent of either the capital interest or the  profits interest is owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer  partners who are individuals) the principal business of which is trading  in stocks or securities for its own account, if the principal office of  such partnership is in the United States at any time during the taxable  year. The principles of subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph for  determining whether a foreign corporation has its principal office in  the United States shall apply in determining under this subdivision  whether a partnership has its principal office in the United States. See  section 707(b)(3) and paragraph (b)(3) of Sec. 1.707-1 for rules for  determining the extent of the ownership by a partner of a capital  interest or profits interest in a partnership. The application of this  subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. B, a nonresident alien individual, is a member of  partnership X, the members of which are U.S. citizens, nonresident alien  individuals, and foreign corporations. The principal business of  partnership X is trading in stocks or securities for its own account.  Pursuant to discretionary authority granted by B, partnership X effects  transactions in the United States in stocks or securities for its own  account. Partnership X is not a dealer in stocks or securities, and more  than 50 percent of either the capital interest or the profits interest  in partnership X is owned throughout its taxable year by five or fewer  partners who are individuals. B is not engaged in trade or business  within the United States solely by reason of such effecting of  transactions in the United States in stocks or securities by partnership  X for its own account.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that not  more than 50 percent of either the capital interest or the profits  interest in partnership X is owned throughout the taxable year by five  or fewer   partners who are individuals. However, partnership X does not maintain  its principal office in the United States at any time during the taxable  year. B is not engaged in trade or business within the United States  solely by reason of the trading in stocks or securities by partnership X  for its own account.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that,  pursuant to discretionary authority granted by partnership X, domestic  broker D effects transactions in the United States in stocks or  securities for the account of partnership X. B is not engaged in trade  or business in the United States solely by reason of such trading in  stocks or securities for the account of partnership X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Dealers in stocks or securities and certain foreign  corporations. This subparagraph shall not apply to the effecting of  transactions in the United States for the account of (a) a dealer in  stocks or securities or (b) a foreign corporation (other than a  corporation which is, or but for section 542(c)(7) or 543(b)(1)(C) would  be, a personal holding company) the principal business of which is  trading in stocks or securities for its own account, if the principal  office of such corporation is in the United States at any time during  the taxable year. Whether a foreign corporation's principal office is in  the United States for this purpose is to be determined by comparing the  activities (other than trading in stocks or securities) which the  corporation conducts from its office or other fixed place of business  located in the United States with the activities it conducts from its  offices or other fixed places of business located outside the United  States. For purposes of this subdivision, a foreign corporation is  considered to have only one principal office, and an office of such  corporation will not be considered to be its principal office merely  because it is a statutory office of such corporation. For example, a  foreign corporation which carries on most or all of its investment  activities in the United States but maintains a general business office  or offices outside the United States in which its management is located  will not be considered as having its principal office in the United  States if all or a substantial portion of the following functions is  carried on at or from an office or offices located outside the United  States:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Communicating with its shareholders (including the furnishing of  financial reports),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Communicating with the general public,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Soliciting sales of its own stock,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Accepting the subscriptions of new stockholders,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Maintaining its principal corporate records and books of  account,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Auditing its books of account,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Disbursing payments of dividends, legal fees, accounting fees,  and officers' and directors' salaries,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Publishing or furnishing the offering and redemption price of  the shares of stock issued by it,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Conducting meetings of its shareholders and board of directors,  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Making redemptions of its own stock.  The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following  examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Foreign corporation X (not a corporation which is, or  but for section 542(c)(7) or 543(b)(1)(C) would be, a personal holding  company) was organized to sell its shares to nonresident alien  individuals and foreign corporations and to invest the proceeds from the  sale of such shares in stocks or securities in the United States.  Foreign corporation X is engaged primarily in the business of investing,  reinvesting, and trading in stocks or securities for its own account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For a period of three years, foreign corporation X irrevocably  authorizes domestic corporation Y to exercise its discretion in  effecting transactions in the United States in stocks or securities for  the account and risk of foreign corporation X. Foreign corporation X  issues a prospectus in which it is stated that its funds will be  invested pursuant to an investment advisory contract with domestic  corporation Y and otherwise advertises its services. Shares of foreign  corporation X are sold to nonresident aliens and foreign corporations  who are customers of the United States brokerage firms unrelated to  domestic corporation Y or foreign corporation X. The principal functions  performed for foreign corporation X by domestic corporation Y are the  rendering of investment advice and the effecting of transactions in the  United States in stocks or securities for the account of foreign  corporation X. Moreover, domestic corporation Y occasionally  communicates with prospective foreign investors in foreign corporation X  (through speaking engagements abroad by management of domestic  corporation Y, and otherwise) for the purpose of explaining the  investment techniques   and policies used by domestic corporation Y in investing the funds of  foreign corporation X. However, domestic corporation Y does not  participate in the day-to-day conduct of other business activities of  foreign corporation X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Foreign corporation X maintains a general business office or  offices outside the United States in which its management is permanently  located and from which it carries on, except to the extent noted  heretofore, the functions enumerated in (b)(1) through (10) of this  subdivision. The management of foreign corporation X at all times  retains the independent power to cancel the investment advisory contract  with domestic corporation Y subject to the contractual limitations  contained therein and is in all other respects independent of the  management of domestic corporation Y. The managing personnel of foreign  corporation X communicate on a regular basis with domestic corporation  Y, and periodically visit the offices of domestic corporation Y, in  connection with the business activities of foreign corporation X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The principal office of foreign corporation X will not be  considered to be in the United States; and, therefore, foreign  corporation X is not engaged in trade or business within the United  States solely by reason of its relationship with domestic corporation Y.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1 except that, in  lieu of having the investment advisory contract with domestic  corporation Y, foreign corporation X has an office in the United States  in which its employees perform the same functions as are performed by  domestic corporation Y in example 1. Foreign corporation X is not  engaged in trade or business within the United States during the taxable  year solely because the employees located in its United States office  effect transactions in the United States in stocks or securities for the  account of that corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Definition of dealer in stocks or securities--(a) In general.  For purposes of this subparagraph, a dealer in stocks or securities is a  merchant of stocks or securities, with an established place of business,  regularly engaged as a merchant in purchasing stocks or securities and  selling them to customers with a view to the gains and profits that may  be derived therefrom. Persons who buy and sell, or hold, stocks or  securities for investment or speculation, irrespective of whether such  buying or selling constitutes the carrying on of a trade or business,  and officers of corporations, members of partnerships, or fiduciaries,  who in their individual capacities buy and sell, or hold, stocks or  securities for investment or speculation are not dealers in stocks or  securities within the meaning of this subparagraph solely by reason of  that activity. In determining under this subdivision whether a person is  a dealer in stocks or securities such person's transactions in stocks or  securities effected both in and outside the United States shall be taken  into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Underwriting syndicates and dealers trading for others. A  foreign person who otherwise may be considered a dealer in stocks or  securities under (a) of this subdivision shall not be considered a  dealer in stocks or securities for purposes of this subparagraph--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Solely because he acts as an underwriter, or as a selling group  member, for the purpose of making a distribution of stocks or securities  of a domestic issuer to foreign purchasers of such stocks or securities,  irrespective of whether other members of the selling group distribute  the stocks or securities of the domestic issuer to domestic purchasers,  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Solely because of transactions effected in the United States in  stocks or securities pursuant to his grant of discretionary authority to  make decisions in effecting those transactions, if he can demonstrate to  the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the broker, commission agent,  custodian, or other agent through whom the transactions were effected  acted pursuant to his written representation that the funds in respect  of which such discretion was granted were the funds of a customer who is  neither a dealer in stocks or securities, a partnership described in  subdivision (ii)(b) of this subparagraph, or a foreign corporation  described in subdivision (iii)(b) of this subparagraph.  For purposes of this (b), a foreign person includes a nonresident alien  individual, a foreign corporation, or a partnership any member of which  is a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation. This (b)  shall apply only if the foreign person at no time during the taxable  year has an office or other fixed place of business in the United States  through which, or by the direction of which, the transactions in stocks  or securities are effected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Illustrations. The application of this subdivision may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Foreign corporation X is a member of an underwriting  syndicate organized to distribute stock issued by domestic corporation  Y. Foreign corporation X distributes the stock of domestic corporation Y  to foreign purchasers only. Domestic corporation M is syndicate manager  of the underwriting syndicate and, pursuant to the terms of the  underwriting agreement, reserves the right to sell certain quantities of  the underwritten stock on behalf of all the members of the syndicate so  as to engage in stabilizing transactions and to take certain other  actions which may result in the realization of profit by all members of  the underwriting syndicate. Foreign corporation X is not engaged in  trade or business within the United States solely by reason of its  participation as a member of such underwriting syndicate for the purpose  of distributing the stock of domestic corporation Y to foreign  purchasers or by reason of the exercise by M corporation of its  discretionary authority as manager of such syndicate.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Foreign corporation Y, a calendar year taxpayer, is a  bank which trades in stocks or securities both for its own account and  for the account of others. During 1967 foreign corporation Y authorizes  domestic corporation M, a broker, to exercise its discretion in  effecting transactions in the United States in stocks or securities for  the account of B, a nonresident alien individual who has a trading  account with foreign corporation Y. Foreign corporation Y furnishes a  written representation to domestic corporation M to the effect that the  funds in respect of which foreign corporation Y has authorized domestic  corporation M to use its discretion in trading in the United States in  stocks or securities are not funds in respect of which foreign  corporation Y is trading for its own account but are the funds of one of  its customers who is neither a dealer in stocks or securities, a  partnership described in subdivision (ii)(b) of this subparagraph, or a  foreign corporation described in subdivision (iii)(b) of this  subparagraph. Pursuant to the discretionary authority so granted,  domestic corporation M effects transactions in the United States during  1967 in stocks or securities for the account of the customer of foreign  corporation Y. At no time during 1967 does foreign corporation Y have an  office or other fixed place of business in the United States through  which, or by the direction of which, such transactions in stocks or  securities are effected by domestic corporation M. During 1967 foreign  corporation Y is not engaged in trade or business within the United  States solely by reason of such trading in stocks or securities during  such year by domestic corporation M for the account of the customer of  foreign corporation Y. Copies of the written representations furnished  to domestic corporation M should be retained by foreign corporation Y  for inspection by the Commissioner, if inspection is requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Trading in commodities. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this  section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term ``engaged in trade or business within the  United States'' does not include the effecting of transactions in the  United States in commodities (including hedging transactions) through a  resident broker, commission agent, custodian, or other independent agent  if (i) the commodities are of a kind customarily dealt in on an  organized commodity exchange, such as a grain futures or a cotton  futures market, (ii) the transaction is of a kind customarily  consummated at such place, and (iii) the taxpayer at no time during the  taxable year has an office or other fixed place of business in the  United States through which, or by the direction of which, the  transactions in commodities are effected. The volume of commodity  transactions effected during the taxable year shall not be taken into  account in determining under this subparagraph whether the taxpayer is  engaged in trade or business in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Trading for taxpayer's own account--(i) In general. The term  ``engaged in trade or business within the United States'' does not  include the effecting of transactions in the United States in  commodities (including hedging transactions) for the taxpayer's own  account if the commodities are of a kind customarily dealt in on an  organized commodity exchange and if the transaction is of a kind  customarily consummated at such place. This rule shall apply  irrespective of whether such transactions are effected by or through--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The taxpayer himself while present in the United States,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Employees of the taxpayer, whether or not such employees are  present in the United States while effecting the transactions, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A broker, commission, agent, custodian, or other agent of the  taxpayer, whether or not such agent while effecting the transactions is  (1) dependent or independent, or (2) resident, nonresident, or present,  in the United   States, and irrespective of whether any such employee or agent has  discretionary authority to make decisions in effecting such  transactions. The volume of commodity transactions effected during the  taxable year shall not be taken into account in determining under this  subparagraph whether the taxpayer is engaged in trade or business within  the United States. This subparagraph shall not apply to the effecting of  transactions in the United States for the account of a dealer in  commodities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Partnerships. A nonresident alien individual, foreign  partnership, foreign estate, foreign trust, or foreign corporation shall  not be considered to be engaged in trade or business within the United  States solely because such person is a member of a partnership (whether  domestic or foreign) which, pursuant to discretionary authority granted  to such partnership by such person, effects transactions in the United  States in commodities for the partnership's account or solely because an  employee of such partnership, or a broker, commission agent, custodian,  or other agent, pursuant to discretionary authority granted by such  partnership, effects transactions in the United States in commodities  for the account of such partnership. This subdivision shall not apply to  any member of a partnership which is a dealer in commodities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Illustration. The application of this subparagraph may be  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Foreign corporation X, a calendar year taxpayer, is engaged  as a merchant in the business of purchasing grain in South America and  selling such cash grain outside the United States under long-term  contracts for delivery in foreign countries. Foreign corporation X  consummates a sale of 100,000 bushels of cash grain in February 1967 for  July delivery to Sweden. Because foreign corporation X does not actually  own such grain at the time of the sales transaction, such corporation  buys as a hedge a July ``futures contract'' for delivery of 100,000  bushels of grain, in order to protect itself from loss by reason of a  possible rise in the price of grain between February and July. The  ``futures contract'' is ordered through domestic corporation Y, a  futures commission merchant registered under the Commodity Exchange Act.  Foreign corporation X is not engaged in trade or business within the  United States during 1967 solely by reason of its effecting of such  futures contract for its own account through domestic corporation Y.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definition of commodity. For purposes of section 864(b)(2)(B)  and this paragraph the term ``commodities'' does not include goods or  merchandise in the ordinary channels of commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Other rules. The fact that a person is not determined by reason  of this section to be not engaged in trade or business with the United  States is not to be considered a determination that such person is  engaged in trade or business within the United States. Whether or not  such person is engaged in trade or business within the United States  shall be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances in each  case. For other rules relating to the determination of whether a  taxpayer is engaged in trade or business in the United States see  section 875 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective date. The provisions of this section shall apply only  in the case of taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966.
