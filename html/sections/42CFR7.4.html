                            <p class="depth0">The charges imposed in Sec.  7.2 are based on the amount published  in CDC's price list of available products. These changes will reflect  direct costs (such as salaries and equipment), indirect costs (such as  rent, telephone service, and a proportionate share of management and  administrative costs), and the cost of particular ingredients. Charges  may vary over time and between different biological standards or  biological preparations, depending   upon the cost of ingredients and the complexity of production. An up-to- date schedule of charges is available from the Division of Scientific  Resources, Centers for Disease Control, 1600 Clifton Road NE., MS C-17,  Atlanta, Georgia, 30333 or 404-639-3466.
