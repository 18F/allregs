                            <p class="depth0">The charges imposed in Sec.  7.2 are based on the amount published in CDC's price list of available products. These changes will reflect direct costs (such as salaries and equipment), indirect costs (such as rent, telephone service, and a proportionate share of management and administrative costs), and the cost of particular ingredients. Charges may vary over time and between different biological standards or biological preparations, depending

upon the cost of ingredients and the complexity of production. An up-to-date schedule of charges is available from the Division of Scientific Resources, Centers for Disease Control, 1600 Clifton Road NE., MS C-17, Atlanta, Georgia, 30333 or 404-639-3466.
