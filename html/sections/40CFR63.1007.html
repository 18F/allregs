                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Compliance schedule. The owner or operator shall comply with  this section no later than the compliance date specified in the  referencing subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>,  or Sec.  63.1016 of this subpart or paragraph (e) of this section, the  owner or operator shall monitor each pump monthly to detect leaks and  shall comply with all other provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Monitoring method. The pumps shall be monitored to detect leaks  by the method specified in Sec.  63.1004(b) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Instrument reading that defines a leak. The instrument reading  that defines a leak is 10,000 parts per million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Visual inspection. Each pump shall be checked by visual  inspection each calendar week for indications of liquids dripping from  the pump seal. The owner or operator shall document that the inspection  was conducted and the date of the inspection. If there are indications  of liquids dripping from the pump seal, a leak is detected. Unless the  owner or operator demonstrates (e.g., through instrument monitoring)  that the indications of liquids dripping are due to a condition other  than process fluid drips, the leak shall be repaired according to the  procedures of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Visual inspection: Leak repair. Where a leak is identified by  visual indications of liquids dripping, repair shall mean that the  visual indications of liquids dripping have been eliminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Percent leaking pumps calculation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator  shall decide no later than the compliance date of this part or upon  revision of an operating permit whether to calculate percent leaking  pumps on a process unit basis or group of process units basis.   Once the owner or operator has decided, all subsequent percentage  calculations shall be made on the same basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The number of pumps at a process unit shall be the sum of all  the pumps in regulated material service, except that pumps found leaking  in a continuous process unit or within 1 month after startup of the pump  shall not count in the percent leaking pumps calculation for that one  monitoring period only.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Percent leaking pumps shall be determined by the following  equation: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29JN99.009  Where:  %PL = Percent leaking pumps PL = Number of pumps found leaking as determined through</p><p class="depth0">monthly monitoring as required in paragraph (b) of this</p><p class="depth0">section.

PS = Number of pumps leaking within 1 month of start-up</p><p class="depth0">during the current monitoring period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Leak repair. If a leak is detected pursuant to paragraph (b) of  this section, then the leak shall be repaired using the procedures in  Sec.  63.1005, as applicable, unless otherwise specified in paragraph  (b)(4) of this section for leaks identified by visual indications of  liquids dripping.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(viii)</em> of this section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator determines, based on design considerations  and operating experience, criteria applicable to the presence and  frequency of drips and to the sensor that indicates failure of the seal  system, the barrier fluid system, or both. The owner or operator shall  keep records at the plant of the design criteria and an explanation of  the design criteria, and any changes to these criteria and the reasons  for the changes. This record must be available for review by an  inspector.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(C)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Each dual mechanical seal system is operated with the barrier  fluid at a pressure that is at all times (except periods of startup,  shutdown, or malfunction) greater than the pump stuffing box pressure;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Equipped with a barrier fluid degassing reservoir that is routed  to a process or fuel gas system or connected by a closed vent system to  a control device that complies with the requirements of subpart SS of  this part; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Equipped with a closed-loop system that purges the barrier fluid  into a process stream.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The barrier fluid is not in light liquid service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Each barrier fluid system is equipped with a sensor that will  detect failure of the seal system, the barrier fluid system, or both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)(B)</em> of this section prior to the next required inspection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The owner or operator shall monitor the pump as specified in  Sec.  63.1004(b) to determine if there is a leak of regulated material  in the barrier fluid; if an instrument reading of 10,000 parts per  million or greater is measured, a leak   is detected and shall be repaired using the procedures in Sec.  63.1005;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The owner or operator shall eliminate the visual indications of  liquids dripping.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> If indications of liquids dripping from the pump seal exceed  the criteria established in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, or if  based on the criteria established in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section  the sensor indicates failure of the seal system, the barrier fluid  system, or both, a leak is detected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Each sensor as described in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this  section is observed daily or is equipped with an alarm unless the pump  is located within the boundary of an unmanned plant site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> When a leak is detected pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(vi) of  this section, it shall be repaired as specified in Sec.  63.1005.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No external shaft. Any pump that is designed with no externally  actuated shaft penetrating the pump housing is exempt from the  requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Routed to a process or fuel gas system or equipped with a closed  vent system. Any pump that is routed to a process or a fuel gas system  or equipped with a closed vent system that captures and transports  leakage from the pump to a control device meeting the requirements of  Sec.  63.1015 is exempt from requirements of paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Unmanned plant site. Any pump that is located within the  boundary of an unmanned plant site is exempt from the weekly visual  inspection requirement of paragraphs (b)(3), and (e)(1)(v) of this  section, and the daily requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(vii) of this  section, provided that each pump is visually inspected as often as  practical and at least monthly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em>.</p>
