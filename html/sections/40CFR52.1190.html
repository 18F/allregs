Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include a base year (1993 attainment year) emission inventory for NOX and VOC, a demonstration of maintenance of the ozone NAAQS with projected emission inventories (including interim years) to the year 2005 for NOX and VOC, a plan to verify continued attainment, a contingency plan, and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. If the area records a violation of the ozone NAAQS (which must be confirmed by the State), Michigan will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) which are contained in the contingency plan. Appropriateness of a contingency measure will be determined by an urban airshed modeling analysis. The Governor or his designee will select the contingency measure(s) to be implemented based on the analysis and the MDNR's recommendation.

If a violation of the ozone NAAQS, determined not to be attributable to transport from upwind areas, is monitored, Michigan will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) contained in the contingency plan. Once a violation of the ozone NAAQS is recorded, the State will notify EPA, review the data for quality assurance, and conduct a technical analysis, including an analysis of meteorological conditions leading up to and during the exceedances contributing to the violation, to determine local culpability. This preliminary analysis will be submitted to EPA and subjected to public review and comment. The State will solicit and consider EPA's technical advice and analysis before making a final determination on the cause of the violation.

The Environmental Protection Agency's approval of these Executive Orders is limited to those provisions affecting air pollution control. The Air Pollution Control Commission was abolished and its authority was initially transferred to the Director of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR). Subsequently, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources of Environmental Quality (DEQ) was created by elevating eight program divisions and two program offices previously located within the DNR.
