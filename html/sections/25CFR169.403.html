                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The tribe and the grantee on tribal land may negotiate remedies for a violation, abandonment, or non-use. The negotiated remedies must be stated in the tribe's consent to the right-of-way grant, which BIA will then incorporate into the grant itself. The negotiated remedies may include, but are not limited to, the power to terminate the right-of-way grant. If the negotiated remedies provide one or both parties with the power to terminate the grant:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> BIA approval of the termination is not required;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The termination is effective without BIA cancellation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The tribe must provide us with written notice of the termination so that we may record it in the LTRO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Indian landowners and the grantee to a right-of-way grant on individually owned Indian land may negotiate remedies, so long as the consent also specifies the manner in which those remedies may be exercised by or on behalf of the Indian landowners of the majority interest under Sec. 169.107. If the negotiated remedies provide one or both parties with the power to terminate the grant:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> BIA concurrence with the termination is required to ensure that the Indian landowners of the applicable percentage of interests have consented; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> BIA will record the termination in the LTRO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The parties must notify any surety of any violation that may result in termination and the termination of a right-of-way.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Negotiated remedies may apply in addition to, or instead of, the cancellation remedy available to us, as specified in the right-of-way grant. The landowners may request our assistance in enforcing negotiated remedies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A right-of-way grant may provide that violations will be addressed by a tribe, and that disputes will be resolved by a tribal court, any other court of competent jurisdiction, or by a tribal governing body in the absence of a tribal court, or through an alternative dispute resolution method. We may not be bound by decisions made in such forums, but we will defer to ongoing actions or proceedings, as appropriate, in deciding whether to exercise any of the remedies available to us.</p>
