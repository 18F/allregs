                            <p class="depth0">The following criteria is considered before determining liability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The incident causing the damage or injury must occur outside the  United States. It must be caused by noncombatant activities of the US  Armed Forces or by civilian employees or military members of the Armed  Forces.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Negligence is not a prerequisite.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scope of employment is considered in the following situations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is a prerequisite to US responsibility if the employee  causing the damage or injury is a local inhabitant, a prisoner of war,  or an interned enemy alien. These persons are ``employees'' within the  meaning of the Foreign Claims Act (FCA) only when in the service of the  United States. Ordinarily, a slight deviation as to time or place does  not constitute a departure from the scope of employment. The purpose of  the activity and whether it furthers the general interest of the United  States is considered. If the claim arose from the operation or use of a  US Armed Forces vehicle or other equipment by such a person, pay it  provided local law imposes liability on the owner of the vehicle or  other equipment in the circumstances involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is immaterial when the claim arises from the acts or  omissions of   any US Armed Forces member or employee not listed in Sec. 842.64(c)(1)  of this part. The Act imposes responsibility on the United States when  it places a US citizen or non-US citizen employee in a position to cause  the injury or damage. If the cause is a criminal act clearly outside the  scope of employment, ordinarily pay the claim and consider disciplinary  action against the offender.</p>
