                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must reasonably describe the records sought. A reasonable description contains sufficient detail to enable bureau personnel familiar with the subject matter of the request to locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or types of records that you are seeking. This will assist the bureau in identifying the requested records (for example, time frames involved or specific personnel who may have the requested records). For example, whenever possible, identify:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject of any particular records you seek;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The office that created the records you seek;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The timeframe for which you are seeking records; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any other information that will assist the bureau in locating the records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The bureau's FOIA Public Liaison can assist you in formulating or reformulating a request in an effort to better identify the records you seek.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the bureau will inform you what additional information is needed. It will also notify you that it will not be able to comply with your FOIA request unless you provide the additional information requested within 20 workdays. If you receive this sort of response, you may wish to discuss it with the bureau's designated FOIA contact or its FOIA Public Liaison (see Sec. 2.66 of this part). If the bureau does not receive a written response within 20 workdays after asking for additional information, it will presume that you are no longer interested in the records and will close the file on the request.
