Other noise abatement procedures, such as taxiing and engine runups, are not subject to this part unless the procedures imposed limit the total number of Stage 2 or Stage 3 aircraft operations, or limit the hours of Stage 2 or Stage 3 aircraft operations, at the airport.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The notice, review, and approval requirements set forth in this part do not apply to airports with restrictions as specified in 49 U.S.C.

In any case in which an agreement relating to noise reductions at such airport is then entered into between the airport proprietor and an air carrier or air carrier constituting a

majority of the air carrier users of such airport, the requirements of subparts B and D of this part with respect to restrictions on Stage 3 aircraft operations do apply to local actions to enforce such agreements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except to the extent required by the application of the provisions of the Act, nothing in this part eliminates, invalidates, or supersedes the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Existing law with respect to airport noise or access restrictions by local authorities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any proposed airport noise or access regulation at a general aviation airport where the airport proprietor has formally initiated a regulatory or legislative process on or before October 1, 1990; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The authority of the Secretary of Transportation to seek and obtain such legal remedies as the Secretary considers appropriate, including injunctive relief.</p>
