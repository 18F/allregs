                            <p class="depth0">Chimpanzee reproduction is prohibited in the sanctuary. Therefore,  all males must be sterilized by vasectomy before acceptance into the  system, or, as a temporary measure, housed apart from females until they  are sterilized. Vasectomies are advisable because they are minimally  invasive and because effectiveness of the vasectomy may be validated  through laboratory testing for semen. Seminal collection techniques must  be carefully evaluated to avoid painful stimuli. Other proven methods of  birth control may be used under special conditions deemed appropriate by  the Facility Veterinarian and SCCC. The Facility Veterinarian must  determine the appropriate test(s) to use to validate sterility. A  veterinarian experienced in performing vasectomies in chimpanzees should  perform the operation. Documentation must accompany each male accepted  to the sanctuary system attesting to the fact that the male has been  vasectomized and laboratory tests confirm that a segment of the Vas  Deferens has been removed, or that the test used is reliable and is  negative for sperm. The sanctuary must have a contingency plan for  handling accidental births that includes the length of time the  offspring is expected to remain with the mother.</p>
