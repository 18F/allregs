                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applications for certification. Parties may submit applications  for certification of TVBDs that rely solely on spectrum sensing to  identify available channels. Devices authorized under this section must  demonstrate with an extremely high degree of confidence that they will  not cause harmful interference to incumbent radio services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In addition to the procedures in subpart J of part 2 of this  chapter, applicants shall comply with the following.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The application must include a full explanation of how the  device will protect incumbent authorized services against interference.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Applicants must submit a pre-production device, identical to  the device expected to be marketed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission will follow the procedures below for processing  applications pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Applications will be placed on public notice for a minimum of 30  days for comments and 15 days for reply comments. Applicants may request  that portions of their application remain confidential in accordance  with Sec. 0.459 of this chapter. This public notice will include  proposed test procedures and methodologies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Commission will conduct laboratory and field tests of the  pre-production device. This testing will be conducted to evaluate proof  of performance of the device, including characterization of its sensing  capability and its interference potential. The testing will be open to  the public.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Subsequent to the completion of testing, the Commission will  issue by public notice, a test report including recommendations. The  public notice will specify a minimum of 30 days for comments and, if any  objections are received, an additional 15 days for reply comments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.  Compliance with the detection threshold for spectrum sensing in  Sec. 15.717(c), although required, is not necessarily sufficient for  demonstrating reliable interference avoidance. Once a device is  certified, additional devices that are identical in electrical  characteristics and antenna systems may be certified under the  procedures of Part 2, Subpart J of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sensing requirements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Detection threshold. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The required  detection thresholds are:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> ATSC digital TV signals: -114 dBm, averaged over a 6 MHz  bandwidth;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> NTSC analog TV signals: -114 dBm, averaged over a 100 kHz  bandwidth;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Low power auxiliary, including wireless microphone, signals: - 107 dBm, averaged over a 200 kHz bandwidth.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The detection thresholds are referenced to an omnidirectional  receive antenna with a gain of 0 dBi. If a receive antenna with a  minimum directional gain of less than 0 dBi is used, the detection  threshold shall be reduced by the amount in dB that the minimum  directional gain of the antenna is less than 0 dBi. Minimum directional  gain shall be defined as the antenna gain in the direction and at the  frequency that exhibits the least gain. Alternative approaches for the  sensing antenna are permitted, e.g., electronically rotatable antennas,  provided the applicant for equipment authorization can demonstrate that  its sensing antenna provides at least the same performance as an  omnidirectional antenna with 0 dBi gain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Channel availability check time. A TVBD may start operating on a  TV channel if no TV, wireless microphone or other low power auxiliary  device signals above the detection threshold are detected within a  minimum time interval of 30 seconds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In-service monitoring. A TVBD must perform in-service monitoring  of an operating channel at least once every 60 seconds. There is no  minimum channel availability check time for in-service monitoring.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Channel move time. After a TV, wireless microphone or other low  power auxiliary device signal is detected on a TVBD operating channel,  all transmissions by the TVBD must cease within two seconds.
