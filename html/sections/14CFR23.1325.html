                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each instrument provided with static pressure case connections  must be so vented that the influence of airplane speed, the opening and  closing of windows, airflow variations, moisture, or other foreign  matter will least affect the accuracy of the instruments except as noted  in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The design and installation of a static pressure system must be  such that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Positive drainage of moisture is provided;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Chafing of the tubing, and excessive distortion or restriction  at bends in the tubing, is avoided; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The materials used are durable, suitable for the purpose  intended, and protected against corrosion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A proof test must be conducted to demonstrate the integrity of  the static pressure system in the following manner:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Unpressurized airplanes. Evacuate the static pressure system to  a pressure differential of approximately 1 inch of mercury or to a  reading on the altimeter, 1,000 feet above the aircraft elevation at the  time of the test. Without additional pumping for a period of 1 minute,  the loss of indicated altitude must not exceed 100 feet on the  altimeter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Pressurized airplanes. Evacuate the static pressure system  until a pressure differential equivalent to the maximum cabin pressure  differential for which the airplane is type certificated is achieved.  Without additional pumping for a period of 1 minute, the loss of  indicated altitude must not exceed 2 percent of the equivalent altitude  of the maximum cabin differential pressure or 100 feet, whichever is  greater.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a static pressure system is provided for any instrument,  device, or system required by the operating rules of this chapter, each  static pressure port must be designed or located in such a manner that  the correlation between air pressure in the static pressure system and  true ambient atmospheric static pressure is not altered when the  airplane encounters icing conditions. An antiicing means or an alternate  source of static pressure may be used in showing compliance with this  requirement. If the reading of the altimeter, when on the alternate  static pressure system differs from the reading of the altimeter when on  the primary static system by more than 50 feet, a correction card must  be provided for the alternate static system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, if the  static pressure system incorporates both a primary and an alternate  static pressure source, the means for selecting one or the other source  must be designed so that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When either source is selected, the other is blocked off; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Both sources cannot be blocked off simultaneously.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For unpressurized airplanes, paragraph (c)(1) of this section  does not apply if it can be demonstrated that the static pressure system  calibration, when either static pressure source is selected, is not  changed by the other static pressure source being open or blocked.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each static pressure system must be calibrated in flight to  determine the system error. The system error, in indicated pressure  altitude, at sea-level, with a standard atmosphere, excluding instrument  calibration error, may not exceed 30 feet per 100  knot speed for the appropriate configuration in the speed range between  1.3 VS0 with flaps extended, and 1.8 VS1 with  flaps retracted. However, the error need not be less than 30 feet.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For airplanes prohibited from flight in instrument  meteorological or icing conditions, in accordance with Sec. 23.1559(b)  of this part, paragraph (b)(3) of this section does not apply.
