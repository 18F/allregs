                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The purpose of this Standard 9904.412 is to provide guidance for  determining and measuring the components of pension cost. The Standard  establishes the basis on which pension costs shall be assigned to cost  accounting periods. The provisions of this Cost Accounting Standard  should enhance uniformity and consistency in accounting for pension  costs and thereby increase the probability that those costs are properly  allocated to cost objectives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This Standard does not cover the cost of Employee Stock  Ownership Plans (ESOPs) that meet the definition of a pension plan. Such  plans are considered a form of deferred compensation and are covered  under 9904.415.  [73 FR 23964, May 1, 2008]</p>
