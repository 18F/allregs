If the cancellation is  oral, the cancellation will become effective immediately, and the  cancellation and the reasons for the cancellation will be confirmed in  writing as soon as circumstances permit. Any person whose compliance  agreement has been canceled may appeal the decision in writing to the  Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written cancellation  notice. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons that the  person wants the Administrator to consider in deciding the appeal. A  hearing may be held to resolve a conflict as to any material fact.
