                                Sec. 201.210  Parties, limited participants and amici curiae.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Parties in an enforcement or disciplinary proceeding, a  proceeding to review a self-regulatory organization determination, or a  proceeding to review a Board determination--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Generally. No person  shall be granted leave to become a party or a non-party participant on a  limited basis in an enforcement or disciplinary proceeding, a proceeding  to review a determination by a self-regulatory organization pursuant to  Sec. Sec. 201.420 and 201.421, or a proceeding to review a  determination by the Board pursuant to Sec. Sec. 201.440 and 201.441,  except as authorized by paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disgorgement proceedings. In an enforcement proceeding, a person  may state his or her views with respect to a proposed plan of  disgorgement or file a proof of claim pursuant to Sec. 201.1103.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Intervention as a party--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Generally. In any proceeding, other  than an enforcement proceeding, a disciplinary proceeding, a proceeding  to review a self-regulatory determination, or a proceeding to review a  Board determination, any person may seek leave to intervene as a party  by filing a motion setting forth the person's interest in the  proceeding. No person, however, shall be admitted as a party to a  proceeding by intervention unless it is determined that leave to  participate pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section would be  inadequate for the protection of the person's interests. In a proceeding  under the Investment Company Act of 1940, any representative of  interested security holders, or any other person whose participation in  the proceeding may be in the public interest or for the protection of  investors, may be admitted as a party upon the filing of a written  motion setting forth the person's interest in the proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Intervention as of right. In proceedings under the Investment  Company Act of 1940, any interested State or State agency shall be  admitted as a party to any proceeding upon the filing of a written  motion requesting leave to be admitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Leave to participate on a limited basis. In any proceeding,  other than an enforcement proceeding, a disciplinary proceeding, a  proceeding to review a self-regulatory determination, or a proceeding to  review a Board determination, any person may seek leave to participate  on a limited basis as a non-party participant as to any matter affecting  the person's interests:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Procedure. Motions for leave to participate shall be in writing,  shall   set forth the nature and extent of the movant's interest in the  proceeding, and, except where good cause for late filing is shown, shall  be filed not later than 20 days prior to the date fixed for the  commencement of the hearing. Leave to participate pursuant to this  paragraph (c) may include such rights of a party as the hearing officer  may deem appropriate. Persons granted leave to participate shall be  served in accordance with Sec. 201.150; provided, however, that a party  to the proceeding may move that the extent of notice of filings or other  papers to be provided to persons granted leave to participate be  limited, or may move that the persons granted leave to participate bear  the cost of being provided copies of any or all filings or other papers.  Persons granted leave to participate shall be bound, except as may be  otherwise determined by the hearing officer, by any stipulation between  the parties to the proceeding with respect to procedure, including  submission of evidence, substitution of exhibits, corrections of the  record, the time within which briefs or exceptions may be filed or  proposed findings and conclusions may be submitted, the filing of  initial decisions, the procedure to be followed in the preparation of  decisions and the effective date of the Commission's order in the case.  Where the filing of briefs or exceptions or the submission of proposed  findings and conclusions are waived by the parties to the proceedings, a  person granted leave to participate pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall  not be permitted to file a brief or exceptions or submit proposed  findings and conclusions except by leave of the Commission or of the  hearing officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certain persons entitled to leave to participate. The hearing  officer is directed to grant leave to participate under this paragraph  (c) to any person to whom it is proposed to issue any security in  exchange for one or more bona fide outstanding securities, claims or  property interests, or partly in such exchange and partly for cash,  where the Commission is authorized to approve the terms and conditions  of such issuance and exchange after a hearing upon the fairness of such  terms and conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> may be granted for such a period and upon such  conditions as the Commission or the hearing officer deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Amicus participation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Availability. An amicus brief may be  filed only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A motion for leave to file the brief has been granted;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The brief is accompanied by written consent of all parties;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The brief is filed at the request of the Commission or the  hearing officer; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The brief is presented by the United States or an officer or  agency thereof, or by a State, Territory or Commonwealth.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedure. An amicus brief may be filed conditionally with the  motion for leave. The motion for leave shall identify the interest of  the movant and shall state the reasons why a brief of an amicus curiae  is desirable. Except as all parties otherwise consent, any amicus curiae  shall file its brief within the time allowed the party whose position  the amicus will support, unless the Commission or hearing officer, for  cause shown, grants leave for a later filing. In the event that a later  filing is allowed, the order granting leave to file shall specify when  an opposing   party may reply to the brief. A motion of an amicus curiae to  participate in oral argument will be granted only for extraordinary  reasons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> will be considered only to the  extent that the statements therein made are otherwise supported by the  record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Modification of participation provisions. The Commission or the  hearing officer may, by order, modify the provisions of this section  which would otherwise be applicable, and may impose such terms and  conditions on the participation of any person in any proceeding as it  may deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest.
