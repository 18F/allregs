                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. In addition to the requirements of part 10 of this subchapter, the applicant for an officer endorsement, whether original, renewal, duplicate, or raise of grade, must establish to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard that he or she possesses all the qualifications necessary (including but not limited to age, experience, character, physical health, citizenship, approved training, professional competence, and a test for dangerous drugs) before the Coast Guard will issue to him or her a merchant mariner

credential (MMC). An applicant for any STCW endorsement must hold the appropriate national endorsement unless otherwise specified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> English language requirements. Except as provided in Sec. 11.467(i) of this part, an applicant for an officer endorsement must demonstrate an ability to speak and understand English as found in the navigation rules, aids to navigation publications, emergency equipment instructions, machinery instructions, and radiotelephone communications instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Experience and service. (1) Applicants for officer endorsements should refer to Sec. 10.232 of this subchapter for information regarding requirements for documentation and proof of sea service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicants for officer endorsements should refer to Sec. 10.232 of this subchapter for information regarding requirements for documentation and proof of sea service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An applicant for a national officer endorsement must have at least 3 months of required service on vessels of appropriate tonnage or horsepower within the 3 years immediately preceding the date of application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No original officer endorsement may be issued to any naturalized citizen based on less experience in any grade or capacity than would have been required of a citizen of the United States by birth.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Experience and service acquired on foreign vessels is creditable for establishing eligibility for an officer endorsement, subject to evaluation by the Coast Guard to determine that it is a fair and reasonable equivalent to service acquired on merchant vessels of the United States, with respect to grade, tonnage, horsepower, waters, and operating conditions. An applicant who has obtained qualifying experience on foreign vessels must submit satisfactory documentary evidence of such service (including any necessary translation into English) in accordance with Sec. 10.232 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> No applicant for an original officer endorsement who is a naturalized citizen and who has obtained experience on foreign vessels will be given an original officer endorsement in a grade higher than that upon which he or she has actually served while acting under the authority of a foreign credential.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Experience acquired while the applicant was less than 16 years of age is generally not creditable. Compelling circumstances and unique experiences acquired before the applicant reaches 16 years of age will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Citizenship. No officer endorsement may be issued to any person who is not a citizen of the United States with the exception of operators of uninspected passenger vessels that are not documented under the laws of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Age. Except as specified in this paragraph, no officer endorsement may be issued to a person who has not attained the age of 21 years. The required evidence of age may be established using any of the items submitted to establish citizenship set out in 49 CFR 1572.17.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An endorsement may be granted to an applicant who has reached the age of 19 years as--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Master of near-coastal, Great Lakes and inland, or river vessels of 25-200 GRT;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Third mate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Third assistant engineer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Mate of vessels of between 200 GRT and 1,600 GRT;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Ballast control operator (BCO);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Assistant engineer (MODU);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Assistant engineer of fishing industry vessels;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Mate (pilot) of towing vessels;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Radio officer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Assistant engineer (limited); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Designated duty engineer of vessels of less than 4,000 HP/3,000 kW.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An endorsement may be granted to an applicant who has reached the age of 18 years as--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Limited master of near-coastal vessels of less than 100 GRT;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Limited master of Great Lakes and inland vessels of less than 100 GRT;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Mate of Great Lakes and inland vessels of 25-200 GRT;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Mate of near-coastal vessels of 25-200 GRT;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Operator of uninspected passenger vessels (OUPV);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Designated duty engineer of vessels of less than 1,000 HP/750 kW;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Apprentice mate (steersman) of towing vessels;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Officer in charge of a navigational watch (OICNW);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Officer in charge of an engineering watch (OICEW); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Electro-technical officer (ETO).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Physical examination. (1) Persons serving or intending to serve in the merchant marine service are encouraged to take the earliest opportunity to ascertain, through examination, whether their visual acuity, color vision, hearing, and general physical condition, are such as to qualify them for service in that profession. Any physical impairment or medical condition that would render an applicant incompetent to perform the ordinary duties required of an officer is cause for denial of an officer endorsement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Persons serving or intending to serve in the merchant marine service are encouraged to take the earliest opportunity to ascertain, through examination, whether their visual acuity, color vision, hearing, and general physical condition, are such as to qualify them for service in that profession.

(1) An individual may apply for an original officer endorsement, or officer or STCW endorsement of a different type, while on probation as a result of administrative action under part 5 of this chapter. The offense for which the applicant was placed on probation will be considered in determining his or her fitness to hold the endorsement applied for. An officer or STCW endorsement issued to an applicant on probation will be subject to the same probationary conditions as were imposed against the applicant's other credential. An applicant may not take an examination for an officer or STCW endorsement during any period of time when a suspension without probation or a revocation is effective against the applicant's currently held license, merchant mariner document (MMD), or MMC, or while an appeal from these actions is pending.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An individual may apply for an original officer endorsement, or officer or STCW endorsement of a different type, while on probation as a result of administrative action under part 5 of this chapter.
