                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> There must be a clear and distinctive stall warning, with the flaps and landing gear in any normal position, in straight and turning flight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The stall warning may be furnished either through the inherent aerodynamic qualities of the airplane or by a device that will give clearly distinguishable indications under expected conditions of flight. However, a visual stall warning device that requires the attention of the crew within the cockpit is not acceptable by itself.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> During the stall tests required by Sec. 23.201(b) and Sec. 23.203(a)(1), the stall warning must begin at a speed exceeding the stalling speed by a margin of not less than 5 knots and must continue until the stall occurs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When following procedures furnished in accordance with Sec. 23.1585, the stall warning must not occur during a takeoff with all engines operating, a takeoff continued with one engine inoperative, or during an approach to landing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> During the stall tests required by Sec. 23.203(a)(2), the stall warning must begin sufficiently in advance of the stall for the stall to be averted by pilot action taken after the stall warning first occurs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For acrobatic category airplanes, an artificial stall warning may be mutable, provided that it is armed automatically during takeoff and rearmed automatically in the approach configuration.
