                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At any time after a respondent's answer has been filed, the  respondent or the Director may make a motion for summary disposition of  any or all allegations contained in the Order Instituting Proceedings.  If the Director has not completed presentation of his or her case-in- chief, a motion for summary disposition shall be made only with  permission of the Administrative Law Judge. The facts of the pleadings  of the party against whom the motion is made shall be taken as true,  except as modified by stipulations or admissions made by that party, by  uncontested affidavits, or by facts officially noticed pursuant to Sec.  501.732(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Decision on motion. The Administrative Law Judge may promptly  decide the motion for summary disposition or may defer decision on the  motion. The Administrative Law Judge shall issue an order granting a  motion for summary disposition if the record shows there is no genuine  issue with regard to any material fact and the party making the motion  is entitled to a summary disposition as a matter of law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A motion for summary disposition must be accompanied by a  statement of the material facts as to which the moving party contends  there is no genuine issue. Such motion must be supported by documentary  evidence, which may take the form of admissions in pleadings,  stipulations, depositions, transcripts, affidavits, and any other  evidentiary materials that the moving party contends support its  position. The motion must also be accompanied by a brief containing the  points and authorities in support of the moving party's arguments. Any  party opposing a motion for summary disposition must file a statement  setting forth those material facts as to which such party contends a  genuine dispute exists. The   opposition must be supported by evidence of the same type as that  submitted with the motion for summary disposition and a brief containing  the points and authorities in support of the contention that summary  disposition would be inappropriate.</p>
