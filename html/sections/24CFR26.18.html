                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary  discovery procedures, which may commence at any time after an answer has  been filed. Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not  privileged, that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party,  including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and  location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the  identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable  matter. For good cause, the hearing officer may order discovery of any  matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the action. To be  relevant, information need not be admissible at the hearing, if the  discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of  admissible evidence. Each party shall bear its own expenses associated  with discovery. Discovery may include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests for production of documents as set forth in Sec.  26.19;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Depositions as set forth in Sec. 26.20;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Written interrogatories as set forth in Sec. 26.21; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Requests for admissions as set forth in Sec. 26.22.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Supplementation of responses. A party who has responded to a  request for discovery with a response is under a duty to timely amend a  prior response to an interrogatory, request for production, or request  for admission if so ordered by the hearing officer, or if the party  learns that the response is in some material respect incomplete or  incorrect and if the additional or corrective information has not  otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery  process or in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requesting an order. In connection with any discovery procedure,  by motion addressed to the hearing officer and upon a showing of a good  faith attempt to resolve the issue without the hearing officer's  intervention, either party may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Request an order compelling a response with respect to any  objection to or other failure to respond to the discovery requested or  any part thereof, or any failure to respond as specifically requested,  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Request a protective order limiting the scope, methods, time and  place for discovery, and provisions for protecting privileged  information or documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limitations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By order, the hearing officer may set or alter  limits on the number of document requests, depositions, and  interrogatories, or the length of depositions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Orders compelling discovery shall be issued only where such  discovery will not compel the disclosure of privileged information,  unduly delay the hearing, or result in prejudice to the public interest  or the rights of the parties, and upon a showing of good cause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Protective orders may be issued by a hearing officer if the  hearing officer determines such an order is necessary to protect a party  or other person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue  burden or expense because:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative,  or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less  burdensome, or less expensive;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by  discovery in the action to obtain the information sought; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its  likely benefit, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in  controversy, the parties' resources, the importance of the issues at  stake in the litigation, and the importance of the proposed discovery in  resolving the issues.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A party need not provide discovery of electronically stored  information from sources that the party identifies as not reasonably  accessible because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel  discovery or for a protective order, the party from whom discovery is  sought must show that the information is not reasonably accessible  because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the hearing  officer may nonetheless order discovery from such sources if the  requesting party shows good cause or, when the party's refusal to  provide the information sought is solely due to undue expense, if the  party seeking the discovery agrees to bear the expense associated with  the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Refusal to honor discovery order. When a party refuses to honor  a discovery order, the hearing officer may issue such orders in regard  to the refusal as justice shall require.</p>
