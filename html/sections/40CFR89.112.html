[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exhaust emissions of oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and nonmethane hydrocarbon are measured using the procedures set forth in subpart E of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exhaust emission of particulate matter is measured using the California Regulations for New 1996 and Later Heavy-Duty Off-Road Diesel Cycle Engines. This procedure is incorporated by reference. See Sec. 89.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In lieu of the NOX standards, NMHC + NOX standards, and PM standards specified in paragraph (a) of this section, manufacturers may elect to include engine families in the averaging, banking, and trading program, the provisions of which are specified in subpart C of this part. The manufacturer must set a family emission limit (FEL) not to exceed the levels contained in Table 2. The FEL established by the manufacturer serves as the standard for that engine family. Table 2 follows:

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Naturally aspirated nonroad engines to which this subpart is applicable shall not discharge crankcase emissions into the ambient atmosphere, unless such crankcase emissions are permanently routed into the exhaust and included in all exhaust emission measurements. This provision applies to all

Tier 2 engines and later models. This provision does not apply to engines using turbochargers, pumps, blowers, or superchargers for air induction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The following paragraphs define the requirements for low-emitting Blue Sky Series engines:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Voluntary standards. Engines may be designated ``Blue Sky Series'' engines by meeting the voluntary standards listed in Table 3, which apply to all certification and in-use testing, as follows:</p><p class="depth3">Table 3--Voluntary Emission Standards (g/kW-hr)------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Rated Brake Power (kW)                  NMHC+NOX      PM------------------------------------------------------------------------kW<8..............................................          4.6     0.488<=kW<19..........................................          4.5     0.4819<=kW<37.........................................          4.5     0.3637<=kW<75.........................................          4.7     0.2475<=kW<130........................................          4.0     0.18130<=kW<=560......................................          4.0     0.12kW560..................................          3.8     0.12------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional standards. Blue Sky Series engines are subject to all provisions that would otherwise apply under this part, except as specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Test procedures. NOX, NMHC, and PM emissions are measured using the procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 1065, in lieu of the procedures set forth in subpart E of this part. CO emissions may be measured using the procedures set forth either in 40 CFR part 1065 or in subpart E of this part. Manufacturers may use an alternate procedure to demonstrate the desired level of emission control if approved in advance by the Administrator. Engines meeting the requirements to qualify as Blue Sky Series engines must be capable of maintaining a comparable level of emission control when tested using the procedures set forth in paragraph (c) of this section and subpart E of this part. The numerical emission levels measured using the procedures from subpart E of this part may be up to 20 percent higher than those measured using the procedures from 40 CFR part 1065 and still be considered comparable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Manufacturers of engines at or above 37 kW and below 56 kW from model years 2008 through 2012 that are subject to the standards of this section under 40 CFR 1039.102 must take the following additional steps:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State the applicable PM standard on the emission control information label.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Add information to the emission-related installation instructions to clarify the equipment manufacturer's obligations under 40 CFR 1039.104(f).
