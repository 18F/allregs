                            <p class="depth0">X-ray examinations are conducted through the use of equipment which  is free of unnecessary hazards for patients, personnel, and other  persons in the immediate environment, and through operating procedures  which provide minimum radiation exposure to patients, personnel, and  other persons in the immediate environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Standard--tube housing and devices to restrict the useful beam.  The tube housing is of diagnostic type. Diaphragms, cones, or adjustable  collimators capable of restricting the useful beam to the area of  clinical interest are used and provide the same degree of protection as  is required of the housing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Standard--total filtration. (1) The aluminum equivalent of the  total filtration in the primary beam is not less than that shown in the  following table except when contraindicated for a particular diagnostic  procedure.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Total filtration (inherent</p><p class="depth0">Operating kVp                         plus added) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Below 50 kVp.............................  0.5 millimeters aluminum. 50-70 kVp................................  1.5 millimeters aluminum. Above 70 kVp.............................  2.5 millimeters aluminum. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the filter in the machine is not accessible for examination  or the total filtration is unknown, it can be assumed that the  requirements are met if the half-value layer is not less than that shown  in the following table:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Operating kVp                       Half-value layer ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 50 kVp...................................  0.6 millimeters aluminum. 70 kVp...................................  1.6 millimeters aluminum. 90 kVp...................................  2.6 millimeters aluminum. 100 kVp..................................  2.8 millimeters aluminum. 110 kVp..................................  3.0 millimeters aluminum. 120 kVp..................................  3.3 millimeters aluminum. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Standard--termination of exposure. A device is provided to  terminate the exposure after a preset time or exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Standard--control panel. The control panel provides a device  (usually a   milliammeter or a means for an audible signal to give positive  indication of the production of X-rays whenever the X-ray tube is  energized. The control panel includes appropriate indicators (labelled  control settings and/or meters) which show the physical factors (such as  kVp, mA, exposure time or whether timing is automatic) used for the  exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Standard--exposure control switch. The exposure control switch  is of the dead-man type and is so arranged that the operator can stand  at least 6 feet from the patient and well away from the useful beam.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Standard--protection against electrical hazards. Only shockproof  equipment is used. All electrical equipment is grounded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Standard--mechanical supporting or restraining devices.  Mechanical supporting or restraining devices are provided so that such  devices can be used when a patient must be held in position for  radiography.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Standard--protective gloves and aprons. Protective gloves and  aprons are provided so that when the patient must be held by an  individual, that individual is protected with these shielding devices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Standard--restriction of the useful beam. Diaphragms, cones, or  adjustable collimators are used to restrict the useful beam to the area  of clinical interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Standard--personnel monitoring. A device which can be worn to  monitor radiation exposure (e.g., a film badge) is provided to each  individual who operates portable X-ray equipment. The device is  evaluated for radiation exposure to the operator at least monthly and  appropriate records are maintained by the supplier of portable X-ray  services of radiation exposure measured by such a device for each  individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Standard--personnel and public protection. No individual  occupationally exposed to radiation is permitted to hold patients during  exposures except during emergencies, nor is any other individual  regularly used for this service. Care is taken to assure that pregnant  women do not assist in portable X-ray examinations.  [34 FR 388, Jan. 10, 1969. Redesignated at 42 FR 52826, Sept. 30, 1977.
