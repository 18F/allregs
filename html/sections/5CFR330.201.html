                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Reemployment Priority List (RPL) is a required component of  an agency's placement programs to assist its current and former  competitive service employees who will be or were separated by reduction  in force (RIF) under part 351 of this chapter, or who have recovered  from a compensable work-related injury after more than 1 year, as  required by part 353 of this chapter. In filling vacancies, an agency  must give its RPL registrants placement priority for most competitive  service vacancies before hiring someone from outside its own permanent  competitive service workforce. An agency may choose to consider RPL  placement priority candidates before other agency permanent competitive  service employees under its Career Transition Assistance Plan (CTAP)  established under subpart F of this part, after fulfilling agency  obligations to its CTAP selection priority candidates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agencies must use an RPL to give placement priority to their:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Current competitive service employees with a specific notice of  RIF separation or a Certification of Expected Separation issued under  part 351 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Former competitive service employees separated by RIF under part  351 of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Former competitive service employees fully recovered from a  compensable injury (as defined in part 353 of this chapter) after more  than 1 year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All agency components within the local commuting area use a  single RPL and are responsible for giving placement priority to the  agency's RPL registrants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> With prior OPM approval, an agency may operate an alternate  placement program which satisfies the basic requirements of this  subpart, including veterans' preference, as an exception to the RPL  regulations under this subpart. This provision is limited to  reemployment priority because of RIF separation and allows agencies to  adopt different placement strategies that are effective for their  programs and satisfy employee entitlements to reemployment priority.</p>
