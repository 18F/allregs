Notices of appeal, petitions, and  applications will be docketed by the Office of the Clerk of the Board,  and a written notice of docketing will be sent promptly to all parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Consolidation. When cases involving common questions of law or  fact are filed, the Board may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Order the cases consolidated; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Make such other orders concerning the proceedings as are needed  to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
