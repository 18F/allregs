                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section prescribes the maximum amount of purchased  credit card relationships, serving assets, intangible assets (other than  purchased credit card relationships and servicing assets), credit- enhancing interest-only strips, and deferred tax assets that State  savings associations may include in calculating tangible and core  capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Computation of core and tangible capital. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Purchased credit  card relationships may be included (that is, not deducted) in computing  core capital in accordance with the restrictions in this   section, but must be deducted in computing tangible capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In accordance with the restrictions in this section, mortgage  servicing assets may be included in computing core and tangible capital  and nonmortgage servicing assets may be included in core capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Credit-enhancing interest-only strips may be included (that is  not deducted) in computing core capital subject to the restrictions of  this section, and may be included in tangible capital in the same  amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Deferred tax assets may be included (that is not deducted) in  computing core capital subject to the restrictions of paragraph (h) of  this section, and may be included in tangible capital in the same  amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Market valuations. The FDIC reserves the authority to require  any State savings association to perform an independent market valuation  of assets subject to this section on a case-by-case basis or through the  issuance of policy guidance. An independent market valuation, if  required, shall be conducted in accordance with any policy guidance  issued by the FDIC. A required valuation shall include adjustments for  any significant changes in original valuation assumptions, including  changes in prepayment estimates or attrition rates. The valuation shall  determine the current fair value of assets subject to this section. This  independent market valuation may be conducted by an independent  valuation expert evaluating the reasonableness of the internal  calculations and assumptions used by the State savings association in  conducting its internal analysis. The State savings association shall  calculate an estimated fair value for assets subject to this section at  least quarterly regardless of whether an independent valuation expert is  required to perform an independent market valuation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Value limitation. For purposes of calculating core capital under  this subpart (but not for financial statement purposes), purchased  credit card relationships and servicing assets must be valued at the  lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ninety (90) percent of their fair value determined in accordance  with paragraph (c) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> One hundred (100) percent of their remaining unamortized book  value determined in accordance with the instructions for the Thrift  Financial Report or Consolidated Reports of Condition or Income (``Call  Report.''), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Core capital limitations(1) Servicing assets and purchased  credit card relationships. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The maximum aggregate amount of servicing  assets and purchased credit card relationships that may be included in  core capital is limited to the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> 100 percent of the amount of core capital; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount of servicing assets and purchased credit card  relationships determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In addition to the aggregate limitation in paragraph (e)(1)(i)  of this section, a sublimit applies to purchased credit card  relationships and non mortgage-related serving assets. The maximum  allowable amount of these two types of assets combined is limited to the  lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> 25 percent the amount of core capital; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount of purchased credit card relationships and non  mortgage-related servicing assets determined in accordance with  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Credit-enhancing interest-only strips. The maximum aggregate  amount of credit-enhancing interest-only strips that may be included in  core capital is limited to 25 percent of the amount of core capital.  Purchased and retained credit-enhancing interest-only strips, on a non- tax adjusted basis, are included in the total amount that is used for  purposes of determining whether a State savings association exceeds the  core capital limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Computation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of computing the limits and  sublimits in paragraphs (e) and (h) of this section, core capital is  computed before the deduction of disallowed servicing assets, disallowed  purchased credit card relationships, disallowed credit-enhancing  interest-only strips (purchased and retained), and disallowed deferred  tax assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A State savings association may elect to deduct the following  items on a basis net of deferred tax liabilities:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Disallowed servicing assets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Goodwill such that only the net amount must be deducted from  Tier 1 capital;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Disallowed credit-enhancing interest-only strips (both purchased  and retained); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other intangible assets arising from non-taxable business  combinations. A deferred tax liability that is specifically related to  an intangible asset (other than purchased credit card relationships)  arising from a nontaxable business combination may be netted against  this intangible asset. The net amount of the intangible asset must be  deducted from Tier 1 capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Deferred tax liabilities that are netted in accordance with  paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section cannot also be netted against  deferred tax assets when determining the amount of deferred tax assets  that are dependent upon future taxable income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Tangible capital limitation. The maximum amount of mortgage  servicing assets that may be included in tangible capital shall be the  same amount includable in core capital in accordance with the  limitations set by paragraph (e) of this section. All nonmortgage  servicing assets are deducted in computing tangible capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Exemption for certain subsidiaries--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Exemption standard. A  State savings association holding purchased mortgage servicing rights in  separately capitalized, non-includable subsidiaries may submit an  application for approval by the FDIC for an exemption from the  deductions and limitations set forth in this section. The deductions and  limitations will apply to such purchased mortgage servicing rights,  however, if the FDIC determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State savings association and subsidiary are not conducting  activities on an arm's length basis; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The exemption is not consistent with the State savings  association's safe and sound operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applicable requirements. If the FDIC determines to grant or to  permit the continuation of an exemption under paragraph (h)(1) of this  section, the State savings association receiving the exemption must  ensure the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State savings association's investments in, and extensions  of credit to, the subsidiary are deducted from capital when calculating  capital under this subpart;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Extensions of credit and other transactions with the subsidiary  are conducted in compliance with the rules for covered transactions with  affiliates set forth in sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act,  as applied to State savings associations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any contracts entered into by the subsidiary include a written  disclosure indicating that the subsidiary is not a bank or State savings  association; the subsidiary is an organization separate and apart from  any bank or State savings association; and the obligations of the  subsidiary are not backed or guaranteed by any bank or State savings  association and are not insured by the FDIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Treatment of deferred tax assets. For purposes of calculating  Tier 1 capital under this subpart (but not for financial statement  purposes) deferred tax assets are subject to the conditions,  limitations, and restrictions described in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Tier 1 capital limitations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The maximum allowable amount of  deferred tax assets net of any valuation allowance that are dependent  upon future taxable income will be limited to the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future  taxable income that is expected to be realized within one year of the  calendar quarter-end date, based on a projected future taxable income  for that year; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Ten percent of the amount of Tier 1 capital that exists before  the deduction of any disallowed servicing assets, any disallowed  purchased credit card   relationships, any disallowed credit-enhancing interest-only strips, and  any disallowed deferred tax assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this limitation, all existing temporary  differences should be assumed to fully reverse at the calendar quarter- end date. The recorded amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent  upon future taxable income, net of any valuation allowance for deferred  tax assets, in excess of this limitation will be deducted from assets  and from equity capital for purposes of determining Tier 1 capital under  this subpart. The amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  from taxes paid in prior carryback years and from the reversal of  existing taxable temporary differences generally would not be deducted  from assets and from equity capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(1)(B)(ii) of this section, the  amount of carryback potential that may be considered in calculating the  amount of deferred tax assets that a State savings association that is  part of a consolidated group (for tax purposes) may include in Tier 1  capital may not exceed the amount which the association could reasonably  expect to have refunded by its parent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Projected future taxable income. Projected future taxable income  should not include net operating loss carryforwards to be used within  one year of the most recent calendar quarter-end date or the amount of  existing temporary differences expected to reverse within that year.  Projected future taxable income should include the estimated effect of  tax planning strategies that are expected to be implemented to realize  tax carryforwards that will otherwise expire during that year. Future  taxable income projections for the current fiscal year (adjusted for any  significant changes that have occurred or are expected to occur) may be  used when applying the capital limit at an interim calendar quarter-end  date rather than preparing a new projection each quarter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale debt  securities. The deferred tax effects of any unrealized holding gains and  losses on available-for-sale debt securities may be excluded from the  determination of the amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent  upon future taxable income and the calculation of the maximum allowable  amount of such assets. If these deferred tax effects are excluded, this  treatment must be followed consistently over time.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

General Provisions</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Purpose, Applicability, Reservation of Authority, and</p><p class="depth0">Principle of Conservatism</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This appendix establishes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Minimum qualifying criteria for State savings associations using  State savings association-specific internal risk measurement and  management processes for calculating risk-based capital requirements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Methodologies for such State savings associations to calculate  their risk-based capital requirements; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Public disclosure requirements for such State savings  associations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applicability. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> This appendix applies to a State savings  association that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Has consolidated assets, as reported on the most recent year-end  Thrift Financial Report (TFR) or Consolidated Reports of Condition or  Income (``Call Report''), as applicable, equal to $250 billion or more;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Has consolidated total on-balance sheet foreign exposure at the  most recent year-end equal to $10 billion or more (where total on- balance sheet foreign exposure equals total cross-border claims less  claims with head office or guarantor located in another country plus  redistributed guaranteed amounts to the country of head office or  guarantor plus local country claims on local residents plus revaluation  gains on foreign exchange and derivative products, calculated in  accordance with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council  (FFIEC) 009 Country Exposure Report);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Is a subsidiary of a depository institution that uses 12 CFR  part 3, appendix C, 12 CFR part 208, appendix F, 12 CFR part 325,  appendix D, or 12 CFR subpart Z of part 390, appendix A, to calculate  its risk-based capital requirements; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Is a subsidiary of a bank holding company that uses 12 CFR part  225, appendix G, to calculate its risk-based capital requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any State savings association may elect to use this appendix to  calculate its risk-based capital requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A State savings association that is subject to this appendix  must use this appendix unless the FDIC determines in writing that  application of this appendix is not appropriate in light of the State  savings association's asset size, level of complexity, risk profile, or  scope of operations. In making a determination under this paragraph, the  FDIC will apply notice and response procedures in the same manner and to  the same extent as the notice and response procedures in  Sec. 390.463(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reservation of authority--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Additional capital in the  aggregate. The FDIC may require a State savings association to hold an  amount of capital greater than otherwise required under this appendix if  the FDIC determines that the State savings association's risk-based  capital requirement under this appendix is not commensurate with the  State savings association's credit, market, operational, or other risks.  In making a determination under this paragraph, the FDIC will apply  notice and response procedures in the same manner and to the same extent  as the notice and response procedures in Sec. 390.463(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Specific risk-weighted asset amounts. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the FDIC determines  that the risk-weighted asset amount calculated under this appendix by  the State savings association for one or more exposures is not  commensurate with the risks associated with those exposures, the FDIC  may require the State savings association to assign a different risk- weighted asset amount to the exposures, to assign different risk  parameters to the exposures (if the exposures are wholesale or retail  exposures), or to use different model assumptions for the exposures (if  relevant), all as specified by the FDIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the FDIC determines that the risk-weighted asset amount for  operational risk produced by the State savings association under this  appendix is not commensurate with the operational risks of the State  savings association, the FDIC may require the State savings association  to assign a different risk-weighted asset amount for operational risk,  to change elements of its operational risk analytical framework,  including distributional and dependence assumptions, or to make other  changes to the State savings association's operational risk management  processes, data and assessment systems, or quantification systems, all  as specified by the FDIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Regulatory capital treatment of unconsolidated entities. The  FDIC may find that the capital treatment for an exposure to a  transaction not subject to consolidation on the State savings  association's balance sheet   does not appropriately reflect the risks imposed on the State savings  association. Accordingly, the FDIC may require the State savings  association to treat the transaction as if it were consolidated on the  State savings association's balance sheet. The FDIC will look to the  substance of and risk associated with the transaction as well as other  relevant factors in determining whether to require such treatment and in  calculating risk-based capital as the FDIC deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Other supervisory authority. Nothing in this appendix limits the  authority of the FDIC under any other provision of law or regulation to  take supervisory or enforcement action, including action to address  unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, deficient capital levels, or  violations of law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Principle of conservatism. Notwithstanding the requirements of  this appendix, a State savings association may choose not to apply a  provision of this appendix to one or more exposures, provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The State savings association can demonstrate on an ongoing  basis to the satisfaction of the FDIC that not applying the provision  would, in all circumstances, unambiguously generate a risk-based capital  requirement for each such exposure greater than that which would  otherwise be required under this appendix;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The State savings association appropriately manages the risk of  each such exposure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The State savings association notifies the FDIC in writing prior  to applying this principle to each such exposure; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The exposures to which the State savings association applies  this principle are not, in the aggregate, material to the State savings  association.</p><p class="depth0">Section 2.

Mechanics for Calculating Total Wholesale and Retail Risk-</p><p class="depth0">Weighted Assets</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Overview. A State savings association must calculate its total  wholesale and retail risk-weighted asset amount in four distinct phases:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Phase 1--categorization of exposures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Phase 2--assignment of wholesale obligors and exposures to  rating grades and segmentation of retail exposures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Phase 3--assignment of risk parameters to wholesale exposures  and segments of retail exposures; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Phase 4--calculation of risk-weighted asset amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Phase 1--Categorization. The State savings association must  determine which of its exposures are wholesale exposures, retail  exposures, securitization exposures, or equity exposures. The State  savings association must categorize each retail exposure as a  residential mortgage exposure, a QRE, or an other retail exposure. The  State savings association must identify which wholesale exposures are  HVCRE exposures, sovereign exposures, OTC derivative contracts, repo- style transactions, eligible margin loans, eligible purchased wholesale  exposures, unsettled transactions to which section 35 of this appendix  applies, and eligible guarantees or eligible credit derivatives that are  used as credit risk mitigants. The State savings association must  identify any on-balance sheet asset that does not meet the definition of  a wholesale, retail, equity, or securitization exposure, as well as any  non-material portfolio of exposures described in paragraph (e)(4) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Phase 2--Assignment of wholesale obligors and exposures to  rating grades and retail exposures to segments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Assignment of  wholesale obligors and exposures to rating grades.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State savings association must assign each obligor of a  wholesale exposure to a single obligor rating grade and must assign each  wholesale exposure to which it does not directly assign an LGD estimate  to a loss severity rating grade.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The State savings association must identify which of its  wholesale obligors are in default.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Segmentation of retail exposures. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State savings  association must group the retail exposures in each retail subcategory  into segments that have homogeneous risk characteristics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The State savings association must identify which of its retail  exposures are in default.

A State savings  association must treat an equity derivative contract as an equity  exposure and compute a risk-weighted asset amount for the equity  derivative contract under part VI (unless the State savings association  is treating the contract as a covered position under any applicable  market risk rule). In addition, if the State savings association is  treating the contract as a covered position under any applicable market  risk rule and in certain other cases described in section 55 of this  appendix, the State savings association must also calculate a risk-based  capital requirement for the counterparty credit risk of an equity  derivative contract under this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Single OTC derivative contract.

The PFE for a single OTC derivative contract, including an  OTC derivative contract with a negative mark-to-market value, is  calculated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the  derivative contract by the appropriate conversion factor in Table 4. For  purposes of calculating either the PFE under this paragraph or the gross  PFE under paragraph (c)(6) of this section for exchange rate contracts  and other similar contracts in which the notional principal amount is  equivalent to the cash flows, notional principal amount is the net  receipts to each party falling due on each value date in each currency.  For any OTC derivative contract that does not fall within one of the  specified categories in Table 4, the PFE must be calculated using the  ``other'' conversion factors. A State savings association must use an  OTC derivative contract's effective notional principal amount (that is,  its apparent or stated notional principal amount multiplied by any  multiplier in the OTC derivative contract) rather than its apparent or  stated notional principal amount in calculating PFE. PFE of the  protection provider of a credit derivative is capped at the net present  value of the amount of unpaid premiums.</p><p class="depth0">Table 4--Conversion Factor Matrix for OTC Derivative Contracts \4\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Credit     Credit (non-</p><p class="depth0">Foreign    (investment-  investment-               Precious</p><p class="depth0">Remaining maturity \5\                       Interest      exchange        grade        grade       Equity      metals       Other</p><p class="depth0">rate        rate and      reference    reference                 (except</p><p class="depth0">gold      obligor) \6\    obligor)                  gold) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- One year or less.............................................         0.00          0.01           0.05         0.10        0.06        0.07        0.10 Over one to five years.......................................         0.005         0.05           0.05         0.10        0.08        0.07        0.12 Over five years..............................................         0.015         0.075          0.05         0.10        0.10        0.08        0.15 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \4\ For an OTC derivative contract with multiple exchanges of principal, the conversion factor is multiplied by the number of remaining payments in the</p><p class="depth0">derivative contract. \5\ For an OTC derivative contract that is structured such that on specified dates any outstanding exposure is settled and the terms are reset so that</p><p class="depth0">the market value of the contract is zero, the remaining maturity equals the time until the next reset date.

A State savings  association may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of  financial collateral that secures an OTC derivative contract or single- product netting set of OTC derivatives by factoring the collateral into  its LGD estimates for the contract or netting set. Alternatively, a  State savings association may recognize the credit risk mitigation  benefits of financial collateral that secures such a contract or netting  set that is marked to market on a daily basis and subject to a daily  margin maintenance requirement by estimating an unsecured LGD for the  contract or netting set and adjusting the EAD calculated under paragraph  (c)(5) or (c)(6) of this section using the collateral haircut approach  in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The State savings association must  substitute the EAD calculated under paragraph (c)(5) or (c)(6) of this  section for [Sigma]E in the equation in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this  section and must use a ten-business-day minimum holding period  (TM= 10).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Internal models methodology. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> With prior written approval  from the FDIC, a State savings association may use the internal models  methodology in this paragraph (d) to determine EAD for counterparty  credit risk for OTC derivative contracts (collateralized or  uncollateralized) and single-product netting sets thereof, for eligible  margin loans and single-product netting sets thereof, and for repo-style  transactions and single-product netting sets thereof. A State savings  association that uses the internal models methodology for a particular  transaction type (OTC derivative contracts, eligible margin loans, or  repo-style transactions) must use the internal models methodology for  all transactions of that transaction type. A State savings association  may choose to use the internal models methodology for one or two of  these three types of exposures and not the other types. A State savings  association may also use the internal models methodology for OTC  derivative contracts, eligible margin loans, and repo-style transactions  subject to a qualifying cross-product netting agreement if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State savings association effectively integrates the risk  mitigating effects of cross-product netting into its risk management and  other information technology systems; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The State savings association obtains the prior written  approval of the FDIC.

The State savings association must estimate expected exposures for OTC  derivative contracts both with and without the effect of collateral  agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The State savings association must have procedures to identify,  monitor, and control specific wrong-way risk throughout the life of an  exposure. Wrong-way risk in this context is the risk that future  exposure to a counterparty will be high when the counterparty's  probability of default is also high.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The model must use current market data to compute current  exposures. When estimating model parameters based on historical data, at  least three years of historical data that cover a wide range of economic  conditions must be used and must be updated quarterly or more frequently  if market conditions warrant. The State savings association should  consider using model parameters based on forward-looking measures, where  appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> A State savings association must subject its internal model  to an initial validation and annual model review process.

A State savings association may capture  the effect on EAD of a collateral agreement that requires receipt of  collateral when exposure to the counterparty increases but may not  capture the effect on EAD of a collateral agreement that requires  receipt of collateral when counterparty credit quality deteriorates. For  this purpose, a collateral agreement means a legal contract that  specifies the time when, and circumstances under which, the counterparty  is required to pledge collateral to the State savings association for a  single financial contract or for all financial contracts in a netting  set and confers upon the State savings association a perfected, first  priority security interest (notwithstanding the prior security interest  of any custodial agent), or the legal equivalent thereof, in the  collateral posted by the counterparty under the agreement. This security  interest must provide the State savings association with a right to  close out the financial positions and liquidate the collateral upon an  event of default of, or failure to perform by, the counterparty under  the collateral agreement. A contract would not satisfy this requirement  if the State savings association's exercise of rights under the  agreement may be stayed or avoided under applicable law in the relevant  jurisdictions. Two methods are available to capture the effect of a  collateral agreement:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With prior written approval from the FDIC, a State savings  association may include the effect of a collateral agreement within its  internal model used to calculate EAD. The State savings association may  set EAD equal to the expected exposure at the end of the margin period  of risk. The margin period of risk means, with respect to a netting set  subject to a collateral agreement, the time period from the most recent  exchange of collateral with a counterparty until the next required  exchange of collateral plus the period of time required to sell and  realize the proceeds of the least liquid collateral that can be  delivered under the terms of the collateral agreement and, where  applicable, the period of time required to re-hedge the resulting market  risk, upon the default of the counterparty. The minimum margin period of  risk is five business days for repo-style transactions and ten business  days for other transactions when liquid financial collateral is posted  under a daily margin maintenance requirement. This period should be  extended to cover any additional time between margin calls; any  potential closeout difficulties; any delays in selling collateral,  particularly if the collateral is illiquid; and any impediments to  prompt re-hedging of any market risk.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A State savings association that can model EPE without  collateral agreements but cannot achieve the higher level of modeling  sophistication to model EPE with collateral agreements can set effective  EPE for a collateralized netting set equal to the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The threshold, defined as the exposure amount at which the  counterparty is required to post collateral under the collateral  agreement, if the threshold is positive, plus an add-on that reflects  the potential increase in exposure of the netting set over the margin  period of risk. The add-on is computed as the expected increase in the  netting set's exposure beginning from current exposure of zero over the  margin period of risk. The margin period of risk must be at least five  business days for netting sets consisting only of repo-style  transactions subject to daily re-margining and daily marking-to-market,  and ten business days for all other netting sets; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Effective EPE without a collateral agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Own estimate of alpha. With prior written approval of the FDIC,  a State savings association may calculate alpha as the ratio of economic  capital from a full simulation of counterparty exposure across  counterparties that incorporates a joint simulation of market and credit  risk factors (numerator) and economic capital based on EPE  (denominator), subject to a floor of 1.2. For purposes of this  calculation, economic capital is the unexpected losses for all  counterparty credit risks measured at a 99.9 percent confidence level  over a one-year horizon. To receive approval, the State savings  association must meet the following minimum standards to the  satisfaction of the FDIC:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State savings association's own estimate of alpha must  capture in the numerator the effects of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The material sources of stochastic dependency of distributions  of market values of transactions or portfolios of transactions across  counterparties;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Volatilities and correlations of market risk factors used in the  joint simulation, which must be related to the credit risk factor used  in the simulation to reflect potential increases in volatility or  correlation in an economic downturn, where appropriate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The granularity of exposures (that is, the effect of a  concentration in the proportion of each counterparty's exposure that is  driven by a particular risk factor).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The State savings association must assess the potential model  uncertainty in its estimates of alpha.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The State savings association must calculate the numerator and  denominator of alpha in a consistent fashion with respect to modeling  methodology, parameter specifications, and portfolio composition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The State savings association must review and adjust as  appropriate its estimates of the numerator and denominator of alpha on  at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when the composition of  the portfolio varies over time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Other measures of counterparty exposure. With prior written  approval of the FDIC, a State savings association may set EAD equal to a  measure of counterparty credit risk exposure, such as peak EAD, that is  more conservative than an alpha of 1.4 (or higher under the terms of  paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) times EPE for every  counterparty whose EAD will be measured under the alternative measure of  counterparty exposure. The State savings association must demonstrate  the conservatism of the measure of counterparty credit risk exposure  used for EAD. For material portfolios of new OTC derivative products,  the State savings association may assume that the current exposure  methodology in paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(6) of this section meets the  conservatism requirement of this paragraph for a period not to exceed  180 days. For immaterial portfolios of OTC derivative contracts, the  State savings association generally may assume that the current exposure  methodology in paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(6) of this section meets the  conservatism requirement of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">Section 33.

Risk-Weighted Assets for Equity Exposures</p><p class="depth0">Section 51. Introduction and Exposure Measurement</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. To calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity  exposures that are not equity exposures to investment funds, a State  savings association may apply either the Simple Risk Weight Approach  (SRWA) in section 52 of this appendix or, if it qualifies to do so, the  Internal Models Approach (IMA) in section 53 of this appendix. A State  savings association must use the look-through approaches in section 54  of this appendix to calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity  exposures to investment funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Adjusted carrying value. For purposes of this part, the adjusted  carrying value of an equity exposure is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For the on-balance sheet component of an equity exposure, the  State savings association's carrying value of the exposure reduced by  any unrealized gains on the exposure that are reflected in such carrying  value but excluded from the State savings association's tier 1 and tier  2 capital; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For the off-balance sheet component of an equity exposure, the  effective notional principal amount of the exposure, the size of which  is equivalent to a hypothetical on-balance sheet position in the  underlying equity instrument that would evidence the same change in fair  value (measured in dollars) for a given small change in the price of the  underlying equity instrument, minus the adjusted carrying value of the  on-balance sheet component of the exposure as calculated in paragraph  (b)(1) of this section. For unfunded equity commitments that are  unconditional, the effective notional principal amount is the notional  amount of the commitment.

Simple Risk Weight Approach (SRWA)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Under the SRWA, a State savings association's aggregate  risk-weighted asset amount for its equity exposures is equal to the sum  of the risk-weighted asset amounts for each of the State savings  association's individual equity exposures (other than equity exposures  to an investment fund) as determined in this section and the risk- weighted asset amounts for each of the State savings association's  individual equity exposures to an investment fund as determined in  section 54 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 0 percent risk weight equity exposures.

If RVC is  positive, the hedge is not effective and E equals 0. If RVC is negative  and greater than or equal to -1 (that is, between zero and -1), then E  equals the absolute value of RVC.

Under this approach,  a State savings association may assign the adjusted carrying value of an  equity exposure to an investment fund on a pro rata basis to different  risk weight categories in Table 10 based on the investment limits in the  fund's prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that  defines the fund's permissible investments. The risk-weighted asset  amount for the State savings association's equity exposure to the  investment fund equals the sum of each portion of the adjusted carrying  value assigned to an exposure class multiplied by the applicable risk  weight. If the sum of the investment limits for exposure classes within  the fund exceeds 100 percent, the State savings association must assume  that the fund invests to the maximum extent permitted under its  investment limits in the exposure class with the highest risk weight  under Table 10, and continues to make investments in order of the  exposure class with the next highest risk weight under Table 10 until  the maximum total investment level is reached. If more than one exposure  class applies to an exposure, the State savings association must use the  highest applicable risk weight. A State savings association may exclude  derivative contracts held by the fund that are used for hedging rather  than for speculative purposes and do not constitute a material portion  of the fund's exposures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Money Market Fund Approach. The risk-weighted asset amount for a  State savings association's equity exposure to an investment fund that  is a money market fund subject to 17 CFR 270.2a-7 and that has an  applicable external rating in the highest investment-grade rating  category equals the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure  multiplied by 7 percent.</p><p class="depth0">Section 55. Equity Derivative Contracts</p><p class="depth0">Under the IMA, in addition to holding risk-based capital against an  equity derivative contract under this part, a State savings association  must hold risk-based capital against the counterparty credit risk in the  equity derivative contract by also treating the equity derivative  contract as a wholesale exposure and computing a supplemental risk- weighted asset amount for the contract under part IV. Under the SRWA, a  State savings association may choose not to hold risk-based capital  against the counterparty credit risk of equity derivative contracts, as  long as it does so for all such contracts. Where the equity derivative  contracts are subject to a qualified master netting agreement, a State  savings association using the SRWA must either include all or exclude  all of the contracts from any measure used to determine counterparty  credit risk exposure.</p><p class="depth0">Part VII.
