                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Administrator of General Services will determine, on the basis of the feasibility study, whether provision of a centralized service meets the criteria for increased economy, efficiency, and service, with due regard to the program and internal administrative requirements of the agencies to be served. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the head of each agency affected will be advised of the Administrator's determination and of the reasons therefor. Each determination to provide a centralized service shall include a formal report containing an explanation of the advantages to be gained, a comparison of estimated annual costs between the proposed centralized operation and separate agency operations, and a statement of the date the centralized facility will be fully operational.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> While a formal appeals procedure is not prescribed, any agency desiring to explain its inability to participate in the use of a centralized service may do so through a letter to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, with a copy to the Administrator of General Services.
