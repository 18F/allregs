At a minimum, the analysis must contain all the information needed to treat or store the waste to comply with this part and 40 CFR part 268.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may include data in the analysis that was developed under 40 CFR part 261, and published or documented data on the hazardous waste or on hazardous waste generated from similar processes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must repeat the analysis as necessary to ensure that it is accurate and up to date. At a minimum, you must repeat the analysis if the process or operation generating the hazardous wastes has changed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must develop and follow a written waste analysis plan that describes the procedures you will follow to comply with paragraph (a) of this section. You must keep this plan at the facility. If you receive wastes generated from off-site, and are eligible for a standardized permit, you also must have submitted the waste analysis plan with the Notice of Intent. At a minimum, the plan must specify all of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The hazardous waste parameters that you will analyze and the rationale for selecting these parameters (that is, how analysis for these parameters will provide sufficient information on the waste's properties to comply with paragraph (a) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The test methods you will use to test for these parameters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The sampling method you will use to obtain a representative sample of the waste to be analyzed. You may obtain a representative sample using either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> One of the sampling methods described in appendix I of 40 CFR part 261; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An equivalent sampling method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> How frequently you will review or repeat the initial analysis of the waste to ensure that the analysis is accurate and up to date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where applicable, the methods you will use to meet the additional waste analysis requirements for specific waste management methods as specified in 40 CFR 264.17, 264.1034(d), 264.1063(d), and 264.1083.</p>
