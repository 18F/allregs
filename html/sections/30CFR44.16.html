                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Time for filing. An application for temporary relief from  enforcement of a mandatory standard may be filed at any time before a  proposed decision and order is issued on a petition for modification and  shall be served upon all parties to the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> With whom filed. The application shall be filed with and decided  by the appropriate Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Investigation and decision. Upon receipt of an application for  temporary relief, the Administrator shall cause an investigation to be  made as to the merits of the application. As soon thereafter as  practicable, but in no event greater than 60 days from filing of the  application, the Administrator shall issue a decision. If the  Administrator does not issue a decision within 60 days of filing of the  application, the application shall be deemed to be denied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contents of application. An application for temporary relief  shall comply with applicable general requirements of this part, state  the specific relief requested, and include specific evidence showing how  the applicant meets the criteria set forth in paragraph (e) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Criteria. Before temporary relief is granted, the applicant must  clearly show that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The application was filed in good faith;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The requested relief will not adversely affect the health or  safety of miners in the affected mine;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An identifiable hazard to miners exists in the mine which is  caused by application of the standard at the mine;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other means will be used to reasonably address the hazard  against which the original standard was designed to protect; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Compliance with the standard while the petition for modification  is pending will expose miners to the identifiable hazard upon which the  application is based.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Response. All parties to the proceeding in which an application  for temporary relief has been filed shall have 15 days from receipt of  the application to file a written response with the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Evidence. An application for temporary relief or a response to  such an application may be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary  matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Findings. Temporary relief may be granted by the Administrator  upon a finding that application of the standard at the mine will result  in a diminution of safety to the miners at such mine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Appeal to the Office of the Administrative Law Judges. If the  application for temporary relief is granted by the Administrator, any  other party may request a hearing within 15 days of the Administrator's  decision. The request shall be addressed to the Administrator and shall  be referred by the Administrator, along with the petition for  modification, to the Chief Administrative Law Judge in accordance with  Sec. 44.15. The hearing and decision of the presiding administrative  law judge shall be in accordance with subparts C through E of this part.  After referral of the petition for modification and application for  temporary relief, no further decision shall be rendered by the  Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Duration of relief. An order granting temporary relief shall be  effective until superseded by the Administrator's proposed decision and  order, unless a hearing is requested in accordance with paragraph (i) of  this section. If such hearing is requested, the temporary relief shall  remain in effect until modified, affirmed or set aside by the presiding  administrative law judge.   In no case, however, shall the Administrator's order remain in effect  for more than one year, unless renewed or affirmed by the presiding  administrative law judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Application for relief to give effect to the proposed decision  and order. At any time following the proposed decision and order of the  Administrator on the accompanying petition for modification, any party  may request relief to give effect to the proposed decision and order  until it becomes final.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> An application for relief under paragraph (k) shall be filed  with the Administrator and shall include a good faith representation  that no party is expected to contest the granting of the petition for  modification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> A decision to grant relief requested under paragraph (k) will  take effect on the seventh day following the decision. If a request for  hearing on the proposed decision and order is filed in accordance with  Sec. 44.14 prior to the seventh day following the granting of such  relief, the relief will not become effective. If such request for  hearing on the proposed decision and order is filed after relief becomes  effective, the relief will expire immediately.  [55 FR 53441, Dec. 28, 1990]</p>
