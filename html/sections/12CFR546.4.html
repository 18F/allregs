                            <p class="depth0">A Federal savings association's board of directors may propose a  plan for dissolution of the association. The plan may provide for  either:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Appointment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (under  section 5 of the Act and section 11 of the Federal Deposit Insurance  Act, as amended or section 21A of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, as  amended) as receiver for the purpose of liquidation;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Transfer of all the association's assets to another association  or home-financing institutions under Federal or State charter either for  cash sufficient to pay all obligations of the association and retire all  outstanding accounts or in exchange for that association's payment of  all the association's outstanding obligations and issuance of share  accounts or other evidence of interest to the association's members on a  pro rata basis; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Dissolution in a manner proposed by the directors which they  consider best for all concerned.  The plan, and a statement of reasons for proposing dissolution and for  proposing the plan, shall be submitted to the OTS for approval. The OTS  will approve the plan if the OTS believes dissolution is advisable and  the plan best for all concerned, but if the OTS considers the plan  inadvisable, the OTS may either make recommendations to the association  concerning the plan or disapprove it. When the plan is approved by the  association's board of directors and by the OTS, it shall be submitted  to the association's members at a duly called meeting and, when approved  by a majority of votes cast at that meeting, shall become effective.  After dissolution in accordance with the plan, a certificate evidencing  dissolution, supported by such evidence as the OTS may require, shall  immediately be filed with the OTS. When the OTS receives such evidence  satisfactory to the OTS, it will terminate the corporate existence of  the dissolved association and the association's charter shall thereby be  canceled. A Federal savings association is not required to obtain  approval under this section where the Federal savings association  transfers all of its assets and liabilities to a bank in a transaction  that is subject to Sec. 563.22(b) of this chapter.
