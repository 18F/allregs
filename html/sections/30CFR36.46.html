                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Explosion tests to determine the strength of the intake and  exhaust systems to withstand internal explosions and the adequacy of the  flame arresters to prevent the propagation of an explosion shall be made  with the systems connected to the engine or the systems simulated as  connected to the engine. The system shall be filled with and surrounded  by an explosive natural gas-air mixture. The mixture within the intake  and exhaust systems shall be ignited by suitable means and the internal  pressure developed by the resultant explosion shall be determined. Tests  shall be conducted with the ignition source in several different  locations to determine the maximum pressure developed by an internal  explosion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Explosion tests shall be made with the engine at rest and with  the flammable natural gas-air mixtures in the intake and exhaust  systems. In other tests with the flammable mixture in motion, the engine  shall be driven (externally) at speeds prescribed by MSHA but no liquid  fuel shall be supplied to the injection valves.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The temperature of the flame arresters in the intake or exhaust  systems shall not exceed 212 [deg]F. when an explosion test is  conducted. Any water-spray cooling for the exhaust system shall not be  operated and water shall not be present in the exhaust cooling boxes  except when water is the cooling agent for a cooling box designed to act  as a flame arrester, in which case MSHA will prescribe the test  conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The explosion tests of the intake and exhaust systems shall not  result in:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Discharge of visible flame from any joint or opening.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ignition of surrounding flammable gas-air mixture.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Development of dangerous afterburning. \4\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\4\ The term ``afterburning'' as used in this part is applied to  combustion of a flammable gas-air mixture drawn into the system under  test by the cooling of the products from an explosion in the system. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Excessive pressures.</p>
