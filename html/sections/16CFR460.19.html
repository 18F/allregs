                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you say or imply in your ads, labels, or other promotional  materials that insulation can cut fuel bills or fuel use, you must have  a reasonable basis for the claim. For example, if you say that  insulation can ``slash'' or ``lower'' fuel bills, or that insulation  ``saves money,'' you must have a reasonable basis for the claim. Also,  if you say that insulation can ``cut fuel use in half,'' or ``lower fuel  bills by 30%,'' you must have a reasonable basis for the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you say or imply in your ads, labels, or other promotional  materials that insulation can cut fuel bills or fuel use, you must make  this statement about savings: ``Savings vary. Find out why in the  seller's fact sheet on R-values. Higher R-values mean greater insulating  power.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you say or imply that a combination of products can cut fuel  bills or use, you must have a reasonable basis for the claim. You must  make the statement about savings in paragraph (b) of this section. Also,  you must list the combination of products used. They may be two or more  types of insulation; one or more types of insulation and one or more  other insulating products, like storm windows or siding; or insulation  for two or more parts of the house, like the attic and walls. You must  say how much of the savings came from each product or location. If you  cannot give exact or approximate figures, you must give a ranking. For  instance, if your ad says that insulation and storm doors combined to  cut fuel use by 50%, you must say which one saved more.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>, and also makes a savings claim, you must  follow the rules in Sec. Sec. 460.18 and 460.19. However, you need not  make the statement explaining R-value in Sec. 460.18(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Manufacturers are liable if they do not have a reasonable basis  for their savings claims before the claim is made. If you are not a  manufacturer, you are liable only if you know or should know that the  manufacturer does not have a reasonable basis for the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Keep records of all data on savings claims for at least three  years. For the records showing proof for claims, the three years will  begin again each time you make the claim. Federal Trade Commission staff  members can check these records at any time, but they must give you  reasonable notice first.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The affirmative disclosure requirements in Sec. 460.19 do not  apply to ads on television or radio.
