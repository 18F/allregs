You must follow the procedures in paragraphs (e) through (o) of this section to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.3090(a) or Sec. 63.3091(a). You may also use the guidelines presented in ``Protocol for Determining Daily Volatile Organic Compound Emission Rate of Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Topcoat Operations,'' EPA-450/3-88-018 (Docket ID No. OAR-2002-0093 and Docket ID No. A-2001-22) in making this demonstration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Determine the mass fraction of organic HAP, density, and volume used. Follow the procedures specified in Sec. 63.3151(a) through (c) to determine the mass fraction of organic HAP and the density and volume of each coating and thinner used during each month. For electrodeposition primer operations, the mass fraction of organic HAP, density, and volume used must be determined for each material added to the tank or system during each month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Determine the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating. You must determine the volume fraction of coating solids (liter of coating solids per liter of coating) for each coating used during the compliance period by a test or by information provided by the supplier or the manufacturer of the material, as specified in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section. For electrodeposition primer operations, the volume fraction of solids must be determined for each material added to the tank or system during each month. If test results obtained according to paragraph (f)(1) of this section do not agree with the information obtained under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the test results will take precedence unless, after consultation, the facility demonstrates to the satisfaction of the enforcement authority that the facility's data are correct.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> ASTM Method D2697-86 (Reapproved 1998) or ASTM Method D6093-97 (Reapproved 2003).

Emission Rate of Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Topcoat Operations,'' EPA-450/3-88-018 (Docket ID No. OAR-2002-0093 and Docket ID No. A-2001-22).

You may assume 100 percent transfer efficiency for electrodeposition primer coatings, glass bonding primers, and glass bonding adhesives. For final repair coatings, you may assume 40 percent transfer efficiency for air atomized spray and 55 percent transfer efficiency for electrostatic spray and high volume, low pressure spray. For blackout, chip resistant edge primer, interior color, in-line repair, lower body anti-chip coatings, or underbody anti-chip coatings, you may assume 40 percent transfer efficiency for air atomized spray, 55 percent transfer efficiency for electrostatic spray and high volume-low pressure spray, and 80 percent transfer efficiency for airless spray.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Calculate the total mass of organic HAP emissions before add-on controls.

Determine the mass of organic HAP emissions reduced for each controlled coating operation during each month. The emission reduction determination quantifies the total organic HAP emissions captured by the emission capture system and destroyed or removed by the add-on control device. Use the procedures in paragraph (j) of this section to calculate the mass of organic HAP emission reduction for each controlled coating operation using an emission capture system and add-on control device other than a solvent recovery system for which you

conduct liquid-liquid material balances. For each controlled coating operation using a solvent recovery system for which you conduct a liquid-liquid material balance, use the procedures in paragraph (k) of this section to calculate the organic HAP emission reduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Calculate the organic HAP emission reduction for each controlled coating operation not using liquid-liquid material balances.

The calculation of mass of organic HAP emission reduction for the controlled coating operation during the month applies the emission capture system efficiency and add-on control device efficiency to the mass of organic HAP contained in the coatings and thinners that are used in the coating operation served by the emission capture system and add-on control device during each month. Except as provided in paragraph (p) of this section, for any period of time in which a deviation, including a deviation during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, from an operating limit or from any CPMS requirement of the capture system or control device serving the controlled coating operation occurred, you must assume zero efficiency for the emission capture system and add-on control device.

the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.3090(a) or Sec. 63.3091(a) and you achieved the operating limits required by Sec. 63.3093 and the work practice standards required by Sec. 63.3094.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> You may request approval from the Administrator to use non-zero capture efficiencies and add-on control device efficiencies for any period of time in which a deviation, including a deviation during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, from an operating limit or from any CPMS requirement for the capture system or add-on control device serving a controlled coating operation occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If you have manually collected parameter data indicating that a capture system or add-on control device was operating normally during a CPMS malfunction, a CPMS out-of-control period, or associated repair, then these data may be used to support and document your request to use the normal capture efficiency or add-on control device efficiency for that period of deviation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If you have data indicating the actual performance of a capture system or add-on control device (e.g., capture efficiency measured at a reduced flow rate or add-on control device efficiency measured at a reduced thermal oxidizer temperature) during a deviation, including a deviation during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, from an operating limit or from any CPMS requirement for the capture system or add-on control device serving a controlled coating operation, then these data may be used to support and document your request to use these values for that period of deviation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The organic HAP emission reduction achieved during each period of deviation, including a deviation during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, from an operating limit or from any CPMS requirement for the capture system or add-on control device serving a controlled coating operation for which the Administrator has approved the use of non-zero capture efficiency and add-on control device efficiency values is calculated using Equation 8 of this section.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26AP04.015
