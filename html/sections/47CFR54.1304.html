Only those local exchange carriers that qualified for safety net additive based on 2011 or prior year costs shall be eligible to receive safety net additive pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. A local exchange carrier shall not receive safety net additive unless the carrier's realized total growth in Telecommunications Plant in Service (TPIS) was more than 14 percent in 2011 or earlier, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Calculation of safety net additive support for companies that qualified based on 2011 or prior year costs. Safety net additive support is equal to the amount of capped support calculated pursuant to this subpart M in the qualifying year minus the amount of support in the year prior to qualifying for support subtracted from the difference between the uncapped expense adjustment for the study area in the qualifying year minus the uncapped expense adjustment in the year prior to qualifying for support as shown in the following equation: Safety net additive support = (Uncapped support in the qualifying year-Uncapped support in the base year)-(Capped support in the qualifying year-Amount of support received in the base year).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Operation of safety net additive support for companies that qualified based on 2011 or prior year costs. (1) In any year in which the total carrier loop cost expense adjustment is limited by the provisions of Sec. 54.1302, a rate-of-return incumbent local exchange carrier shall receive safety net additive support as calculated in paragraph (b) of this section, if in any study area, the rural incumbent local exchange carrier realizes growth in end of period TPIS, as prescribed in Sec. 32.2001, on a per loop basis, of at least 14 percent more than the study area's TPIS per loop investment at the end of the prior period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In any year in which the total carrier loop cost expense adjustment is limited by the provisions of Sec. 54.1302, a rate-of-return incumbent local exchange carrier shall receive safety net additive support as calculated in paragraph (b) of this section, if in any study area, the rural incumbent local exchange carrier realizes growth in end of period TPIS, as prescribed in Sec. 32.2001, on a per loop basis, of at least 14 percent more than the study area's TPIS per loop investment at the end of the prior period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If paragraph (c)(1) of this section is met, the rural incumbent local exchange carrier must notify the Administrator; failure to properly notify the Administrator of eligibility shall result in disqualification of that study area for safety net additive, requiring the rural incumbent local exchange carrier to again meet the eligibility requirements in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for that study area in a subsequent period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon completion of verification by the Administrator that the study area meets the stated criterion in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section, the Administrator shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Pay to any qualifying rural telephone company safety net additive support for the qualifying study area in accordance with the calculation set forth in paragraph (b) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Continue to pay safety net additive support in any of the four succeeding years in which the total carrier loop expense adjustment is limited by the provisions of Sec. 54.1302. Safety net additive support in the succeeding four years shall be the lesser of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The sum of capped support and the safety net additive support received in the qualifying year; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The rural telephone company's uncapped support.</p>
