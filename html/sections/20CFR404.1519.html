                            <p class="depth0">A consultative examination is a physical or mental examination or test purchased for you at our request and expense from a treating source or another medical source, including a pediatrician when appropriate. The decision to purchase a consultative examination will be made on an individual case basis in accordance with the provisions of Secs. 404.1519a through 404.1519f. Selection of the source for the examination will be consistent with the provisions of Sec. 404.1503a and Secs. 404.1519g through 404.1519j. The rules and procedures for requesting consultative examinations set forth in Secs. 404.1519a and 404.1519b are applicable at the reconsideration and hearing levels of review, as well as the initial level of determination.

Sec. 404.1519a  When we will purchase a consultative examinationand how we will use it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. If we cannot get the information we need from your medical sources, we may decide to purchase a consultative examination. See Sec. 404.1512 for the procedures we will follow to obtain evidence from your medical sources and Sec. 404.1520b for how we consider evidence. Before purchasing a consultative examination, we will consider not only existing medical reports, but also the disability interview form containing your allegations as well as other pertinent evidence in your file.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Situations that may require a consultative examination. We may purchase a consultative examination to try to resolve an inconsistency in the evidence, or when the evidence as a whole is insufficient to allow us to make a determination or decision on your claim. Some examples of when we might purchase a consultative examination to secure needed medical evidence, such as clinical findings, laboratory tests, a diagnosis, or prognosis, include but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The additional evidence needed is not contained in the records of your medical sources;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The evidence that may have been available from your treating or other medical sources cannot be obtained for reasons beyond your control, such as death or noncooperation of a medical source;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Highly technical or specialized medical evidence that we need is not available from your treating or other medical sources; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> There is an indication of a change in your condition that is likely to affect your ability to work, but the current severity of your impairment is not established.

Sec. 404.1519f  Type of purchased examinations.</p><p class="depth0">We will purchase only the specific examinations and tests we need to make a determination in your claim. For example, we will not authorize a comprehensive medical examination when the only evidence we need is a special test, such as an X-ray, blood studies, or an electrocardiogram.

Sec. 404.1519g  Who we will select to perform a consultative examination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> We will purchase a consultative examination only from a qualified medical source. The medical source may be your own physician or psychologist, or another source. If you are a child, the medical source we choose may be a pediatrician. For a more complete list of medical sources, see Sec. 404.1513.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> By ``qualified,'' we mean that the medical source must be currently licensed in the State and have the training and experience to perform the type of examination or test we will request; the medical source must not be barred from participation in our programs under the provisions of Sec. 404.1503a. The medical source must also have the equipment required to provide an adequate assessment and record of the existence and level of severity of your alleged impairments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The medical source we choose may use support staff to help perform the consultative examination. Any such support staff (e.g., X-ray technician, nurse) must meet appropriate licensing or certification requirements of the State. See Sec. 404.1503a.

Sec. 404.1519h  Your treating source.</p><p class="depth0">When in our judgment your treating source is qualified, equipped, and willing to perform the additional examination or tests for the fee schedule payment, and generally furnishes complete and timely reports, your treating source will be the preferred source to do the purchased examination. Even if only a supplemental test is required, your treating source is ordinarily the preferred source.
[65 FR 11876, Mar. 7, 2000]


Sec. 404.1519i  Other sources for consultative examinations.</p><p class="depth0">We will use a medical source other than your treating source for a purchased examination or test in situations including, but not limited to, the following situations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Your treating source prefers not to perform such an examination or does not have the equipment to provide the specific data needed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> There are conflicts or inconsistencies in your file that cannot be resolved by going back to your treating source;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> You prefer a source other than your treating source and have a good reason for your preference;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> We know from prior experience that your treating source may not be a productive source, e.g., he or she has consistently failed to provide complete or timely reports.
[65 FR 11876, Mar. 7, 2000]


Sec. 404.1519j  Objections to the medical source designated to performthe consultative examination.</p><p class="depth0">You or your representative may object to your being examined by a medical source we have designated to perform a consultative examination. If there is a good reason for the objection, we will schedule the examination with another medical source. A good reason may be that the medical source we designated had previously represented an interest adverse to you. For example, the medical source may have represented your employer in a workers' compensation case or may have been involved in an insurance claim or legal action adverse to you. Other things we will consider include: The presence of a language barrier, the medical source's office location (e.g., 2nd floor, no elevator), travel restrictions, and whether the medical source had examined you in connection with a previous disability determination or decision that was unfavorable to you. If your objection is that a medical source allegedly ``lacks objectivity'' in general, but not in relation to you personally, we will review the allegations. See Sec. 404.1519s. To avoid a delay in processing your claim, the consultative examination in your case will be changed to another medical source while a review is being conducted. We will handle any objection to use of the substitute medical source in the same manner. However, if we had previously conducted such a review and found that the reports of the medical source in question conformed to our guidelines, we will not change your examination.

Sec. 404.1519k  Purchase of medical examinations, laboratory tests,and other services.</p><p class="depth0">We may purchase medical examinations, including psychiatric and psychological examinations, X-rays and laboratory tests (including specialized tests, such as pulmonary function studies, electrocardiograms, and stress tests) from a medical source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The rate of payment for purchasing medical or other services necessary to make determinations of disability may not exceed the highest rate paid by Federal or public agencies in the State for the same or similar types of service. See Secs. 404.1624 and 404.1626 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If a physician's bill or a request for payment for a physician's services includes a charge for a laboratory test for which payment may be made under this part, the amount payable with respect to the test shall be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the bill or request for payment indicates that the test was personally performed or supervised by the physician who submitted the bill (or for whose services the request for payment was made) or by another physician with whom that physician shares his or her practice, the payment will be based on the physician's usual and customary charge for the test or the rates of payment which the State uses for purchasing such services, whichever is the lesser amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the bill or request for payment indicates that the test was performed by an independent laboratory, the amount of reimbursement will not exceed the billed cost of the independent laboratory or the rate of payment which the State uses for purchasing such services, whichever is the lesser amount. A nominal payment may be made to the physician for collecting, handling and shipping a specimen to the laboratory if the physician bills for such a service. The total reimbursement may not exceed the rate of payment which the State uses for purchasing such services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The State will assure that it can support the rate of payment it uses. The State shall also be responsible for monitoring and overseeing the rate of payment it uses to ensure compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

Sec. 404.1519m  Diagnostic tests or procedures.</p><p class="depth0">We will request the results of any diagnostic tests or procedures that have been performed as part of a workup by your treating source or other medical source and will use the results to help us evaluate impairment severity or prognosis. However, we will not order diagnostic tests or procedures that involve significant risk to you, such as myelograms, arteriograms, or cardiac catheterizations for the evaluation of disability under the Social Security program. A State agency medical consultant must approve the ordering of any diagnostic test or procedure when there is a chance it may involve significant risk. The responsibility for deciding whether to perform the examination rests with the medical source designated to perform the consultative examination.

Sec. 404.1519n  Informing the medical source of examination scheduling,report content, and signature requirements.</p><p class="depth0">The medical sources who perform consultative examinations will have a good understanding of our disability programs and their evidentiary requirements. They will be made fully aware of their responsibilities and obligations regarding confidentiality as described in Sec. 401.105(e). We will fully inform medical sources who perform consultative examinations at the time we first contact them, and at subsequent appropriate intervals, of the following obligations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scheduling. In scheduling full consultative examinations, sufficient time should be allowed to permit the medical source to take a case history and perform the examination, including any needed tests. The following minimum scheduling intervals (i.e., time set aside for the individual, not the actual duration of the consultative examination) should be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Comprehensive general medical examination--at least 30 minutes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Comprehensive musculoskeletal or neurological examination--at least 20 minutes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Comprehensive psychiatric examination--at least 40 minutes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Psychological examination--at least 60 minutes (Additional time may be required depending on types of psychological tests administered); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> All others--at least 30 minutes, or in accordance with accepted medical practices.

We recognize that actual practice will dictate that some examinations may require longer scheduling intervals depending on the circumstances in a particular situation. We also recognize that these minimum intervals may have to be adjusted to allow for those claimants who do not attend their scheduled examination. The purpose of these minimum scheduling timeframes is to ensure that such examinations are complete and that sufficient time is made available to obtain the information needed to make an accurate determination in your case. State agencies will monitor the scheduling of examinations (through their normal consultative examination oversight activities) to ensure that any overscheduling is avoided, as overscheduling may lead to examinations that are not thorough.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Report content. The reported results of your medical history, examination, requested laboratory findings, discussions and conclusions must conform to accepted professional standards and practices in the medical field for a complete and competent examination. The facts in a particular case and the information and findings already reported in the medical and other evidence of record will dictate the extent of detail needed in the consultative examination report for that case. Thus, the detail and format for reporting the results of a purchased examination will vary depending upon the type of examination or testing requested. The reporting of information will differ from one type of examination to another when the requested examination relates to the performance of tests such as ventilatory function tests, treadmill exercise tests, or audiological tests. The medical report must be complete enough to help us determine the nature, severity, and duration of the impairment, and residual functional capacity. The report should reflect your

statement of your symptoms, not simply the medical source's statements or conclusions. The medical source's report of the consultative examination should include the objective medical facts as well as observations and opinions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Elements of a complete consultative examination. A complete consultative examination is one which involves all the elements of a standard examination in the applicable medical specialty. When the report of a complete consultative examination is involved, the report should include the following elements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Your major or chief complaint(s);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A detailed description, within the area of specialty of the examination, of the history of your major complaint(s);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A description, and disposition, of pertinent ``positive'' and ``negative'' detailed findings based on the history, examination and laboratory tests related to the major complaint(s), and any other abnormalities or lack thereof reported or found during examination or laboratory testing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The results of laboratory and other tests (e.g., X-rays) performed according to the requirements stated in the Listing of Impairments (see appendix 1 of this subpart P);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The diagnosis and prognosis for your impairment(s);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A statement about what you can still do despite your impairment(s), unless the claim is based on statutory blindness. This statement should describe the opinion of the medical source about your ability, despite your impairment(s), to do work-related activities, such as sitting, standing, walking, lifting, carrying, handling objects, hearing, speaking, and traveling; and, in cases of mental impairment(s), the opinion of the medical source about your ability to understand, to carry out and remember instructions, and to respond appropriately to supervision, coworkers and work pressures in a work setting. Although we will ordinarily request, as part of the consultative examination process, a medical source statement about what you can still do despite your impairment(s), the absence of such a statement in a consultative examination report will not make the report incomplete. See Sec. 404.1527; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> In addition, the medical source will consider, and provide some explanation or comment on, your major complaint(s) and any other abnormalities found during the history and examination or reported from the laboratory tests. The history, examination, evaluation of laboratory test results, and the conclusions will represent the information provided by the medical source who signs the report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> When a complete consultative examination is not required. When the evidence we need does not require a complete consultative examination (for example, we need only a specific laboratory test result to complete the record), we may not require a report containing all of the elements in paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Signature requirements. All consultative examination reports will be personally reviewed and signed by the medical source who actually performed the examination. This attests to the fact that the medical source doing the examination or testing is solely responsible for the report contents and for the conclusions, explanations or comments provided with respect to the history, examination and evaluation of laboratory test results. The signature of the medical source on a report annotated ``not proofed'' or ``dictated but not read'' is not acceptable. A rubber stamp signature of a medical source or the medical source's signature entered by any other person is not acceptable.

Sec. 404.1519o  When a properly signed consultative examinationreport has not been received.</p><p class="depth0">If a consultative examination report is received unsigned or improperly signed we will take the following action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> When we will make determinations and decisions without a properly signed report. We will make a determination or decision in the circumstances specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section without waiting for a properly signed consultative examination report. After we have made the determination or decision, we will obtain a

We will not use an unsigned or improperly signed consultative examination report to make the determinations or decisions specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section. When we need a properly signed consultative examination report to make these determinations or decisions, we must obtain such a report. If the signature of the medical source who performed the original examination cannot be obtained because the medical source is out of the country for an extended period of time, or on an extended vacation, seriously ill, deceased, or for any other reason, the consultative examination will be rescheduled with another medical source:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Denial; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cessation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Allowance of a period of disability which has ended; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Allowance with an onset date later than alleged.

Sec. 404.1519p  Reviewing reports of consultative examinations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> We will review the report of the consultative examination to determine whether the specific information requested has been furnished. We will consider the following factors in reviewing the report:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Whether the report provides evidence which serves as an adequate basis for decisionmaking in terms of the impairment it assesses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Whether the report is internally consistent; Whether all the diseases, impairments and complaints described in the history are adequately assessed and reported in the clinical findings; Whether the conclusions correlate the findings from your medical history, clinical examination and laboratory tests and explain all abnormalities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whether the report is consistent with the other information available to us within the specialty of the examination requested; Whether the report fails to mention an important or relevant complaint within that specialty that is noted in other evidence in the file (e.g., your blindness in one eye, amputations, pain, alcoholism, depression);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Whether this is an adequate report of examination as compared to standards set out in the course of a medical education; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Whether the report is properly signed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the report is inadequate or incomplete, we will contact the medical source who performed the consultative examination, give an explanation of our evidentiary needs, and ask that the medical source furnish the missing information or prepare a revised report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> With your permission, or when the examination discloses new diagnostic information or test results that reveal a potentially life-threatening situation, we will refer the consultative examination report to your treating source. When we refer the consultative examination report to your treating source without your permission, we will notify you that we have done so.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> We will perform ongoing special management studies on the quality of consultative examinations purchased from major medical sources and the appropriateness of the examinations authorized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> We will take steps to ensure that consultative examinations are scheduled only with medical sources who have access to the equipment required to provide an adequate assessment and record of the existence and level of severity of your alleged impairments.

Sec. 404.1519q  Conflict of interest.</p><p class="depth0">All implications of possible conflict of interest between medical or psychological consultants and their medical or psychological practices will be avoided. Such consultants are not only those physicians and psychologists who work for us directly but are also those who do review and adjudication work in the State agencies. Physicians and

psychologists who work for us directly as employees or under contract will not work concurrently for a State agency. Physicians and psychologists who do review work for us will not perform consultative examinations for us without our prior approval. In such situations, the physician or psychologist will disassociate himself or herself from further involvement in the case and will not participate in the evaluation, decision, or appeal actions. In addition, neither they, nor any member of their families, will acquire or maintain, either directly or indirectly, any financial interest in a medical partnership, corporation, or similar relationship in which consultative examinations are provided. Sometimes physicians and psychologists who do review work for us will have prior knowledge of a case; for example, when the claimant was a patient. Where this is so, the physician or psychologist will not participate in the review or determination of the case. This does not preclude the physician or psychologist from submitting medical evidence based on treatment or examination of the claimant.
