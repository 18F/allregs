                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Voluntary. An acquiring person, and in the case of an  acquisition to which Sec. 801.30 does not apply, an acquired person,  may withdraw its notification by notifying the Federal Trade Commission  and the Antitrust Division in writing of such withdrawal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon public announcement of termination. An acquiring person's  notification or, in the case of an acquisition to which Sec. 801.30 of  this chapter does not apply, an acquiring or an acquired person's  notification, will be deemed to have been withdrawn if any filing that  publicly announces the expiration, termination or withdrawal of a tender  offer or the termination of an agreement or letter of intent is made by  the acquiring person or the acquired person with the U.S. Securities and  Exchange Commission (``SEC'') under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) and rules promulgated under that act. The  acquiring person or acquired person must notify the Federal Trade  Commission and the Antitrust Division by letter that such filing has  been made with the SEC and the withdrawal shall be deemed effective on  the date of the SEC filing. Withdrawal of the HSR notification(s) shall  occur even if statements are made in the SEC filing indicating a desire  to recommence the tender offer or enter into a new or amended agreement  or letter of intent. This paragraph is inapplicable if the initial 15- day or 30-day waiting period has expired without issuance of a request  for additional information or documentary material and without an  agreement in place with the Agencies to delay closing of the transaction  (``a timing agreement''); or early termination of that waiting period  has been granted, without a timing agreement in place; or if a request  for additional information or documentary material has been issued and  the Agencies have either granted early termination or allowed the  extended waiting period to expire following certification of compliance  without a timing agreement in place.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Resubmission without a new filing fee. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An acquiring person  whose notification has been voluntarily withdrawn pursuant to paragraph  (a) of this section, or an acquiring person whose notification is deemed  to have been automatically withdrawn under paragraph (b) of this  section, may resubmit its notification, thereby initiating a new waiting  period for the same transaction without an additional filing fee  pursuant to Sec. 803.9(f). This procedure may be used only one time,  and only under the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The proposed acquisition does not change in any material way;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The resubmitted notification is recertified, and the  submission, as it relates to Items 4(a), 4(b), 4(c), and 4(d), is  updated to the date of the resubmission;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A new executed affidavit is provided with the resubmitted HSR  filing; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The resubmitted notification is refiled prior to the close of  the second business day after withdrawal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the acquired person, in the case of an acquisition to which  Sec. 801.30 of this chapter does not apply, withdraws its notification  under paragraph (a) of this section or if its notification is  automatically withdrawn under paragraph (b) of this section, no  resubmission is available under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3">Examples: 1. A commences a tender offer to acquire 100% of B's  voting securities and files a Schedule TO with the SEC and a premerger  notification   filing with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division  (``the Agencies''). Subsequently, A decides to withdraw the tender offer  and files an amended Schedule TO announcing the withdrawal. A states in  its amended filing, designated as a Schedule TO-T/A on EDGAR, the SEC's  Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system, which  announces the tender offer withdrawal that it reserves the right to  recommence the tender offer, should circumstances change. A's premerger  notification filing is deemed to have been withdrawn on the date of the  filing of the Schedule TO-T/A with the SEC.</p><p class="depth3">2. A commences a tender offer for at least 75% of B's voting  securities and files a Schedule TO with the SEC stating that the tender  offer will expire after 30 days. A also files a premerger notification  filing with the Agencies and a request for additional information or  documentary material (``Second Request'') is issued. At the end of the  30 day effective period of the tender offer sufficient shares have not  been tendered and the tender offer expires. A files a closing Schedule  TO-T/A with the SEC announcing the expiration of the tender offer. A's  premerger notification filing is deemed to have been withdrawn on the  date of the filing of the Schedule TO-T/A with the SEC.</p><p class="depth3">3. A commences a tender offer for 100% of B's voting securities and  files a Schedule TO with the SEC stating that shareholders tendering  their shares will receive $2.00 per share. During the effective period  of the tender offer, A increases the amount it will pay per share to  $2.25 and files a Schedule TO-T/A with the SEC announcing the increased  share price. A's premerger notification filing is not deemed to have  been withdrawn on the date of the filing of the Schedule TO-T/A with the  SEC because it is not notifying the SEC that the tender offer has  expired or is being withdrawn.</p><p class="depth3">4. A commences a tender offer for 100% of B's voting securities and  files a Schedule TO with the SEC. During the effective period of the  tender offer, A and B enter into a merger agreement and A files a  Schedule TO-T/A with the SEC announcing the withdrawal of the tender  offer. A's premerger notification filing is deemed to have been  withdrawn on the date of the filing of the Schedule TO-T/A with the SEC.  A can, however, refile within two business days on the merger agreement,  commencing a new waiting period, without paying an additional filing  fee, if it meets the requirements of Sec. 803.12(c).</p><p class="depth3">5. A and B enter into a merger agreement conditioned on successful  completion of due diligence. A and B file premerger notification filings  with the Agencies and also Form 8-Ks with the SEC announcing they have  entered into an agreement to merge. Subsequent findings in the course of  due diligence cause A and B to terminate the merger agreement and A  files an additional Form 8-K announcing the termination of an agreement.  A states that it may seek to enter into a new or amended merger  agreement with B. A's premerger notification filing is deemed to have  been withdrawn on the date of the filing of the Form 8-K announcing the  termination of the merger agreement. A can, however, refile within two  business days on a new merger agreement, commencing a new waiting  period, without paying an additional filing fee, if it meets the  requirements of Sec. 803.12(c).</p><p class="depth3">6. A and B enter into a merger agreement and file premerger  notification filings with the Agencies and Form 8-Ks with the SEC.  Second requests are issued. A and B subsequently certify compliance with  the second request, starting the extended waiting period. Prior to the  expiration of the extended waiting period, the parties enter into an  agreement with the agency conducting the investigation to delay closing  of the transaction, allowing the consummation of the acquisition only  after 30-days' notice (a ``timing agreement''), and the extended waiting  period expires. During the pendency of the timing agreement, A and B  terminate the merger agreement and A files a Form 8-K with the SEC  announcing the termination of an agreement. A's premerger notification  filing is deemed withdrawn on the date of the SEC filing as a result of  that filing, even though the extended waiting period has expired and the  parties are still within the one year period following that expiration  under Sec. 803.7(a). Note that had   the extended waiting period expired and no timing agreement had been  entered into, a filing with the SEC announcing the termination of the  agreement would not result in the withdrawal of A's premerger  notification filing.</p><p class="depth3">7. A and B enter into a merger agreement and file premerger  notification filings with the Agencies and Form 8-Ks with the SEC. The  agencies complete their review and early termination of the initial 30- day waiting period is granted. Prior to the expiration of the one year  period following the grant of early termination, A and B terminate the  merger agreement and A files a Form 8-K with the SEC announcing the  termination of an agreement. A's premerger notification filing is not  deemed withdrawn as a result of the SEC filing because the initial 30- day premerger notification waiting period had been granted early  termination. Therefore, the parties still have the full one year period  prior to the expiration of the notification under Sec. 803.7(a) to  consummate the transaction should it be recommenced.
