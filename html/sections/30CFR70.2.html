                            <p class="depth0">The following definitions apply in this part.</p><p class="depth0">Act. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, Public Law 91- 173, as amended by Public Law 95-164 and Public Law 109-236.</p><p class="depth0">Active workings. Any place in a coal mine where miners are normally  required to work or travel.</p><p class="depth0">Approved sampling device. A sampling device approved by the  Secretary and Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) under part 74  of this title.</p><p class="depth0">Certified person. An individual certified by the Secretary in  accordance with Sec. 70.202 to take respirable dust samples required by  this part or certified in accordance with Sec. 70.203 to perform the  maintenance and calibration of respirable dust sampling equipment as  required by this part.</p><p class="depth0">Coal mine dust personal sampler unit (CMDPSU). A personal sampling  device approved under part 74, subpart B, of this title.</p><p class="depth0">Concentration. A measure of the amount of a substance contained per  unit volume of air.</p><p class="depth0">Continuous personal dust monitor (CPDM). A personal sampling device  approved under part 74, subpart C of this title.</p><p class="depth0">Designated area (DA). A specific location in the mine identified by  the operator in the mine ventilation plan under Sec. 75.371(t) of this  title where samples will be collected to measure respirable dust  generation sources in the active workings; approved by the District  Manager; and assigned a four-digit identification number by MSHA.</p><p class="depth0">Designated occupation (DO). The occupation on a mechanized mining  unit (MMU) that has been determined by results of respirable dust  samples to have the greatest respirable dust concentration.</p><p class="depth0">District Manager. The manager of the Coal Mine Safety and Health  District in which the mine is located.</p><p class="depth0">Equivalent concentration. The concentration of respirable coal mine  dust, including quartz, expressed in milligrams per cubic meter of air  (mg/m\3\) as measured with an approved sampling device, determined by  dividing the weight of dust in milligrams collected on the filter of an  approved sampling device by the volume of air in cubic meters passing  through the filter (sampling time in minutes (t) times the sampling  airflow rate in cubic meters per minute), and then converting that  concentration to an equivalent concentration as measured by the Mining  Research Establishment (MRE) instrument. When the approved sampling  device is:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The CMDPSU, the equivalent concentration is determined by  multiplying the concentration of respirable coal mine dust by the  constant factor prescribed by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The CPDM, the device shall be programmed to automatically report  end-of-shift concentration measurements as equivalent concentrations.</p><p class="depth0">Mechanized mining unit (MMU). A unit of mining equipment including  hand loading equipment used for the production of material; or a  specialized unit which uses mining equipment other than specified in  Sec. 70.206(b) or in Sec. 70.208(b) of this part. Each MMU will be  assigned a four-digit identification number by MSHA, which is retained  by the MMU regardless of where the unit relocates within the mine.  However, when:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Two sets of mining equipment are used in a series of working  places within the same working section and only one production crew is  employed at any given time on either set of mining equipment, the two  sets of equipment shall be identified as a single MMU.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Two or more sets of mining equipment are simultaneously engaged  in cutting, mining, or loading coal or rock from working places within  the same working section, each set of mining equipment shall be  identified as a separate MMU.</p><p class="depth2">MRE instrument. The gravimetric dust sampler with a four channel  horizontal elutriator developed by the Mining Research Establishment of  the National Coal Board, London, England.</p><p class="depth2">MSHA. The Mine Safety and Health Administration of the U.S.  Department of Labor.</p><p class="depth2">Normal production shift. A production shift during which the amount  of material produced by an MMU is at least equal to 80 percent of the  average production recorded by the operator for the most recent 30  production shifts or for all production shifts if fewer than 30 shifts  of production data are available.</p><p class="depth2">Other designated occupation (ODO). Other occupation on an MMU that  is designated for sampling required by this part in addition to the DO.  Each ODO shall be identified by a four-digit identification number  assigned by MSHA.</p><p class="depth2">Production shift. With regard to an MMU, a shift during which  material is produced; with regard to a DA of a mine, a shift during  which material is produced and routine day-to-day activities are  occurring in the DA.</p><p class="depth2">Quartz. Crystalline silicon dioxide (SiO2) not chemically  combined with other substances and having a distinctive physical  structure.</p><p class="depth2">Representative sample. A respirable dust sample, expressed as an  equivalent concentration, that reflects typical dust concentration  levels and with regard to an MMU, normal mining activities in the active  workings during which the amount of material produced is equivalent to a  normal production shift; or with regard to a DA, material is produced  and routine-day-to-day activities are occurring.</p><p class="depth2">Respirable dust. Dust collected with a sampling device approved by  the Secretary and the Secretary of HHS in accordance with part 74 (Coal  Mine Dust Sampling Devices) of this title.</p><p class="depth2">Secretary. The Secretary of Labor or a delegate.</p><p class="depth2">Valid respirable dust sample. A respirable dust sample collected and  submitted as required by this part, including any sample for which the  data were   electronically transmitted to MSHA, and not voided by MSHA.</p>
