                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. Within this section, each of the following terms has the meaning prescribed below:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as otherwise provided by law or except as otherwise provided by federal law is a qualifying phrase referring to a federal and/or state law, as the case may be, which supersedes a requirement of this section. It is the responsibility of the credit union to ascertain whether such statutory or case law exists and is applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Impress means to attach to a member's account and is the act which makes the lien enforceable against that account;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Member means any member who is primarily, secondarily or otherwise responsible for an outstanding financial obligation to the credit union, including without limitation an obligor, maker, co-maker, guarantor, co-signer, endorser, surety or accommodation party;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Notice means written notice to a member disclosing, in plain language, that the credit union has the right to impress and enforce a statutory lien against the member's shares and dividends in the event of failure to satisfy a financial obligation, and may enforce the right without further notice to the member.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a statutory lien gives the federal credit union priority over other creditors when claims are asserted against a member's account(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Impressing a statutory lien. Except as otherwise provided by federal law, a credit union can impress a statutory lien on a member's account(s)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Account records.

[64 FR 56956, Oct. 22, 1999]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 701--Federal Credit Union Bylaws</p><p class="depth0">Introduction</p><p class="depth0">A. Effective date. After consideration of public comment, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) Board adopted these Bylaws and incorporated them as appendix A to part 701 of NCUA's regulations on November 30, 2007. Unless a federal credit union has adopted bylaws before November 30, 2007, it must adopt these revised bylaws.</p><p class="depth0">B. Adoption of all or part of these bylaws. Although federal credit unions may retain any previously approved version of the bylaws, the NCUA Board encourages federal credit unions to adopt the revised bylaws because it believes they provide greater clarity and flexibility for credit unions and their officials and members. Federal credit unions may also adopt portions of the revised bylaws and retain the remainder of previously approved bylaws, but the NCUA Board cautions federal credit unions to be extremely careful. Federal credit unions must be careful because they run the risk of having inconsistent or conflicting provisions because

of the various options the revised bylaws provide as well as other revisions in the text.</p><p class="depth0">C. Bylaw amendments. 1. The FCU Bylaws contain several provisions allowing FCU boards to select from an option or range of options and fill in a blank. Changes to ``fill-in-the-blank'' provisions are, in fact, changes to the FCU's bylaws and require a two-thirds vote of the board. As long as the FCU selects from the permissible options for completing the blank, the FCU need not submit the change for NCUA approval using the process outlined below.</p><p class="depth0">2. Federal credit unions continue to have the flexibility to request other bylaw amendments if the need arises. NCUA must approve any bylaw amendments; federal credit unions may no longer adopt amendments from the ``Standard Bylaw Amendments'' booklet because the 1999 revisions to the bylaws included sufficient flexibility to make the separate list of standard bylaw amendments superfluous. Thus, NCUA no longer differentiates between ``standard'' and ``nonstandard'' bylaw amendments.</p><p class="depth0">3. The procedure for approval of bylaw amendments is as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. The federal credit union wishing to adopt a bylaw amendment must file a request with its regional director.</p><p class="depth0">b. The request must include the section of the bylaws to be amended; the reason for or purpose of the amendment, including an explanation of why the amendment is desirable and what it will accomplish for the credit union; and the specific, proposed wording of the amendment.</p><p class="depth0">c. After review by the regional director and consultation within the agency, the regional director will advise the credit union if a proposed amendment is approved.</p><p class="depth0">4. Federal credit unions considering an amendment may find it useful to review the bylaws section of the agency Web site, which includes Office of General Counsel opinions about proposed bylaw amendments. Opinions issued after April 2006 will include the language of approved amendments. Even if an amendment has been previously approved, the credit union must submit a proposed amendment to NCUA for review under the procedure listed above to ensure the amendment is identical. Credit unions requesting previously approved amendments will receive notice of the regional office's decision within 15 business days of the receipt of the request.</p><p class="depth0">D. The nature of the bylaws. 1. The Federal Credit Union Act requires the NCUA Board to prepare bylaws for federal credit unions. 12 U.S.C. 1758. The bylaws address a broad range of matters concerning a credit union's organization and governance, the relationship of the credit union to its members, and the procedures and rules a credit union follows. The bylaws supplement the broad provisions of: A federal credit union's charter, which establishes the existence of a federal credit union; the Federal Credit Union Act, which establishes the powers of federal credit unions; and NCUA regulations, which implement the Federal Credit Union Act. As a legal matter, a federal credit union's bylaws must conform to and cannot be inconsistent with any provision of its charter, the Federal Credit Union Act, NCUA regulations or other laws or regulations applicable to its operations.</p><p class="depth0">2. NCUA expects federal credit unions and their members will make every effort to resolve bylaw disputes using the credit union's internal member complaint resolution process. If a bylaw dispute cannot be resolved internally, however, credit union officials or members should contact the regional office with jurisdiction for the credit union for assistance in resolving the dispute.</p><p class="depth0">3. NCUA has discretion to take administrative actions when a credit union is not in compliance with its bylaws. If a potential violation is identified, NCUA will carefully consider all of the facts and circumstances in deciding whether to take enforcement action. NCUA will not take action against minor or technical violations, but emphasizes that it retains discretion to enforce the bylaws in appropriate cases, such as safety and soundness concerns or threats to fundamental, material credit union member rights.</p><p class="depth0">Table of Contents</p><p class="depth0">Page

Definitions</p><p class="depth0">BYLAWS</p><p class="depth0">Federal Credit Union, Charter No.______</p><p class="depth0">(A corporation chartered under the laws of the United States)</p><p class="depth0">Article I. Name--Purposes</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Name. The name of this credit union is as stated in Section 1 of the charter (approved organization certificate) of this credit union.</p><p class="depth0">Section 2. Purposes. This credit union is a member-owned, democratically operated, not-for-profit organization managed by a volunteer board of directors, with the specified mission of meeting the credit and savings needs of consumers, especially persons of modest means. The purpose of this credit union is to promote thrift among its members by affording them an opportunity to accumulate their savings and to create for them a source of credit for provident or productive purposes. The credit union may add business as one of its purposes by placing a comma after ``provident'' and inserting ``business.''</p><p class="depth0">Article II. Qualifications for Membership</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Field of membership. The field of membership of this credit union is limited to that stated in Section 5 of its charter.</p><p class="depth0">Section 2. Membership application procedures. Applications for membership from persons eligible for membership under Section 5 of the charter must be signed by the applicant on forms approved by the board. The applicant is admitted to membership after approval of an application by a majority of the directors, a majority of the members of a duly authorized executive committee, or by a membership officer, and after subscription to at least one share of this credit union and the payment of the initial installment, and the payment of a uniform entrance fee if required by the board. If a person whose membership application is denied makes a written request, the credit union must explain the reasons for the denial in writing.</p><p class="depth0">Section 3. Maintenance of membership share required. A member who withdraws all shareholdings or fails to comply with the time requirements for restoring his or her account balance to par value in Article III, Section 3, ceases to be a member. By resolution, the board may require persons readmitted to membership to pay another entrance fee.</p><p class="depth0">Section 4. Continuation of membership. Once a member becomes a member that person may remain a member until the person or organization chooses to withdraw or is expelled in accordance with the Act and Article XIV of these bylaws. A member who is disruptive to credit union operations may be subject to limitations on services and access to credit union facilities. A credit union that wishes to restrict services to members no longer within the field of membership should specify the restrictions in this section.</p><p class="depth0">Staff commentary on qualifications for membership:</p><p class="depth0">Entrance fee--FCUs may not vary the entrance fee among different classes of members because the Act requires a uniform fee. FCUs may, however, eliminate the entrance fee for all applicants.</p><p class="depth0">Article III. Shares of Members</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Par value. The par value of each share will be $___. Subscriptions to shares are payable at the time of subscription, or in installments of at least $___ per month.</p><p class="depth0">Section 2. Cap on shares held by one person. The board may establish, by resolution, the maximum amount of shares that any one member may hold.</p><p class="depth0">Section 3. Time periods for payment and maintenance of membership share. A member who fails to complete payment of one share within ___ of admission to membership, or within ___ from the increase in the par value of shares, or a member who reduces the share balance below the par value of one share and does not increase the balance to at least the par value of one share within ___ of the reduction will be terminated from membership.</p><p class="depth0">Section 4. Transferability. Shares may only be transferred from one member to another by an instrument in a form as the board may prescribe. Shares that accrue credits for unpaid dividends retain those credits when transferred.</p><p class="depth0">Section 5. Withdrawals. Money paid in on shares or installments of shares may be withdrawn as provided in these bylaws or regulation on any day when payment on shares may be made, provided, however, that;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The board has the right, at any time, to require members to give up to 60 days written notice of intention to withdraw the whole or any part of the amounts paid in by them.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reserved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> No member may withdraw any shareholdings below the amount of the member's primary or contingent liability to the credit union if the member is delinquent as a borrower, or if borrowers for whom the member is comaker, endorser, or guarantor are delinquent, without the written approval of the credit committee or loan officer. Coverage of overdrafts under an overdraft protection policy does not constitute delinquency for purposes of this paragraph. Shares issued in an irrevocable trust as provided in Section 6 of this article are not subject to withdrawal restrictions except as stated in the trust agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The share account of a deceased member (other than one held in joint tenancy

with another member) may be continued until the close of the dividend period in which the administration of the deceased's estate is completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The board will have the right, at any time, to impose a fee for excessive share withdrawals from regular share accounts. The number of withdrawals not subject to a fee and the amount of the fee will be established by board resolution and will be subject to regulations applicable to the advertising and disclosure of terms and conditions on member accounts.</p><p class="depth0">Section 6. Trusts. Shares may be issued in a revocable or irrevocable trust, subject to the following:</p><p class="depth0">When shares are issued in a revocable trust, the settlor must be a member of this credit union in his or her own right. When shares are issued in an irrevocable trust, either the settlor or the beneficiary must be a member of this credit union. The name of the beneficiary must be stated in both a revocable and irrevocable trust. For purposes of this section, shares issued pursuant to a pension plan authorized by the rules and regulations will be treated as an irrevocable trust unless otherwise indicated in the rules and regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Section 7. Joint accounts and membership requirements. Select one option and check the box corresponding to that option.</p><p class="depth0">-- Option A--Separate account not required to establish membership</p><p class="depth0">Owners of a joint account may both be members of the credit union without opening separate accounts. For joint membership, both owners are required to fulfill all of the membership requirements including each member purchasing and maintaining at least one share in the account.</p><p class="depth0">-- Option B--Separate account required to establish membership</p><p class="depth0">Each member must purchase and maintain at least one share in a share account that names the member as the sole or primary owner. Being named as a joint owner of a joint account is insufficient to establish membership.</p><p class="depth0">Staff commentary on shares:</p><p class="depth0">i. Installments--FCUs may insert zero for the number of installments. The FCU Act allows membership upon the payment of the initial installment of a membership share, but NCUA no longer views this provision as requiring FCUs to offer the option of paying for the membership share in installments.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Par value--FCUs may establish differing par values for different classes of members or types of accounts, provided this action does not violate any federal, state or local antidiscrimination laws. For example, an FCU may want to establish a higher par value for recent credit union members, without requiring long-time members to bring their accounts up to the new par value. A differing par value may also be permissible for different types of accounts, such as requiring a higher par value for a member with only a share draft account. If a credit union adopts differing par values, all of the possible par values should be stated in Section 1.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Reduction in share balance below par value--When a member's account balance falls below the par value, Section 3 requires FCUs to allow members a minimum time period to restore their account balance to the par value before membership is terminated. FCUs may not delete this requirement or delete references to this requirement in Article II, Section 3.</p><p class="depth0">Article IV. Meetings of Members</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Annual meeting. The annual meeting of the members must be held [insert time for annual meeting, for example, ``during the month of March/on the third Saturday of April/ no later than March 31''], in the county in which any office of the credit union is located or within a radius of 100 miles of an office, at the time and place as the board determines and announces in the notice of the annual meeting.</p><p class="depth0">Section 2. Notice of meetings required. a. At least 30 but no more than 75 days before the date of any annual meeting or at least 7 days before the date of any special meeting of the members, the secretary must give written notice to each member. Notice may be by written notice delivered in person or by mail to the member's address, or, for members who have opted to receive statements and notices electronically, by electronic mail. Notice of the annual meeting may be given by posting the notice in a conspicuous place in the office of this credit union where it may be read by the members, at least 30 days before the meeting, if the annual meeting is to be held during the same month as that of the previous annual meeting and if this credit union maintains an office that is readily accessible to members where regular business hours are maintained. Any meeting of the members, whether annual or special, may be held without prior notice, at any place or time, if all the members entitled to vote, who are not present at the meeting, waive notice in writing, before, during, or after the meeting.</p><p class="depth0">b. Notice of any special meeting must state the purpose for which it is to be held, and no business other than that related to this purpose may be transacted at the meeting.</p><p class="depth0">Section 3. Special meetings. a. Special meetings of the members may be called by the chair or the board of directors upon a majority vote, or by the supervisory committee as provided in these bylaws. The chair must call a special meeting, meaning the meeting must be held, within 30 days of the receipt of a written request of 25 members or 5% of the members as of the date of the request,

whichever number is larger. However, a request of no more than 750 members may be required to call a special meeting.</p><p class="depth0">b. The notice of a special meeting must be given as provided in Section 2 of this article. Special meetings may be held at any location permitted for the annual meeting.</p><p class="depth0">Section 4. Items of business for annual meeting and rules of order for annual and special meetings. The suggested order of business at annual meetings of members is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Ascertainment that a quorum is present.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reading and approval or correction of the minutes of the last meeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Report of directors, if there is one. For credit unions participating in the Community Development Revolving Loan Program, the directors must report on the credit union's progress on providing needed community services, if required by NCUA Regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Report of the financial officer or the chief management official.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Report of the credit committee, if there is one.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Report of the supervisory committee, as required by Section 115 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Unfinished business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> New business other than elections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Elections, as required by Section 111 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Adjournment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> To the extent consistent with these bylaws, all meetings of the members will be conducted according to ______. The order of business for the annual meeting may vary from the suggested order, provided it includes all required items and complies with the rules of procedure adopted by the credit union.</p><p class="depth0">The credit union must fill in the blank with one of the following authorities, noting the edition to be used: Democratic Rules of Order, The Modern Rules of Order, Robert's Rules of Order, or Sturgis' Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure.</p><p class="depth0">Section 5. Quorum. Except as otherwise provided, 15 members constitute a quorum at annual or special meetings. If no quorum is present, an adjournment may be taken to a date at least 7 but not more than 14 days thereafter. The members present at any adjourned meeting will constitute a quorum, regardless of the number of members present. The same notice must be given for the adjourned meeting as is prescribed in Section 2 of this article for the original meeting, except that the notice must be given at least 5 days before the date of the meeting as fixed in the adjournment.</p><p class="depth0">Article V. Elections</p><p class="depth0">The Credit Union must select one of the four voting options. This may be done by printing the credit union's bylaws with the option selected or retaining this copy and checking the box of the option selected. All options continue with Section 3 of this article.</p><p class="depth0">Option A1--In-Person Elections; Nominating Committee and Nominations</p><p class="depth0">From Floor</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Nomination procedures. At least 30 days before each annual meeting, the chair will appoint a nominating committee of three or more members. It is the duty of the nominating committee to nominate at least one member for each vacancy, including any unexpired term vacancy, for which elections are being held, and to determine that the members nominated are agreeable to the placing of their names in nomination and will accept office if elected.</p><p class="depth0">Section 2. Election procedures. After the nominations of the nominating committee have been placed before the members, the chair calls for nominations from the floor. When nominations are closed, the chair appoints the tellers, ballots are distributed, the vote is taken and tallied by the tellers, and the results announced. All elections are determined by plurality vote and will be by ballot except where there is only one nominee for the office.
Option A2--In-Person Elections; Nominating Committee and Nominations by</p><p class="depth0">Petition</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Nomination procedures. a. At least 120 days before each annual meeting the chair will appoint a nominating committee of three or more members. It is the duty of the nominating committee to nominate at least one member for each vacancy, including any unexpired term vacancy, for which elections are being held, and to determine that the members nominated are agreeable to the placing of their names in nomination and will accept office if elected.</p><p class="depth0">b. The nominating committee files its nominations with the secretary of the credit union at least 90 days before the annual meeting, and the secretary notifies in writing all members eligible to vote at least 75 days before the annual meeting that nominations for vacancies may also be made by petition signed by 1% of the members with a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 500. The secretary may use electronic mail to notify members who have opted to receive notices or statements electronically.</p><p class="depth0">c. The written notice must indicate that the election will not be conducted by ballot and there will be no nominations from the floor when the number of nominees equals the number of positions to be filled. A brief statement of qualifications and biographical data in a form approved by the board of directors will be included for each nominee submitted by the nominating committee with the written notice to all eligible members. Each nominee by petition must submit

a similar statement of qualifications and biographical data with the petition. The written notice must state the closing date for receiving nominations by petition. In all cases, the period for receiving nominations by petition must extend at least 30 days from the date that the petition requirement and the list of nominating committee's nominees are mailed to all members. To be effective, nominations by petition must be accompanied by a signed certificate from the nominee or nominees stating that they are agreeable to nomination and will serve if elected to office. Nominations by petition must be filed with the secretary of the credit union at least 40 days before the annual meeting and the secretary will ensure that nominations by petition, along with those of the nominating committee, are posted in a conspicuous place in each credit union office at least 35 days before the annual meeting.</p><p class="depth0">Section 2. Election procedures. a. All persons nominated by either the nominating committee or by petition must be placed before the members. When nominations are closed, the chair appoints the tellers, ballots are distributed, the vote is taken and tallied by the tellers, and the results announced.

If sufficient nominations are made by the nominating committee or by petition to provide at least as many nominees as positions to be filled, nominations cannot be made from the floor. In the event nominations from the floor are permitted and result in more nominees than positions to be filled, when nominations have been closed, the chair appoints the tellers, ballots are distributed, the vote is taken and tallied by the tellers, and the results announced. When the number of nominees equals the number of positions to be filled, the chair may take a voice vote or declare each nominee elected by general consent or acclamation at the annual meeting.</p><p class="depth0">Option A3--Election by Ballot Boxes or Voting Machine; Nominating</p><p class="depth0">Committee and Nomination by Petition</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Nomination procedures. a. At least 120 days before each annual meeting, the chair will appoint a nominating committee of three or more members. It is the duty of the nominating committee to nominate at least one member for each vacancy, including any unexpired term vacancy, for which elections are being held, and to determine that the members nominated are agreeable to the placing of their names in nomination and will accept office if elected.</p><p class="depth0">b. The nominating committee files its nominations with the secretary of the credit union at least 90 days before the annual meeting, and the secretary notifies in writing all members eligible to vote at least 75 days before the annual meeting that nominations for vacancies may also be made by petition signed by 1% of the members with a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 500. The secretary may use electronic mail to notify members who have opted to receive notices or statements electronically.</p><p class="depth0">c. The written notice must indicate that the election will not be conducted by ballot and there will be no nominations from the floor when the number of nominees equals the number of positions to be filled. A brief statement of qualifications and biographical data in a form approved by the board of directors will be included for each nominee submitted by the nominating committee with the written notice to all eligible members.

The written notice must state the closing date for receiving nominations by petition. In all cases, the period for receiving nominations by petition must extend at least 30 days from the date of the petition requirement and the list of nominating committee's nominees are mailed to all members. To be effective, nominations by petition must be accompanied by a signed certificate from the nominee or nominees stating that they are agreeable to nomination and will serve if elected to office. Nominations by petition must be filed with the secretary of the credit union at least 40 days before the annual meeting and the secretary will ensure that nominations by petition along with those of the nominating committee are posted in a conspicuous place in each credit union office at least 35 days before the annual meeting.</p><p class="depth0">Section 2. Election procedures. All elections are determined by plurality vote. The election will be conducted by ballot boxes or voting machines, subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The board of directors will appoint the election tellers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If sufficient nominations are made by the nominating committee or by petition to provide more nominees than positions to be filled, the secretary, at least 10 days before the annual meeting, will cause ballot boxes and printed ballots, or voting machines, to be placed in conspicuous locations, as determined by the board of directors with the names of the candidates posted near the boxes or voting machines. The name of each candidate will be followed by a brief statement of qualifications and biographical data in a form approved by the board of directors;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> After the members have been given 24 hours to vote at conspicuous locations as determined by the board of directors, the ballot boxes or voting machines will be opened, the vote tallied by the tellers, the tallies placed in the ballot boxes, and the ballot boxes resealed. The tellers are responsible at

all times for the ballot boxes or voting machines and the integrity of the vote. A record must be kept of all persons voting and the tellers must assure themselves that each person voting is entitled to vote; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The tellers will take the ballot boxes to the annual meeting. At the annual meeting, printed ballots will be distributed to those in attendance who have not voted and their votes will be deposited in the ballot boxes placed by the tellers, before the beginning of the meeting, in conspicuous locations with the names of the candidates posted near them.

If the ballots are designed so that members' identities remain secret and are not disclosed on the ballot, FCUs may use election tellers from the FCU. In any case, FCU employees, officials, and members must not have access to ballots identifying members or to information that links members' votes to their identities.</p><p class="depth0">v.

The security furnished must be adequate in quality and character and consistent with sound lending practices. When funds are not available to make all the loans and lines of credit for which there are applications, preference should be given, in all cases, to the smaller applications if the need and credit factors are nearly equal.</p><p class="depth0">Article VIII. Option 2 Loan Officers (No Credit Committee)</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Records of loan officer; prohibition on loan officer disbursing funds. Each loan officer must maintain a record of each approved or not approved transaction within 7 days of the filing of the application or request, and that record becomes a part of the records of the credit union. No individual may disburse funds of this credit union for any application or share withdrawal which the individual has approved as a loan officer.</p><p class="depth0">Section 2. Duties of loan officer. For each loan or line of credit, the loan officer must inquire into the character and financial condition of the applicant and the applicant's sureties, if any, to ascertain their ability to repay fully and promptly the obligations incurred by them and to determine whether the loan or line of credit will be of probable benefit to the borrower. The loan officers should endeavor diligently to assist applicants in solving their financial problems.</p><p class="depth0">Section 3. Unapproved loans prohibited. No loan or line of credit may be made unless approved by a loan officer in accordance with applicable law and regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Section 4. Lending procedures. Subject to the limits imposed by law and regulations, these bylaws, and the general policies of the board, a loan officer determines the security if any required for each application and the

terms of repayment. The security furnished must be adequate in quality and character and consistent with sound lending practices. When funds are not available to make all the loans and lines of credit for which there are applications, preference should be given, in all cases, to the applications for lesser amounts if the need and credit factors are nearly equal.</p><p class="depth0">Article IX. Supervisory Committee</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Appointment and membership. The supervisory committee is appointed by the board from among the members of this credit union, one of whom may be a director other than the financial officer or the compensated officer of the board. The board determines the number of members on the committee, which may not be fewer than 3 nor more than 5. No member of the credit committee, if applicable, or any employee of this credit union may be appointed to the committee. Regular terms of committee members are for periods of 1, 2, or 3 years as the board determines: Provided, however, that all regular terms are for the same number of years and until the appointment and qualification of successors. The regular terms are fixed at the beginning, or upon any increase or decrease in the number of committee members, so that approximately an equal number of regular terms expires at each annual meeting.</p><p class="depth0">Section 2. Officers of supervisory committee. The supervisory committee members choose from among their number a chair and a secretary. The secretary of the supervisory committee prepares, maintains, and has custody of full and correct records of all actions taken by it. The offices of chair and secretary may be held by the same person.</p><p class="depth0">Section 3. Duties of supervisory committee. a. The supervisory committee makes, or causes to be made, the audits, and prepares and submits the written reports required by the Act and regulations. The committee may employ and use clerical and auditing assistance required to carry out its responsibilities prescribed by this article, and may request the board to provide compensation for this assistance. It will prepare and forward to the Administration required reports.</p><p class="depth0">b. If all director positions become vacant simultaneously, the supervisory committee immediately assumes the role of the board of directors. The supervisory committee acting as the board must generally call and hold a special meeting to elect a board that will serve until the next annual meeting. The special meeting must occur at least 7 but no more than 14 days after all director positions became vacant, and candidates for the board at the special meeting may be nominated by petition or from the floor. However, if the next annual meeting has been scheduled and will occur within 45 days after all the director positions become vacant, the supervisory committee may decide to forego the special meeting and continue serving as the board until the election of new directors at the annual meeting.</p><p class="depth0">c. If the next annual meeting has not been scheduled, but the month and day of the previous year's meeting plus 7 days falls within 45 days after all the director positions become vacant, the supervisory committee acting as the board may decide to forego the special meeting to elect new directors. In this case, the supervisory committee must schedule the annual meeting within 7 days before or after the month and day of the previous annual meeting and continue to serve as the board until directors are elected at the annual meeting.</p><p class="depth0">d. The supervisory committee acting as the board may not act on policy matters. However, directors elected at a special meeting have the same powers as directors elected at the annual meeting.</p><p class="depth0">Section 4. Verification of accounts. The supervisory committee will cause the verification of the accounts of members with the records of the financial officer from time to time and not less frequently than as required by the Act and regulations. The committee must maintain a record of this verification.</p><p class="depth0">Section 5. Powers of supervisory committee--removal of directors and credit committee members. By unanimous vote, the supervisory committee may suspend until the next meeting of the members any director, board officer, or member of the credit committee. In the event of any suspension, the supervisory committee must call a special meeting of the members to act on the suspension, which meeting must be held not fewer than 7 nor more than 14 days after the suspension. The chair of the committee acts as chair of the meeting unless the members select another person to act as chair.</p><p class="depth0">Section 6. Powers of supervisory committee--special meetings. By the affirmative vote of a majority of its members, the supervisory committee may call a special meeting of the members to consider any violation of the provisions of the Act, the regulations, or of the charter or the bylaws of this credit union, or to consider any practice of this credit union which the committee deems to be unsafe or unauthorized.</p><p class="depth0">Article X. Organization Meeting</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Initial meeting. When application is made for a federal credit union charter, the subscribers to the organization certificate must meet for the purpose of electing a board of directors and a credit committee, if applicable. Failure to commence operations within 60 days following receipt of the approved organization certificate is cause for revocation of the charter unless a request for an extension of time has been submitted to and approved by the Regional Director.</p><p class="depth0">Section 2. Election of directors and credit committee. The subscribers elect a chair and a secretary for the meeting. The subscribers then elect from their number, or from those eligible to become members of this credit union, a board of directors and a credit committee, if applicable, all to hold office until the first annual meeting of the members and until the election and qualification of their respective successors. If not already a member, every person elected under this section or appointed under Section 3 of this article, must qualify within 30 days by becoming a member. If any person elected as a director or committee member or appointed as a supervisory committee member does not qualify as a member within 30 days of election or appointment, the office will automatically become vacant and be filled by the board.</p><p class="depth0">Section 3. Election of board officers. Promptly following the elections held under the provisions of Section 2 of this article, the board must meet and elect the board officers who will hold office until the first meeting of the board of directors following the first annual meeting of the members and until the election and qualification of their respective successors. The board also appoints a supervisory committee at this meeting as provided in Article IX, Section 1, of these bylaws and a credit committee, if applicable. The members so appointed hold office until the first regular meeting of the board following the first annual meeting of the members and until the appointment and qualification of their respective successors.</p><p class="depth0">Article XI. Loans and Lines of Credit to Members</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Loan purposes. Loans may only be made to members and for provident or productive purposes in accordance with applicable law and regulations.</p><p class="depth0">The credit union may add business as one of its purposes by placing a comma after ``provident'' and inserting ``business.''</p><p class="depth0">Section 2. Delinquency. Any member whose loan is delinquent may be required to pay a late charge as determined by the board of directors.</p><p class="depth0">Article XII. Dividends</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Power of board to declare dividends. The board establishes dividend periods and declares dividends as permitted by the Act and applicable regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Article XIII. Reserved</p><p class="depth0">Article XIV. Expulsion and Withdrawal</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Expulsion procedure; expulsion or withdrawal does not affect members' liability or shares. A member may be expelled by a two-thirds vote of the members present at special meeting called for that purpose, but only after the member has been given the opportunity to be heard. A member also may be expelled under a nonparticipation policy adopted by the board of directors and provided to each member in accordance with the Act. Expulsion or withdrawal will not operate to relieve a member of any liability to this credit union. All amounts paid in on shares by expelled or withdrawing members, before their expulsion or withdrawal, will be paid to them in the order of their withdrawal or expulsion, but only as funds become available and only after deducting any amounts due to this credit union.</p><p class="depth0">Article XV. Minors</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Minors permitted to own shares. Shares may be issued in the name of a minor. State law governs the rights of minors to transact business with this credit union.</p><p class="depth0">Article XVI. General</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Compliance with law and regulation. All power, authority, duties, and functions of the members, directors, officers, and employees of this credit union, pursuant to the provisions of these bylaws, must be exercised in strict conformity with the provisions of applicable law and regulations, and of the charter and the bylaws of this credit union.</p><p class="depth0">Section 2. Confidentiality. The officers, directors, members of committees and employees of this credit union must hold in confidence all transactions of this credit union with its members and all information respecting their personal affairs, except when permitted by state or federal law.</p><p class="depth0">Section 3. Removal of directors and committee members. Notwithstanding any other provisions in these bylaws, any director or committee member of this credit union may be removed from office by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members present at a special meeting called for the purpose, but only after an opportunity has been given to be heard. If member votes at a special meeting result in the removal of all directors, the supervisory committee immediately becomes the temporary board of directors and must follow the procedures in Article IX, Section 3.</p><p class="depth0">Section 4. Conflicts of interest prohibited. No director, committee member, officer, agent, or employee of this credit union may participate in any manner, directly or indirectly, in the deliberation upon or the determination of any question affecting his or her pecuniary or personal interest or the pecuniary interest of any corporation, partnership, or association (other than this credit union) in which he or she is directly or indirectly interested. In the event of the disqualification of any director respecting any matter presented to the board for deliberation or determination, that director must withdraw from

the deliberation or determination; and if the remaining qualified directors present at the meeting plus the disqualified director or directors constitute a quorum, the remaining qualified directors may exercise with respect to this matter, by majority vote, all the powers of the board. In the event of the disqualification of any member of the credit committee, if applicable, or the supervisory committee, that committee member must withdraw from the deliberation or determination.</p><p class="depth0">Section 5. Records. Copies of the organization certificate of this credit union, its bylaws and any amendments to the bylaws, and any special authorizations by the Administration must be preserved in a place of safekeeping. Copies of the organization certificate and field of membership amendments should be attached as an appendix to these bylaws. Returns of nominations and elections and proceedings of all regular and special meetings of the members and directors must be recorded in the minute books of this credit union. The minutes of the meetings of the members, the board, and the committees must be signed by their respective chairmen or presiding officers and by the persons who serve as secretaries of those meetings.</p><p class="depth0">Section 6. Availability of credit union records. All books of account and other records of this credit union must be available at all times to the directors and committee members of this credit union provided they have a proper purpose for obtaining the records. The charter and bylaws of this credit union must be made available for inspection by any member and, if the member requests a copy, it will be provided for a reasonable fee.</p><p class="depth0">Section 7. Member contact information. Members must keep the credit union informed of their current address.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Subject to the limitations in Sec. 701.33(c)(5) through (c)(7) of the regulations, the credit union may elect to indemnify to the extent authorized by (check one)

Amendments of Bylaws and Charter</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Amendment procedures. Amendments of these bylaws may be adopted and amendments of the charter requested by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the authorized number of members of the board at any duly held meeting of the board if the members of the board have been given prior written notice of the meeting and the notice has contained a copy of the proposed amendment or amendments. No amendment of these bylaws or of the charter may become effective, however, until approved in writing by the NCUA Board.</p><p class="depth0">Article XVIII.

Appendix B to Part 701--Chartering and Field of Membership Manual</p><p class="depth0">Chapter 1</p><p class="depth0">Federal Credit Union Chartering</p><p class="depth0">I--Goals of NCUA Chartering Policy</p><p class="depth0">The National Credit Union Administration's (NCUA) chartering and field of membership policies are directed toward achieving the following goals:</p><p class="depth0">To encourage the formation of credit unions;</p><p class="depth0">To uphold the provisions of the Federal Credit Union Act;</p><p class="depth0">To promote thrift and credit extension;</p><p class="depth0">To promote credit union safety and soundness; and</p><p class="depth0">To make quality credit union service available to all eligible persons.</p><p class="depth0">NCUA may grant a charter to single occupational/associational groups, multiple groups, or communities if:</p><p class="depth0">The occupational, associational, or multiple groups possess an appropriate common bond or the community represents a well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district;</p><p class="depth0">The subscribers are of good character and are fit to represent the proposed credit union; and</p><p class="depth0">The establishment of the credit union is economically advisable.</p><p class="depth0">Generally, these are the primary criteria that NCUA will consider. In unusual circumstances, however, NCUA may examine other factors, such as other federal law or public policy, in deciding if a charter should be approved.</p><p class="depth0">Unless otherwise noted, the policies outlined in this manual apply only to federal credit unions.</p><p class="depth0">II--Types of Charters</p><p class="depth0">The Federal Credit Union Act recognizes three types of federal credit union charters--single common bond (occupational and associational), multiple common bond (more than one group each having a common bond of occupation or association), and community.</p><p class="depth0">The requirements that must be met to charter a federal credit union are described in Chapter 2. Special rules for credit unions serving low-income groups are described in Chapter 3.</p><p class="depth0">If a federal credit union charter is granted, Section 5 of the charter will describe the credit union's field of membership, which defines those persons and entities eligible for membership. Generally, federal credit unions are only able to grant loans and provide services to persons within the field of membership who have become members of the credit union.</p><p class="depth0">III--Subscribers</p><p class="depth0">Federal credit unions are generally organized by persons who volunteer their time and resources and are responsible for determining the interest, commitment, and economic advisability of forming a federal credit union. The organization of a successful federal credit union takes considerable planning and dedication.</p><p class="depth0">Persons interested in organizing a federal credit union should contact one of the credit union trade associations or the NCUA regional office serving the state in which the credit union will be organized. Lists of NCUA offices and credit union trade associations are shown in the appendices. NCUA will provide information to groups interested in pursuing a federal charter and will assist them in contacting an organizer.</p><p class="depth0">While anyone may organize a credit union, a person with training and experience in chartering new federal credit unions is generally the most effective organizer. However, extensive involvement by the group desiring credit union service is essential.</p><p class="depth0">The functions of the organizer are to provide direction, guidance, and advice on the chartering process. The organizer also provides the group with information about a credit union's functions and purpose as well as technical assistance in preparing and submitting the charter application. Close communication and cooperation between the organizer and the proposed members are critical to the chartering process.</p><p class="depth0">The Federal Credit Union Act requires that seven or more natural persons--the ``subscribers''--present to NCUA for approval a sworn organization certificate stating at a minimum:</p><p class="depth0">The name of the proposed federal credit union;</p><p class="depth0">The location of the proposed federal credit union and the territory in which it will operate;</p><p class="depth0">The names and addresses of the subscribers to the certificate and the number of shares subscribed by each;</p><p class="depth0">The initial par value of the shares;</p><p class="depth0">The detailed proposed field of membership; and</p><p class="depth0">The fact that the certificate is made to enable such persons to avail themselves of the advantages of the Federal Credit Union Act.</p><p class="depth0">False statements on any of the required documentation filed in obtaining a federal credit union charter may be grounds for federal criminal prosecution.</p><p class="depth0">IV--Economic Advisability</p><p class="depth0">IV.A--General</p><p class="depth0">Before chartering a federal credit union, NCUA must be satisfied that the institution will be viable and that it will provide needed

services to its members. Economic advisability, which is a determination that a potential charter will have a reasonable opportunity to succeed, is essential in order to qualify for a credit union charter.</p><p class="depth0">NCUA will conduct an independent on-site investigation of each charter application to ensure that the proposed credit union can be successful. In general, the success of any credit union depends on: (a) The character and fitness of management; (b) the depth of the members' support; and (c) present and projected market conditions.</p><p class="depth0">IV.B--Proposed Management's Character and Fitness</p><p class="depth0">The Federal Credit Union Act requires NCUA to ensure that the subscribers are of good ``general character and fitness.'' Prospective officials and employees will be the subject of credit and background investigations. The investigation report must demonstrate each applicant's ability to effectively handle financial matters. Employees and officials should also be competent, experienced, honest and of good character. Factors that may lead to disapproval of a prospective official or employee include criminal convictions, indictments, and acts of fraud and dishonesty. Further, factors such as serious or unresolved past due credit obligations and bankruptcies disclosed during credit checks may disqualify an individual.</p><p class="depth0">NCUA also needs reasonable assurance that the management team will have the requisite skills--particularly in leadership and accounting--and the commitment to dedicate the time and effort needed to make the proposed federal credit union a success.</p><p class="depth0">Section 701.14 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations sets forth the procedures for NCUA approval of officials of newly chartered credit unions. If the application of a prospective official or employee to serve is not acceptable to the regional director, the group can propose an alternate to act in that individual's place. If the charter applicant feels it is essential that the disqualified individual be retained, the individual may appeal the regional director's decision to the NCUA Board. If an appeal is pursued, action on the application may be delayed. If the appeal is denied by the NCUA Board, an acceptable new applicant must be provided before the charter can be approved.</p><p class="depth0">IV.C--Member Support</p><p class="depth0">Economic advisability is a major factor in determining whether the credit union will be chartered. An important consideration is the degree of support from the field of membership. The charter applicant must be able to demonstrate that membership support is sufficient to ensure viability.</p><p class="depth0">NCUA has not set a minimum field of membership size for chartering a federal credit union. Consequently, groups of any size may apply for a credit union charter and be approved if they demonstrate economic advisability. However, it is important to note that often the size of the group is indicative of the potential for success. For that reason, a charter application with fewer than 3,000 primary potential members (e.g., employees of a corporation or members of an association) may not be economically advisable. Therefore, a charter applicant with a proposed field of membership of fewer than 3,000 primary potential members may have to provide more support than an applicant with a larger field of membership. For example, a small occupational or associational group may be required to demonstrate a commitment for long-term support from the sponsor.</p><p class="depth0">IV.D--Present and Future Market Conditions--Business Plan</p><p class="depth0">The ability to provide effective service to members, compete in the marketplace, and to adapt to changing market conditions are key to the survival of any enterprise. Before NCUA will charter a credit union, a business plan based on realistic and supportable projections and assumptions must be submitted.</p><p class="depth0">The business plan should contain, at a minimum, the following elements:</p><p class="depth0">Mission statement;</p><p class="depth0">Analysis of market conditions, including if applicable, geographic, demographic, employment, income, housing, and other economic data;</p><p class="depth0">Evidence of member support;</p><p class="depth0">Goals for shares, loans, and for number of members;</p><p class="depth0">Financial services needed/desired;</p><p class="depth0">Financial services to be provided to members of all segments within the field of membership;</p><p class="depth0">How/when services are to be implemented;</p><p class="depth0">Organizational/management plan addressing qualification and planned training of officials/employees;</p><p class="depth0">Continuity plan for directors, committee members and management staff;</p><p class="depth0">Operating facilities, to include office space/equipment and supplies, safeguarding of assets, insurance coverage, etc.;</p><p class="depth0">Type of record keeping and data processing system;</p><p class="depth0">Detailed semiannual pro forma financial statements (balance sheet, income and expense projections) for 1st and 2nd year, including assumptions--e.g., loan and dividend rates;</p><p class="depth0">Plans for operating independently;</p><p class="depth0">Written policies (shares, lending, investments, funds management, capital accumulation, dividends, collections, etc.);</p><p class="depth0">Source of funds to pay expenses during initial months of operation, including any

subsidies, assistance, etc., and terms or conditions of such resources; and</p><p class="depth0">Evidence of sponsor commitment (or other source of support) if subsidies are critical to success of the federal credit union. Evidence may be in the form of letters, contracts, financial statements from the sponsor, and any other such document on which the proposed federal credit union can substantiate its projections.</p><p class="depth0">While the business plan may be prepared with outside assistance, the subscribers and proposed officials must understand and support the submitted business plan.</p><p class="depth0">V--Steps in Organizing a Federal Credit Union</p><p class="depth0">V.A--Getting Started</p><p class="depth0">Following the guidance contained throughout this policy, the organizers should submit wording for the proposed field of membership (the persons, organizations and other legal entities the credit union will serve) to NCUA early in the application process for written preliminary approval. The proposed field of membership must meet all common bond or community requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Once the field of membership has been given preliminary approval, and the organizer is satisfied the application has merit, the organizer should conduct an organizational meeting to elect seven to ten persons to serve as subscribers. The subscribers should locate willing individuals capable of serving on the board of directors, credit committee, supervisory committee, and as chief operating officer/manager of the proposed credit union.</p><p class="depth0">Subsequent organizational meetings may be held to discuss the progress of the charter investigation, to announce the proposed slate of officials, and to respond to any questions posed at these meetings.</p><p class="depth0">If NCUA approves the charter application, the subscribers, as their final duty, will elect the board of directors of the proposed federal credit union. The new board of directors will then appoint the supervisory committee.</p><p class="depth0">V.B--Charter Application Documentation</p><p class="depth0">V.B.1--General</p><p class="depth0">As discussed previously in this Chapter, the organizer of a federal credit union charter must, at a minimum, provide evidence that:</p><p class="depth0">The group(s) possess an appropriate common bond or the geographical area to be served is a well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district;</p><p class="depth0">The subscribers, prospective officials, and employees are of good character and fitness; and</p><p class="depth0">The establishment of the credit union is economically advisable.</p><p class="depth0">As part of the application process, the organizer must submit the following forms, which are available in appendix 4 of this Manual:</p><p class="depth0">Federal Credit Union Investigation Report, NCUA 4001;</p><p class="depth0">Organization Certificate, NCUA 4008;</p><p class="depth0">Report of Official and Agreement To Serve, NCUA 4012;</p><p class="depth0">Application and Agreements for Insurance of Accounts, NCUA 9500; and</p><p class="depth0">Certification of Resolutions, NCUA 9501.</p><p class="depth0">Each of these forms is described in more detail in the following sections.</p><p class="depth0">V.B.2--Federal Credit Union Investigation Report, NCUA 4001</p><p class="depth0">The application for a new federal credit union will be submitted on NCUA 4001. State-chartered credit unions applying for conversion to a federal charter will use NCUA 4000. (See Chapter 4 for a full discussion.) The organizer is required to certify the information and recommend approval or disapproval, based on the investigation of the request.</p><p class="depth0">V.B.3--Organization Certificate, NCUA 4008</p><p class="depth0">This document, which must be completed by the subscribers, includes the seven criteria established by the Federal Credit Union Act. NCUA staff assigned to the case will assist in the proper completion of this document.</p><p class="depth0">V.B.4--Report of Official and Agreement To Serve, NCUA 4012</p><p class="depth0">This form documents general background information of each official and employee of the proposed federal credit union. Each official and employee must complete and sign this form. The organizer must review each of the NCUA 4012s for elements that would prevent the prospective official or employee from serving. Further, such factors as serious, unresolved past due credit obligations and bankruptcies disclosed during credit checks may disqualify an individual.</p><p class="depth0">V.B.5--Application and Agreements for Insurance of Accounts, NCUA 9500</p><p class="depth0">This document contains the agreements with which federal credit unions must comply in order to obtain National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) coverage of member accounts. The document must be completed and signed by both the chief executive officer and chief financial officer. A federal credit union must qualify for federal share insurance.</p><p class="depth0">V.B.6--Certification of Resolutions, NCUA 9501</p><p class="depth0">This document certifies that the board of directors of the proposed federal credit union has resolved to apply for NCUSIF insurance

of member accounts and has authorized the chief executive officer and recording officer to execute the Application and Agreements for Insurance of Accounts. Both the chief executive officer and recording officer of the proposed federal credit union must sign this form.</p><p class="depth0">VI--Name Selection</p><p class="depth0">It is the responsibility of the federal credit union organizers or officials of an existing credit union to ensure that the proposed federal credit union name or federal credit union name change does not constitute an infringement on the name of any corporation in its trade area. This responsibility also includes researching any service marks or trademarks used by any other corporation (including credit unions) in its trade area. NCUA will ensure, to the extent possible, that the credit union's name:</p><p class="depth0">Is not already being officially used by another federal credit union;</p><p class="depth0">Will not be confused with NCUA or another federal or state agency, or with another credit union; and</p><p class="depth0">Does not include misleading or inappropriate language.</p><p class="depth0">The last three words in the name of every credit union chartered by NCUA must be ``Federal Credit Union.''</p><p class="depth0">The word ``community,'' while not required, can only be included in the name of federal credit unions that have been granted a community charter.</p><p class="depth0">VII--NCUA Review</p><p class="depth0">VII.A--General</p><p class="depth0">Once NCUA receives a complete charter application package, an acknowledgment of receipt will be sent to the organizer. At some point during the review process, a staff member will be assigned to perform an on-site contact with the proposed officials and others having an interest in the proposed federal credit union.</p><p class="depth0">NCUA staff will review the application package and verify its accuracy and reasonableness. A staff member will inquire into the financial management experience and the suitability and commitment of the proposed officials and employees, and will make an assessment of economic advisability. The staff member will also provide guidance to the subscribers in the proper completion of the Organization Certificate, NCUA 4008.</p><p class="depth0">Credit and background investigations may be conducted concurrently by NCUA with other work being performed by the organizer and subscribers to reduce the likelihood of delays in the chartering process.</p><p class="depth0">The staff member will analyze the prospective credit union's business plan for realistic projections, attainable goals, adequate service to all segments of the field of membership, sufficient start-up capital, and time commitment by the proposed officials and employees. Any concerns will be reviewed with the organizer and discussed with the prospective credit union's officials. Additional on-site contacts by NCUA staff may be necessary. The organizer and subscribers will be expected to take the steps necessary to resolve any issues or concerns. Such resolution efforts may delay processing the application.</p><p class="depth0">NCUA staff will then make a recommendation to the regional director regarding the charter application. The recommendation may include specific provisions to be included in a Letter of Understanding and Agreement. In most cases, NCUA will require the prospective officials to adhere to certain operational guidelines. Generally, the agreement is for a limited term of two to four years. A sample Letter of Understanding and Agreement is found in appendix 2.</p><p class="depth0">VII.B--Regional Director Approval</p><p class="depth0">Once approved, the board of directors of the newly formed federal credit union will receive a signed charter and standard bylaws from the regional director. Additionally, the officials will be advised of the name of the examiner assigned responsibility for supervising and examining the credit union.</p><p class="depth0">VII.C--Regional Director Disapproval</p><p class="depth0">When a regional director disapproves any charter application, in whole or in part, the organizer will be informed in writing of the specific reasons for the disapproval. Where applicable, the regional director will provide information concerning options or suggestions that the applicant could consider for gaining approval or otherwise acquiring credit union service. The letter of denial will include the procedures for appealing the decision.</p><p class="depth0">VII.D--Appeal of Regional Director Decision</p><p class="depth0">If the regional director denies a charter application, in whole or in part, that decision may be appealed to the NCUA Board. An appeal must be sent to the appropriate regional office within 60 days of the date of denial and must address the specific reasons for denial. The regional director will then forward the appeal to the NCUA Board. NCUA central office staff will make an independent review of the facts and present the appeal with a recommendation to the NCUA Board.</p><p class="depth0">Before appealing, the prospective group may, within 30 days of the denial, provide supplemental information to the regional director for reconsideration. A reconsideration will contain new and material evidence addressing the reasons for the initial denial. The regional director will have 30 days from the date of the receipt of the request for reconsideration to make a final decision. If the request is again denied, the applicant may

proceed with the appeal process within 60 days of the date of the last denial. A second request for reconsideration will be treated as an appeal to the NCUA Board.</p><p class="depth0">VII.E--Commencement of Operations</p><p class="depth0">Assistance in commencing operations is generally available through the various credit union trade organizations listed in appendix 5.</p><p class="depth0">All new federal credit unions are also encouraged to establish a mentor relationship with a knowledgeable, experienced credit union individual or an existing, well-operated credit union. The mentor should provide guidance and assistance to the new credit union through attendance at meetings and general oversight. Upon request, NCUA will provide assistance in finding a qualified mentor.</p><p class="depth0">VIII--Future Supervision</p><p class="depth0">Each federal credit union will be examined regularly by NCUA to determine that it remains in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to determine that it does not pose undue risk to the NCUSIF. The examiner will contact the credit union officials shortly after approval of the charter in order to arrange for the initial examination (usually within the first six months of operation).</p><p class="depth0">The examiner will be responsible for monitoring the progress of the credit union and providing the necessary advice and guidance to ensure it is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The examiner will also monitor compliance with the terms of any required Letter of Understanding and Agreement. Typically, the examiner will require the credit union to submit copies of monthly board minutes and financial statements.</p><p class="depth0">The Federal Credit Union Act requires all newly chartered credit unions, up to two years after the charter anniversary date, to obtain NCUA approval prior to appointment of any new board member, credit or supervisory committee member, or senior executive officer. Section 701.14 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations sets forth the notice and application requirements. If NCUA issues a Notice of Disapproval, the newly chartered credit union is prohibited from making the change.</p><p class="depth0">NCUA may disapprove an individual serving as a director, committee member or senior executive officer if it finds that the competence, experience, character, or integrity of the individual indicates it would not be in the best interests of the members of the credit union or of the public to permit the individual to be employed by or associated with the credit union. If a Notice of Disapproval is issued, the credit union may appeal the decision to the NCUA Board.</p><p class="depth0">IX--Corporate Federal Credit Unions</p><p class="depth0">A corporate federal credit union is one that is operated primarily for the purpose of serving other credit unions. Corporate federal credit unions operate under and are administered by the NCUA Office of National Examinations and Supervision.</p><p class="depth0">X--Groups Seeking Credit Union Service</p><p class="depth0">NCUA will attempt to assist any group in chartering a credit union or joining an existing credit union. If the group is not eligible for federal credit union service, NCUA will refer the group to the appropriate state supervisory authority where different requirements may apply.</p><p class="depth0">XI--Field of Membership Designations</p><p class="depth0">NCUA will designate a credit union based on the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0">Single Occupational: If a credit union serves a single occupational sponsor, such as ABC Corporation, it will be designated as an occupational credit union. A single occupational common bond credit union may also serve a trade, industry, or profession (TIP), such as all teachers.</p><p class="depth0">Single Associational: If a credit union serves a single associational sponsor, such as the Knights of Columbus, it will be designated as an associational credit union.</p><p class="depth0">Multiple Common Bond: If a credit union serves more than one group, each of which has a common bond of occupation and/or association, it will be designated as a multiple common bond credit union.</p><p class="depth0">Community: All community credit unions will be designated as such, followed by a description of their geographic boundaries (e.g., city or county).</p><p class="depth0">Credit unions desiring to confirm or submit an application to change their designations should contact the appropriate NCUA regional office.</p><p class="depth0">XII--Foreign Branching</p><p class="depth0">Federal credit unions are permitted to serve foreign nationals within their fields of membership wherever they reside provided they have the ability, resources, and management expertise to serve such persons. Before a credit union opens a branch outside the United States, it must submit an application to do so and have prior written approval of the regional director. A federal credit union may establish a service facility on a United States military installation or United States embassy without prior NCUA approval.</p><p class="depth0">Chapter 2</p><p class="depth0">Field of Membership Requirements for Federal Credit Unions</p><p class="depth0">I--Introduction</p><p class="depth0">I.A.1--General</p><p class="depth0">As set forth in Chapter 1, the Federal Credit Union Act provides for three types of federal credit union charters--single common bond (occupational or associational), multiple common bond (multiple groups), and community. Section 109 (12 U.S.C. 1759) of the Federal Credit Union Act sets forth the membership criteria for each of these three types of credit unions.</p><p class="depth0">The field of membership, which is specified in Section 5 of the charter, defines those persons and entities eligible for membership. A single common bond federal credit union consists of one group having a common bond of occupation or association. A multiple common bond federal credit union consists of more than one group, each of which has a common bond of occupation or association. A community federal credit union consists of persons or organizations within a well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district.</p><p class="depth0">Once chartered, a federal credit union can amend its field of membership; however, the same common bond or community requirements for chartering the credit union must be satisfied. Since there are differences in the three types of charters, special rules, which are fully discussed in the following sections of this Chapter, may apply to each.</p><p class="depth0">I.A.2--Special Low-Income Rules</p><p class="depth0">Generally, federal credit unions can only grant loans and provide services to persons who have joined the credit union. The Federal Credit Union Act states that one of the purposes of federal credit unions is ``to serve the productive and provident credit needs of individuals of modest means.'' Although field of membership requirements are applicable, special rules set forth in Chapter 3 may apply to low-income designated credit unions and those credit unions assisting low-income groups or to a federal credit union that adds an underserved community to its field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">II--Occupational Common Bond</p><p class="depth0">II.A.1--General</p><p class="depth0">A single occupational common bond federal credit union may include in its field of membership all persons and entities who share that common bond. NCUA permits a person's membership eligibility in a single occupational common bond group to be established in five ways:</p><p class="depth0">Employment (or a long-term contractual relationship equivalent to employment) in a single corporation or other legal entity makes that person part of a single occupational common bond;</p><p class="depth0">Employment in a corporation or other legal entity with a controlling ownership interest (which shall not be less than 10 percent) in or by another legal entity makes that person part of a single occupational common bond;</p><p class="depth0">Employment in a corporation or other legal entity which is related to another legal entity (such as a company under contract and possessing a strong dependency relationship with another company) makes that person part of a single occupational common bond;</p><p class="depth0">Employment or attendance at a school makes that person part of a single occupational common bond (see Chapter 2, Section III.A.1); or</p><p class="depth0">Employment in the same Trade, Industry, or Profession (TIP) (see Chapter 2, Section II.A.2).</p><p class="depth0">A geographic limitation is not a requirement for a single occupational common bond. However, for purposes of describing the field of membership, the geographic areas being served may be included in the charter. For example:</p><p class="depth0">Employees, officials, and persons who work regularly under contract in Miami, Florida for ABC Corporation and subsidiaries;</p><p class="depth0">Employees of ABC Corporation who are paid from * * *;</p><p class="depth0">Employees of ABC Corporation who are supervised from * * *;</p><p class="depth0">Employees of ABC Corporation who are headquartered in * * *; and/or</p><p class="depth0">Employees of ABC Corporation who work in the United States.</p><p class="depth0">The corporation or other legal entity (i.e., the employer) may also be included in the common bond--e.g., ``ABC Corporation.'' The corporation or legal entity will be defined in the last clause in Section 5 of the credit union's charter.</p><p class="depth0">A charter applicant must provide documentation to establish that the single occupational common bond requirement has been met.</p><p class="depth0">Some examples of single occupational common bonds are:</p><p class="depth0">Employees of the Hunt Manufacturing Company who work in West Chester, Pennsylvania. (common bond--same employer with geographic definition);</p><p class="depth0">Employees of the Buffalo Manufacturing Company who work in the United States. (common bond--same employer with geographic definition);</p><p class="depth0">Employees, elected and appointed officials of municipal government in Parma, Ohio. (common bond--same employer with geographic definition);</p><p class="depth0">Employees of Johnson Soap Company and its majority owned subsidiary, Johnson

Toothpaste Company, who work in, are paid from, are supervised from, or are headquartered in Augusta and Portland, Maine. (common bond--parent and subsidiary company with geographic definition);</p><p class="depth0">Employees of MMLLJS contractor who work regularly at the U.S. Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington. (common bond--employees of contractors with geographic definition);</p><p class="depth0">Employees, doctors, medical staff, technicians, medical and nursing students who work in or are paid from the Newport Beach Medical Center, Newport Beach, California. (single corporation with geographic definition);</p><p class="depth0">Employees of JLS, Incorporated and MJM, Incorporated working for the LKM Joint Venture Company in Catalina Island, California. (common bond--same employer--ongoing dependent relationship);</p><p class="depth0">Employees of and students attending Georgetown University. (common bond--same occupation);</p><p class="depth0">Employees of all the schools supervised by the Timbrook Board of Education in Timbrook, Georgia. (common bond--same employer); or</p><p class="depth0">All licensed nurses in Fairfax County, Virginia. (occupational common bond TIP).</p><p class="depth0">Some examples of insufficiently defined single occupational common bonds are:</p><p class="depth0">Employees of manufacturing firms in Seattle, Washington. (no defined occupational sponsor; overly broad TIP);</p><p class="depth0">Persons employed or working in Chicago, Illinois. (no occupational common bond).</p><p class="depth0">II.A.2--Trade, Industry, or Profession</p><p class="depth0">A common bond based on employment in a trade, industry, or profession can include employment at any number of corporations or other legal entities that--while not under common ownership--have a common bond by virtue of producing similar products, providing similar services, or participating in the same type of business.</p><p class="depth0">While proposed or existing single common bond credit unions have some latitude in defining a trade, industry, or profession occupational common bond, it cannot be defined so broadly as to include groups in fields which are not closely related. For example, the manufacturing industry, energy industry, communications industry, retail industry, or entertainment industry would not qualify as a TIP because each industry lacks the necessary commonality. However, textile workers, realtors, nurses, teachers, police officers, or U.S. military personnel are closely related and each would qualify as a TIP.</p><p class="depth0">The common bond relationship must be one that demonstrates a narrow commonality of interests within a specific trade, industry, or profession. If a credit union wants to serve a physician TIP, it can serve all physicians, but that does not mean it can also serve all clerical staff in the physicians' offices. However, if the TIP is based on the health care industry, then clerical staff would be able to be served by the credit union because they work in the same industry and have the same commonality of interests.</p><p class="depth0">If a credit union wants to include the airline services industry, it can serve airline and airport personnel but not passengers. Clients or customers of the TIP are not eligible for credit union membership (e.g., patients in hospitals). Any company that is involved in more than one industry cannot be included in an industry TIP (e.g., a company that makes tobacco products, food products, and electronics). However, employees of these companies may be eligible for membership in a variety of trade/profession occupational common bond TIPs.</p><p class="depth0">Since a TIP must be narrowly defined, it cannot include third party vendors and other suppliers. For example, the steel suppliers to the automobile industry would not be part of the automobile industry TIP. However, the automobile industry includes manufacturers and their automobile dealerships.</p><p class="depth0">In general, except for credit unions currently serving a national field of membership or operating in multiple states, a geographic limitation is required for a TIP credit union. The geographic limitation will be part of the credit union's charter and generally correspond to its current or planned operational area. More than one federal credit union may serve the same trade, industry, or profession, even if both credit unions are in the same geographic location.</p><p class="depth0">This type of occupational common bond is only available to single common bond credit unions. A TIP cannot be added to a multiple common bond or community field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">To obtain a TIP designation, the proposed or existing credit union must submit a request to the regional director. New charter applicants must follow the documentation requirements in Chapter 1. New charter applicants and existing credit unions must submit a business plan on how the credit union will serve the group with the request to serve the TIP. The business plan also must address how the credit union will verify the TIP. Examples of such verification include state licenses, professional licenses, organizational memberships, pay statements, union membership, or employer certification. The regional director must approve this type of field of membership before a credit union can serve a TIP. Credit unions converting to a TIP can retain members of record but cannot add new members from its previous group or groups, unless it is part of the TIP.</p><p class="depth0">Section II.B on Occupational Common Bond Amendments does not apply to a TIP

common bond. Removing or changing a geographical limitation will be processed as a housekeeping amendment. If safety and soundness concerns are present, the regional director may require additional information before the request can be processed.</p><p class="depth0">Section II.H, on Other Persons Eligible for Credit Union Membership, applies to TIP based credit unions except for the corporate account provision which only applies to industry based TIPs. Credit unions with industry based TIPs may include corporations as members because they have the same commonality of interests as all employees in the industry. For example, an airline service TIP (industry) can serve an airline carrier (corporate account); however, a nurses TIP (profession) could not serve a hospital (corporate account) because not everyone working in the hospital shares the same profession.</p><p class="depth0">If a TIP designated credit union wishes to convert to a different TIP or employer-based occupational common bond, or different charter type, it only retains members of record after the conversion. The regional director, for safety and soundness reasons, may approve a TIP designated credit union to convert to its original field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">II.B--Occupational Common Bond Amendments</p><p class="depth0">II.B.1--General</p><p class="depth0">Section 5 of every single occupational federal credit union's charter defines the field of membership the credit union can legally serve. Only those persons or legal entities specified in the field of membership can be served. There are a number of instances in which Section 5 must be amended by NCUA.</p><p class="depth0">First, a group sharing the credit union's common bond is added to the field of membership. This may occur through various ways including agreement between the group and the credit union directly, or through a merger, corporate acquisition, purchase and assumption (P&A;), or spin-off.</p><p class="depth0">Second, if the entire field of membership is acquired by another corporation, the credit union can serve the employees of the new corporation and any subsidiaries after receiving NCUA approval.</p><p class="depth0">Third, a federal credit union qualifies to change its common bond from:</p><p class="depth0">A single occupational common bond to a single associational common bond;</p><p class="depth0">A single occupational common bond to a community charter; or</p><p class="depth0">A single occupational common bond to a multiple common bond.</p><p class="depth0">Fourth, a federal credit union removes a portion of the group from its field of membership through agreement with the group, a spin-off, or because a portion of the group is no longer in existence.</p><p class="depth0">An existing single occupational common bond federal credit union that submits a request to amend its charter must provide documentation to establish that the occupational common bond requirement has been met. The regional director must approve all amendments to an occupational common bond credit union's field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">II.B.2--Corporate Restructuring</p><p class="depth0">If the single common bond group that comprises a federal credit union's field of membership undergoes a substantial restructuring, the result is often that portions of the group are sold or spun off. This requires a change to the credit union's field of membership. NCUA will not permit a single common bond credit union to maintain in its field of membership a sold or spun-off group to which it has been providing service unless the group otherwise qualifies for membership in the credit union or the credit union converts to a multiple common bond credit union.</p><p class="depth0">If the group comprising the single common bond of the credit union merges with, or is acquired by, another group, the credit union can serve the new group resulting from the merger or acquisition after receiving a housekeeping amendment.</p><p class="depth0">II.B.3--Economic Advisability</p><p class="depth0">Prior to granting a common bond expansion, NCUA will examine the amendment's likely effect on the credit union's operations and financial condition. In most cases, the information needed for analyzing the effect of adding a particular group will be available to NCUA through the examination and financial and statistical reports; however, in particular cases, a regional director may require additional information prior to making a decision.</p><p class="depth0">II.B.4--Documentation Requirements</p><p class="depth0">A federal credit union requesting a common bond expansion must submit an Application for Field of Membership Amendment (NCUA 4015-EZ) to the appropriate NCUA regional director. An authorized credit union representative must sign the request.</p><p class="depth0">II.C--NCUA's Procedures for Amending the Field of Membership</p><p class="depth0">II.C.1--General</p><p class="depth0">All requests for approval to amend a federal credit union's charter must be submitted to the appropriate regional director.</p><p class="depth0">II.C.2--Regional Director's Decision</p><p class="depth0">NCUA staff will review all amendment requests in order to ensure compliance with NCUA policy.</p><p class="depth0">Before acting on a proposed amendment, the regional director may require an on-site

review. In addition, the regional director may, after taking into account the significance of the proposed field of membership amendment, require the applicant to submit a business plan addressing specific issues.</p><p class="depth0">The financial and operational condition of the requesting credit union will be considered in every instance. NCUA will carefully consider the economic advisability of expanding the field of membership of a credit union with financial or operational problems.</p><p class="depth0">In most cases, field of membership amendments will only be approved for credit unions that are operating satisfactorily. Generally, if a federal credit union is having difficulty providing service to its current membership, or is experiencing financial or other operational problems, it may have more difficulty serving an expanded field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">Occasionally, however, an expanded field of membership may provide the basis for reversing current financial problems. In such cases, an amendment to expand the field of membership may be granted notwithstanding the credit union's financial or operational problems. The applicant credit union must clearly establish that the expanded field of membership is in the best interest of the members and will not increase the risk to the NCUSIF.</p><p class="depth0">II.C.3--Regional Director Approval</p><p class="depth0">If the regional director approves the requested amendment, the credit union will be issued an amendment to Section 5 of its charter.</p><p class="depth0">II.C.4--Regional Director Disapproval</p><p class="depth0">When a regional director disapproves any application, in whole or in part, to amend the field of membership under this chapter, the applicant will be informed in writing of the:</p><p class="depth0">Specific reasons for the action;</p><p class="depth0">Options to consider, if appropriate, for gaining approval; and</p><p class="depth0">Appeal procedure.</p><p class="depth0">II.C.5--Appeal of Regional Director Decision</p><p class="depth0">If a field of membership expansion request, merger, or spin-off is denied by the regional director, the federal credit union may appeal the decision to the NCUA Board. An appeal must be sent to the appropriate regional office within 60 days of the date of denial, and must address the specific reason(s) for the denial. The regional director will then forward the appeal to the NCUA Board. NCUA central office staff will make an independent review of the facts and present the appeal to the Board with a recommendation.</p><p class="depth0">Before appealing, the credit union may, within 30 days of the denial, provide supplemental information to the regional director for reconsideration. A reconsideration will contain new and material evidence addressing the reasons for the initial denial. The regional director will have 30 days from the date of the receipt of the request for reconsideration to make a final decision. If the request is again denied, the applicant may proceed with the appeal process within 60 days of the date of the last denial. A second request for reconsideration will be treated as an appeal to the NCUA Board.</p><p class="depth0">II.D--Mergers, Purchase and Assumptions, and Spin-Offs</p><p class="depth0">In general, other than the addition of common bond groups, there are three additional ways a federal credit union with a single occupational common bond can expand its field of membership:</p><p class="depth0">By taking in the field of membership of another credit union through a common bond or emergency merger;</p><p class="depth0">By taking in the field of membership of another credit union through a common bond or emergency purchase and assumption (P&A;); or</p><p class="depth0">By taking a portion of another credit union's field of membership through a common bond spin-off.</p><p class="depth0">II.D.1--Mergers</p><p class="depth0">Generally, the requirements applicable to field of membership expansions found in this chapter apply to mergers where the continuing credit union has a federal charter. That is, the two credit unions must share a common bond.</p><p class="depth0">Where the merging credit union is state-chartered, the common bond rules applicable to a federal credit union apply.</p><p class="depth0">Mergers must be approved by the NCUA regional director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director of the merging credit union, and, as applicable, the state regulators.</p><p class="depth0">If a single occupational credit union wants to merge into a multiple common bond or community credit union, Section IV.D or Section V.D of this Chapter, respectively, should be reviewed.</p><p class="depth0">II.D.2--Emergency Mergers</p><p class="depth0">An emergency merger may be approved by NCUA without regard to common bond or other legal constraints. An emergency merger involves NCUA's direct intervention and approval. The credit union to be merged must either be insolvent or in danger of insolvency, as defined in the Glossary, and NCUA must determine that:</p><p class="depth0">An emergency requiring expeditious action exists;</p><p class="depth0">Other alternatives are not reasonably available; and</p><p class="depth0">The public interest would best be served by approving the merger.</p><p class="depth0">If not corrected, conditions that could lead to insolvency include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0">Abandonment by management;</p><p class="depth0">Loss of sponsor;</p><p class="depth0">Serious and persistent recordkeeping problems; or</p><p class="depth0">Serious and persistent operational concerns.</p><p class="depth0">In an emergency merger situation, NCUA will take an active role in finding a suitable merger partner (continuing credit union). NCUA is primarily concerned that the continuing credit union has the financial strength and management expertise to absorb the troubled credit union without adversely affecting its own financial condition and stability.</p><p class="depth0">As a stipulated condition to an emergency merger, the field of membership of the merging credit union may be transferred intact to the continuing federal credit union without regard to any common bond restrictions. Under this authority, therefore, a single occupational common bond federal credit union may take into its field of membership any dissimilar charter type.</p><p class="depth0">The common bond characteristic of the continuing credit union in an emergency merger does not change. That is, even though the merging credit union is a multiple common bond or community, the continuing credit union will remain a single common bond credit union. Similarly, if the merging credit union is also an unlike single common bond, the continuing credit union will remain a single common bond credit union. Future common bond expansions will be based on the continuing credit union's original single common bond.</p><p class="depth0">Emergency mergers involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by the regional director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director of the merging credit union and, as applicable, the state regulators.</p><p class="depth0">II.D.3--Purchase and Assumption (P&A;)</p><p class="depth0">Another alternative for acquiring the field of membership of a failing credit union is through a consolidation known as a P&A.; A P&A; has limited application because, in most cases, the failing credit union must be placed into involuntary liquidation. In the few instances where a P&A; may be appropriate, the assuming federal credit union, as with emergency mergers, may acquire the entire field of membership if the emergency merger criteria are satisfied. However, if the P&A; does not meet the emergency merger criteria, it must be processed under the common bond requirements.</p><p class="depth0">In a P&A; processed under the emergency criteria, specified loans, shares, and certain other designated assets and liabilities, without regard to common bond restrictions, may also be acquired without changing the character of the continuing federal credit union for purposes of future field of membership amendments.</p><p class="depth0">If the purchased and/or assumed credit union's field of membership does not share a common bond with the purchasing and/or assuming credit union, then the continuing credit union's original common bond will be controlling for future common bond expansions.</p><p class="depth0">P&As; involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by the regional director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director of the purchased and/or assumed credit union and, as applicable, the state regulators.</p><p class="depth0">II.D.4--Spin-Offs</p><p class="depth0">A spin-off occurs when, by agreement of the parties, a portion of the field of membership, assets, liabilities, shares, and capital of a credit union are transferred to a new or existing credit union. A spin-off is unique in that usually one credit union has a field of membership expansion and the other loses a portion of its field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">All common bond requirements apply regardless of whether the spun-off group becomes a new credit union or goes to an existing federal charter.</p><p class="depth0">The request for approval of a spin-off must be supported with a plan that addresses, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth0">Why the spin-off is being requested;</p><p class="depth0">What part of the field of membership is to be spun off;</p><p class="depth0">Whether the affected credit unions have a common bond (applies only to single occupational credit unions);</p><p class="depth0">Which assets, liabilities, shares, and capital are to be transferred;</p><p class="depth0">The financial impact the spin-off will have on the affected credit unions;</p><p class="depth0">The ability of the acquiring credit union to effectively serve the new members;</p><p class="depth0">The proposed spin-off date; and</p><p class="depth0">Disclosure to the members of the requirements set forth above.</p><p class="depth0">The spin-off request must also include current financial statements from the affected credit unions and the proposed voting ballot.</p><p class="depth0">For federal credit unions spinning off a group, membership notice and voting requirements and procedures are the same as for mergers (see part 708 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations), except that only the members directly affected by the spin-off--those whose shares are to be transferred--are permitted to vote. Members whose shares are not being transferred will not be afforded the opportunity to vote. All members of the group to be spun off (whether they voted in

favor, against, or not at all) will be transferred if the spin-off is approved by the voting membership. Voting requirements for federally insured state credit unions are governed by state law.</p><p class="depth0">Spin-offs involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by all regional directors where the credit unions are headquartered and the state regulators, as applicable. Spin-offs in the same region also require approval by the state regulator, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">II.E--Overlaps</p><p class="depth0">II.E.1--General</p><p class="depth0">An overlap exists when a group of persons is eligible for membership in two or more credit unions. NCUA will permit single occupational federal credit unions to overlap any other charter without performing an overlap analysis.</p><p class="depth0">II.E.2--Organizational Restructuring</p><p class="depth0">A federal credit union's field of membership will always be governed by the common bond descriptions contained in Section 5 of its charter. Where a sponsor organization expands its operations internally, by acquisition or otherwise, the credit union may serve these new entrants to its field of membership if they are part of the common bond described in Section 5. NCUA will permit a complete overlap of the credit unions' fields of membership.</p><p class="depth0">If a sponsor organization sells off a group, new members can no longer be served unless they otherwise qualify for membership in the credit union or it converts to a multiple common bond charter.</p><p class="depth0">Credit unions must submit documentation explaining the restructuring and providing information regarding the new organizational structure.</p><p class="depth0">II.E.3--Exclusionary Clauses</p><p class="depth0">An exclusionary clause is a limitation precluding the credit union from serving the primary members of a portion of a group otherwise included in its field of membership. NCUA no longer grants exclusionary clauses. Those granted prior to the adoption of this new chartering manual will remain in effect unless the credit unions agree to remove them or one of the affected credit unions submits a housekeeping amendment to have it removed.</p><p class="depth0">II.F--Charter Conversion</p><p class="depth0">A single occupational common bond federal credit union may apply to convert to a community charter provided the field of membership requirements of the community charter are met. Groups within the existing charter which cannot qualify in the new charter cannot be served except for members of record, or groups or communities obtained in an emergency merger or P&A.; A credit union must notify all groups that will be removed from the field of membership as a result of conversion. Members of record can continue to be served. Also, in order to support a case for a conversion, the applicant federal credit union may be required to develop a detailed business plan as specified in Chapter 2, Section V.A.3.</p><p class="depth0">A single occupational common bond federal credit union may apply to convert to a multiple common bond charter by adding a non-common bond group that is within a reasonable proximity of a service facility. Groups within the existing charter may be retained and continue to be served. However, future amendments, including any expansions of the original single common bond group, must be done in accordance with multiple common bond policy.</p><p class="depth0">II.G--Removal of Groups From the Field of Membership</p><p class="depth0">A credit union may request removal of a portion of the common bond group from its field of membership for various reasons. The most common reasons for this type of amendment are:</p><p class="depth0">The group is within the field of membership of two credit unions and one wishes to discontinue service;</p><p class="depth0">The federal credit union cannot continue to provide adequate service to the group;</p><p class="depth0">The group has ceased to exist;</p><p class="depth0">The group does not respond to repeated requests to contact the credit union or refuses to provide needed support; or</p><p class="depth0">The group initiates action to be removed from the field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">When a federal credit union requests an amendment to remove a group from its field of membership, the regional director will determine why the credit union desires to remove the group. If the regional director concurs with the request, membership will continue for those who are already members under the ``once a member, always a member'' provision of the Federal Credit Union Act.</p><p class="depth0">II.H--Other Persons Eligible for Credit Union Membership</p><p class="depth0">A number of persons, by virtue of their close relationship to a common bond group, may be included, at the charter applicant's option, in the field of membership. These include the following:</p><p class="depth0">Spouses of persons who died while within the field of membership of this credit union;</p><p class="depth0">Employees of this credit union;</p><p class="depth0">Persons retired as pensioners or annuitants from the above employment;</p><p class="depth0">Volunteers;</p><p class="depth0">Members of the immediate family or household;</p><p class="depth0">Organizations of such persons; and</p><p class="depth0">Corporate or other legal entities in this charter.</p><p class="depth0">Immediate family is defined as spouse, child, sibling, parent, grandparent, or grandchild. This includes stepparents, stepchildren, stepsiblings, and adoptive relationships.</p><p class="depth0">Household is defined as persons living in the same residence maintaining a single economic unit.</p><p class="depth0">Membership eligibility is extended only to individuals who are members of an ``immediate family or household'' of a credit union member. It is not necessary for the primary member to join the credit union in order for the immediate family or household member of the primary member to join, provided the immediate family or household clause is included in the field of membership. However, it is necessary for the immediate family member or household member to first join in order for that person's immediate family member or household member to join the credit union. A credit union can adopt a more restrictive definition of immediate family or household.</p><p class="depth0">Volunteers, by virtue of their close relationship with a sponsor group, may be included. Examples include volunteers working at a hospital or school.</p><p class="depth0">Under the Federal Credit Union Act, once a person becomes a member of the credit union, such person may remain a member of the credit union until the person chooses to withdraw or is expelled from the membership of the credit union. This is commonly referred to as ``once a member, always a member.'' The ``once a member, always a member'' provision does not prevent a credit union from restricting services to members who are no longer within the field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">III--Associational Common Bond</p><p class="depth0">III.A.1--General</p><p class="depth0">A single associational federal credit union may include in its field of membership, regardless of location, all members and employees of a recognized association. A single associational common bond consists of individuals (natural persons) and/or groups (non-natural persons) whose members participate in activities developing common loyalties, mutual benefits, and mutual interests. Separately chartered associational groups can establish a single common bond relationship if they are integrally related and share common goals and purposes. For example, two or more churches of the same denomination, Knights of Columbus Councils, or locals of the same union can qualify as a single associational common bond.</p><p class="depth0">Individuals and groups eligible for membership in a single associational credit union can include the following:</p><p class="depth0">Natural person members of the association (for example, members of a union or church members);</p><p class="depth0">Non-natural person members of the association;</p><p class="depth0">Employees of the association (for example, employees of the labor union or employees of the church); and</p><p class="depth0">The association.</p><p class="depth0">Generally, a single associational common bond does not include a geographic definition and can operate nationally. However, a proposed or existing federal credit union may limit its field of membership to a single association or geographic area. NCUA may impose a geographic limitation if it is determined that the applicant credit union does not have the ability to serve a larger group or there are other operational concerns. All single associational common bonds should include a definition of the group that may be served based on the association's charter, bylaws, and any other equivalent documentation.</p><p class="depth0">The common bond for an associational group cannot be established simply on the basis that the association exists. In determining whether a group satisfies associational common bond requirements for a federal credit union charter, NCUA will consider the totality of the circumstances, which includes:</p><p class="depth0">Whether members pay dues;</p><p class="depth0">Whether members participate in the furtherance of the goals of the association;</p><p class="depth0">Whether the members have voting rights. To meet this requirement, members need not vote directly for an officer, but may vote for a delegate who in turn represents the members' interests;</p><p class="depth0">Whether the association maintains a membership list;</p><p class="depth0">Whether the association sponsors other activities;</p><p class="depth0">The association's membership eligibility requirements; and</p><p class="depth0">The frequency of meetings.</p><p class="depth0">A support group whose members are continually changing or whose duration is temporary may not meet the single associational common bond criteria. Each class of member will be evaluated based on the totality of the circumstances. Individuals or honorary members who only make donations to the association are not eligible to join the credit union.</p><p class="depth0">Educational groups--for example, parent-teacher organizations, alumni associations, and student organizations in any school--and church groups may constitute associational common bonds.</p><p class="depth0">Student groups (e.g., students enrolled at a public, private, or parochial school) may constitute either an associational or occupational common bond. For example, students enrolled at a church sponsored school could share a single associational common bond

with the members of that church and may qualify for a federal credit union charter. Similarly, students enrolled at a university, as a group by itself, or in conjunction with the faculty and employees of the school, could share a single occupational common bond and may qualify for a federal credit union charter.</p><p class="depth0">The terminology ``Alumni of Jacksonville State University'' is insufficient to demonstrate an associational common bond. To qualify as an association, the alumni association must meet the requirements for an associational common bond. The alumni of a school must first join the alumni association, and not merely be alumni of the school to be eligible for membership.</p><p class="depth0">Homeowner associations, tenant groups, consumer groups, and other groups of persons having an ``interest in'' a particular cause and certain consumer cooperatives may also qualify as an association.</p><p class="depth0">Associations based primarily on a client-customer relationship do not meet associational common bond requirements. However, having an incidental client-customer relationship does not preclude an associational charter as long as the associational common bond requirements are met. For example, a fraternal association that offers insurance, which is not a condition of membership, may qualify as a valid associational common bond.</p><p class="depth0">Applicants for a single associational common bond federal credit union charter or a field of membership amendment to include an association must provide, at the request of the regional director, a copy of the association's charter, bylaws, or other equivalent documentation, including any legal documents required by the state or other governing authority.</p><p class="depth0">The associational sponsor itself may also be included in the field of membership--e.g., ``Sprocket Association''--and will be shown in the last clause of the field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">III.A.2--Subsequent Changes to Association's Bylaws</p><p class="depth0">If the association's membership or geographical definitions in its charter and bylaws are changed subsequent to the effective date stated in the field of membership, the credit union must submit the revised charter or bylaws for NCUA's consideration and approval prior to serving members of the association added as a result of the change.</p><p class="depth0">III.A.3--Sample Single Associational Common Bonds</p><p class="depth0">Some examples of associational common bonds are:</p><p class="depth0">Regular members of Locals 10 and 13, IBEW, in Florida, who qualify for membership in accordance with their charter and bylaws in effect on May 20, 2001;</p><p class="depth0">Members of the Hoosier Farm Bureau in Grant, Logan, or Lee Counties of Indiana, who qualify for membership in accordance with its charter and bylaws in effect on March 7, 1997;</p><p class="depth0">Members of the Shalom Congregation in Chevy Chase, Maryland;</p><p class="depth0">Regular members of the Corporate Executives Association, located in Westchester, New York, who qualify for membership in accordance with its charter and bylaws in effect on December 1, 1997;</p><p class="depth0">Members of the University of Wisconsin Alumni Association, located in Green Bay, Wisconsin;</p><p class="depth0">Members of the Marine Corps Reserve Officers Association; or</p><p class="depth0">Members of St. John's Methodist Church and St. Luke's Methodist Church, located in Toledo, Ohio.</p><p class="depth0">Some examples of insufficiently defined single associational common bonds are:</p><p class="depth0">All Lutherans in the United States (too broadly defined); or</p><p class="depth0">Veterans of U.S. military service (group is too broadly defined; no formal association of all members of the group).</p><p class="depth0">Some examples of unacceptable single associational common bonds are:</p><p class="depth0">Alumni of Amos University (no formal association);</p><p class="depth0">Customers of Fleetwood Insurance Company (policyholders or primarily customer/client relationships do not meet associational standards);</p><p class="depth0">Employees of members of the Reston, Virginia, Chamber of Commerce (not a sufficiently close tie to the associational common bond); or</p><p class="depth0">Members of St. John's Lutheran Church and St. Mary's Catholic Church located in Anniston, Alabama (churches are not of the same denomination).</p><p class="depth0">III.B--Associational Common Bond Amendments</p><p class="depth0">III.B.1--General</p><p class="depth0">Section 5 of every associational federal credit union's charter defines the field of membership the credit union can legally serve. Only those persons who, or legal entities that, join the credit union and are specified in the field of membership can be served. There are three instances in which Section 5 must be amended by NCUA.</p><p class="depth0">First, a group that shares the credit union's common bond is added to the field of membership. This may occur through various ways including agreement between the group and the credit union directly, or through a merger, purchase and assumption (P&A;), or spin-off.</p><p class="depth0">Second, a federal credit union qualifies to change its common bond from:</p><p class="depth0">A single associational common bond to a single occupational common bond;</p><p class="depth0">A single associational common bond to a community charter; or</p><p class="depth0">A single associational common bond to a multiple common bond.</p><p class="depth0">Third, a federal credit union removes a portion of the group from its field of membership through agreement with the group, a spin-off, or a portion of the group that is no longer in existence.</p><p class="depth0">An existing single associational federal credit union that submits a request to amend its charter must provide documentation to establish that the associational common bond requirement has been met. The regional director must approve all amendments to an associational common bond credit union's field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">III.B.2--Organizational Restructuring</p><p class="depth0">If the single common bond group that comprises a federal credit union's field of membership undergoes a substantial restructuring, the result is often that portions of the group are sold or spun off. This is an event requiring a change to the credit union's field of membership. NCUA may not permit a single associational credit union to maintain in its field of membership a sold or spun-off group to which it has been providing service unless the group otherwise qualifies for membership in the credit union or the credit union converts to a multiple common bond credit union.</p><p class="depth0">If the group comprising the single common bond of the credit union merges with, or is acquired by, another group, the credit union can serve the new group resulting from the merger or acquisition after receiving a housekeeping amendment.</p><p class="depth0">III.B.3--Economic Advisability</p><p class="depth0">Prior to granting a common bond expansion, NCUA will examine the amendment's likely impact on the credit union's operations and financial condition. In most cases, the information needed for analyzing the effect of adding a particular group will be available to NCUA through the examination and financial and statistical reports; however, in particular cases, a regional director may require additional information prior to making a decision.</p><p class="depth0">III.B.4--Documentation Requirements</p><p class="depth0">A federal credit union requesting a common bond expansion must submit an Application for Field of Membership Amendment (NCUA 4015-EZ) to the appropriate NCUA regional director. An authorized credit union representative must sign the request.</p><p class="depth0">III.C--NCUA Procedures for Amending the Field of Membership</p><p class="depth0">III.C.1--General</p><p class="depth0">All requests for approval to amend a federal credit union's charter must be submitted to the appropriate regional director.</p><p class="depth0">III.C.2--Regional Director's Decision</p><p class="depth0">NCUA staff will review all amendment requests in order to ensure conformance to NCUA policy.</p><p class="depth0">Before acting on a proposed amendment, the regional director may require an on-site review. In addition, the regional director may, after taking into account the significance of the proposed field of membership amendment, require the applicant to submit a business plan addressing specific issues.</p><p class="depth0">The financial and operational condition of the requesting credit union will be considered in every instance. The economic advisability of expanding the field of membership of a credit union with financial or operational problems must be carefully considered.</p><p class="depth0">In most cases, field of membership amendments will only be approved for credit unions that are operating satisfactorily. Generally, if a federal credit union is having difficulty providing service to its current membership, or is experiencing financial or other operational problems, it may have more difficulty serving an expanded field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">Occasionally, however, an expanded field of membership may provide the basis for reversing current financial problems. In such cases, an amendment to expand the field of membership may be granted notwithstanding the credit union's financial or operational problems. The applicant credit union must clearly establish that the expanded field of membership is in the best interest of the members and will not increase the risk to the NCUSIF.</p><p class="depth0">III.C.3--Regional Director Approval</p><p class="depth0">If the regional director approves the requested amendment, the credit union will be issued an amendment to Section 5 of its charter.</p><p class="depth0">III.C.4--Regional Director Disapproval</p><p class="depth0">When a regional director disapproves any application, in whole or in part, to amend the field of membership under this chapter, the applicant will be informed in writing of the:</p><p class="depth0">Specific reasons for the action;</p><p class="depth0">Options to consider, if appropriate, for gaining approval; and</p><p class="depth0">Appeal procedures.</p><p class="depth0">III.C.5--Appeal of Regional Director Decision</p><p class="depth0">If a field of membership expansion request, merger, or spin-off is denied by the regional director, the federal credit union may appeal the decision to the NCUA Board. An appeal must be sent to the appropriate regional office within 60 days of the date of denial and must address the specific reason(s) for the denial. The regional director will then forward the appeal to the NCUA Board. NCUA central office staff will make an independent review of the facts and present the appeal to the NCUA Board with a recommendation.</p><p class="depth0">Before appealing, the credit union may, within 30 days of the denial, provide supplemental information to the regional director for reconsideration. A reconsideration will contain new and material evidence addressing the reasons for the initial denial. The regional director will have 30 days from the date of the receipt of the request for reconsideration to make a final decision. If the request is again denied, the applicant may proceed with the appeal process within 60 days of the date of the last denial. A second request for reconsideration will be treated as an appeal to the NCUA Board.</p><p class="depth0">III.D--Mergers, Purchase and Assumptions, and Spin-Offs</p><p class="depth0">In general, other than the addition of common bond groups, there are three additional ways a federal credit union with a single associational common bond can expand its field of membership:</p><p class="depth0">By taking in the field of membership of another credit union through a common bond or emergency merger;</p><p class="depth0">By taking in the field of membership of another credit union through a common bond or emergency purchase and assumption (P&A;); or</p><p class="depth0">By taking a portion of another credit union's field of membership through a common bond spin-off.</p><p class="depth0">III.D.1--Mergers</p><p class="depth0">Generally, the requirements applicable to field of membership expansions found in this section apply to mergers where the continuing credit union is a federal charter. That is, the two credit unions must share a common bond.</p><p class="depth0">Where the merging credit union is state-chartered, the common bond rules applicable to a federal credit union apply.</p><p class="depth0">Mergers must be approved by the NCUA regional director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director of the merging credit union, and, as applicable, the state regulators.</p><p class="depth0">If a single associational credit union wants to merge into a multiple common bond or community credit union, Section IV.D or Section V.D of this Chapter, respectively, should be reviewed.</p><p class="depth0">III.D.2--Emergency Mergers</p><p class="depth0">An emergency merger may be approved by NCUA without regard to common bond or other legal constraints. An emergency merger involves NCUA's direct intervention and approval. The credit union to be merged must either be insolvent or in danger of insolvency, as defined in the Glossary, and NCUA must determine that:</p><p class="depth0">An emergency requiring expeditious action exists;</p><p class="depth0">Other alternatives are not reasonably available; and</p><p class="depth0">The public interest would best be served by approving the merger.</p><p class="depth0">If not corrected, conditions that could lead to insolvency include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0">Abandonment by management;</p><p class="depth0">Loss of sponsor;</p><p class="depth0">Serious and persistent record keeping problems; or</p><p class="depth0">Serious and persistent operational concerns.</p><p class="depth0">In an emergency merger situation, NCUA will take an active role in finding a suitable merger partner (continuing credit union). NCUA is primarily concerned that the continuing credit union has the financial strength and management expertise to absorb the troubled credit union without adversely affecting its own financial condition and stability.</p><p class="depth0">As a stipulated condition to an emergency merger, the field of membership of the merging credit union may be transferred intact to the continuing federal credit union without regard to any common bond restrictions. Under this authority, therefore, a single associational common bond federal credit union may take into its field of membership any dissimilar charter type.</p><p class="depth0">The common bond characteristic of the continuing credit union in an emergency merger does not change. That is, even though the merging credit union is a multiple common bond or community, the continuing credit union will remain a single common bond credit union. Similarly, if the merging credit union is an unlike single common bond, the continuing credit union will remain a single common bond credit union. Future common bond expansions will be based on the continuing credit union's single common bond.</p><p class="depth0">Emergency mergers involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by the regional director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director of the merging credit union and, as applicable, the state regulators.</p><p class="depth0">III.D.3--Purchase and Assumption (P&A;)</p><p class="depth0">Another alternative for acquiring the field of membership of a failing credit union is through a consolidation known as a P&A.; A P&A; has limited application because, in most cases, the failing credit union must be placed into involuntary liquidation. In the few instances where a P&A; may be appropriate, the assuming federal credit union, as with emergency mergers, may acquire the entire field of membership if the emergency merger criteria are satisfied. However, if the P&A; does not meet the emergency merger criteria, it must be processed under the common bond requirements.</p><p class="depth0">In a P&A; processed under the emergency criteria, specified loans, shares, and certain other designated assets and liabilities, without regard to common bond restrictions, may also be acquired without changing the character of the continuing federal credit union for purposes of future field of membership amendments.</p><p class="depth0">If the purchased and/or assumed credit union's field of membership does not share a common bond with the purchasing and/or assuming credit union, then the continuing credit union's original common bond will be controlling for future common bond expansions.</p><p class="depth0">P&As; involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by the regional director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director of the purchased and/or assumed credit union and, as applicable, the state regulators.</p><p class="depth0">III.D.4--Spin-Offs</p><p class="depth0">A spin-off occurs when, by agreement of the parties, a portion of the field of membership, assets, liabilities, shares, and capital of a credit union are transferred to a new or existing credit union. A spin-off is unique in that usually one credit union has a field of membership expansion and the other loses a portion of its field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">All common bond requirements apply regardless of whether the spun-off group becomes a new credit union or goes to an existing federal charter.</p><p class="depth0">The request for approval of a spin-off must be supported with a plan that addresses, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth0">Why the spin-off is being requested;</p><p class="depth0">What part of the field of membership is to be spun off;</p><p class="depth0">Whether the affected credit unions have the same common bond (applies only to single associational credit unions);</p><p class="depth0">Which assets, liabilities, shares, and capital are to be transferred;</p><p class="depth0">The financial impact the spin-off will have on the affected credit unions;</p><p class="depth0">The ability of the acquiring credit union to effectively serve the new members;</p><p class="depth0">The proposed spin-off date; and</p><p class="depth0">Disclosure to the members of the requirements set forth above.</p><p class="depth0">The spin-off request must also include current financial statements from the affected credit unions and the proposed voting ballot.</p><p class="depth0">For federal credit unions spinning off a group, membership notice and voting requirements and procedures are the same as for mergers (see part 708 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations), except that only the members directly affected by the spin-off--those whose shares are to be transferred--are permitted to vote. Members whose shares are not being transferred will not be afforded the opportunity to vote. All members of the group to be spun off (whether they voted in favor, against, or not at all) will be transferred if the spin-off is approved by the voting membership. Voting requirements for federally insured state credit unions are governed by state law.</p><p class="depth0">Spin-offs involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by all regional directors where the credit unions are headquartered and the state regulators, as applicable. Spin-offs in the same region also require approval by the state regulator, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">III.E--Overlaps</p><p class="depth0">III.E.1--General</p><p class="depth0">An overlap exists when a group of persons is eligible for membership in two or more credit unions. NCUA will permit single associational federal credit unions to overlap any other charters without performing an overlap analysis.</p><p class="depth0">III.E.2--Organizational Restructuring</p><p class="depth0">A federal credit union's field of membership will always be governed by the common bond descriptions contained in Section 5 of its charter. Where a sponsor organization expands its operations internally, by acquisition or otherwise, the credit union may serve these new entrants to its field of membership if they are part of the common bond described in Section 5. NCUA will permit a complete overlap of the credit unions' fields of membership. If a sponsor organization sells off a group, new members can no longer be served unless they otherwise qualify for membership in the credit union or it converts to a multiple common bond.</p><p class="depth0">Credit unions must submit documentation explaining the restructuring and providing information regarding the new organizational structure.</p><p class="depth0">III.E.3--Exclusionary Clauses</p><p class="depth0">An exclusionary clause is a limitation precluding the credit union from serving the primary members of a portion of a group

otherwise included in its field of membership. NCUA no longer grants exclusionary clauses. Those granted prior to the adoption of this new chartering manual will remain in effect unless the credit unions agree to remove them or one of the affected credit unions submits a housekeeping amendment to have it removed.</p><p class="depth0">III.F--Charter Conversions</p><p class="depth0">A single associational common bond federal credit union may apply to convert to a community charter provided the field of membership requirements of the community charter are met. Groups within the existing charter which cannot qualify in the new charter cannot be served except for members of record, or groups or communities obtained in an emergency merger or P&A.; A credit union must notify all groups that will be removed from the field of membership as a result of conversion. Members of record can continue to be served. Also, in order to support a case for a conversion, the applicant federal credit union may be required to develop a detailed business plan as specified in Chapter 2, Section V.A.3.</p><p class="depth0">A single associational common bond federal credit union may apply to convert to a multiple common bond charter by adding a non-common bond group that is within a reasonable proximity of a service facility. Groups within the existing charter may be retained and continue to be served. However, future amendments, including any expansions of the original single common bond group, must be done in accordance with multiple common bond policy.</p><p class="depth0">III.G--Removal of Groups From the Field of Membership</p><p class="depth0">A credit union may request removal of a portion of the common bond group from its field of membership for various reasons. The most common reasons for this type of amendment are:</p><p class="depth0">The group is within the field of membership of two credit unions and one wishes to discontinue service;</p><p class="depth0">The federal credit union cannot continue to provide adequate service to the group;</p><p class="depth0">The group has ceased to exist;</p><p class="depth0">The group does not respond to repeated requests to contact the credit union or refuses to provide needed support; or</p><p class="depth0">The group initiates action to be removed from the field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">When a federal credit union requests an amendment to remove a group from its field of membership, the regional director will determine why the credit union desires to remove the group. If the regional director concurs with the request, membership will continue for those who are already members under the ``once a member, always a member'' provision of the Federal Credit Union Act.</p><p class="depth0">III.H--Other Persons Eligible for Credit Union Membership</p><p class="depth0">A number of persons by virtue of their close relationship to a common bond group may be included, at the charter applicant's option, in the field of membership. These include the following:</p><p class="depth0">Spouses of persons who died while within the field of membership of this credit union;</p><p class="depth0">Employees of this credit union;</p><p class="depth0">Volunteers;</p><p class="depth0">Members of the immediate family or household;</p><p class="depth0">Organizations of such persons; and</p><p class="depth0">Corporate or other legal entities in this charter.</p><p class="depth0">Immediate family is defined as spouse, child, sibling, parent, grandparent, or grandchild. This includes stepparents, stepchildren, stepsiblings, and adoptive relationships.</p><p class="depth0">Household is defined as persons living in the same residence maintaining a single economic unit.</p><p class="depth0">Membership eligibility is extended only to individuals who are members of an ``immediate family or household'' of a credit union member. It is not necessary for the primary member to join the credit union in order for the immediate family or household member of the primary member to join, provided the immediate family or household clause is included in the field of membership. However, it is necessary for the immediate family member or household member to first join in order for that person's immediate family member or household member to join the credit union. A credit union can adopt a more restrictive definition of immediate family or household.</p><p class="depth0">Volunteers, by virtue of their close relationship with a sponsor group, may be included. One example is volunteers working at a church.</p><p class="depth0">Under the Federal Credit Union Act, once a person becomes a member of the credit union, such person may remain a member of the credit union until the person chooses to withdraw or is expelled from the membership of the credit union. This is commonly referred to as ``once a member, always a member.'' The ``once a member, always a member'' provision does not prevent a credit union from restricting services to members who are no longer within the field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">IV--Multiple Occupational/ Associational Common Bonds</p><p class="depth0">IV.A.1--General</p><p class="depth0">A federal credit union may be chartered to serve a combination of distinct, definable single occupational and/or associational

common bonds. This type of credit union is called a multiple common bond credit union. Each group in the field of membership must have its own occupational or associational common bond. For example, a multiple common bond credit union may include two unrelated employers, or two unrelated associations, or a combination of two or more employers or associations. Additionally, these groups must be within reasonable geographic proximity of the credit union. That is, the groups must be within the service area of one of the credit union's service facilities. These groups are referred to as select groups. A multiple common bond credit union cannot include a TIP or expand using single common bond criteria.</p><p class="depth0">A federal credit union's service area is the area that can reasonably be served by the service facilities accessible to the groups within the field of membership. The service area will most often coincide with that geographic area primarily served by the service facility. Additionally, the groups served by the credit union must have access to the service facility. The non-availability of other credit union service is a factor to be considered in determining whether the group is within reasonable proximity of a credit union wishing to add the group to its field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">A service facility for multiple common bond credit unions is defined as a place where shares are accepted for members' accounts, loan applications are accepted or loans are disbursed. This definition includes a credit union owned branch, a mobile branch, an office operated on a regularly scheduled weekly basis, a credit union owned ATM, or a credit union owned electronic facility that meets, at a minimum, these requirements. A service facility also includes a shared branch or a shared branch network if either: (1) the credit union has an ownership interest in the service facility either directly or through a CUSO or similar organization; or (2) the service facility is local to the credit union and the credit union is an authorized participant in the service center. This definition does not include the credit union's Internet Web site.</p><p class="depth0">The select group as a whole will be considered to be within a credit union's service area when:</p><p class="depth0">A majority of the persons in a select group live, work, or gather regularly within the service area;</p><p class="depth0">The group's headquarters is located within the service area; or</p><p class="depth0">The group's ``paid from'' or ``supervised from'' location is within the service area.</p><p class="depth0">IV.A.2--Sample Multiple Common Bond Field of Membership</p><p class="depth0">An example of a multiple common bond field of membership is:</p><p class="depth0">``The field of membership of this federal credit union shall be limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0">1.

Only those persons or legal entities specified in the field of membership can be served. There are a number of instances in which Section 5 must be amended by NCUA.</p><p class="depth0">First, a new select group is added to the field of membership. This may occur through agreement between the group and the credit union directly, or through a merger, corporate acquisition, purchase and assumption (P&A;), or spin-off.</p><p class="depth0">Second, a federal credit union qualifies to change its charter from:</p><p class="depth0">A single occupational or associational charter to a multiple common bond charter;</p><p class="depth0">A multiple common bond to a single occupational or associational charter;</p><p class="depth0">A multiple common bond to a community charter; or</p><p class="depth0">A community to a multiple common bond charter.</p><p class="depth0">Third, a federal credit union removes a group from its field of membership through agreement with the group, a spin-off, or because the group no longer exists.</p><p class="depth0">IV.B.2--Numerical Limitation of Select Groups</p><p class="depth0">An existing multiple common bond federal credit union that submits a request to amend its charter must provide documentation to establish that the multiple common bond requirements have been met. The regional director must approve all amendments to a multiple common bond credit union's field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">NCUA will approve groups to a credit union's field of membership if the agency determines in writing that the following criteria are met:</p><p class="depth0">The credit union has not engaged in any unsafe or unsound practice, as determined by the regional director, which is material during the one year period preceding the filing to add the group;</p><p class="depth0">The credit union is ``adequately capitalized.'' NCUA defines adequately capitalized to mean the credit union has a net worth

ratio of not less than 6 percent. For low-income credit unions or credit unions chartered less than ten years, the regional director may determine that a net worth ratio of less than 6 percent is adequate if the credit union is making reasonable progress toward meeting the 6 percent net worth requirement. For any other credit union, the regional director may determine that a net worth ratio of less than 6 percent is adequate if the credit union is making reasonable progress toward meeting the 6 percent net worth requirement, and the addition of the group would not adversely affect the credit union's capitalization level;</p><p class="depth0">The credit union has the administrative capability to serve the proposed group and the financial resources to meet the need for additional staff and assets to serve the new group;</p><p class="depth0">Any potential harm the expansion may have on any other credit union and its members is clearly outweighed by the probable beneficial effect of the expansion. With respect to a proposed expansion's effect on other credit unions, the requirements on overlapping fields of membership set forth in Section IV.E of this Chapter are also applicable; and</p><p class="depth0">If the formation of a separate credit union by such group is not practical and consistent with reasonable standards for the safe and sound operation of a credit union.</p><p class="depth0">A detailed analysis is required for groups of 3,000 or more primary potential members requesting to be added to a multiple common bond credit union. It is incumbent upon the credit union to demonstrate that the formation of a separate credit union by such a group is not practical. The group must provide evidence that it lacks sufficient volunteer and other resources to support the efficient and effective operations of a credit union or does not meet the economic advisability criteria outlined in Chapter 1. If this can be demonstrated, the group may be added to a multiple common bond credit union's field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">IV.B.3--Documentation Requirements</p><p class="depth0">A multiple common bond credit union requesting a select group expansion must submit a formal written request, using the Application for Field of Membership Amendment (NCUA 4015 or NCUA 4015-EZ) to the appropriate NCUA regional director. An authorized credit union representative must sign the request.</p><p class="depth0">The NCUA 4015-EZ (for groups less than 3,000 potential members) must be accompanied by the following:</p><p class="depth0">A letter, or equivalent documentation, from the group requesting credit union service. This letter must indicate:</p><p class="depth0">o That the group wants to be added to the applicant federal credit union's field of membership;</p><p class="depth0">o The number of persons currently included within the group to be added and their locations; and</p><p class="depth0">o The group's proximity to credit union's nearest service facility.</p><p class="depth0">The most recent copy of the group's charter and bylaws or equivalent documentation (for associational groups).</p><p class="depth0">The NCUA 4015 (for groups of 3,000 or more primary potential members) must be accompanied by the following:</p><p class="depth0">A letter, or equivalent documentation, from the group requesting credit union service. This letter must indicate:</p><p class="depth0">o That the group wants to be added to the federal credit union's field of membership;</p><p class="depth0">o Whether the group presently has other credit union service available;</p><p class="depth0">o The number of persons currently included within the group to be added and their locations;</p><p class="depth0">o The group's proximity to credit union's nearest service facility, and</p><p class="depth0">o Why the formation of a separate credit union for the group is not practical or consistent with safety and soundness standards. A credit union need not address every item on the list, simply those issues that are relevant to its particular request:</p><p class="depth0">Member location--whether the membership is widely dispersed or concentrated in a central location.</p><p class="depth0">Demographics--the employee turnover rate, economic status of the group's members, and whether the group is more apt to consist of savers and/or borrowers.</p><p class="depth0">Market competition--the availability of other financial services.</p><p class="depth0">Desired services and products--the type of services the group desires in comparison to the type of services a new credit union could offer.</p><p class="depth0">Sponsor subsidies--the availability of operating subsidies.</p><p class="depth0">The desire of the sponsor--the extent of the sponsor's interest in supporting a credit union charter.</p><p class="depth0">Employee interest--the extent of the employees' interest in obtaining a credit union charter.</p><p class="depth0">Evidence of past failure--whether the group previously had its own credit union or previously filed for a credit union charter.</p><p class="depth0">Administrative capacity to provide services--will the group have the management expertise to provide the services requested.</p><p class="depth0">If the group is eligible for membership in any other credit union, documentation must be provided to support inclusion of the group under the overlap standards set forth in Section IV.E of this Chapter; and</p><p class="depth0">The most recent copy of the group's charter and bylaws or equivalent documentation (for associational groups).</p><p class="depth0">IV.B.4--Corporate Restructuring</p><p class="depth0">If a select group within a federal credit union's field of membership undergoes a substantial restructuring, a change to the credit union's field of membership may be required if the credit union is to continue to provide service to the select group. NCUA permits a multiple common bond credit union to maintain in its field of membership a sold, spun-off, or merged select group to which it has been providing service. This type of amendment to the credit union's charter is not considered an expansion; therefore, the criteria relating to adding new groups are not applicable.</p><p class="depth0">When two groups merge and each is in the field of membership of a credit union, then both (or all affected) credit unions can serve the resulting merged group, subject to any existing geographic limitation and without regard to any overlap provisions. However, the credit unions cannot serve the other multiple groups that may be in the field of membership of the other credit union.</p><p class="depth0">IV.C--NCUA's Procedures for Amending the Field of Membership</p><p class="depth0">IV.C.1--General</p><p class="depth0">All requests for approval to amend a federal credit union's charter must be submitted to the appropriate regional director.</p><p class="depth0">IV.C.2--Regional Director's Decision</p><p class="depth0">NCUA staff will review all amendment requests in order to ensure conformance to NCUA policy.</p><p class="depth0">Before acting on a proposed amendment, the regional director may require an on-site review. In addition, the regional director may, after taking into account the significance of the proposed field of membership amendment, require the applicant to submit a business plan addressing specific issues.</p><p class="depth0">The financial and operational condition of the requesting credit union will be considered in every instance. An expanded field of membership may provide the basis for reversing adverse trends. In such cases, an amendment to expand the field of membership may be granted notwithstanding the credit union's adverse trends. The applicant credit union must clearly establish that the approval of the expanded field of membership meets the requirements of Section IV.B.2 of this Chapter and will not increase the risk to the NCUSIF.</p><p class="depth0">IV.C.3--Regional Director Approval</p><p class="depth0">If the regional director approves the requested amendment, the credit union will be issued an amendment to Section 5 of its charter.</p><p class="depth0">IV.C.4--Regional Director Disapproval</p><p class="depth0">When a regional director disapproves any application, in whole or in part, to amend the field of membership under this chapter, the applicant will be informed in writing of the:</p><p class="depth0">Specific reasons for the action;</p><p class="depth0">Options to consider, if appropriate, for gaining approval; and</p><p class="depth0">Appeal procedure.</p><p class="depth0">IV.C.5--Appeal of Regional Director Decision</p><p class="depth0">If a field of membership expansion request, merger, or spin-off is denied by the regional director, the federal credit union may appeal the decision to the NCUA Board. An appeal must be sent to the appropriate regional office within 60 days of the date of denial, and must address the specific reason(s) for the denial. The regional director will then forward the appeal to the NCUA Board. NCUA central office staff will make an independent review of the facts and present the appeal to the Board with a recommendation.</p><p class="depth0">Before appealing, the credit union may, within 30 days of the denial, provide supplemental information to the regional director for reconsideration. A reconsideration will contain new and material evidence addressing the reasons for the initial denial. The regional director will have 30 days from the date of the receipt of the request for reconsideration to make a final decision. If the request is again denied, the applicant may proceed with the appeal process within 60 days of the date of the last denial. A second request for reconsideration will be treated as an appeal to the NCUA Board.</p><p class="depth0">IV.D--Mergers, Purchase and Assumptions, and Spin-Offs</p><p class="depth0">In general, other than the addition of select groups, there are three additional ways a multiple common bond federal credit union can expand its field of membership:</p><p class="depth0">By taking in the field of membership of another credit union through a merger;</p><p class="depth0">By taking in the field of membership of another credit union through a purchase and assumption (P&A;); or</p><p class="depth0">By taking a portion of another credit union's field of membership through a spin-off.</p><p class="depth0">IV.D.1--Voluntary Mergers</p><p class="depth0">a. All Select Groups in the Merging Credit Union's Field of Membership</p><p class="depth0">Have Less Than 3,000 Primary Potential Members</p><p class="depth0">A voluntary merger of two or more federal credit unions is permissible as long as each select group in the merging credit union's field of membership has less than 3,000 primary potential members. While the merger requirements outlined in Section 205 of the Federal Credit Union Act must still be met,

the requirements of Chapter 2, Section IV.B.2 of this manual are not applicable.</p><p class="depth0">b. One or More Select Groups in the Merging Credit Union's Field of</p><p class="depth0">Membership Has 3,000 or More Primary Potential Members</p><p class="depth0">If the merging credit unions serve the same group, and the group consists of 3,000 or more primary potential members, then the ability to form a separate credit union analysis is not required for that group. If the merging credit union has any other groups consisting of 3,000 or more primary potential members, special requirements apply. NCUA will analyze each group of 3,000 or more primary potential members, except as noted above, to determine whether the formation of a separate credit union by such a group is practical. If the formation of a separate credit union by such a group is not practical because the group lacks sufficient volunteer and other resources to support the efficient and effective operations of a credit union or does not meet the economic advisable criteria outlined in Chapter 1, the group may be merged into a multiple common bond credit union. If the formation of a separate credit union is practical, the group must be spun-off before the merger can be approved.</p><p class="depth0">c. Merger of a Single Common Bond Credit Union Into a Multiple Common</p><p class="depth0">Bond Credit Union</p><p class="depth0">A financially healthy single common bond credit union with a primary potential membership of 3,000 or more cannot merge into a multiple common bond credit union, absent supervisory reasons, unless the continuing credit union already serves the same group.</p><p class="depth0">d. Merger Approval</p><p class="depth0">If the merger is approved, the qualifying groups within the merging credit union's field of membership will be transferred intact to the continuing credit union and can continue to be served.</p><p class="depth0">Where the merging credit union is state-chartered, the field of membership rules applicable to a federal credit union apply.</p><p class="depth0">Mergers must be approved by the NCUA regional director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director of the merging credit union, and, as applicable, the state regulators.</p><p class="depth0">IV.D.2--Supervisory Mergers</p><p class="depth0">The NCUA may approve the merger of any federally insured credit union when safety and soundness concerns are present without regard to the 3,000 numerical limitation. The credit union need not be insolvent or in danger of insolvency for NCUA to use this statutory authority. Examples constituting appropriate reasons for using this authority are: abandonment of the management and/or officials and an inability to find replacements, loss of sponsor support, serious and persistent record keeping problems, sustained material decline in financial condition, or other serious or persistent circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">IV.D.3--Emergency Mergers</p><p class="depth0">An emergency merger may be approved by NCUA without regard to common bond or other legal constraints. An emergency merger involves NCUA's direct intervention and approval. The credit union to be merged must either be insolvent or in danger of insolvency, as defined in the Glossary, and NCUA must determine that:</p><p class="depth0">An emergency requiring expeditious action exists;</p><p class="depth0">Other alternatives are not reasonably available; and</p><p class="depth0">The public interest would best be served by approving the merger.</p><p class="depth0">If not corrected, conditions that could lead to insolvency include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0">Abandonment by management;</p><p class="depth0">Loss of sponsor;</p><p class="depth0">Serious and persistent record keeping problems; or</p><p class="depth0">Serious and persistent operational concerns.</p><p class="depth0">In an emergency merger situation, NCUA will take an active role in finding a suitable merger partner (continuing credit union). NCUA is primarily concerned that the continuing credit union has the financial strength and management expertise to absorb the troubled credit union without adversely affecting its own financial condition and stability.</p><p class="depth0">As a stipulated condition to an emergency merger, the field of membership of the merging credit union may be transferred intact to the continuing federal credit union without regard to any field of membership restrictions including numerical limitation requirements. Under this authority, any single occupational or associational common bond, multiple common bond, or community charter may merger into a multiple common bond credit union and that credit union can continue to serve the merging credit union's field of membership. Subsequent field of membership expansions of the continuing multiple common bond credit union must be consistent with multiple common bond policies.</p><p class="depth0">Emergency mergers involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by the regional director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director of the merging credit union and, as applicable, the state regulators.</p><p class="depth0">IV.D.4--Purchase and Assumption (P&A;)</p><p class="depth0">Another alternative for acquiring the field of membership of a failing credit union is through a consolidation known as a P&A.; Generally, the requirements applicable to field of membership expansions found in this chapter apply to purchase and assumptions where the purchasing credit union is a federal charter.</p><p class="depth0">A P&A; has limited application because, in most cases, the failing credit union must be placed into involuntary liquidation. However, in the few instances where a P&A; may occur, the assuming federal credit union, as with emergency mergers, may acquire the entire field of membership if the emergency criteria are satisfied. Specified loans, shares, and certain other designated assets and liabilities, without regard to field of membership restrictions, may also be acquired without changing the character of the continuing federal credit union for purposes of future field of membership amendments. Subsequent field of membership expansions must be consistent with multiple common bond policies.</p><p class="depth0">P&As; involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by the regional director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director of the purchased and/or assumed credit union and, as applicable, the state regulators.</p><p class="depth0">IV.D.5--Spin-Offs</p><p class="depth0">A spin-off occurs when, by agreement of the parties, a portion of the field of membership, assets, liabilities, shares, and capital of a credit union are transferred to a new or existing credit union. A spin-off is unique in that usually one credit union has a field of membership expansion and the other loses a portion of its field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">All common bond requirements apply regardless of whether the spun-off group becomes a new charter or goes to an existing federal charter.</p><p class="depth0">The request for approval of a spun-off group must be supported with a plan that addresses, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth0">Why the spin-off is being requested;</p><p class="depth0">What part of the field of membership is to be spun off;</p><p class="depth0">Which assets, liabilities, shares, and capital are to be transferred;</p><p class="depth0">The financial impact the spin-off will have on the affected credit unions;</p><p class="depth0">The ability of the acquiring credit union to effectively serve the new members;</p><p class="depth0">The proposed spin-off date; and</p><p class="depth0">Disclosure to the members of the requirements set forth above.</p><p class="depth0">The spin-off request must also include current financial statements from the affected credit unions and the proposed voting ballot.</p><p class="depth0">For federal credit unions spinning off a group, membership notice and voting requirements and procedures are the same as for mergers (see part 708 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations), except that only the members directly affected by the spin-off--those whose shares are to be transferred--are permitted to vote. Members whose shares are not being transferred will not be afforded the opportunity to vote. All members of the group to be spun off (whether they voted in favor, against, or not at all) will be transferred if the spin-off is approved by the voting membership. Voting requirements for federally insured state credit unions are governed by state law.</p><p class="depth0">Spin-offs involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by all regional directors where the credit unions are headquartered and the state regulators, as applicable. Spin-offs in the same region also require approval by the state regulator, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">IV.E--Overlaps</p><p class="depth0">IV.E.1--General</p><p class="depth0">An overlap exists when a group of persons is eligible for membership in two or more credit unions, including state charters. An overlap is permitted when the expansion's beneficial effect in meeting the convenience and needs of the members of the group proposed to be included in the field of membership clearly outweighs any adverse effect on the overlapped credit union.</p><p class="depth0">Credit unions must investigate the possibility of an overlap with federally insured credit unions prior to submitting an expansion request if the group has 3,000 or more primary potential members. If cases arise where the assurance given to a regional director concerning the unavailability of credit union service is inaccurate, the misinformation may be grounds for removal of the group from the federal credit union's charter.</p><p class="depth0">When an overlap situation requiring analysis does arise, officials of the expanding credit union must ascertain the views of the overlapped credit union. If the overlapped credit union does not object, the applicant must submit a letter or other documentation to that effect. If the overlapped credit union does not respond, the expanding credit union must notify NCUA in writing of its attempt to obtain the overlapped credit union's comments.</p><p class="depth0">NCUA will approve an overlap if the expansion's beneficial effect in meeting the convenience and needs of the members of the group clearly outweighs any adverse effect on the overlapped credit union.</p><p class="depth0">In reviewing the overlap, the regional director will consider:</p><p class="depth0">The view of the overlapped credit union(s);</p><p class="depth0">Whether the overlap is incidental in nature--the group of persons in question is so small as to have no material effect on the original credit union;</p><p class="depth0">Whether there is limited participation by members or employees of the group in the original credit union after the expiration of a reasonable period of time;</p><p class="depth0">Whether the original credit union fails to provide requested service;</p><p class="depth0">Financial effect on the overlapped credit union;</p><p class="depth0">The desires of the group(s);</p><p class="depth0">The desire of the sponsor organization; and</p><p class="depth0">The best interests of the affected group and the credit union members involved.</p><p class="depth0">Generally, if the overlapped credit union does not object, and NCUA determines that there is no safety and soundness problem, the overlap will be permitted.</p><p class="depth0">Potential overlaps of a federally insured state credit union's field of membership by a federal credit union will generally be analyzed in the same way as if two federal credit unions were involved. Where a federally insured state credit union's field of membership is broadly stated, NCUA will exclude its field of membership from any overlap protection.</p><p class="depth0">NCUA will permit multiple common bond federal credit unions to overlap community charters without performing an overlap analysis.</p><p class="depth0">IV.E.2--Overlap Issues as a Result of Organizational Restructuring</p><p class="depth0">A federal credit union's field of membership will always be governed by the field of membership descriptions contained in Section 5 of its charter. Where a sponsor organization expands its operations internally, by acquisition or otherwise, the credit union may serve these new entrants to its field of membership if they are part of any select group listed in Section 5. Where acquisitions are made which add a new subsidiary, the group cannot be served until the subsidiary is included in the field of membership through a housekeeping amendment.</p><p class="depth0">Overlaps may occur as a result of restructuring or merger of the parent organization. When such overlaps occur, each credit union must request a field of membership amendment to reflect the new groups each wishes to serve. The credit union can continue to serve any current group in its field of membership that is acquiring a new group or has been acquired by a new group. The new group cannot be served by the credit union until the field of membership amendment is approved by NCUA.</p><p class="depth0">Credit unions affected by organizational restructuring or merger should attempt to resolve overlap issues among themselves. Unless an agreement is reached limiting the overlap resulting from the corporate restructuring, NCUA will permit a complete overlap of the credit unions' fields of membership. When two groups merge, or one group is acquired by the other, and each is in the field of membership of a credit union, both (or all affected) credit unions can serve the resulting merged or acquired group, subject to any existing geographic limitation and without regard to any overlap provisions. This is accomplished through a housekeeping amendment.</p><p class="depth0">Credit unions must submit to NCUA documentation explaining the restructuring and provide information regarding the new organizational structure.</p><p class="depth0">IV.E.3--Exclusionary Clauses</p><p class="depth0">An exclusionary clause is a limitation precluding the credit union from serving the primary members of a portion of a group otherwise included in its field of membership. NCUA no longer grants exclusionary clauses. Those granted prior to the adoption of this new chartering manual will remain in effect unless the credit unions agree to remove them or one of the affected credit unions submits a housekeeping amendment to have it removed.</p><p class="depth0">IV.F--Charter Conversion</p><p class="depth0">A multiple common bond federal credit union may apply to convert to a community charter provided the field of membership requirements of the community charter are met. Groups within the existing charter which cannot qualify in the new charter cannot be served except for members of record, or groups or communities obtained in an emergency merger or P&A.; A credit union must notify all groups that will be removed from the field of membership as a result of conversion. Members of record can continue to be served. Also, in order to support a case for a conversion, the applicant federal credit union may be required to develop a detailed business plan as specified in Chapter 2, Section V.A.3.</p><p class="depth0">A multiple common bond federal credit union may apply to convert to a single occupational or associational common bond charter provided the field of membership requirements of the new charter are met. Groups within the existing charter, which do not qualify in the new charter, cannot be served except for members of record, or groups or communities obtained in an emergency merger or P&A.; A credit union must notify all groups that will be removed from the field of membership as a result of conversion.</p><p class="depth0">IV.G--Removal of Groups From the Field of Membership</p><p class="depth0">A credit union may request removal of a group from its field of membership for various reasons. The most common reasons for this type of amendment are:</p><p class="depth0">The group is within the field of membership of two credit unions and one wishes to discontinue service;</p><p class="depth0">The federal credit union cannot continue to provide adequate service to the group;</p><p class="depth0">The group has ceased to exist;</p><p class="depth0">The group does not respond to repeated requests to contact the credit union or refuses to provide needed support;</p><p class="depth0">The group initiates action to be removed from the field of membership; or</p><p class="depth0">The federal credit union wishes to convert to a single common bond.</p><p class="depth0">When a federal credit union requests an amendment to remove a group from its field of membership, the regional director will determine why the credit union desires to remove the group. If the regional director concurs with the request, membership will continue for those who are already members under the ``once a member, always a member'' provision of the Federal Credit Union Act.</p><p class="depth0">IV.H--Other Persons Eligible for Credit Union Membership</p><p class="depth0">A number of persons, by virtue of their close relationship to a common bond group, may be included, at the charter applicant's option, in the field of membership. These include the following:</p><p class="depth0">Spouses of persons who died while within the field of membership of this credit union;</p><p class="depth0">Employees of this credit union;</p><p class="depth0">Persons retired as pensioners or annuitants from the above employment;</p><p class="depth0">Volunteers;</p><p class="depth0">Members of the immediate family or household;</p><p class="depth0">Organizations of such persons; and</p><p class="depth0">Corporate or other legal entities in this charter.</p><p class="depth0">Immediate family is defined as spouse, child, sibling, parent, grandparent, or grandchild. This includes stepparents, stepchildren, stepsiblings, and adoptive relationships.</p><p class="depth0">Household is defined as persons living in the same residence maintaining a single economic unit.</p><p class="depth0">Membership eligibility is extended only to individuals who are members of an ``immediate family or household'' of a credit union member. It is not necessary for the primary member to join the credit union in order for the immediate family or household member of the primary member to join, provided the immediate family or household clause is included in the field of membership. However, it is necessary for the immediate family member or household member to first join in order for that person's immediate family member or household member to join the credit union. A credit union can adopt a more restrictive definition of immediate family or household.</p><p class="depth0">Volunteers, by virtue of their close relationship with a sponsor group, may be included. Examples include volunteers working at a hospital or church.</p><p class="depth0">Under the Federal Credit Union Act, once a person becomes a member of the credit union, such person may remain a member of the credit union until the person chooses to withdraw or is expelled from the membership of the credit union. This is commonly referred to as ``once a member, always a member.'' The ``once a member, always a member'' provision does not prevent a credit union from restricting services to members who are no longer within the field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">V--Community Charter Requirements</p><p class="depth0">V.A.1--General</p><p class="depth0">There are two types of community charters. One is based on a single, geographically well-defined local community or neighborhood; the other is a rural district. More than one credit union may serve the same community.</p><p class="depth0">NCUA recognizes four types of affinity on which both a community charter and a rural district can be based--persons who live in, worship in, attend school in, or work in the community or rural district. Businesses and other legal entities within the community boundaries or rural district may also qualify for membership.</p><p class="depth0">NCUA has established the following requirements for community charters:</p><p class="depth0">The geographic area's boundaries must be clearly defined; and</p><p class="depth0">The area is a well-defined local community or a rural district.</p><p class="depth0">V.A.2--Definition of Well-Defined Local Community and Rural District</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the documentation requirements in Chapter 1 to charter a credit union, a community credit union applicant must provide additional documentation addressing the proposed area to be served and community service policies.</p><p class="depth0">An applicant has the burden of demonstrating to NCUA that the proposed community area meets the statutory requirements of being: (1) well-defined, and (2) a local community or rural district.</p><p class="depth0">``Well-defined'' means the proposed area has specific geographic boundaries. Geographic boundaries may include a city, township, county (single, multiple, or portions of a county) or their political equivalent, school districts, or a clearly identifiable

neighborhood. Although congressional districts and state boundaries are well-defined areas, they do not meet the requirement that the proposed area be a local community or rural district.</p><p class="depth0">The well-defined local community requirement is met if:</p><p class="depth0">Single Political Jurisdiction--The area to be served is in a recognized single political jurisdiction, i.e., a city, county, or their political equivalent, or any contiguous portion thereof.</p><p class="depth0">Statistical Area--</p><p class="depth0">The area is a designated Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) or allowing part thereof, or in the case of a CBSA with Metropolitan Divisions, the area is a Metropolitan Division or part thereof; and</p><p class="depth0">The CBSA or Metropolitan Division must have a population of 2.5 million or less people.</p><p class="depth0">The rural district requirement is met if:</p><p class="depth0">Rural District--</p><p class="depth0">The district has well-defined, contiguous geographic boundaries;</p><p class="depth0">More than 50% of the district's population resides in census blocks or other geographic areas that are designated as rural by the United State Census Bureau; and</p><p class="depth0">The total population of the district does not exceed the greater of 250,000 people or three percent of the population of the state in which the majority of the district is located; or</p><p class="depth0">The district has well-defined, contiguous geographic boundaries;</p><p class="depth0">The district does not have a population density in excess of 100 people per square mile; and</p><p class="depth0">The total population of the district does not exceed the greater of 250,000 people or three percent of the population of the state in which the majority of the district is located.</p><p class="depth0">The affinities that apply to rural districts are the same as those that apply to well defined local communities. The OMB definitions of CBSA and Metropolitan Division may be found at 65 FR82238 (Dec. 27, 2000). They are incorporated herein by reference. Access to these definitions is available through the main page of the Federal Register Web site at http://www.gpoaccess.gov/fr/index.html and on NCUA's Web site at http://www.ncua.gov.</p><p class="depth0">The requirements in Chapter 2, Sections V.A.4 through V.G. also apply to a credit union that serves a rural district.</p><p class="depth0">V.A.3--Previously Approved Communities</p><p class="depth0">If prior to July 26, 2010 NCUA has determined that a specific geographic area is a well defined local community, then a new applicant need not reestablish that fact as part of its application to serve the exact area. The new applicant must, however, note NCUA's previous determination as part of its overall application. An applicant applying for an area after that date that is not exactly the same as the previously approved well defined local community must comply with the current criteria in place for determining a well defined local community.</p><p class="depth0">V.A.4--Business Plan Requirements for a Community Credit Union</p><p class="depth0">A community credit union is frequently more susceptible to competition from other local financial institutions and generally does not have substantial support from any single sponsoring company or association. As a result, a community credit union will often encounter financial and operational factors that differ from an occupational or associational charter. Its diverse membership may require special marketing programs targeted to different segments of the community. For example, the lack of payroll deduction creates special challenges in the development and promotion of savings programs and in the collection of loans. Accordingly, to support an application for a community charter, an applicant Federal credit union must develop a business plan incorporating the following data:</p><p class="depth0">Pro forma financial statements for a minimum of 24 months after the proposed conversion, including the underlying assumptions and rationale for projected member, share, loan, and asset growth;</p><p class="depth0">Anticipated financial impact on the credit union, including the need for additional employees and fixed assets, and the associated costs;</p><p class="depth0">A description of the current and proposed office/branch structure, including a general description of the location(s); parking availability, public transportation availability, drive-through service, lobby capacity, or any other service feature illustrating community access;</p><p class="depth0">A marketing plan addressing how the community will be served for the 24-month period after the proposed conversion to a community charter, including detailing: how the credit union will implement its business plan; the unique needs of the various demographic groups in the proposed community; how the credit union will market to each group, particularly underserved groups; which community-based organizations the credit union will target in its outreach efforts; the credit union's marketing budget projections dedicating greater resources to reaching new members; and the credit union's timetable for implementation, not just a calendar of events;</p><p class="depth0">Details, terms and conditions of the credit union's financial products, programs, and services to be provided to the entire community; and</p><p class="depth0">Maps showing the current and proposed service facilities, ATMs, political boundaries, major roads, and other pertinent information.</p><p class="depth0">An existing Federal credit union may apply to convert to a community charter. Groups currently in the credit union's field of membership, but outside the new community credit union's boundaries, may not be included in the new community charter. Therefore, the credit union must notify groups that will be removed from the field of membership as a result of the conversion. Members of record can continue to be served.</p><p class="depth0">Before approval of an application to convert to a community credit union, NCUA must be satisfied that the credit union will be viable and capable of providing services to its members.</p><p class="depth0">Community credit unions will be expected to regularly review and to follow, to the fullest extent economically possible, the marketing and business plans submitted with their applications. Additionally, NCUA will follow-up with an FCU every year for three years after the FCU has been granted a new or expanded community charter, and at any other intervals NCUA believes appropriate, to determine if the FCU is satisfying the terms of its marketing and business plans. An FCU failing to satisfy those terms will be subject to supervisory action. As part of this review process, the regional office will report to the NCUA Board instances where an FCU is failing to satisfy the terms of its marketing and business plan and indicate what supervisory actions the region intends to take.</p><p class="depth0">V.A.5--Community Boundaries</p><p class="depth0">The geographic boundaries of a community Federal credit union are the areas defined in its charter. The boundaries can usually be defined using political borders, streets, rivers, railroad tracks, or other static geographical feature.</p><p class="depth0">A community that is a recognized legal entity may be stated in the field of membership--for example, ``Gus Township, Texas,'' ``Isabella City, Georgia,'' or ``Fairfax County, Virginia.''</p><p class="depth0">A community that is a recognized CBSA must state in the field of membership the political jurisdiction(s) that comprise the CBSA.</p><p class="depth0">V.A.6--Special Community Charters</p><p class="depth0">A community field of membership may include persons who work or attend school in a particular industrial park, shopping mall, office complex, or similar development. The proposed field of membership must have clearly defined geographic boundaries.</p><p class="depth0">V.A.7--Sample Community Fields of Membership</p><p class="depth0">A community charter does not have to include all four affinities (i.e., live, work, worship, or attend school in a community). Some examples of community fields of membership are:</p><p class="depth0">Persons who live, work, worship, or attend school in, and businesses located in the area of Johnson City, Tennessee, bounded by Fern Street on the north, Long Street on the east, Fourth Street on the south, and Elm Avenue on the west;</p><p class="depth0">Persons who live or work in Green County, Maine;</p><p class="depth0">Persons who live, worship, work (or regularly conduct business in), or attend school on the University of Dayton campus, in Dayton, Ohio;</p><p class="depth0">Persons who work for businesses located in Clifton Country Mall, in Clifton Park, New York;</p><p class="depth0">Persons who live, work, or worship in the Binghamton, New York, CBSA, consisting of Broome and Tioga Counties, New York (a qualifying CBSA in its entirety);</p><p class="depth0">Persons who live, work, worship, or attend school in the portion of the Oklahoma City, OK MSA that includes Canadian and Oklahoma counties, Oklahoma (two contiguous counties in a portion of a qualifying CBSA that has seven counties in total); or</p><p class="depth0">Persons who live, work, worship, or attend school in Uinta County or Lincoln County, Wyoming, a rural district.</p><p class="depth0">Some examples of insufficiently defined local communities, neighborhoods, or rural districts are:</p><p class="depth0">Persons who live or work within and businesses located within a ten-mile radius of Washington, DC (using a radius does not establish a well-defined area);</p><p class="depth0">Persons who live or work in the industrial section of New York, New York. (not a well-defined neighborhood, community, or rural district); or</p><p class="depth0">Persons who live or work in the greater Boston area. (not a well-defined neighborhood, community, or rural district).</p><p class="depth0">Some examples of unacceptable local communities, neighborhoods, or rural districts are:</p><p class="depth0">Persons who live or work in the State of California. (does not meet the definition of local community, neighborhood, or rural district).</p><p class="depth0">Persons who live in the first congressional district of Florida. (does not meet the definition of local community, neighborhood, or rural district).</p><p class="depth0">V.B--Field of Membership Amendments</p><p class="depth0">A community credit union may amend its field of membership by adding additional affinities or removing exclusionary clauses.

This can be accomplished with a housekeeping amendment.</p><p class="depth0">A community credit union also may expand its geographic boundaries. Persons who live, work, worship, or attend school within the proposed well-defined local community, neighborhood or rural district must have common interests and/or interact. The credit union must follow the requirements of Section V.A.3 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">V.C--NCUA Procedures for Amending the Field of Membership</p><p class="depth0">V.C.1--General</p><p class="depth0">All requests for approval to amend a community credit union's charter must be submitted to the appropriate regional director. If a decision cannot be made within a reasonable period of time, the regional director will notify the credit union.</p><p class="depth0">V.C.2--NCUA's Decision</p><p class="depth0">The financial and operational condition of the requesting credit union will be considered in every instance. The economic advisability of expanding the field of membership of a credit union with financial or operational problems must be carefully considered.</p><p class="depth0">In most cases, field of membership amendments will only be approved for credit unions that are operating satisfactorily. Generally, if a federal credit union is having difficulty providing service to its current membership, or is experiencing financial or other operational problems, it may have more difficulty serving an expanded field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">Occasionally, however, an expanded field of membership may provide the basis for reversing current financial problems. In such cases, an amendment to expand the field of membership may be granted notwithstanding the credit union's financial or operational problems. The applicant credit union must clearly establish that the expanded field of membership is in the best interest of the members and will not increase the risk to the NCUSIF.</p><p class="depth0">V.C.3--NCUA Approval</p><p class="depth0">If the requested amendment is approved by NCUA, the credit union will be issued an amendment to Section 5 of its charter.</p><p class="depth0">V.C.4--NCUA Disapproval</p><p class="depth0">When NCUA disapproves any application to amend the field of membership, in whole or in part, under this chapter, the applicant will be informed in writing of the:</p><p class="depth0">Specific reasons for the action;</p><p class="depth0">If appropriate, options or suggestions that could be considered for gaining approval; and</p><p class="depth0">Appeal procedures.</p><p class="depth0">V.C.5--Appeal of Regional Director Decision</p><p class="depth0">If a field of membership expansion request, merger, or spin-off is denied by the regional director, the federal credit union may appeal the decision to the NCUA Board. An appeal must be sent to the appropriate regional office within 60 days of the date of denial and must address the specific reason(s) for the denial. The regional director will then forward the appeal to the NCUA Board. NCUA central office staff will make an independent review of the facts and present the appeal to the NCUA Board with a recommendation.</p><p class="depth0">Before appealing, the credit union may, within 30 days of the denial, provide supplemental information to the regional director for reconsideration. A reconsideration will contain new and material evidence addressing the reasons for the initial denial. The regional director will have 30 days from the date of the receipt of the request for reconsideration to make a final decision. If the request is again denied, the applicant may proceed with the appeal process within 60 days of the date of the last denial. A second request for reconsideration will be treated as an appeal to the NCUA Board.</p><p class="depth0">V.D--Mergers, Purchase and Assumptions, and Spin-offs</p><p class="depth0">There are three additional ways a community federal credit union can expand its field of membership:</p><p class="depth0">By taking in the field of membership of another credit union through a merger;</p><p class="depth0">By taking in the field of membership through a purchase and assumption (P&A;); or</p><p class="depth0">By taking a portion of another credit union's field of membership through a spin-off.</p><p class="depth0">V.D.1--Standard Mergers</p><p class="depth0">Generally, the requirements applicable to field of membership expansions apply to mergers where the continuing credit union is a community federal charter.</p><p class="depth0">Where both credit unions are community charters, the continuing credit union must meet the criteria for expanding the community boundaries. A community credit union cannot merge into a single occupational/associational, or multiple common bond credit union, except in an emergency merger. However, a single occupational or associational, or multiple common bond credit union can merge into a community charter as long as the merging credit union has a service facility within the community boundaries or a majority of the merging credit union's field of membership would qualify for membership in the community charter. While a community charter may take in an occupational, associational, or multiple common bond credit union in a merger, it will remain a community charter.</p><p class="depth0">Groups within the merging credit union's field of membership located outside of the community boundaries may not continue to be served. The merging credit union must notify groups that will be removed from the field of membership as a result of the merger. However, the credit union may continue to serve members of record.</p><p class="depth0">Where a state-chartered credit union is merging into a community federal credit union, the continuing federal credit union's field of membership will be worded in accordance with NCUA policy. Any subsequent field of membership expansions must comply with applicable amendment procedures.</p><p class="depth0">Mergers must be approved by the NCUA regional director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director of the merging credit union, and, as applicable, the state regulators.</p><p class="depth0">V.D.2--Emergency Mergers</p><p class="depth0">An emergency merger may be approved by NCUA without regard to common bond or other legal constraints. An emergency merger involves NCUA's direct intervention and approval. The credit union to be merged must either be insolvent or in danger of insolvency, as defined in the Glossary, and NCUA must determine that:</p><p class="depth0">An emergency requiring expeditious action exists;</p><p class="depth0">Other alternatives are not reasonably available; and</p><p class="depth0">The public interest would best be served by approving the merger.</p><p class="depth0">If not corrected, conditions that could lead to insolvency include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0">Abandonment by management;</p><p class="depth0">Loss of sponsor;</p><p class="depth0">Serious and persistent record keeping; or</p><p class="depth0">Serious and persistent operational concerns.</p><p class="depth0">In an emergency merger situation, NCUA will take an active role in finding a suitable merger partner (continuing credit union). NCUA is primarily concerned that the continuing credit union has the financial strength and management expertise to absorb the troubled credit union without adversely affecting its own financial condition and stability.</p><p class="depth0">As a stipulated condition to an emergency merger, the field of membership of the merging credit union may be transferred intact to the continuing federal credit union without regard to any field of membership restrictions, including the service facility requirement. Under this authority, a federal credit union may take in any dissimilar field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">Even though the merging credit union is a single common bond credit union or multiple common bond credit union or community credit union, the continuing credit union will remain a community charter. Future community expansions will be based on the continuing credit union's original community area.</p><p class="depth0">Emergency mergers involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by the regional director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director of the merging credit union and, as applicable, the state regulators.</p><p class="depth0">V.D.3--Purchase and Assumption (P&A;)</p><p class="depth0">Another alternative for acquiring the field of membership of a failing credit union is through a consolidation known as a P&A.; Generally, the requirements applicable to community expansions found in this chapter apply to purchase and assumptions where the purchasing credit union is a federal charter.</p><p class="depth0">A P&A; has limited application because, in most instances, the failing credit union must be placed into involuntary liquidation. However, in the few instances where a P&A; may occur, the assuming federal credit union, as with emergency mergers, may acquire the entire field of membership if the emergency criteria are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0">In a P&A; processed under the emergency criteria, specified loans, shares, and certain other designated assets and liabilities may also be acquired without regard to field of membership restrictions and without changing the character of the continuing federal credit union for purposes of future field of membership amendments.</p><p class="depth0">If the P&A; does not meet the emergency criteria, then only members of record can be obtained unless they otherwise qualify for membership in the community charter.</p><p class="depth0">P&As; involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by the regional director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director of the purchased and/or assumed credit union and, as applicable, the state regulators.</p><p class="depth0">V.D.4--Spin-Offs</p><p class="depth0">A spin-off occurs when, by agreement of the parties, a portion of the field of membership, assets, liabilities, shares, and capital of a credit union are transferred to a new or existing credit union. A spin-off is unique in that usually one credit union has a field of membership expansion and the other loses a portion of its field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">All field of membership requirements apply regardless of whether the spun-off group goes to a new or existing federal charter.</p><p class="depth0">The request for approval of a spin-off must be supported with a plan that addresses, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth0">Why the spin-off is being requested;</p><p class="depth0">What part of the field of membership is to be spun off;</p><p class="depth0">Whether the field of membership requirements are met;</p><p class="depth0">Which assets, liabilities, shares, and capital are to be transferred;</p><p class="depth0">The financial impact the spin-off will have on the affected credit unions;</p><p class="depth0">The ability of the acquiring credit union to effectively serve the new members;</p><p class="depth0">The proposed spin-off date; and</p><p class="depth0">Disclosure to the members of the requirements set forth above.</p><p class="depth0">The spin-off request must also include current financial statements from the affected credit unions and the proposed voting ballot.</p><p class="depth0">For federal credit unions spinning off a portion of the community, membership notice and voting requirements and procedures are the same as for mergers (see part 708 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations), except that only the members directly affected by the spin-off--those whose shares are to be transferred--are permitted to vote. Members whose shares are not being transferred will not be afforded the opportunity to vote. All members of the group to be spun off (whether they voted in favor, against, or not at all) will be transferred if the spin-off is approved by the voting membership. Voting requirements for federally insured state credit unions are governed by state law.</p><p class="depth0">V.E--Overlaps</p><p class="depth0">V.E.1--General</p><p class="depth0">Generally, an overlap exists when a group of persons is eligible for membership in two or more credit unions. NCUA will permit community credit unions to overlap any other charters without performing an overlap analysis.</p><p class="depth0">V.E.2--Exclusionary Clauses</p><p class="depth0">An exclusionary clause is a limitation precluding the credit union from serving the primary members of a portion of a group or community otherwise included in its field of membership. NCUA no longer grants exclusionary clauses. Those granted prior to the adoption of this new chartering manual will remain in effect unless the credit unions agree to remove them or one of the affected credit unions submits a housekeeping amendment to have it removed.</p><p class="depth0">V.F--Charter Conversions</p><p class="depth0">A community federal credit union may convert to a single occupational or associational, or multiple common bond credit union. The converting credit union must meet all occupational, associational, and multiple common bond requirements, as applicable. The converting credit union may continue to serve members of record of the prior field of membership as of the date of the conversion, and any groups or communities obtained in an emergency merger or P&A.; A change to the credit union's field of membership and designated common bond will be necessary.</p><p class="depth0">A community credit union may convert to serve a new geographical area provided the field of membership requirements of V.A.3 of this chapter are met. Members of record of the original community can continue to be served.</p><p class="depth0">V.G--Other Persons With a Relationship to the Community</p><p class="depth0">A number of persons who have a close relationship to the community may be included, at the charter applicant's option, in the field of membership. These include the following:</p><p class="depth0">Spouses of persons who died while within the field of membership of this credit union;</p><p class="depth0">Employees of this credit union;</p><p class="depth0">Volunteers in the community;</p><p class="depth0">Members of the immediate family or household; and</p><p class="depth0">Organizations of such persons</p><p class="depth0">Immediate family is defined as spouse, child, sibling, parent, grandparent, or grandchild. This includes stepparents, stepchildren, stepsiblings, and adoptive relationships.</p><p class="depth0">Household is defined as persons living in the same residence maintaining a single economic unit.</p><p class="depth0">Membership eligibility is extended only to individuals who are members of an ``immediate family or household'' of a credit union member. It is not necessary for the primary member to join the credit union in order for the immediate family or household member of the primary member to join, provided the immediate family or household clause is included in the field of membership. However, it is necessary for the immediate family member or household member to first join in order for that person's immediate family member or household member to join the credit union. A credit union can adopt a more restrictive definition of immediate family or household.</p><p class="depth0">Under the Federal Credit Union Act, once a person becomes a member of the credit union, such person may remain a member of the credit union until the person chooses to withdraw or is expelled from the membership of the credit union. This is commonly referred to as ``once a member, always a member.'' The ``once a member, always a member'' provision does not prevent a credit union from restricting services to members who are no longer within the field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">Chapter 3</p><p class="depth0">Low-Income Credit Unions and Credit Unions Serving Underserved Areas</p><p class="depth0">I--Introduction</p><p class="depth0">One of the primary reasons for the creation of federal credit unions is to make credit available to people of modest means for provident and productive purposes. To help NCUA fulfill this mission, the agency has established special operational policies for federal credit unions that serve low-income groups and underserved areas. The policies provide a greater degree of flexibility that will enhance and invigorate capital infusion into low-income groups, low-income communities, and underserved areas. These unique policies are necessary to provide credit unions serving low-income groups with financial stability and potential for controlled growth and to encourage the formation of new charters as well as the delivery of credit union services in low-income communities.</p><p class="depth0">II--Low-Income Credit Union</p><p class="depth0">II.A--Defined</p><p class="depth0">A credit union serving predominantly low-income members may be designated as a low-income credit union. Section 701.34 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations defines the term ``low-income members'' as those members:</p><p class="depth0">Who make less than 80 percent of the average for all wage earners as established by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; or</p><p class="depth0">Whose annual household income falls at or below 80 percent of the median household income for the nation as established by the Census Bureau.</p><p class="depth0">The term ``low-income members'' also includes members who are full-time or part-time students in a college, university, high school, or vocational school.</p><p class="depth0">To obtain a low-income designation from NCUA, an existing credit union must establish that a majority of its members meet the low-income definition. An existing community credit union that serves a geographic area where a majority of residents meet the annual income standard is presumed to be serving predominantly low-income members. A low-income designation for a new credit union charter may be based on a majority of the potential membership.</p><p class="depth0">II.B--Special Programs</p><p class="depth0">A credit union with a low-income designation has greater flexibility in accepting nonmember deposits insured by the NCUSIF, are exempt from the aggregate loan limit on business loans, and may offer secondary capital accounts to strengthen its capital base. It also may participate in special funding programs such as the Community Development Revolving Loan Program for Credit Unions (CDRLP) if it is involved in the stimulation of economic development and community revitalization efforts.</p><p class="depth0">The CDRLP provides both loans and grants for technical assistance to low-income credit unions. The requirements for participation in the revolving loan program are in part 705 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations. Only operating credit unions are eligible for participation in this program.</p><p class="depth0">II.C--Low-Income Documentation</p><p class="depth0">A federal credit union charter applicant or existing credit union wishing to receive a low-income designation should forward a separate request for the designation to the regional director, along with appropriate documentation supporting the request.</p><p class="depth0">For community charter applicants, the supporting material should include the median household income or annual wage figures for the community to be served. If this information is unavailable, the applicant should identify the individual zip codes or census tracts that comprise the community and NCUA will assist in obtaining the necessary demographic data.</p><p class="depth0">Similarly, if single occupational or associational or multiple common bond charter applicants cannot supply income data on its potential members, they should provide the regional director with a list which includes the number of potential members, sorted by their residential zip codes, and NCUA will assist in obtaining the necessary demographic data.</p><p class="depth0">An existing credit union can perform a loan or membership survey to determine if the credit union is primarily serving low-income members.</p><p class="depth0">II.D--Third Party Assistance</p><p class="depth0">A low-income federal credit union charter applicant may contract with a third party to assist in the chartering and low-income designation process. If the charter is granted, a low-income credit union may contract with a third party to provide necessary management services. Such contracts should not exceed the duration of one year subject to renewal.</p><p class="depth0">II.E--Special Rules for Low-Income Federal Credit Unions</p><p class="depth0">In recognition of the unique efforts needed to help make credit union service available to low-income groups, NCUA has adopted special rules that pertain to low-income credit union charters, as well as field of membership additions for low-income credit unions. These special rules provide additional latitude to enable underserved, low-income individuals to gain access to credit union service.</p><p class="depth0">NCUA permits credit union chartering and field of membership amendments based on

associational groups formed for the sole purpose of making credit union service available to low-income persons. The association must be defined so that all of its members will meet the low-income definition of Section 701.34 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations. Any multiple common bond credit union can add low-income associations to their fields of membership.</p><p class="depth0">A low-income designated community federal credit union has additional latitude in serving persons who are affiliated with the community. In addition to serving members who live, work, worship, or attend school in the community, a low-income community federal credit union may also serve persons who participate in programs to alleviate poverty or distress, or who participate in associations headquartered in the community.</p><p class="depth0">Examples of a low-income designated community and an associational-based low-income federal credit union are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Persons who live in [the target area]; persons who work, worship, attend school, or participate in associations headquartered in [the target area]; persons participating in programs to alleviate poverty or distress which are located in [the target area]; incorporated and unincorporated organizations located in [the target area] or maintaining a facility in [the target area]; and organizations of such persons.</p><p class="depth0">Members of the Canarsie Economic Assistance League, in Brooklyn, NY, an association whose members all meet the low-income definition of Section 701.34 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations.</p><p class="depth0">III--Service to Underserved Communities</p><p class="depth0">III.A--General</p><p class="depth0">A multiple common bond federal credit union may include in its field of membership, without regard to location, an ``underserved area'' as defined by the Federal Credit Union Act. 12 U.S.C. 1759(c)(2). The addition of an ``underserved area'' will not change the charter type of the multiple common bond federal credit union. More than one multiple common-bond federal credit union can serve the same ``underserved area,'' provided each credit union is approved as provided below.</p><p class="depth0">By adding an ``underserved area,'' a multiple common bond federal credit union does not become eligible to receive the benefits afforded to low-income designated credit unions, such as expanded use of nonmember deposits and access to the Community Development Revolving Loan Program for Credit Unions.</p><p class="depth0">III.B--``Underserved Area'' Defined</p><p class="depth0">The Federal Credit Union Act defines an ``underserved area'' as (1) a ``local community, neighborhood, or rural district'' that (2) meets the definition of an ``investment area'' under section 103(16) of the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994 (``CDFI''), 12 U.S.C. 4702(16), and (3) is ``underserved by other depository institutions'' based on data of the NCUA Board and the federal banking agencies.</p><p class="depth0">III.B.1--Local Community</p><p class="depth0">To be eligible for approval as ``underserved,'' a proposed area must be a well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district as defined in Chapter 2, sections V.A.1. and V.A.2. of this Manual.</p><p class="depth0">III.B.2--Investment Area</p><p class="depth0">To be approved as an ``underserved area,'' the proposed area must meet the CDFI definition of an ``investment area.'' Id. Sec. 4702(16). A proposed area that, at the time the credit union applies, is designated in its entirety as an Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community (id. Sec. 1391) automatically qualifies as an ``investment area''; no further criteria of an ``investment area'' must be met. Id. Sec. 4702(16)(B). A proposed area that is not designated as such must qualify as an ``investment area'' under ``the objective criteria of economic distress'' developed by the CDFI Fund (``distress criteria'') based on current decennial U.S. Census data, and also must have ``significant unmet needs'' for loans and financial services that credit unions are authorized to offer to their members. Id. Sec. 4702(16)(A).</p><p class="depth0">III.B.2.a--Economic Distress Criteria</p><p class="depth0">Geographic Unit(s) By Proposed Area's Location. The location of a proposed ``underserved area'' either within or outside of an MSA corresponding to the most recent completed decennial census published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census (``decennial Census'') determines the geographic unit(s) that apply to determine whether the area meets the distress criteria.</p><p class="depth0">Within MSA. For a proposed area located, in whole or in part, within an MSA, the permissible geographic units (``Metro units'') for implementing the economic distress criteria are: (i) a census tract; (ii) a block group; and (iii) an American Indian or Alaskan Native area. 12 CFR 1805.201(b)(3)(ii)(B) (2008). For ease of implementation, it is advisable to use a census tract as the proposed area's Metro unit.</p><p class="depth0">Outside MSA. For a proposed area that is located entirely outside an MSA, the permissible units (``Non-Metro units'') for implementing the economic distress criteria are: (i) a county or equivalent area; (ii) a minor civil division that is a unit of local government; (iii) an incorporated place; (iv) a census tract; (v) a block numbering area; (vi) a block group; and (vii) an American Indian or Alaskan Native area. Id. For ease of implementation, it is advisable to use either a

census tract or county, as the case may be, as the proposed area's Non-Metro unit.</p><p class="depth0">Proposed Area Consisting of a Single Metro Unit. A proposed area consisting of a single whole Metro unit (e.g., a single census tract located within an MSA) must meet one of the following distress criteria, as reported by the most recent decennial Census:</p><p class="depth0">Unemployment. The proposed area's unemployment rate is at least 1.5 times the national average; or</p><p class="depth0">Poverty. At least 20 percent (20%) of the proposed area's population lives in poverty; or</p><p class="depth0">Median Family Income. The proposed area's Median Family Income (``MFI'') is at or below 80 percent (80%) of either the MFI of the corresponding MSA, or of the national MFI for Metro Areas, whichever is greater; or</p><p class="depth0">Other Criterion. Any other economic distress criterion the CDFI Fund may adopt in the future.</p><p class="depth0">Id. Sec. 1805.201(b)(3)(ii)(D)(1), (2)(i) and (3) (2008).</p><p class="depth0">Proposed Area Consisting of a Single Non-Metro Unit. A proposed area consisting of a single whole Non-Metro unit (e.g., a single county located outside an MSA) must meet one of the following distress criteria, as reported by the most recent decennial Census:</p><p class="depth0">Unemployment. The proposed area's unemployment rate is at least 1.5 times the national average; or</p><p class="depth0">Poverty. At least 20 percent (20%) of the proposed area's population lives in poverty; or</p><p class="depth0">Median Family Income. The proposed area's MFI is at or below 80 percent (80%) of either the corresponding state's Non-Metro MFI or the national MFI for Non-Metro Areas, whichever is greater; or</p><p class="depth0">Other Criterion. Any other economic distress criterion the CDFI Fund may adopt in the future.</p><p class="depth0">Id. Sec. 1805.201(b)(3)(ii)(D)(1), (2)(ii) and (3) (2008). Alternatively, a proposed area consisting of a single Non-Metro county (located outside an MSA) may instead meet either of the following two criteria, as reported by the decennial Census:</p><p class="depth0">County Population Loss. County's population loss of at least 10 percent (10%) between the most recent and the preceding decennial Census; or</p><p class="depth0">County Migration Loss. County's net migration loss of at least 5 percent (5%) in the 5-year period preceding the most recent decennial Census.</p><p class="depth0">Id. Sec. 1805.201(b)(3)(ii)(D)(4)-(5) (2008).</p><p class="depth0">Proposed Area Consisting of Multiple Contiguous Units. When a proposed area consists of either multiple contiguous Metro units (e.g., a group of adjoining census tracts) or multiple contiguous Non-Metro units (e.g., a group of adjoining counties), a population threshold applies when implementing the economic distress criteria. At least 85 percent (85%) of the area's total population must reside within the units that are ``distressed,'' i.e, that meet one of the applicable economic distress criteria above, as reported by the decennial Census (Unemployment, Poverty and MFI for census tracts plus, for counties only, Population Loss and Migration Loss); the balance of the area's population may reside in the non-``distressed'' tract(s). The population threshold is met, and the whole proposed area qualifies as ``distressed,'' when the ``distressed'' units represent at least 85 percent of the area's total population.</p><p class="depth0">III.B.2.b--Proposed Area's ``Significant Unmet Needs''</p><p class="depth0">A proposed area that is ``distressed'' also must display ``significant unmet needs'' for loans or for one or more of the financial services credit unions are authorized to offer. To meet this criterion, the credit union must include within its Business Plan a section, one page in length, entitled ``Significant Unmet Needs for Credit Union Services'' (``SUN section'') that establishes the existence of such unmet needs by identifying the credit and depository needs of the community and detailing how the credit union plans to serve those needs. The credit union may choose which among the following ``credit and depository needs'' to address in the SUN section: loans, share draft accounts, savings accounts, check cashing, money orders, certified checks, automated teller machines, deposit taking, safe deposit box services, and similar services. The existence of each ``credit and depository need'' the credit union identifies and plans to serve must be supported by objective reasons and/or accompanying documentation derived from an identified, authoritative source of the credit union's choice. Third party documentation generally is the most compelling.</p><p class="depth0">III.B.3--Underserved by Other Depository Institutions</p><p class="depth0">A proposed area that meets the CDFI definition of an ``investment area'' (i.e, is ``distressed'' and has ``significant unmet needs'') must also be underserved by other insured depository institutions, including credit unions. 12 U.S.C. 1759(c)(2)(A)(ii). This statutory criterion is met when the concentration of depository institution facilities among the population of the proposed area's non-``distressed'' tracts--which sets a benchmark level of adequate service--is greater than the concentration of facilities among the population of all of the proposed area's census tracts combined. If there are no non-``distressed'' tracts within a proposed area, a non-``distressed'' census tract or larger geographic unit (e.g., city or county) of the credit union's choice that adjoins the proposed

area may be used to set the benchmark concentration ratio.</p><p class="depth0">Without regard to a proposed area's location within or outside an MSA, this criterion compares two ratios: the ratio of facilities to the population of the non-``distressed'' tracts (the benchmark) versus the same facilities-to-population ratio among all the tracts of the proposed area as a whole. If the benchmark ratio is greater than the ratio for the whole area, then the area is ``underserved by other depository institutions,'' and vice versa.</p><p class="depth0">III.C--NCUA Approval</p><p class="depth0">If NCUA approves the request to add an ``underserved area,'' the credit union will be issued an amendment to Section 5 of its charter.</p><p class="depth0">III.D--Approval to Serve an Already Approved ``Underserved Area''</p><p class="depth0">Once a credit union is initially approved to serve an ``underserved area,'' other credit unions that subsequently apply may be approved to serve the same area. To be approved, the area must qualify as ``underserved'' at the time the new applicant applies. An applicant must demonstrate the area continues to be ``distressed'', as provided above, only if a new decennial Census has been published since the date the area was last approved. In any case, the applicant must demonstrate that the area still has ``significant unmet needs'' for loans or credit union services (to qualify as an ``investment area''), and remains ``underserved by other depository institutions'' (to qualify as ``underserved'').</p><p class="depth0">III.E--Business Plan</p><p class="depth0">A federal credit union that desires to include an underserved community in its field of membership must first develop, and submit for approval, a business plan specifying how it will serve the community. In addition, the business plan must include a SUN section as provided in section III.B.2.b. above. The credit union will be expected to regularly review the business plan to determine if the community is being adequately served. The regional director may require periodic service status reports from a credit union about the ``underserved area'' to ensure that the needs of the community are being met, and must require such reports before NCUA allows a multiple common bond federal credit union to add an additional ``underserved area.''</p><p class="depth0">III.F--Service Facility</p><p class="depth0">Once an ``underserved area'' has been added to a federal credit union's field of membership, the credit union must establish within two years, and maintain, an office or service facility in the community. A service facility is defined as a place where shares are accepted for members' accounts, loan applications are accepted and loans are disbursed. By definition, a service facility includes a credit union-owned branch, a shared branch, a mobile branch, or an office operated on a regularly scheduled weekly basis or a credit union owned electronic facility that meets, at a minimum, the above requirements. This definition does not include an ATM or the credit union's Internet Web site.</p><p class="depth0">IV--Appeal Procedures for Denial of Underserved Area</p><p class="depth0">IV.A--NCUA Disapproval</p><p class="depth0">When NCUA disapproves any application to add an ``underserved area'' in whole or in part, under this chapter, the applicant will be informed in writing of the:</p><p class="depth0">Specific reasons for the action;</p><p class="depth0">Options to consider, if appropriate, for gaining approval; and</p><p class="depth0">Appeal procedures.</p><p class="depth0">IV.B--Appeal of Regional Director Decision</p><p class="depth0">If the regional director denies an ``underserved area'' request, the federal credit union may appeal the decision to the NCUA Board. An appeal must be sent to the appropriate regional office within 60 days of the date of denial and must address the specific reason(s) for the denial. The regional director will then forward the appeal to the NCUA Board. NCUA central office staff will make an independent review of the facts and present the appeal to the NCUA Board with a recommendation.</p><p class="depth0">Before appealing, the credit union may, within 30 days of the denial, provide supplemental information to the regional director for reconsideration. A reconsideration will contain new and material evidence addressing the reasons for the initial denial. The regional director will have 30 days from the date of the receipt of the request for reconsideration to make a final decision. If the request is again denied, the applicant may proceed with the appeal process within 60 days of the date of the last denial. A second request for reconsideration will be treated as an appeal to the NCUA Board.</p><p class="depth0">Chapter 4</p><p class="depth0">Charter Conversions</p><p class="depth0">I--Introduction</p><p class="depth0">A charter conversion is a change in the jurisdictional authority under which a credit union operates.</p><p class="depth0">Federal credit unions receive their charters from NCUA and are subject to its supervision, examination, and regulation.</p><p class="depth0">State-chartered credit unions are incorporated in a particular state, receiving their charter from the state agency responsible for

credit unions and subject to the state's regulator. If the state-chartered credit union's deposits are federally insured, it will also fall under NCUA's jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0">A federal credit union's power and authority are derived from the Federal Credit Union Act and NCUA Rules and Regulations. State-chartered credit unions are governed by state law and regulation. Certain federal laws and regulations also apply to federally insured state chartered credit unions.</p><p class="depth0">There are two types of charter conversions: federal charter to state charter and state charter to federal charter. Common bond and community requirements are not an issue from NCUA's standpoint in the case of a federal to state charter conversion. The procedures and forms relevant to both types of charter conversion are included in appendix 4.</p><p class="depth0">II--Conversion of a State Credit Union to a Federal Credit Union</p><p class="depth0">II.A--General Requirements</p><p class="depth0">Any state-chartered credit union may apply to convert to a federal credit union. In order to do so it must:</p><p class="depth0">Comply with state law regarding conversion and file proof of compliance with NCUA;</p><p class="depth0">File the required conversion application, proposed federal credit union organization certificate, and other documents with NCUA;</p><p class="depth0">Comply with the requirements of the Federal Credit Union Act, e.g., chartering and reserve requirements; and</p><p class="depth0">Be granted federal share insurance by NCUA.</p><p class="depth0">Conversions are treated the same as any initial application for a federal charter, including an on-site examination by NCUA where appropriate. NCUA will also consult with the appropriate state authority regarding the credit union's current financial condition, management expertise, and past performance. Since the applicant in a conversion is an ongoing credit union, the economic advisability of granting a charter is more readily determinable than in the case of an initial charter applicant.</p><p class="depth0">A converting state credit union's field of membership must conform to NCUA's chartering policy. The field of membership will be phrased in accordance with NCUA chartering policy. However, if the converting credit union is a multiple group charter and the new federal charter is a multiple group, then the new federal charter may retain in its field of membership any group that the state credit union was serving at the time of conversion. Subsequent changes must conform to NCUA chartering policy in effect at that time.</p><p class="depth0">If the converting credit union is a community charter and the new federal charter is community-based, it must meet the community field of membership requirements set forth in Chapter 2, Section V of this manual. If the state-chartered credit union's community boundary is more expansive than the approved federal boundary, only members of record outside of the new community boundary may continue to be served.</p><p class="depth0">The converting credit union, regardless of charter type, may continue to serve members of record. The converting credit union may retain in its field of membership any group or community added pursuant to state emergency provisions.</p><p class="depth0">II.B--Submission of Conversion Proposal to NCUA</p><p class="depth0">The following documents must be submitted with the conversion proposal:</p><p class="depth0">Conversion of State Charter to Federal Charter (NCUA 4000);</p><p class="depth0">Organization Certificate (NCUA 4008). Only Part (3) and the signature/notary section should be completed and, where applicable, signed by the credit union officials.</p><p class="depth0">Report of Officials and Agreement to Serve (NCUA 4012);</p><p class="depth0">The Application to Convert From State Credit Union to Federal Credit Union (NCUA 4401);</p><p class="depth0">The Application and Agreements for Insurance of Accounts (NCUA 9500);</p><p class="depth0">Certification of Resolution (NCUA 9501);</p><p class="depth0">Written evidence regarding whether the state regulator is in agreement with the conversion proposal; and</p><p class="depth0">Business plan, as appropriate, including the most current financial report and delinquent loan schedule.</p><p class="depth0">If the state charter is applying to become a federal community charter, it must also comply with the documentation requirements included in Chapter 2, Section V.A.2 of this manual.</p><p class="depth0">II.C--NCUA Consideration of Application To Convert</p><p class="depth0">II.C.1--Review by the Regional Director</p><p class="depth0">The application will be reviewed to determine that it is complete and that the proposal is in compliance with Section 125 of the Federal Credit Union Act. This review will include a determination that the state credit union's field of membership is in compliance with NCUA's chartering policies. The regional director may make further investigation into the proposal and may require the submission of additional information to support the request to convert.</p><p class="depth0">II.C.2--On-Site Review</p><p class="depth0">NCUA may conduct an on-site examination of the books and records of the credit union. Non-federally insured credit unions will be assessed an insurance application fee.

II.C.3--Approval by the Regional Director and Conditions to the Approval</p><p class="depth0">The conversion will be approved by the regional director if it is in compliance with Section 125 of the Federal Credit Union Act and meets the criteria for federal insurance. Where applicable, the regional director will specify any special conditions that the credit union must meet in order to convert to a federal charter, including changes to the credit union's field of membership in order to conform to NCUA's chartering policies. Some of these conditions may be set forth in a Letter of Understanding and Agreement (LUA), which requires the signature of the officials and the regional director.</p><p class="depth0">II.C.4--Notification</p><p class="depth0">The regional director will notify both the credit union and the state regulator of the decision on the conversion.</p><p class="depth0">II.C.5--NCUA Disapproval</p><p class="depth0">When NCUA disapproves any application to convert to a federal charter, the applicant will be informed in writing of the:</p><p class="depth0">Specific reasons for the action;</p><p class="depth0">Options to consider, if appropriate, for gaining approval; and</p><p class="depth0">Appeal procedures.</p><p class="depth0">II.C.6--Appeal of Regional Director Decision</p><p class="depth0">If a conversion to a federal charter is denied by the regional director, the applicant credit union may appeal the decision to the NCUA Board. An appeal must be sent to the appropriate regional office within 60 days of the date of denial and must address the specific reason(s) for the denial. The regional director will then forward the appeal to the NCUA Board. NCUA central office staff will make an independent review of the facts and present the appeal to the NCUA Board with a recommendation.</p><p class="depth0">Before appealing, the credit union may, within 30 days of the denial, provide supplemental information to the regional director for reconsideration. The request will not be considered as an appeal, but a request for reconsideration by the regional director. The regional director will have 30 business days from the date of the receipt of the request for reconsideration to make a final decision. If the application is again denied, the credit union may proceed with the appeal process to the NCUA Board within 60 days of the date of the last denial by the regional director.</p><p class="depth0">II.D--Action by Board of Directors</p><p class="depth0">II.D.1--General</p><p class="depth0">Upon being informed of the regional director's preliminary approval, the board must:</p><p class="depth0">Comply with all requirements of the state regulator that will enable the credit union to convert to a federal charter and cease being a state credit union;</p><p class="depth0">Obtain a letter or official statement from the state regulator certifying that the credit union has met all of the state requirements and will cease to be a state credit union upon its receiving a federal charter. A copy of this document must be submitted to the regional director;</p><p class="depth0">Obtain a letter from the private share insurer (includes excess share insurers), if applicable, certifying that the credit union has met all withdrawal requirements. A copy of this document must be submitted to the regional director; and</p><p class="depth0">Submit a statement of the action taken to comply with any conditions imposed by the regional director in the preliminary approval of the conversion proposal and, if applicable, submit the signed LUA.</p><p class="depth0">II.D.2--Application for a Federal Charter</p><p class="depth0">When the regional director has received evidence that the board of directors has satisfactorily completed the actions described above, the federal charter and new Certificate of Insurance will be issued.</p><p class="depth0">The credit union may then complete the conversion as discussed in the following section. A denial of a conversion application can be appealed. Refer to Section II.C.6 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">II.E--Completion of the Conversion</p><p class="depth0">II.E.1--Effective Date of Conversion</p><p class="depth0">The date on which the regional director approves the Organization Certificate and the Application and Agreements for Insurance of Accounts is the date on which the credit union becomes a federal credit union. The regional director will notify the credit union and the state regulator of the date of the conversion.</p><p class="depth0">II.E.2--Assumption of Assets and Liabilities</p><p class="depth0">As of the effective date of the conversion, the federal credit union will be the owner of all of the assets and will be responsible for all of the liabilities and share accounts of the state credit union.</p><p class="depth0">II.E.3--Board of Directors' Meeting</p><p class="depth0">Upon receipt of its federal charter, the board will hold its first meeting as a federal credit union. At this meeting, the board will transact such business as is necessary to complete the conversion as approved and to operate the credit union in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Credit Union Act and NCUA Rules and Regulations.</p><p class="depth0">As of the commencement of operations, the accounting system, records, and forms must conform to the standards established by NCUA.</p><p class="depth0">II.E.4--Credit Union's Name</p><p class="depth0">Changing of the credit union's name on all signage, records, accounts, investments, and other documents should be accomplished as soon as possible after conversion. The credit union has 180 days from the effective date of the conversion to change its signage and promotional material. This requires the credit union to discontinue using any remaining stock of ``state credit union'' stationery immediately, and discontinue using credit cards, ATM cards, etc., within 180 days after the effective date of the conversion, or the reissue date,whichever is later. The regional director has the discretion to extend the timeframe for an additional 180 days. Member share drafts with the state-chartered name can be used by the members until depleted.</p><p class="depth0">II.E.5--Reports to NCUA</p><p class="depth0">Within 10 business days after commencement of operations, the recently converted federal credit union must submit to the regional director the following:</p><p class="depth0">Report of Officials (NCUA 4501); and</p><p class="depth0">Financial and Statistical Reports, as of the commencement of business of the federal credit union.</p><p class="depth0">III--Conversion of a Federal Credit Union to a State Credit Union</p><p class="depth0">III.A--General Requirements</p><p class="depth0">Any federal credit union may apply to convert to a state credit union. In order to do so, it must:</p><p class="depth0">Notify NCUA prior to commencing the process to convert to a state charter and state the reason(s) for the conversion;</p><p class="depth0">Comply with the requirements of Section 125 of the Federal Credit Union Act that enable it to convert to a state credit union and to cease being a federal credit union; and</p><p class="depth0">Comply with applicable state law and the requirements of the state regulator.</p><p class="depth0">It is important that the credit union provide an accurate disclosure of the reasons for the conversion. These reasons should be stated in specific terms, not as generalities. The federal credit union converting to a state charter remains responsible for the entire operating fee for the year in which it converts.</p><p class="depth0">III.B--Special Provisions Regarding Federal Share Insurance</p><p class="depth0">If the federal credit union intends to continue federal share insurance after the conversion to a state credit union, it must submit an Application for Insurance of Accounts (NCUA 9600) to the regional director at the time it requests approval of the conversion proposal. The regional director has the authority to approve or disapprove the application.</p><p class="depth0">If the converting federal credit union does not intend to continue federal share insurance or if its application for continued insurance is denied, insurance will cease in accordance with the provisions of Section 206 of the Federal Credit Union Act.</p><p class="depth0">If, upon its conversion to a state credit union, the federal credit union will be terminating its federal share insurance or converting from federal to non-federal share insurance, it must comply with the membership notice and voting procedures set forth in Section 206 of the Federal Credit Union Act and part 708 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations, and address the criteria set forth in Section 205(c) of the Federal Credit Union Act.</p><p class="depth0">Where the state credit union will be non-federally insured, federal insurance ceases on the effective date of the charter conversion. If it will be otherwise uninsured, then federal insurance will cease one year after the date of conversion subject to the restrictions in Section 206(d)(1) of the Federal Credit Union Act. In either case, the state credit union will be entitled to a refund of the federal credit union's NCUSIF capitalization deposit after the final date on which any of its shares are federally insured.</p><p class="depth0">The NCUA Board reserves the right to delay the refund of the capitalization deposit for up to one year if it determines that payment would jeopardize the NCUSIF.</p><p class="depth0">III.C--Submission of Conversion Proposal to NCUA</p><p class="depth0">Upon approval of a proposition for conversion by a majority vote of the board of directors at a meeting held in accordance with the federal credit union's bylaws, the conversion proposal will be submitted to the regional director and will include:</p><p class="depth0">A current financial report;</p><p class="depth0">A current delinquent loan schedule;</p><p class="depth0">An explanation and appropriate documents relative to any changes in insurance of member accounts;</p><p class="depth0">A resolution of the board of directors;</p><p class="depth0">A proposed Notice of Special Meeting of the Members (NCUA 4221);</p><p class="depth0">A copy of the ballot to be sent to all members (NCUA 4506);</p><p class="depth0">If the credit union intends to continue with federal share insurance, an application for insurance of accounts (NCUA 9600);</p><p class="depth0">Evidence that the state regulator is in agreement with the conversion proposal; and</p><p class="depth0">A statement of reasons supporting the request to convert.</p><p class="depth0">III.D--Approval of Proposal to Convert</p><p class="depth0">III.D.1--Review by the Regional Director</p><p class="depth0">The proposal will be reviewed to determine that it is complete and is in compliance with Section 125 of the Federal Credit Union Act.

The regional director may make further investigation into the proposal and require the submission of additional information to support the request.</p><p class="depth0">III.D.2--Conditions to the Approval</p><p class="depth0">The regional director will specify any special conditions that the credit union must meet in order to proceed with the conversion.</p><p class="depth0">III.D.3--Approval by the Regional Director</p><p class="depth0">The proposal will be approved by the regional director if it is in compliance with Section 125 and, in the case where the state credit union will no longer be federally insured, the notice and voting requirements of Section 206 of the Federal Credit Union Act.</p><p class="depth0">III.D.4--Notification</p><p class="depth0">The regional director will notify both the credit union and the state regulator of the decision on the proposal.</p><p class="depth0">III.D.5--NCUA Disapproval</p><p class="depth0">When NCUA disapproves any application to convert to a state charter, the applicant will be informed in writing of the:</p><p class="depth0">Specific reasons for the action;</p><p class="depth0">If appropriate, options or suggestions that could be considered for gaining approval; and</p><p class="depth0">Appeal procedures.</p><p class="depth0">III.D.6--Appeal of Regional Director Decision</p><p class="depth0">If the regional director denies a conversion to a state charter, the applicant credit union may appeal the decision to the NCUA Board. An appeal must be sent to the appropriate regional office within 60 days of the date of denial and must address the specific reason(s) for the denial. The regional director will then forward the appeal to the NCUA Board. NCUA central office staff will make an independent review of the facts and present the appeal to the NCUA Board with a recommendation.</p><p class="depth0">Before appealing, the credit union may, within 30 days of the denial, provide supplemental information to the regional director for reconsideration. The request will not be considered as an appeal, but a request for reconsideration by the regional director. The regional director will have 30 business days from the date of the receipt of the request for reconsideration to make a final decision. If the application is again denied, the credit union may proceed with the appeal process to the NCUA Board within 60 days of the date of the last denial by the regional director.</p><p class="depth0">III.E--Approval of Proposal by Members</p><p class="depth0">The members may not vote on the proposal until it is approved by the regional director. Once approval of the proposal is received, the following actions will be taken by the board of directors:</p><p class="depth0">The proposal must be submitted to the members for approval and a date set for a meeting to vote on the proposal. The proposal may be acted on at the annual meeting or at a special meeting for that purpose. The members must also be given the opportunity to vote by written ballot to be filed by the date set for the meeting.</p><p class="depth0">Members must be given advance notice (NCUA 4221) of the meeting at which the proposal is to be submitted. The notice must:</p><p class="depth0">o Specify the purpose, time and place of the meeting;</p><p class="depth0">o Include a brief, complete, and accurate statement of the reasons for and against the proposed conversion, including any effects it could have upon share holdings, insurance of member accounts, and the policies and practices of the credit union;</p><p class="depth0">o Specify the costs of the conversion, i.e., changing the credit union's name, examination and operating fees, attorney and consulting fees, tax liability, etc.;</p><p class="depth0">o Inform the members that they have the right to vote on the proposal at the meeting, or by written ballot to be filed not later than the date and time announced for the annual meeting, or at the special meeting called for that purpose;</p><p class="depth0">o Be accompanied by a Federal to State Conversion--Ballot for Conversion Proposal (NCUA 4506); and</p><p class="depth0">o State in bold face type that the issue will be decided by a majority of members who vote.</p><p class="depth0">The proposed conversion must be approved by a majority of all of the members who vote on the proposal, a quorum being present, in order for the credit union to proceed further with the proposition, provided federal insurance is maintained. If the proposed state-chartered credit union will not be federally insured, 20 percent of the total membership must participate in the voting, and of those, a majority must vote in favor of the proposal. Ballots cast by members who did not attend the meeting but who submitted their ballots in accordance with instructions above will be counted with votes cast at the meeting. In order to have a suitable record of the vote, the voting at the meeting should be by written ballot as well.</p><p class="depth0">The board of directors shall, within 10 days, certify the results of the membership vote to the regional director. The statement shall be verified by affidavits of the Chief Executive Officer and the Recording Officer on NCUA 4505.</p><p class="depth0">III.F--Compliance With State Laws</p><p class="depth0">If the proposal for conversion is approved by a majority of all members who voted, the board of directors will:</p><p class="depth0">Ensure that all requirements of state law and the state regulator have been accommodated;</p><p class="depth0">Ensure that the state charter or the license has been received within 90 days from the date the members approved the proposal to convert; and</p><p class="depth0">Ensure that the regional director is kept informed as to progress toward conversion and of any material delay or of substantial difficulties which may be encountered.</p><p class="depth0">If the conversion cannot be completed within the 90-day period, the regional director should be informed of the reasons for the delay. The regional director may set a new date for the conversion to be completed.</p><p class="depth0">III.G--Completion of Conversion</p><p class="depth0">In order for the conversion to be completed, the following steps are necessary:</p><p class="depth0">The board of directors will submit a copy of the state charter to the regional director within 10 days of its receipt. This will be accompanied by the federal charter and the federal insurance certificate. A copy of the financial reports as of the preceding month-end should be submitted at this time.</p><p class="depth0">The regional director will notify the credit union and the state regulator in writing of the receipt of evidence that the credit union has been authorized to operate as a state credit union.</p><p class="depth0">The credit union shall cease to be a federal credit union as of the effective date of the state charter.</p><p class="depth0">If the regional director finds a material deviation from the provisions that would invalidate any steps taken in the conversion, the credit union and the state regulator shall be promptly notified in writing. This notice may be either before or after the copy of the state charter is filed with the regional director. The notice will inform the credit union as to the nature of the adverse findings. The conversion will not be effective and completed until the improper actions and steps have been corrected.</p><p class="depth0">Upon ceasing to be a federal credit union, the credit union shall no longer be subject to any of the provisions of the Federal Credit Union Act, except as may apply if federal share insurance coverage is continued. The successor state credit union shall be immediately vested with all of the assets and shall continue to be responsible for all of the obligations of the federal credit union to the same extent as though the conversion had not taken place. Operation of the credit union from this point will be in accordance with the requirements of state law and the state regulator.</p><p class="depth0">If the regional director is satisfied that the conversion has been accomplished in accordance with the approved proposal, the federal charter will be canceled.</p><p class="depth0">There is no federal requirement for closing the records of the federal credit union at the time of conversion or for the manner in which the records shall be maintained thereafter. The converting credit union is advised to contact the state regulator for applicable state requirements.</p><p class="depth0">The credit union shall neither use the words ``Federal Credit Union'' in its name nor represent itself in any manner as being a federal credit union.</p><p class="depth0">Changing of the credit union's name on all signage, records, accounts, investments, and other documents should be accomplished as soon as possible after conversion. Unless it violates state law, the credit union has 180 days from the effective date of the conversion to change its signage and promotional material. This requires the credit union to discontinue using any remaining stock of ``federal credit union'' stationery immediately, and discontinue using credit cards, ATM cards, etc., within 180 days after the effective date of the conversion, or the reissue date, whichever is later. The regional director has the discretion to extend the timeframe for an additional 180 days. Member share drafts with the federal chartered name can be used by the members until depleted. If the state credit union is not federally insured, it must change its name and must immediately cease using any credit union documents referencing federal insurance.</p><p class="depth0">If the state credit union is to be federally insured, the regional director will issue a new insurance certificate.
