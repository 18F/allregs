A request by the  individual data subject for access to his or her own records shall not  be denied unless both a Privacy Act exemption and a Freedom of  Information Act exemption apply to the requested records. A component  shall make a determination within 30 days to grant or deny a request for  access in whole or in part. If the request is granted in whole, the  component shall so notify the requester in writing. The notice shall  describe the manner in which access to the record will be granted and  shall inform the requester of any fees to be charged in accordance with  Sec. 71.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form of notice denying request for access. A component denying a  request for access in whole or in part shall so notify the requester in  writing. The notice, signed by the responsible agency official, shall  include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name and title or position of the person responsible for the  denial;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A brief statement of the reason or reasons for the denial,  including the Privacy Act and FOIA exemption or exemptions which the  component has relied upon in denying the request; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement that the denial may be appealed under Sec. 71.7(a),  and a description of the requirements of that paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Record cannot be located. If no records are found which are  responsive to the request, the component shall so notify the requester  in writing. Such notification by the component shall inform the  requester that, if the requester considers this response to be a denial  of their request, the requester has a right to appeal to the Solicitor  of Labor, within ninety days, as set forth in Sec. 71.7.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Medical records. When an individual requests medical records  concerning himself, which are not otherwise exempt from disclosure, the  disclosure officer shall, if deemed necessary because of possible harm  to the individual, advise the individual that the Department of Labor  believes that the records should be provided to a physician designated  in writing by the individual. In addition, the Department shall request  the individual to designate such a physician. Upon receipt of the  designation, the disclosure officer will permit the physician to review  the records or to receive copies of the records by mail, upon proper  verification of identity.</p>
