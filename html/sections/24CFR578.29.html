                            <p class="depth0">HUD may provide assistance under this program only in accordance with HUD subsidy layering requirements in section 102 of the Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3545) and 24 CFR part 4, subpart A. An applicant must submit information in its application on other sources of governmental assistance that the applicant has received, or reasonably expects to receive, for a proposed project or activities. HUD's review of this information is intended to prevent excessive public assistance for proposed project or activities by combining (layering) assistance under this program with other governmental housing assistance from federal, State, or local agencies, including assistance such as tax concessions or tax credits.</p>
