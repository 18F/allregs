                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authorization to extend credit. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A carrier that meets the  requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Relinquish possession of freight in advance of the payment of  the tariff charges, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Extend credit in the amount of such charges to those who  undertake to pay them (such persons are called shippers in this part).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For such authorization, the carrier shall take reasonable  actions to assure payment of the tariff charges within the credit  periods specified--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In this part, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In tariff provisions published pursuant to the regulations in  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the credit period begins. The credit period shall begin on  the day following presentation of the freight bill.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Length of credit period. Unless a different credit period has  been established by tariff publication pursuant to paragraph (d) of this  section, the credit period is 15 days. It includes Saturdays, Sundays,  and legal holidays.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Carriers may establish different credit periods in tariff rules.  Carriers may publish tariff rules establishing credit periods different  from those in paragraph (c) of this section. Such credit periods shall  not be longer than 30 calendar days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Service charges. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Service charges shall not apply when credit  is extended and payments are made within the standard credit period. The  term standard credit period, as used in the preceding sentence, means--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The credit period prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section,  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A substitute credit period published in a tariff rule pursuant  to the authorization in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Carriers may, by tariff rule, extend credit for an additional  time period, subject if they wish to a service charge for that  additional time. The combined length of the carrier's standard credit  period (as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) and its  additional credit period shall not exceed the 30-day maximum credit  period prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section. When such a tariff  rule is in effect, shippers may elect to postpone payment until the end  of the extended credit period if, in consideration therefor, they  include any published service charges when making their payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Carriers may, by tariff rule, establish service charges for  payments made after the expiration of an authorized credit period. Such  a rule shall--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Institute such charges on the day following the last day of an  authorized credit period, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notify shippers--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> That its only purpose is to prevent a shipper who does not pay  on time from having free use of funds due to the carrier,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> That it does not sanction payment delays, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> That failure to pay within the authorized credit period will,  despite this provision for such charges, continue to require the  carrier, before again extending credit, to determine in good faith  whether the shipper will comply with the credit regulations in the  future.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Tariff rules that establish charges pursuant to paragraph (e)  (2) or (3) of this section may establish minimum charges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Discounts. Carriers may, by tariff rule, authorize discounts for  early freight bill payments when credit is extended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Collection expense charges. Carriers may, by tariff rule,  assess reasonable and certain liquidated damages for all costs incurred  in the collection of overdue freight charges. Carriers may use one of  two methods in their tariffs:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The first method is to assess liquidated damages as a separate  additional charge to the unpaid freight bill. In doing so, the tariff  rule shall disclose the exact amount of the charges by stating either a  dollar or specified percentage amount (or a combination of both) of the  unpaid freight bill. The tariff shall further specify the time period  (which shall at least allow for the authorized credit period) within  which the shipper must pay to avoid such liquidated damages.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The second method is to require payment of the full,  nondiscounted rate instead of the discounted rate otherwise applicable.  The difference between the discount and the full rate constitutes a  carrier's liquidated damages for its collection effort. Under this  method the tariff shall identify the discount rates that are subject to  the condition precedent and which require the shipper to make payment by  a date certain. The date certain may not be set to occur by the carrier  until at least after the expiration of the carrier's authorized credit  period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The damages, the timing of their applicability, and the  conditions, if any, as provided by the tariff-rule methods allowed under  paragraphs (g)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section also:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Shall be clearly described in the tariff rule;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Shall be applied without unlawful prejudice and/or unjust  discrimination between similarly situated shippers and/or consignees;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Shall be applied only to the nonpayment of original, separate  and independent freight bills and shall not apply to aggregate balance- due claims sought for collection on past shipments by a bankruptcy  trustee, or any other person or agent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Shall not apply to instances of clear clerical or ministerial  error such as non-receipt of a carrier's freight bill, or shipper's  payment check lost in the mail, or carrier mailing of the freight bill  to the wrong address;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Shall not apply in any way to a charge for a transportation  service if the carrier's bill of lading independently provides that the  shipper is liable for fees incurred by the carrier in the collection of  freight charges on that same transportation service;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> shall be applied only after the authorized credit period, and  when the carrier has issued a revised freight bill   or notice of imposition of collection expense charges for late payment  within 90 days after expiration of the authorized credit period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As an alternative to the tariff-rule methods allowed under  paragraphs (g)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, a carrier may, wholly  outside of its tariff, assess collection charges though contract terms  in a bill of lading. By using the carrier and its bill of lading, the  shipper accepts the bill of lading terms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Discrimination prohibited. Tariff rules published pursuant to  paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section shall not result in  unreasonable discrimination among shippers.
