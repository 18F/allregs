                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Time, place, and manner. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If and when the proceeding has  reached the stage where an oral hearing is to be held, the presiding  officer shall set a time, place, and manner for oral hearing. The time  shall be set based upon careful consideration to the convenience of the  parties. The place shall be set in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of  this section and careful consideration to the convenience of the  parties. The manner in which the hearing is to be conducted shall be  determined in accordance with paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The place shall be set in accordance with paragraphs (e) and (f)  of section 407 of the Act, if applicable. In essence, under paragraphs  (e) and (f) of section 407 of the Act, if the complainant and the  respondent, or all of the parties, if there are more than two, have  their principal places of business or residence within a single unit of  local government, a single geographical area within a State, or a single  State, the oral hearing is to be held as near as possible to such places  of business or residence, depending on the availability of an  appropriate location for conducting the hearing. If the parties have  such places of business or residence distant from each other, then  paragraphs (e) and (f) of section 407 of the Act are not applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The oral hearing shall be conducted by audio-visual  telecommunication unless the presiding officer determines that  conducting the oral hearing by personal attendance of any individual who  is expected to participate in the hearing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected  to participate in the hearing; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual  telecommunication. If the presiding officer determines that a hearing  conducted by audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase  the United States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the  hearing, the hearing shall be conducted by personal attendance of any  individual who is expected to participate in the hearing or by  telephone.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The presiding officer may, in his or her sole discretion or in  response to a motion by a party to the proceeding, conduct the hearing  by telephone if the presiding officer finds that a hearing conducted by  telephone:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Would provide a full and fair evidentiary hearing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Would not prejudice any party; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual  telecommunication or personal attendance of any individual who is  expected to participate in the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A notice stating the time, place, and manner of oral  hearing shall be served on each party prior to the time of the oral  hearing. The notice shall state whether the oral hearing will be  conducted by telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or personal  attendance of any individual expected to participate in the hearing. If  any change is made in the time, place, or manner of the oral hearing, a  notice of the change shall be served on each party prior to the time of  the oral hearing as changed, unless the change is made during the course  of an oral hearing and shown in the transcript or on the recording. Any  party may waive such notice, in writing, or orally on the record at an  oral hearing and shown in the transcript or on the recording.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the presiding officer orders an oral hearing, any party may  move that the hearing be conducted by telephone or personal attendance  of any individual expected to attend the hearing rather than by audio- visual telecommunication. Any motion that the hearing be conducted by  telephone or personal attendance of any individual expected to attend  the hearing must be accompanied by a memorandum in support of the motion  stating the basis for the motion and the circumstances that require the  hearing to be conducted other than by audio-visual telecommunication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Within 10 days after the presiding officer issues a notice  stating the manner in which the hearing is to be conducted, any party  may move that the presiding officer reconsider the manner in which the  hearing is to be conducted. Any motion for reconsideration must be  accompanied by a memorandum in support of the motion stating the basis  for the motion and the circumstances that require the hearing to be  conducted other than in accordance with the presiding officer's notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure to appear. If any party to the proceeding, after being  duly notified, fails to appear at the oral hearing in person or by  counsel or other representative, such party shall be deemed to have  waived the right to add any further evidence to the record in the  proceeding, or to object to the admission of any evidence; if the  parties who are present are all adverse to such party, they shall have  an election to present evidence, in whole or in part, in the form of  oral testimony before the presiding officer, affidavits, or depositions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Order of proceeding. Complainant shall proceed first, if present  at the commencement of the oral hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Written statements of direct testimony. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided  in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, each party must exchange with all  other parties a written narrative verified statement of the oral direct  testimony that the party will provide at any hearing to be conducted by  telephone; the direct testimony of each employee or agent of the party  that the party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any hearing  to be conducted by telephone; and the direct testimony of each expert  witness that the party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any  hearing to be conducted by telephone. The written direct testimony of  witnesses shall be exchanged by the parties at least 10 days prior to  the hearing. The oral direct testimony provided by a witness at a  hearing conducted by telephone will be limited to the presentation of  the written direct testimony, unless the presiding officer finds that  oral direct testimony which is supplemental to the written direct  testimony would further the public interest and would not constitute  surprise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The parties shall not be required to exchange testimony in  accordance with this paragraph if the hearing is scheduled to begin less  than 20 days after the presiding officer's notice stating the time of  the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Evidence--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The testimony of witnesses at an oral  hearing shall be on oath or affirmation and subject to cross- examination. Any witness other than a party may be examined separately  and apart from all other witnesses, in the discretion of the presiding  officer. The presiding officer shall exclude evidence which is  immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not of the  sort on   which responsible persons are accustomed to rely, insofar as  practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Objections. If a party objects to the admission of any evidence  or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross- examination or to any other ruling of the presiding officer, such party  shall state briefly the grounds of such objection, and the presiding  officer shall rule on it. The transcript or recording shall include  argument or debates on objections, except as ordered by the presiding  officer, and shall include the ruling of the presiding officer.  Objections not made before the presiding officer may not subsequently be  relied on in the proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Offer of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded by the presiding  officer, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof.  The offer of proof shall consist of a brief statement, which shall be  included in the transcript or recording, describing the evidence  excluded. If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement, it shall  be included in full in the transcript or recording. If the evidence  consists of an exhibit, it shall be marked for identification and  inserted in the record. In either such event, if the judicial officer  decides that the presiding officer's ruling in excluding the evidence  was erroneous and prejudicial, such evidence shall be considered a part  of the record. If the taking of such evidence will consume a  considerable length of time at the hearing, the presiding officer shall  not allow the insertion of such evidence in full and, if the judicial  officer decides that the presiding officer's ruling in excluding the  evidence was erroneous and prejudicial, the hearing shall be reopened to  permit the taking of such evidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Depositions and affidavits. Except as is otherwise provided in  these rules, admission of the deposition of any witness shall be subject  to the provisions of rule 9, Sec. 202.109, and affidavits, and  statements under penalty of perjury as provided in 28 U.S.C. 1746, Pub.  L. 94-550, may be admitted only if the evidence is otherwise admissible  and no party objects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Department records. A true copy of any written entry in any  record of the Department, made by an officer or employee of the  Department in the course of the official duty of such officer or  employee, and relevant to the issues involved in the hearing, shall be  admissible as prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the record of  the Department, without the production of such officer or employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Exhibits. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For each exhibit offered by a party, copies in  addition to the original shall be filed with the presiding officer for  the use of all other parties to the proceeding, except where the  presiding officer finds that the furnishing of copies is impracticable.  The presiding officer shall tell the parties the number of copies  required to be filed, make the proper distribution of the copies, and  have this noted on the record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the testimony of a witness refers to any document, the  presiding officer shall determine whether it shall be produced at the  hearing and made a part of the record as an exhibit, or whether it shall  be incorporated in the record by reference.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If relevant and material matter is embraced in a document  containing irrelevant or immaterial matter, such irrelevant or  immaterial matter shall be designated by the party offering the document  in evidence, and shall be segregated and excluded, insofar as  practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Subpoenas--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Issuance. The attendance and testimony of  witnesses and the production of documentary evidence, from any place in  the United States, on behalf of any party to the proceeding, may be  required by subpoena at any designated place for oral hearing. Subpoenas  may be issued by the presiding officer, on a written application filed  by a party, showing the grounds and necessity thereof, and, with respect  to subpoenas for the production of documentary evidence, showing their  competency, relevancy, and materiality and the necessity for their  production. Subpoenas may be issued on the motion of the presiding  officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Service; proof of service. A subpoena may be served by any  natural person over the age of 18 years. The party at whose instance a  subpoena is issued shall be responsible for serving it, however, at the  request of such party the Secretary will attempt to serve it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Oral argument. The presiding officer shall permit oral argument  by the parties or their counsel who are present at an oral hearing, but  may limit such argument to any extent that the presiding officer finds  necessary for the expeditious or proper disposition of the case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Transcript or recording. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Hearings to be conducted by  telephone shall be recorded verbatim by electronic recording device.  Hearings conducted by audio-visual telecommunication or the personal  attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the  hearing shall be transcribed, unless the presiding officer finds that  recording the hearing verbatim would expedite the proceeding and the  presiding officer orders the hearing to be recorded verbatim. The  presiding officer shall certify that to the best of his or her knowledge  and belief any recording made pursuant to this paragraph with exhibits  that were accepted into evidence is the record of the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a hearing is recorded verbatim, a party requests the  transcript of a hearing or part of a hearing, and the presiding officer  determines that the disposition of the proceeding would be expedited by  a transcript of the hearing or part of a hearing, the presiding officer  shall order the verbatim transcription of the recording as requested by  the party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Parties to the proceeding who desire copies of the transcript or  recording of the oral hearing may make arrangements with the reporter,  who will furnish and deliver such copies direct to such parties, upon  receipt from such parties of payment for the transcript or recording, at  the rate provided by the contract between the reporter and the  Department for such reporting service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> of this  section for the area offices of the Agency and as may be required for  the Washington office of the Agency. At the same time the reporter shall  also transmit a copy of the transcript or recording to each party who  shall have arranged and paid for it, as provided in paragraph (h) of  this section. Upon receipt of the transcript or recording, the presiding  officer shall attach to the original transcript or recording a  certificate stating that, to the best of the presiding officer's  knowledge and belief, the transcript or recording is a true, correct,  and complete transcript or recording of the testimony given at the  hearing and that the exhibits mentioned in it are all the exhibits  received in evidence at the hearing, with such exceptions as the  certificate shall specify. Such certificate shall be served on each  party and a copy thereof shall be attached to each copy of the  transcript or recording received by the presiding officer. In accordance  with such certificate the presiding officer shall note, on the original  transcript or recording, each correction detailed in such certificate by  adding or crossing out (but without obscuring the texts as originally  transcribed or recorded) at the appropriate places any words necessary  to make the text conform to the correct meaning, as certified by the  presiding officer. The presiding officer shall send the copies of the  transcript or recording to the hearing clerk who shall send them to the  Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Keeping of copies of the transcript or recording. During the  period in which the proceeding has an active status in the Department, a  copy of the transcript or recording shall be kept at the area office of  the Agency most convenient to the respondent; however, if there are two  or more respondents and they are located in different regions, such copy  of the transcript or recording shall be kept at the area office of the  Agency nearest to the place where the hearing was held. In addition, a  copy of the transcript or recording shall be kept at the area office of  the Agency most convenient to the complainant. Any such copy shall be  available for examination during official hours of business at the area  office, but   shall remain the property of the Department and shall not be removed  from such office.
