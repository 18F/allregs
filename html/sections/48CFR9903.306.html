                            <p class="depth0">In determining amounts of increased costs in the clauses at  9903.201-4(a), Cost Accounting Standards, 9903.201-4(c), Disclosure and  Consistency of Cost Accounting Practices, and 9903.201-4(d), Consistency  in Cost Accounting, the following considerations apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Increased costs shall be deemed to have resulted whenever the  cost paid by the Government results from a change in a contractor's cost  accounting practices or from failure to comply with applicable Cost  Accounting Standards, and such cost is higher than it would have been  had the practices not been changed or applicable Cost Accounting  Standards complied with.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the contractor under any fixed-price contract, including a  firm fixed-price contract, fails during contract performance to follow  its cost accounting practices or to comply with applicable Cost  Accounting Standards, increased costs are measured by the difference  between the contract price agreed to and the contract price that would  have been agreed to had the contractor proposed in accordance with the  cost accounting practices used during contract performance. The  determination of the contract price that would have been agreed to will  be left to the contracting parties and will depend on the circumstances  of each case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The statutory requirement underlying this interpretation is that  the United States not pay increased costs, including a profit enlarged  beyond that in the contemplation of the parties to the contract when the  contract costs, price, or profit is negotiated, by reason of a  contractor's failure to use applicable Cost Accounting Standards, or to  follow consistently its cost accounting practices. In making price  adjustments under the Cost Accounting Standards clause at 9903.201-4(a)  in fixed price or cost reimbursement incentive contracts, or contracts  providing for prospective or retroactive price redetermination, the  Federal agency shall apply this requirement appropriately in the  circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The contractor and the contracting officer may enter into an  agreement as contemplated by subdivision (a)(4)(ii) of the Cost  Accounting Standards clause at 9903.201-4(a), covering a change in  practice proposed by the Government or the contractor for all of the  contractor's contracts for which the contracting officer is responsible,  provided that the agreement does not permit any increase in the cost  paid by the Government. Such agreement may be made final and binding,  notwithstanding the fact that experience may subsequently establish that  the actual impact of the change differed from that agreed to.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An adjustment to the contract price or of cost allowances  pursuant to the Cost Accounting Standards clause at 9903.201-4(a) may  not be required when a change in cost accounting practices or a failure  to follow Standards or cost accounting practices is estimated to result  in increased costs being paid under a particular contract by the United  States. This circumstance may arise when a contractor is performing two  or more covered contracts, and the change or failure affects all such  contracts. The change or failure may increase the cost paid under one or  more of the contracts, while decreasing the cost paid under one or more  of the contracts. In such case, the Government will not require price  adjustment for any increased costs paid by the United States, so long as  the cost decreases   under one or more contracts are at least equal to the increased cost  under the other affected contracts, provided that the contractor and the  affected contracting officers agree on the method by which the price  adjustments are to be made for all affected contracts. In this  situation, the contracting agencies would, of course, require an  adjustment of the contract price or cost allowances, as appropriate, to  the extent that the increases under certain contracts were not offset by  the decreases under the remaining contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Whether cost impact is recognized by modifying a single  contract, several but not all contracts, or all contracts, or any other  suitable technique, is a contract administration matter. The Cost  Accounting Standards rules do not in any way restrict the capacity of  the parties to select the method by which the cost impact attributable  to a change in cost accounting practice is recognized.</p>
