                                Sec. 1.822-12  Dividends to policyholders.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Dividends to policyholders are used in determining the  ``underwriting loss'' for purposes of the special transitional  underwriting loss deduction provided by section 821(f), and the  limitation on capital losses under section 822(c)(6); in computing  statutory underwriting income or loss under section 823, and the  subtractions from the protection against loss account under section  824(d). The term ``dividends to policyholders'' is defined in section  822(f)(2) as dividends and similar distributions paid or declared to  policyholders. It includes amounts returned to policyholders where the  amount is not fixed in the insurance contract but depends upon the  experience of the company or the discretion of the management. Such  amounts are not to be treated as return premiums under section  822(f)(1). Savings credited to the individual accounts of the  subscribers of a reciprocal underwriter or interinsurer under section  823(b)(2) are not dividends paid or declared within the meaning of this  paragraph. However, distributions in respect of such credits shall be  considered as dividends paid. See section 823(b)(2) and paragraph (c)(2)  of Sec. 1.823-6. The term ``paid or declared'' is to be construed  according to the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the  books of the insurance company, and such method shall be consistently  followed with respect to all deductions (including dividends and similar  distributions to policyholders) and all items of income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the method of accounting so employed is the cash receipts and  disbursements method, the deduction is limited to the dividends and  similar distributions actually paid to policyholders in the taxable  year. If, on the other hand, the method of accounting so employed is the  accrual method, the deduction, or a reasonably accurate estimate  thereof, for dividends and similar distributions declared to  policyholders for any taxable year will, in general, be computed by  adding the amount of dividends and similar distributions declared but  unpaid at the end of the taxable year to dividends and similar  distributions paid during the taxable year and deducting dividends and  similar distributions declared but unpaid at the beginning of the  taxable year. If an insurance company using the accrual method does not  compute the deduction for dividends and similar distributions declared  to policyholders in the manner stated, it must submit with its return a  full and complete explanation of the manner in which the deduction is  computed. For the rule as to when dividends are considered paid, see the  regulations under section 561.  [T.D. 6681, 28 FR 11115, Oct. 17, 1963]</p>
