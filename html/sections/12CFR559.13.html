You must notify OTS at least 30 days before making such a salvage investment. This notice must demonstrate that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The salvage investment protects your interest in the service corporation or lower-tier entity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The salvage investment is consistent with safety and soundness; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You considered alternatives to the salvage investment and determined that such alternatives would not adequately satisfy paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If OTS notifies you within 30 days that the Notice presents supervisory concerns, or raises significant issues of law or policy, you must apply for and receive OTS's prior written approval under the standard treatment processing procedures at part 516, subparts A and E of this chapter before making a salvage investment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If your service corporation or lower-tier entity is a GAAP-consolidated subsidiary, your salvage investment under this section will be considered an investment in a subsidiary for purposes of part 567 of this chapter.
