                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(3)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> through (iii) of this section. As an alternative to  calculating the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput,  the owner or operator of a new or existing source may use the facility's  design maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput to estimate  the maximum potential emissions. Other means to determine the facility's  major source status are allowed, provided the information is documented  and recorded to the Administrator's satisfaction in accordance with  Sec.  63.10(b)(3). A facility that is determined to be an area source,  but subsequently increases its emissions or its potential to emit above  the major source levels, and becomes a major source, must comply  thereafter with all provisions of this subpart applicable   to a major source starting on the applicable compliance date specified  in paragraph (f) of this section. Nothing in this paragraph is intended  to preclude a source from limiting its potential to emit through other  appropriate mechanisms that may be available through the permitting  authority.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(B)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput is the  average of the annual natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput for  the 3 years prior to October 15, 2012, multiplied by a factor of 1.2.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput is the  highest annual natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput over the 5  years prior to October 15, 2012, multiplied by a factor of 1.2.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator shall maintain records of the annual  facility natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput each year and upon  request submit such records to the Administrator. If the facility annual  natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput increases above the maximum  natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput calculated in paragraph  (a)(1)(i)(A) or (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the maximum natural gas or  hydrocarbon liquid throughput must be recalculated using the higher  throughput multiplied by a factor of 1.2.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The owner or operator shall determine the maximum values for  other parameters used to calculate emissions as the maximum for the  period over which the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid  throughput is determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) or  (B) of this section. Parameters, other than glycol circulation rate,  shall be based on either highest measured values or annual average. For  estimating maximum potential emissions from glycol dehydration units,  the glycol circulation rate used in the calculation shall be the unit's  maximum rate under its physical and operational design consistent with  the definition of potential to emit in Sec.  63.2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Facilities that process, upgrade, or store hydrocarbon liquids.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Facilities that process, upgrade, or store natural gas prior to  the point at which natural gas enters the natural gas transmission and  storage source category or is delivered to a final end user. For the  purposes of this subpart, natural gas enters the natural gas  transmission and storage source category after the natural gas  processing plant, when present. If no natural gas processing plant is  present, natural gas enters the natural gas transmission and storage  source category after the point of custody transfer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(iv)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(A)</em> through (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Each large glycol dehydration unit;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Each small glycol dehydration unit for which construction  commenced on or before August 23, 2011, is an existing small glycol  dehydration unit; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Each small glycol dehydration unit for which construction  commenced after August 23, 2011, is a new small glycol dehydration unit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each storage vessel with the potential for flash emissions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The group of all ancillary equipment, except compressors,  intended to operate in volatile hazardous air pollutant service (as  defined in Sec.  63.761),   which are located at natural gas processing plants; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Compressors intended to operate in volatile hazardous air  pollutant service (as defined in Sec.  63.761), which are located at  natural gas processing plants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For area sources, the affected source includes each triethylene  glycol (TEG) dehydration unit located at a facility that meets the  criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any source that determines it is not a major source but has  actual emissions of 5 tons per year or more of a single HAP, or 12.5  tons per year or more of a combination of HAP (i.e., 50 percent of the  major source thresholds), shall update its major source determination  within 1 year of the prior determination or October 15, 2012, whichever  is later, and each year thereafter, using gas composition data measured  during the preceding 12 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The owner and operator of a facility that does not contain an  affected source as specified in paragraph (b) of this section are not  subject to the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(2)</em> of this section are exempt from the requirements of this subpart.

For the purposes of this subpart, a black  oil facility that uses natural gas for fuel or generates gas from black  oil shall qualify for this exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A major source facility, prior to the point of custody transfer,  with a facility-wide actual annual average natural gas throughput less  than 18.4 thousand standard cubic meters per day and a facility-wide  actual annual average hydrocarbon liquid throughput less than 39,700  liters per day.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(3)</em> through (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as specified in paragraphs (f)(7) through (9) of this  section, the owner or operator of an affected major source, the  construction or reconstruction of which commenced before February 6,  1998, shall achieve compliance with the applicable provisions of this  subpart no later than June 17, 2002, except as provided for in Sec.   63.6(i).
