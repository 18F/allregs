                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. This section contains the equipment and operational requirements for scales used to weigh catch at sea, scales used to weigh catch at IFQ first receivers, computer hardware for electronic fish ticket software, and computer hardware for electronic logbook software. Unless otherwise specified by regulation, the operator or manager must retain, for 3 years, a copy of all records described in this section and make available the records upon request of NMFS staff or authorized officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Scales used to weigh catch at sea--performance and technical requirements. (1) Scales approved by NMFS for MS and C/P Coop Programs. A scale used to weigh catch in the MS and C/P Coop Programs must meet the type evaluation and initial inspection requirements set forth in 50 CFR 679.28(b)(1) and (2), and must be approved by NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Annual inspection. Once a scale is installed on a vessel and approved by NMFS for use, it must be inspected annually as described in 50 CFR 679.28(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Daily testing. The vessel operator must ensure that the vessel crew test each required scale daily and ensure that each scale meets the maximum permissible error (MPE) requirements described at paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> At-sea scale tests. To verify that the scale meets the maximum permissible errors (MPEs) specified in this paragraph, the vessel operator must ensure that vessel crew test each scale used to weigh catch at least one time during each 24-hour period when use of the scale is required. The vessel owner must ensure that these tests are performed in an accurate and timely manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Belt scales. The MPE for the daily at-sea scale test is plus or minus 3 percent of the known weight of the test material. The scale must be tested by weighing at least 400 kg (882 lb) of fish or an alternative material supplied by the scale manufacturer on the scale under test. The known weight of the fish or test material must be determined by weighing it on a platform scale approved for use under 50 CFR 679.28(b)(7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Platform scales used for observer sampling on MSs and C/Ps. A platform scale used for observer sampling must be tested at 10, 25, and 50 kg (or 20, 50, and 100 lb if the scale is denominated in pounds) using approved test weights. The MPE for the daily at-sea scale test is plus or minus 0.5 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Approved test weights. Each test weight must have its weight stamped on or otherwise permanently affixed to it. The weight of each test weight must be annually certified by a National Institute of Standards and Technology approved metrology laboratory or approved for continued use by the NMFS authorized inspector at the time of the annual scale inspection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Requirements for all at-sea scale tests. The vessel operator must ensure that vessel crew:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Notify the observer at least 15 minutes before the time that the test will be conducted, and conduct the test while the observer is present.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Conduct the scale test and record the following information on the at-sea scale test report form:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Vessel name;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Month, day, and year of test;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Time test started to the nearest minute;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Known weight of test weights;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Weight of test weights recorded by scale;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Percent error as determined by subtracting the known weight of the test weights from the weight recorded on the scale, dividing that amount by the known weight of the test weights, and multiplying by 100; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Sea conditions at the time of the scale test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Maintain the test report form on board the vessel until the end of the fishing year during which the tests were conducted, and make the report forms available to observers, NMFS staff, or authorized officers. In addition, the vessel owner must retain the scale test report forms for 3 years after the end of the fishing year during which the tests were performed. Each scale test report form must be signed by the vessel operator immediately following completion of each scale test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Scale maintenance. The vessel owner must ensure that the vessel operator maintains the scale in proper operating condition throughout its use, that adjustments made to the scale are made so as to bring the performance errors as close as practicable to a zero value, and that no adjustment is made that will cause the scale to weigh inaccurately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Printed reports from the scale. The vessel owner must ensure that the printed reports are provided to NMFS as required by this paragraph. Printed reports from the scale must be maintained on board the vessel until the end of the year during which the reports were made, and be made available to NMFS staff or authorized officers. In addition, the vessel owner must retain printed reports for 3 years after the end of the year during which the printouts were made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reports of catch weight and cumulative weight. Reports must be printed at least once every 24 hours. Reports must also be printed before any information stored in the scale computer memory is replaced. Scale weights must not be adjusted by the scale operator to account for the perceived weight of water, slime, mud, debris, or other materials. Scale printouts must show:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The vessel name and Federal vessel permit number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The date and time the information was printed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The haul number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The total weight of the haul; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The total cumulative weight of all fish and other material weighed on the scale since the last annual inspection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Printed report from the audit trail. The printed report must include the information specified in sections 2.3.1.8, 3.3.1.7, and 4.3.1.8 of appendix A to 50 CFR part 679. The printed report must be provided to the authorized scale inspector at each scale inspection and must also be printed at any time upon request of NMFS staff or other authorized officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Platform scales used for observer sampling. A platform scale used for observer sampling is not required to produce a printed record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Scales used to weigh catch at IFQ first receivers--performance and technical requirements. Scale requirements in this paragraph are in addition to those requirements set forth by the State in which the scale is located, and nothing in this paragraph may be construed to reduce or supersede the authority of the State to regulate, test, or approve scales within the State. Scales used to weigh catch that are also required to be approved by the State must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Verification of approval. The scale must display a valid sticker indicating that the scale is currently approved in accordance with the laws of the state where the scale is located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Visibility. NMFS staff, NMFS-authorized personnel, or authorized officers must be allowed to observe the weighing of catch on the scale and be allowed to read the scale display at all times.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Printed scale weights. (i) An IFQ first receiver must ensure that printouts of the scale weight of each delivery or offload are made available to NMFS staff, to NMFS-authorized personnel, or to authorized officers at the time printouts are generated. An IFQ first receiver must maintain printouts on site until the end of the fishing year during which the printouts were made and make them available upon request by NMFS staff, NMFS-authorized personnel, or authorized officers for 3 years after the end of the fishing year during which the printout was made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All scales identified in a catch monitoring plan (see Sec. 660.140(f)(3), subpart D) must produce a printed record for each delivery, or portion of a delivery, weighed on that scale, unless specifically exempted by NMFS. NMFS

may exempt, as part of the NMFS-accepted catch monitoring plan, scales not designed for automatic bulk weighing from part or all of the printed record requirements. For scales that must produce a printed record, the printed record must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The IFQ first receiver's name;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The weight of each load in the weighing cycle;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The total weight of fish in each landing, or portion of the landing that was weighed on that scale;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The date the information is printed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The name and vessel registration or documentation number of the vessel making the delivery. The scale operator may write this information on the scale printout in ink at the time of printing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Inseason scale testing. IFQ first receivers must allow, and provide reasonable assistance to NMFS staff, NMFS-authorized personnel, and authorized officers to test scales used to weigh IFQ catch. A scale that does not pass an inseason test may not be used to weigh IFQ catch until the scale passes an inseason test or is approved for continued use by the weights and measures authorities of the State in which the scale is located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Inseason testing criteria. To pass an inseason test, NMFS staff or authorized officers must be able to verify that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The scale display and printed information are clear and easily read under all conditions of normal operation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Weight values are visible on the display until the value is printed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The scale does not exceed the maximum permissible errors specified in the following table:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Maximum error</p><p class="depth0">Test load in scale divisions                   in scale</p><p class="depth0">divisions------------------------------------------------------------------------(1) 0-500...............................................               1(2) 501-2,000...........................................               2(3) 2,001-4,000.........................................               3(4) 4,000....................................               4------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Automatic weighing systems. An automatic weighing system must be provided and operational that will prevent fish from passing over the scale or entering any weighing hopper unless the following criteria are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No catch may enter or leave a weighing hopper until the weighing cycle is complete;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No product may be cycled and weighed if the weight recording element is not operational; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> No product may enter a weighing hopper until the prior weighing cycle has been completed and the scale indicator has returned to a zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Electronic fish tickets. IFQ first receivers using the electronic fish ticket software provided by Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission are required to meet the hardware and software requirements below. Those IFQ first receivers who have NMFS-approved software compatible with the standards specified by Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission for electronic fish tickets are not subject to any specific hardware or software requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Hardware and software requirements. A personal computer system with the following minimum requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Processor: 500-megahertz (MHz) or higher processor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Random Access Memory (RAM): 256 megabytes (MB) or higher;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Hard disk space:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If already have MS Access 2007 or 2010, 200 MB available disk size.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If loading the MS Access 2007 runtime, then 700 MB available disk size.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Monitor: 1024 x 768 or higher display resolution;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Operating system: Microsoft Windows XP with Service Pack (SP) 2, Windows Server 2003 with SP1, or later operating system such as Windows Vista or Windows 7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Software: Microsoft Access 2007 or Microsoft Access 2010, or a runtime version provided by the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> NMFS-approved software standards and internet access. The IFQ first receiver is responsible for obtaining, installing, and updating electronic fish tickets software either provided by Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, or compatible with the data export specifications specified by Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission and for maintaining internet access
