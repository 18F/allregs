                            <p class="depth0">This section describes the emission testing you must perform to show compliance with the emission standards in Sec.  1042.101(a) or Sec.  1042.104. See Sec.  1042.205(p) regarding emission testing related to the NTE standards. See Sec. Sec.  1042.240 and 1042.245 and 40 CFR part 1065, subpart E, regarding service accumulation before emission testing. See Sec.  1042.655 for special testing provisions available for Category 3 engines subject to Tier 3 standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Select an emission-data engine from each engine family for testing. For engines at or above 560 kW, you may use a development engine that is equivalent in design to the engine being certified. For Category 3 engines, you may use a single-cylinder version of the engine. Using good engineering judgment, select the engine configuration most likely to exceed an applicable emission standard over the useful life, considering all exhaust emission constituents and the range of installation options available to vessel manufacturers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Test your emission-data engines using the procedures and equipment specified in subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We may measure emissions from any of your emission-data engines or other engines from the engine family, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We may decide to do the testing at your plant or any other facility. If we do this, you must deliver the engine to a test facility we designate. The engine you provide must include appropriate manifolds, aftertreatment devices, electronic control units, and other emission-related components not normally attached directly to the engine block. If we do the testing at your plant, you must schedule it as soon as possible and make available the instruments, personnel, and equipment we need.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If we measure emissions from one of your engines, the results of that testing become the official emission results for the engine. Unless we later invalidate these data, we may decide not to consider your data in determining if your engine family meets applicable requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Before we test one of your engines, we may set its adjustable parameters to any point within the specified adjustable ranges (see Sec.  1042.115(d)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Before we test one of your engines, we may calibrate it within normal production tolerances for anything we do not consider an adjustable parameter. For example, this would apply for an engine parameter that is subject to production variability because it is adjustable during production, but is not considered an adjustable parameter (as defined in Sec.  1042.901) because it is permanently sealed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may ask to use carryover emission data from a previous model year instead of doing new tests, but only if all the following are true:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The engine family from the previous model year differs from the current engine family only with respect to model year or other characteristics unrelated to emissions. You may also ask to add a configuration subject to Sec.  1042.225.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The emission-data engine from the previous model year remains the appropriate emission-data engine under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The data show that the emission-data engine would meet all the requirements that apply to the engine family covered by the application for certification. For engines originally tested under the provisions of 40 CFR part 94, you may consider those test procedures to be equivalent to the procedures we specify in subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> We may require you to test a second engine of the same or different configuration in addition to the engine tested under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If you use an alternate test procedure under 40 CFR 1065.10 and later testing shows that such testing does

not produce results that are equivalent to the procedures specified in subpart F of this part, we may reject data you generated using the alternate procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Measure CO2 with each low-hour certification test using the procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1065 starting in the 2011 model year. Also measure CH4 from Category 1 and Category 2 engines with each low-hour certification test using the procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1065 starting in the 2012 model year. Measure N2O from Category 1 and Category 2 engines with each low-hour certification test using the procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1065 for any engine family that depends on NOx aftertreatment to meet emission standards. Small-volume engine manufacturers may omit measurement of N2O and CH4. These measurements are not required for NTE testing. Use the same units and modal calculations as for your other results to report a single weighted value for each constituent. Round the final values as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Round CO2 to the nearest 1 g/kW-hr.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Round N2O to the nearest 0.001 g/kW-hr.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Round CH4 to the nearest 0.001 g/kW-hr.
