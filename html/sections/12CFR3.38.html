                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Delivery-versus-payment (DvP) transaction means a securities or commodities transaction in which the buyer is obligated to make payment only if the seller has made delivery of the securities or commodities and the seller is obligated to deliver the securities or commodities only if the buyer has made payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Payment-versus-payment (PvP) transaction means a foreign exchange transaction in which each counterparty is obligated to make a final transfer of one or more currencies only if the other counterparty has made a final transfer of one or more currencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A transaction has a normal settlement period if the contractual settlement period for the transaction is equal to or less than the market standard for the instrument underlying the transaction and equal to or less than five business days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Positive current exposure of a national bank or Federal savings association for a transaction is the difference between the transaction value at the agreed settlement price and the current market price of the transaction, if the difference results in a credit exposure of the national bank or Federal savings association to the counterparty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope. This section applies to all transactions involving securities, foreign exchange instruments, and commodities that have a risk of delayed settlement or delivery. This section does not apply to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cleared transactions that are marked-to-market daily and subject to daily receipt and payment of variation margin;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Repo-style transactions, including unsettled repo-style transactions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> One-way cash payments on OTC derivative contracts; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Transactions with a contractual settlement period that is longer than the normal settlement period (which are treated as OTC derivative contracts as provided in Sec. 3.34).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> System-wide failures. In the case of a system-wide failure of a settlement, clearing system or central counterparty, the OCC may waive risk-based capital requirements for unsettled and failed transactions until the situation is rectified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Delivery-versus-payment (DvP) and payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions. A national bank or Federal savings association must hold risk-based capital against any DvP or PvP transaction with a normal settlement

period if the national bank's or Federal savings association's counterparty has not made delivery or payment within five business days after the settlement date. The national bank or Federal savings association must determine its risk-weighted asset amount for such a transaction by multiplying the positive current exposure of the transaction for the national bank or Federal savings association by the appropriate risk weight in Table 1 to Sec. 3.38.</p><p class="depth2">Table 1 to Sec. 3.38--Risk Weights for Unsettled DvP and PvP</p><p class="depth2">Transactions------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Risk weight to</p><p class="depth2">be applied to</p><p class="depth2">Number of business days after contractual settlement   positive current</p><p class="depth2">date                             exposure (in</p><p class="depth2">percent)------------------------------------------------------------------------From 5 to 15..........................................             100.0From 16 to 30.........................................             625.0From 31 to 45.........................................             937.546 or more............................................           1,250.0------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Non-DvP/non-PvP (non-delivery-versus-payment/non-payment-versus-payment) transactions. (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must hold risk-based capital against any non-DvP/non-PvP transaction with a normal settlement period if the national bank or Federal savings association has delivered cash, securities, commodities, or currencies to its counterparty but has not received its corresponding deliverables by the end of the same business day. The national bank or Federal savings association must continue to hold risk-based capital against the transaction until the national bank or Federal savings association has received its corresponding deliverables.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A national bank or Federal savings association must hold risk-based capital against any non-DvP/non-PvP transaction with a normal settlement period if the national bank or Federal savings association has delivered cash, securities, commodities, or currencies to its counterparty but has not received its corresponding deliverables by the end of the same business day. The national bank or Federal savings association must continue to hold risk-based capital against the transaction until the national bank or Federal savings association has received its corresponding deliverables.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From the business day after the national bank or Federal savings association has made its delivery until five business days after the counterparty delivery is due, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the transaction by treating the current fair value of the deliverables owed to the national bank or Federal savings association as an exposure to the counterparty and using the applicable counterparty risk weight under Sec. 3.32.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the national bank or Federal savings association has not received its deliverables by the fifth business day after counterparty delivery was due, the national bank or Federal savings association must assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to the current fair value of the deliverables owed to the national bank or Federal savings association.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Total risk-weighted assets for unsettled transactions. Total risk-weighted assets for unsettled transactions is the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts of all DvP, PvP, and non-DvP/non-PvP transactions.
