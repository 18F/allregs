                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">An employee may engage in fundraising only in accordance with the  restrictions in part 950 of this title on the conduct of charitable  fundraising in the Federal workplace and in accordance with paragraphs  (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section: (1) Fundraising means  the raising of funds for a nonprofit organization, other than a  political organization as defined in 26 U.S.C. 527(e), through:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Solicitation of funds or sale of items; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Participation in the conduct of an event by an employee where  any portion of the cost of attendance or participation may be taken as a  charitable tax deduction by a person incurring that cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Participation in the conduct of an event means active and  visible participation in the promotion, production, or presentation of  the event and includes serving as honorary chairperson, sitting at a  head table during the event, and standing in a reception line. The term  does not include mere attendance at an event provided that, to the  employee's knowledge, his attendance is not used by the nonprofit  organization to promote the event. While the term generally includes any  public speaking during the event, it does not include the delivery of an  official speech as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section or any  seating or other participation appropriate to the delivery of such a  speech. Waiver of a fee for attendance at an event by a participant in  the conduct of that event does not constitute a gift for purposes of  subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Note: This section does not prohibit fundraising for a political  party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political  group. However, there are statutory restrictions that apply to political  fundraising. For example, under the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993,  at 5 U.S.C. 7323(a), employees may not knowingly solicit, accept, or  receive a political contribution from any person, except under limited  circumstances. In addition, employees are prohibited by 18 U.S.C. 607  from soliciting or receiving political contributions in Federal offices,  and, except as permitted by the Hatch Act Reform Amendments, are  prohibited by 18 U.S.C. 602 from knowingly soliciting political  contributions from other employees.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1: The Secretary of Transportation has been asked to serve  as master of ceremonies for an All-Star Gala. Tickets to the event cost  $150 and are tax deductible as a charitable donation, with proceeds to  be donated to a local hospital. By serving as master of ceremonies, the  Secretary would be participating in fundraising.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Official speech means a speech given by an employee in his  official capacity on a subject matter that relates to his official  duties, provided that the employee's agency has determined that the  event at which the speech is to be given provides an appropriate forum  for the dissemination of the information to be presented and provided  that the employee does not request donations or other support for the  nonprofit organization. Subject matter relates to an employee's official  duties if it focuses specifically on the employee's official duties, on  the responsibilities,   programs, or operations of the employee's agency as described in  Sec. 2635.807(a)(2)(i)(E), or on matters of Administration policy on  which the employee has been authorized to speak.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1: The Secretary of Labor is invited to speak at a banquet  honoring a distinguished labor leader, the proceeds of which will  benefit a nonprofit organization that assists homeless families. She  devotes a major portion of her speech to the Administration's Points of  Light initiative, an effort to encourage citizens to volunteer their  time to help solve serious social problems. Because she is authorized to  speak on Administration policy, her remarks at the banquet are an  official speech. However, the Secretary would be engaged in fundraising  if she were to conclude her official speech with a request for donations  to the nonprofit organization.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2: A charitable organization is sponsoring a two-day tennis  tournament at a country club in the Washington, DC area to raise funds  for recreational programs for learning disabled children. The  organization has invited the Secretary of Education to give a speech on  federally funded special education programs at the awards dinner to be  held at the conclusion of the tournament and a determination has been  made that the dinner is an appropriate forum for the particular speech.  The Secretary may speak at the dinner and, under Sec. 2635.204(g)(1), he  may partake of the meal provided to him at the dinner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Personally solicit means to request or otherwise encourage  donations or other support either through person-to-person contact or  through the use of one's name or identity in correspondence or by  permitting its use by others. It does not include the solicitation of  funds through the media or through either oral remarks, or the  contemporaneous dispatch of like items of mass-produced correspondence,  if such remarks or correspondence are addressed to a group consisting of  many persons, unless it is known to the employee that the solicitation  is targeted at subordinates or at persons who are prohibited sources  within the meaning of Sec. 2635.203(d). It does not include behind-the- scenes assistance in the solicitation of funds, such as drafting  correspondence, stuffing envelopes, or accounting for contributions.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1: An employee of the Department of Energy who signs a  letter soliciting funds for a local private school does not ``personally  solicit'' funds when 500 copies of the letter, which makes no mention of  his DOE position and title, are mailed to members of the local  community, even though some individuals who are employed by Department  of Energy contractors may receive the letter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Fundraising in an official capacity. An employee may participate  in fundraising in an official capacity if, in accordance with a statute,  Executive order, regulation or otherwise as determined by the agency, he  is authorized to engage in the fundraising activity as part of his  official duties. When authorized to participate in an official capacity,  an employee may use his official title, position and authority.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1: Because participation in his official capacity is  authorized under part 950 of this title, the Secretary of the Army may  sign a memorandum to all Army personnel encouraging them to donate to  the Combined Federal Campaign.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Fundraising in a personal capacity. An employee may engage in  fundraising in his personal capacity provided that he does not:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Personally solicit funds or other support from a subordinate or  from any person:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Known to the employee, if the employee is other than a special  Government employee, to be a prohibited source within the meaning of  Sec. 2635.203(d); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Known to the employee, if the employee is a special Government  employee, to be a prohibited source within the meaning of  Sec. 2635.203(d)(4) that is a person whose interests may be  substantially affected by performance or nonperformance of his official  duties;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Use or permit the use of his official title, position or any  authority associated with his public office to further the fundraising  effort, except that an employee who is ordinarily addressed using a  general term of address, such ``The Honorable,'' or a rank, such as a  military or ambassadorial rank, may use or permit the use of that term  of address or rank for such purposes; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Engage in any action that would otherwise violate this part.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1: A nonprofit organization is sponsoring a golf tournament  to raise funds for underprivileged children. The Secretary of the Navy  may not enter the tournament   with the understanding that the organization intends to attract  participants by offering other entrants the opportunity, in exchange for  a donation in the form of an entry fee, to spend the day playing 18  holes of golf in a foursome with the Secretary of the Navy.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2: An employee of the Merit Systems Protection Board may not  use the agency's photocopier to reproduce fundraising literature for her  son's private school. Such use of the photocopier would violate the  standards at Sec. 2635.704 regarding use of Government property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3: An Assistant Attorney General may not sign a letter  soliciting funds for a homeless shelter as ``John Doe, Assistant  Attorney General.'' He also may not sign a letter with just his  signature, ``John Doe,'' soliciting funds from a prohibited source,  unless the letter is one of many identical, mass-produced letters  addressed to a large group where the solicitation is not known to him to  be targeted at persons who are either prohibited sources or  subordinates.
