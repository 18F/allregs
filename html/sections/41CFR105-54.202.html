The Officer  sends the letter of justification, including the draft charter, to the  Committee Management Secretariat.

The Officer publishes the notice in the Federal  Register at least 15 calendar days before the filing of the charter  under Sec. 105-54.203 with the standing committees of the Senate and  the House of Representatives having legislative jurisdiction over GSA.  The date of filing constitutes the date of establishment.</p>
