                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Limitation on losses and deductions. The  aggregate amount of losses and deductions taken into account by a  shareholder under Sec. 1.1366-1(a) (2), (3), and (4) for any taxable  year of an S corporation cannot exceed the sum of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this section); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of  this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Basis of indebtedness--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. The term basis of any  indebtedness of the S corporation to the shareholder means the  shareholder's adjusted basis (as defined in Sec. 1.1011-1 and as  specifically provided in section 1367(b)(2)) in any bona fide  indebtedness of the S corporation that runs directly to the shareholder.  Whether indebtedness is   bona fide indebtedness to a shareholder is determined under general  Federal tax principles and depends upon all of the facts and  circumstances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for guarantees. A shareholder does not obtain  basis of indebtedness in the S corporation merely by guaranteeing a loan  or acting as a surety, accommodation party, or in any similar capacity  relating to a loan. When a shareholder makes a payment on bona fide  indebtedness of the S corporation for which the shareholder has acted as  guarantor or in a similar capacity, then the shareholder may increase  the shareholder's basis of indebtedness to the extent of that payment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  paragraph (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth4">Example 1. Shareholder loan transaction. A is the sole shareholder  of S, an S corporation. S received a loan from A. Whether the loan from  A to S constitutes bona fide indebtedness from S to A is determined  under general Federal tax principles and depends upon all of the facts  and circumstances. See paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. If the loan  constitutes bona fide indebtedness from S to A, A's loan to S increases  A's basis of indebtedness under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. The  result is the same if A made the loan to S through an entity that is  disregarded as an entity separate from A under Sec. 301.7701-3 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. Back-to-back loan transaction. A is the sole shareholder  of two S corporations, S1 and S2. S1 loaned $200,000 to A. A then loaned  $200,000 to S2. Whether the loan from A to S2 constitutes bona fide  indebtedness from S2 to A is determined under general Federal tax  principles and depends upon all of the facts and circumstances. See  paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. If A's loan to S2 constitutes bona  fide indebtedness from S2 to A, A's back-to-back loan increases A's  basis of indebtedness in S2 under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth4">Example 3. Loan restructuring through distributions. A is the sole  shareholder of two S corporations, S1 and S2. In May 2014, S1 made a  loan to S2. In December 2014, S1 assigned its creditor position in the  note to A by making a distribution to A of the note. Under local law,  after S1 distributed the note to A, S2 was relieved of its liability to  S1 and was directly liable to A. Whether S2 is indebted to A rather than  S1 is determined under general Federal tax principles and depends upon  all of the facts and circumstances. See paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this  section. If the note constitutes bona fide indebtedness from S2 to A,  the note increases A's basis of indebtedness in S2 under paragraph  (a)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth4">Example 4. Guarantee. A is a shareholder of S, an S corporation. In  2014, S received a loan from Bank. Bank required A's guarantee as a  condition of making the loan to S. Beginning in 2015, S could no longer  make payments on the loan and A made payments directly to Bank from A's  personal funds until the loan obligation was satisfied. For each payment  A made on the note, A obtains basis of indebtedness under paragraph  (a)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, A's basis of indebtedness is increased  during 2015 under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section to the extent of  A's payments to Bank pursuant to the guarantee agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Carryover of disallowance. A shareholder's aggregate amount of  losses and deductions for a taxable year in excess of the sum of the  adjusted basis of the shareholder's stock in an S corporation and of any  indebtedness of the S corporation to the shareholder is not allowed for  the taxable year. However, any disallowed loss or deduction retains its  character and is treated as incurred by the corporation in the  corporation's first succeeding taxable year, and subsequent taxable  years, with respect to the shareholder. For rules on determining the  adjusted bases of stock of an S corporation and indebtedness of the  corporation to the shareholder, see paragraphs (a)(4) (i) and (ii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Basis limitation amount--(i) Stock portion. A shareholder  generally determines the adjusted basis of stock for purposes of  paragraphs (a)(1)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> and (3) of this section (limiting losses and  deductions) by taking into account only increases in basis under section  1367(a)(1) for the taxable year and decreases in basis under section  1367(a)(2) (A), (D) and (E) (relating to distributions, noncapital,  nondeductible expenses, and certain oil and gas depletion deductions)  for the taxable year. In so determining this loss limitation amount, the  shareholder disregards decreases in basis under section 1367(a)(2) (B)  and (C) (for losses and deductions, including losses and deductions  previously disallowed) for the taxable year. However, if the shareholder  has in effect for the taxable year an election under Sec. 1.1367-1(g)  to decrease basis by items of loss and deduction prior to   decreasing basis by noncapital, nondeductible expenses and certain oil  and gas depletion deductions, the shareholder also disregards decreases  in basis under section 1367(a)(2) (D) and (E). This basis limitation  amount for stock is determined at the time prescribed under Sec.  1.1367-1(d)(1) for adjustments to the basis of stock.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> and (3) of this section (limiting  losses and deductions) without regard to any adjustment under section  1367(b)(2)(A) for the taxable year. This basis limitation amount for  indebtedness is determined at the time prescribed under Sec. 1.1367- 2(d)(1) for adjustments to the basis of indebtedness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Limitation on losses and deductions allocated to each item. If a  shareholder's pro rata share of the aggregate amount of losses and  deductions specified in Sec. 1.1366-1(a)(2), (3), and (4) exceeds the  sum of the adjusted basis of the shareholder's stock in the corporation  (determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section) and  the adjusted basis of any indebtedness of the corporation to the  shareholder (determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this  section), then the limitation on losses and deductions under section  1366(d)(1) must be allocated among the shareholder's pro rata share of  each loss or deduction. The amount of the limitation allocated to any  loss or deduction is an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount  of the limitation as the loss or deduction bears to the total of the  losses and deductions. For this purpose, the total of losses and  deductions for the taxable year is the sum of the shareholder's pro rata  share of losses and deductions for the taxable year, and the losses and  deductions disallowed and carried forward from prior years pursuant to  section 1366(d)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Nontransferability of losses and deductions--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general.  Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section, any loss or  deduction disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is personal  to the shareholder and cannot in any manner be transferred to another  person. If a shareholder transfers some but not all of the shareholder's  stock in the corporation, the amount of any disallowed loss or deduction  under this section is not reduced and the transferee does not acquire  any portion of the disallowed loss or deduction. If a shareholder  transfers all of the shareholder's stock in the corporation, any  disallowed loss or deduction is permanently disallowed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions for transfers of stock under section 1041(a). If a  shareholder transfers stock of an S corporation after December 31, 2004,  in a transfer described in section 1041(a), any loss or deduction with  respect to the transferred stock that is disallowed to the transferring  shareholder under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be treated as  incurred by the corporation in the following taxable year with respect  to the transferee spouse or former spouse. The amount of any loss or  deduction with respect to the stock transferred shall be determined by  prorating any losses or deductions disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of  this section for the year of the transfer between the transferor and the  spouse or former spouse based on the stock ownership at the beginning of  the following taxable year. If a transferor claims a deduction for  losses in the taxable year of transfer, then under paragraph (a)(5) of  this section, if the transferor's pro rata share of the losses and  deductions in the year of transfer exceeds the transferor's basis in  stock and the indebtedness of the corporation to the transferor, then  the limitation must be allocated among the transferor spouse's pro rata  share of each loss or deduction, including disallowed losses and  deductions carried over from the prior year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrates the provisions of  paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth4">Example 1. A owns all 100 shares in X, a calendar year S  corporation. For X's taxable year ending December 31, 2006, A has zero  basis in the shares and X does not have any indebtedness to A. For the  2006 taxable year, X had $100 in losses that A cannot use because of the  basis limitation in section 1366(d)(1) and that are treated as incurred  by the corporation with respect to A in the following taxable year.  Halfway through the 2007 taxable year, A transfers 50 shares to B,   A's former spouse in a transfer to which section 1041(a) applies. In the  2007 taxable year, X has $80 in losses. On A's 2007 individual income  tax return, A may use the entire $100 carryover loss from 2006, as well  as A's share of the $80 2007 loss determined under section 1377(a)  ($60), assuming A acquires sufficient basis in the X stock. On B's 2007  individual income tax return, B may use B's share of the $80 2007 loss  determined under section 1377(a) ($20), assuming B has sufficient basis  in the X stock. If any disallowed 2006 loss is disallowed to A under  section 1366(d)(1) in 2007, that loss is prorated between A and B based  on their stock ownership at the beginning of 2008. On B's 2008  individual income tax return, B may use that loss, assuming B acquires  sufficient basis in the X stock. If neither A nor B acquires any basis  during the 2007 taxable year, then as of the beginning of 2008, the  corporation will be treated as incurring $50 of loss with respect to A  and $50 of loss with respect to B for the $100 of disallowed 2006 loss,  and the corporation will be treated as incurring $60 of loss with  respect to A and $20 with respect to B for the $80 of disallowed 2007  loss.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. Assume the same facts as Example 1, except that during  the 2007 taxable year, A acquires $10 of basis in A's shares in X. For  the 2007 taxable year, A may claim a $10 loss deduction, which  represents $6.25 of the disallowed 2006 loss of $100 and $3.75 of A's  2007 loss of $60. The disallowed 2006 loss is reduced to $93.75. As of  the beginning of 2008, the corporation will be treated as incurring half  of the remaining $93.75 of loss with respect to A and half of that loss  with respect to B for the remaining $93.75 of disallowed 2006 loss, and  if B does not acquire any basis during 2007, the corporation will be  treated as incurring $56.25 of loss with respect to A and $20 with  respect to B for the remaining disallowed 2007 loss.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Basis of stock acquired by gift. For purposes of section  1366(d)(1)(A) and paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (3) of this section, the  basis of stock in a corporation acquired by gift is the basis of the  stock that is used for purposes of determining loss under section  1015(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  In general. If, for the last taxable year of a corporation for which it  was an S corporation, a loss or deduction was disallowed to a  shareholder by reason of the limitation in paragraph (a) of this  section, the loss or deduction is treated under section 1366(d)(3) as  incurred by that shareholder on the last day of any post-termination  transition period (within the meaning of section 1377(b)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, the basis  of stock in a corporation acquired by gift is the basis of the stock  that is used for purposes of determining loss under section 1015(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(B)</em> must be allocated among each loss or deduction. The amount  of the limitation allocated to each loss or deduction is an amount that  bears the same ratio to the amount of the limitation as the amount of  each loss or deduction bears to the total of all the losses and  deductions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Adjustment to the basis of stock. The shareholder's basis in the  stock of the corporation is reduced by the amount allowed as a deduction  by reason of this paragraph (b). For rules regarding adjustments to the  basis of a shareholder's stock in an S corporation, see Sec. 1.1367-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Carryover of disallowed losses and deductions in the case of  liquidations, reorganizations, and divisions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Liquidations and  reorganizations. If a corporation acquires the assets of an S  corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, any loss  or deduction disallowed under paragraph (a) of this section with respect  to a shareholder of the distributor or transferor S corporation is  available to that shareholder as a shareholder of the acquiring  corporation. Thus, where the acquiring corporation is an S corporation,  a loss or deduction of a shareholder of the distributor or transferor S  corporation disallowed prior to or during the taxable year of the  transaction is treated as incurred by the acquiring S corporation with  respect to that shareholder if the shareholder is a shareholder of the  acquiring S corporation after the transaction. Where the acquiring  corporation is a C corporation, a post-termination transition period  arises the day after the last day that an S corporation was in existence  and the rules provided in paragraph (b) of this section apply with  respect to any shareholder of the acquired S corporation that is also a  shareholder of the acquiring C corporation after the transaction. See  the special rules under section 1377 for the availability of the post- termination transition period if the acquiring corporation is a C  corporation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Corporate separations to which section 368(a)(1)(D) applies. If  an S corporation transfers a portion of its assets constituting an  active trade or business to another corporation in a transaction to  which section 368(a)(1)(D) applies, and immediately thereafter the stock  and securities of the controlled corporation are distributed in a  distribution or exchange to which section 355 (or so much of section 356  as relates to section 355) applies, any loss or deduction disallowed  under paragraph (a) of this section with respect to a shareholder of the  distributing S corporation immediately before the transaction is  allocated between the distributing corporation and the controlled  corporation with respect to the shareholder. Such allocation shall be  made according to any reasonable method, including a method based on the  relative fair market value of the shareholder's stock in the  distributing and controlled corporations immediately after the  distribution, a method based on the relative adjusted basis of the  assets in the distributing and controlled corporations immediately after  the distribution, or, in the case of losses and deductions clearly  attributable to either the distributing or controlled corporation, any  method that allocates such losses and deductions accordingly.
