Its members are appointed by the President by and with the  advice and consent of the Senate to   serve terms as provided by law. However, under the law, this is an  independent Agency, and in performing their duties, members should  exhibit a spirit of firm independence and reject any effort by  representatives of the executive or legislative branches of the  government to affect their independent determination of any matter being  considered by this Commission. A member should not be swayed by partisan  demands, public clamor or considerations of personal popularity or  notoriety; so also he should be above fear of unjust criticism by  anyone.</p>
