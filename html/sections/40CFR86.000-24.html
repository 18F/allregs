Within each engine family, one  test vehicle is selected. If air conditioning is projected to be  available on any vehicles within the engine family, the Administrator  will limit selections to engine codes which have air conditioning  available and will require that any vehicle selected under this section  has air conditioning installed and operational. The Administrator  selects as the test vehicle the vehicle with the heaviest equivalent  test weight (including options) within the family which meets the air  conditioning eligibility requirement discussed earlier in this section.  If more than one vehicle meets this criterion, then within that vehicle  grouping, the Administrator selects, in the order listed, the highest  road-load power, largest displacement, the transmission with the highest  numerical final gear ratio (including overdrive), the highest numerical  axle ratio offered in that engine family, and the maximum fuel flow  calibration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Administrator selects one additional test vehicle from  within each engine family. The additional vehicle selected is the  vehicle expected to exhibit the highest emissions of those vehicles  remaining in the engine family. The selected vehicle will include an air  conditioning engine code unless the Administrator chooses a worst  vehicle configuration that is not available with air conditioning. If  all vehicles within the engine family are similar, the Administrator may  waive the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)-(b)(1)(vi)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)-(f)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)-(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Except for air conditioning, where it is expected that 33  percent or less of a carline, within an engine-system combination, will  be equipped with an item (whether that item is standard equipment or an  option) that can reasonably be expected to influence emissions, that  item may not be installed on any emission data vehicle or durability  data vehicle of that carline within that engine-system combination,  unless that item is standard equipment on that vehicle or specifically  required by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Air conditioning must be installed and operational on any  emission data vehicle of any vehicle configuration that is projected to  be available with air conditioning regardless of the rate of  installation of air conditioning within the carline. Section 86.096- 24(g) (1) and (2) and paragraph (g)(3) of this section will be used to  determine whether the weight of the air conditioner will be included in  equivalent test weight calculations for emission testing.
