For purposes of this paragraph (a), a highway motor vehicle that is allowed to operate in a State under a reciprocity agreement is not considered to be registered under the laws of that State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contiguous foreign country. The term ``contiguous foreign country'' means Canada or Mexico.
