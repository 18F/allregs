                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Election to have the credit not apply--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A  taxpayer may elect to have section 43 not apply for any taxable year.  The taxpayer may revoke an election to have section 43 not apply for any  taxable year. An election to have section 43 not apply (or a revocation  of an election to have section 43 not apply) for any taxable year is  effective only for the taxable year to which the election relates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>  and may not be extended under Sec.  1.9100-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Manner of making the election. An election (or revocation) under  paragraph (a)(1) of this section is made by attaching a statement to the  taxpayer's federal income tax return or an amended return (or, in the  case of a Coordinated Examination Program taxpayer, on a written  statement treated as a qualified amended return) for the taxable year  for which the election (or revocation) applies. The taxpayer must  indicate whether the taxpayer is electing to not have section 43 apply  or is revoking such an election and designate the project or projects to  which the election (or revocation) applies. For any taxable year, the  last election (or revocation) made by a taxpayer within the period  prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section determines whether  section 43 applies for that taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Election by partnerships and S corporations. For partnerships  and S corporations, an election to have section 43 not apply (or a  revocation of an election to have section 43 not apply) for any taxable  year is made, in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of  this section, by the partnership or S corporation with respect   to the qualified enhanced oil recovery costs paid or incurred by the  partnership or S corporation for the taxable year to which the election  relates.
