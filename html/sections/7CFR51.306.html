For Red Delicious or Golden Delicious varieties only, a combination of minimum diameter and/or weight may be used. When this designation is used, an individual apple will be considered to have met the minimum size requirement even if the apple is smaller than the minimum diameter, provided it is equal to or greater than the weight provided in table II of this section. However, not more than 5 percent of the apples in any lot may fail to meet either the minimum diameter or minimum weight when so designated. In addition, when Red Delicious or Golden Delicious apples are designated with diameter/weight combinations, they may only be designated according to the following table:---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ ``Fairly uniform'' means the size of the fruit within the container does not vary more than \1/2\ inch diameter from the smallest to largest fruit.</p><p class="depth0">Table II------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Red delicious                      Golden delicious------------------------------------------------------------------------2\1/8\ inches or 65 grams.................  63 grams2\1/4\ inches or 75 grams.................  70 grams2\3/8\ inches or 84 grams.................  82 grams2\1/2\ inches or 100 grams................  95 grams2\5/8\ inches or 115 grams................  109 grams2\3/4\ inches or 139 grams................  134 grams------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Application of Tolerances</p>
