                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A test order addressed to the manufacturer is required for any testing under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The test order is signed by the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation or his or her designee. The test order must be delivered in person by an EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative to a company representative or sent by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the manufacturer's representative who signed the application for certification submitted by the manufacturer, pursuant to the requirements of the applicable section of subpart B of this part. Upon receipt of a test order, the manufacturer must comply with all of the provisions of this subpart and instructions in the test order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Information included in test order. (1) The test order will specify the engine family to be selected for testing, the manufacturer's engine assembly plant or associated storage facility or port facility (for imported engines) from which the engines must be selected, the time and location at which engines must be selected, and the procedure by which engines of the specified family must be selected. The test order may specify the configuration to be audited and/or the number of engines to be selected per day. Engine manufacturers are required to select a minimum of four engines per day unless an alternate selection procedure is approved pursuant to Sec. 91.606(a), or unless total production of the specified configuration is less than four engines per day. If total production of the specified configuration is less than four engines per day, the manufacturer selects the actual number of engines produced per day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The test order will specify the engine family to be selected for testing, the manufacturer's engine assembly plant or associated storage facility or port facility (for imported engines) from which the engines must be selected, the time and location at which engines must be selected, and the procedure by which engines of the specified family must be selected. The test order may specify the configuration to be audited and/or the number of engines to be selected per day. Engine manufacturers are required to select a minimum of four engines per day unless an alternate selection procedure is approved pursuant to Sec. 91.606(a), or unless total production of the specified configuration is less than four engines per day. If total production of the specified configuration is less than four engines per day, the manufacturer selects the actual number of engines produced per day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The test order may include alternate families to be selected for testing at the Administrator's discretion in the event that engines of the specified family are not available for testing because those engines are not being manufactured during the specified time or are not being stored at the specified assembly plant, associated storage facilities, or port of entry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the specified family is not being manufactured at a rate of at least two engines per day in the case of manufacturers specified in 40 CFR 89.607(g)(1), or one engine per day in the case of manufacturers specified in 40 CFR 89.607(g)(2), over the expected duration of the audit, the Assistant Administrator or her or his designated representative may select engines of the alternate family for testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In addition, the test order may include other directions or information essential to the administration of the required testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A manufacturer may submit a list of engine families and the corresponding assembly plants, associated storage facilities, or (in the case of imported engines) port facilities from which the manufacturer prefers to have engines selected for testing in response to a test order. In order that a manufacturer's preferred location be considered for inclusion in a test order for a particular engine family, the list must be submitted prior to issuance of the test order. Notwithstanding the fact that a manufacturer has submitted the list, the Administrator may order selection at other than a preferred location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Upon receipt of a test order, a manufacturer must proceed in accordance with the provisions of this subpart.</p>
