Under the contract clause at 52.211-11, these damages are in addition to any excess repurchase costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the Government has suffered any other ascertainable damages, including administrative costs, as a result of the contractor's default, the contracting officer must, on the basis of legal advice, take appropriate action as prescribed in subpart 32.6 to assert the Government's demand for the damages.
