                            <p class="depth0">Each approved exploration plan shall be supplemented by a written  plan of operation for each fiscal year, or portions thereof, covered by  the exploration plan. Each plan of operation shall specify the field  operations for implementing that exploration plan during the year, or  portions thereof, covered by the plan of operation. Each plan of  operation shall be submitted to the Regional Director at least 30 days  before field operations are to be commenced thereunder, except that any  plan of operation supplementing a portion of an exploration plan that  received expedited review and approval pursuant to Sec.  37.21(c) shall  be submitted 10 days before field operations are to be commenced  thereunder. A plan of operation shall set forth such specific  information as is required by the Regional Director in determining  whether the plan is consistent with the exploration plan to which it  pertains and with this part. The permittee shall make such modifications  in its plan of operation as are deemed at any time by the Regional  Director to be necessary and appropriate to ensure such consistency.  Reconsideration of the Regional Director's actions under this section  may be obtained by employing the procedures described in Sec.  37.22(c).</p>
