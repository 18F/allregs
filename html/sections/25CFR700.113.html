                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Appraisal and invitation to owner. Before the initiation of negotiations, the Commission shall have the habitations and/or improvements appraised to its satisfaction and will attempt to assure that the owner or his designated representative is contacted in advance of the appraisal(s) and given an opportunity to accompany each appraiser during the appraiser's inspection of the property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination and offer of fair market value. Before the initiation of negotiations, the Commission shall establish an amount which it believes is fair market value for improvements. This amount shall be based on a current appraisal at the time negotations commence for the Relocation Contract between the NHIRC and the relocatee. The appraisal will be adjusted according to the Boeckh Building Cost Modifier for time or any physical changes in the improvements. If any changes are necessary the appraisal will be corrected to reflect a current dollar value. The amount of the current appraisal will be offered as just compensation for the improvements acquired, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. A copy of the initial appraisal will be sent to the owner as soon as possible after the appraisal program is completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Basic negotiation procedures. The Commission will attempt to meet with the owner or his/her representative to discuss its offer to purchase his/her property including the basis for the determination of fair market value and explain acquisition policies and procedures, including payment of incidental expenses. The owner shall be given reasonable opportunity to present material which he/she believes is relevant to determining the value of the property

and to suggest modification in the proposed terms and conditions of the purchase. The Commission shall consider the owner's presentation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the condition of the property indicates the need for a new appraisal or if a significant delay has occurred since the time of the latest appraisal of the property, the Commission shall have the appraisal updated or obtain a new appraisal. If a new appraisal is for a lesser value than the previous appraisal and said lesser value is due to damage done to the property during the time between the two appraisals, and such damage was not caused by the owner of the improvement, the owner shall be entitled to the higher appraisal value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Objection to determination of fair market value. If the owner objects to the Commission's determination of fair market value, the owner may request a hearing pursuant to the Commission's Hearing and Administrative Review procedures;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Payment before taking possession. Before requiring an owner to surrender possession of his habitations and/or improvements, the Commission shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Apply the agreed purchase price towards the acquisition price of the replacement dwelling or;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Deposit with the court in an appropriate proceeding, such as divorce or probate, for the benefit of the owner, an amount not less than the Commission's determination of fair market value for the property or the court award of compensation for the property up to the maximum benefit allowed under the then existing replacement housing benefit.</p>
