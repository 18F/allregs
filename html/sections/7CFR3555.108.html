                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The Loan Note Guarantee constitutes an obligation supported by the full faith and credit of the United States and is incontestable except for fraud or misrepresentation of which the lender has actual knowledge at the time it becomes such lender or which the lender participates in or condones. Misrepresentation includes negligent misrepresentation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interest. A note that provides for the payment of interest on interest, however, shall not be guaranteed. If

the note to which the Loan Note Guarantee is attached or relates provides for the payment of interest on interest, then the Loan Note Guarantee is void. Notwithstanding the prohibition of interest on interest, interest may be capitalized in connection with re-amortization under subpart G of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Violations. The Loan Note Guarantee will be unenforceable by the lender to the extent any loss is occasioned by violation of usury laws, civil rights laws, negligent servicing, failure to obtain the required security or use of loan funds for unauthorized purposes, regardless of the time at which Rural Development acquires knowledge of the foregoing. Negligent servicing is defined as servicing that is inconsistent with this subpart and includes the failure to perform those services which a reasonably prudent Lender would perform in servicing its own loan portfolio of loans that are not guaranteed. The term includes not only the concept of a failure to act, but also not acting in a timely manner or acting contrary to the manner in which a reasonably prudent Lender would act up to the time of loan maturity or until a final loss is paid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Indemnification. If the Agency determines that a lender did not originate a loan in accordance with the requirements in this part and the Agency pays a claim under the loan guarantee, the Agency may revoke the lender's eligibility status in accordance with subpart B of this part and may also require the lender:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To indemnify the Agency for the loss, if the payment under the guarantee was made within 24 months of loan closing; or:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To indemnify the Agency for the loss regardless of how long ago the loan closed, if the Agency determines that fraud or misrepresentation was involved in connection with the origination of the loan.
