                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope and definitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Scope. This section sets forth  requirements with respect to internal claims and appeals and external  review processes for group health plans and health insurance issuers  that are not grandfathered health plans under Sec. 2590.715-1251 of this  part. Paragraph (b) of this section provides requirements for internal  claims and appeals processes. Paragraph (c) of this section sets forth  rules governing the applicability of State external review processes.  Paragraph (d) of this section sets forth a Federal external review  process for plans and issuers not subject to an applicable State  external review process. Paragraph (e) of this section prescribes  requirements for ensuring that notices required to be provided under  this section are provided in a culturally and linguistically appropriate  manner. Paragraph (f) of this section describes the authority of the  Secretary to deem certain external review processes in existence on  March 23, 2010 as in compliance with paragraph (c) or (d) of this  section. Paragraph (g) of this section sets forth the applicability date  for this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following  definitions apply--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Adverse benefit determination. An adverse benefit determination  means an adverse benefit determination as defined in 29 CFR 2560.503-1,  as well as any rescission of coverage, as described in Sec. 2590.715- 2712(a)(2) of this part (whether or not, in connection with the  rescission, there is an adverse effect on any particular benefit at that  time).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Appeal (or internal appeal). An appeal or internal appeal means  review by   a plan or issuer of an adverse benefit determination, as required in  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Claimant. Claimant means an individual who makes a claim under  this section. For purposes of this section, references to claimant  include a claimant's authorized representative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> External review. External review means a review of an adverse  benefit determination (including a final internal adverse benefit  determination) conducted pursuant to an applicable State external review  process described in paragraph (c) of this section or the Federal  external review process of paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Final internal adverse benefit determination. A final internal  adverse benefit determination means an adverse benefit determination  that has been upheld by a plan or issuer at the completion of the  internal appeals process applicable under paragraph (b) of this section  (or an adverse benefit determination with respect to which the internal  appeals process has been exhausted under the deemed exhaustion rules of  paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(F) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Final external review decision. A final external review  decision, as used in paragraph (d) of this section, means a  determination by an independent review organization at the conclusion of  an external review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Independent review organization (or IRO). An independent  review organization (or IRO) means an entity that conducts independent  external reviews of adverse benefit determinations and final internal  adverse benefit determinations pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> NAIC Uniform Model Act. The NAIC Uniform Model Act means the  Uniform Health Carrier External Review Model Act promulgated by the  National Association of Insurance Commissioners in place on July 23,  2010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Internal claims and appeals process--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A group  health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group health  insurance coverage must implement an effective internal claims and  appeals process, as described in this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> is  satisfied for both the plan and the issuer with respect to the health  insurance coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Minimum internal claims and appeals standards. A group health  plan and a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance  coverage must comply with all the requirements applicable to group  health plans under 29 CFR 2560.503-1, except to the extent those  requirements are modified by paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.  Accordingly, under this paragraph (b), with respect to health insurance  coverage offered in connection with a group health plan, the group  health insurance issuer is subject to the requirements in 29 CFR  2560.503-1 to the same extent as the group health plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Clarification of meaning of adverse benefit determination. For  purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), an ``adverse benefit determination''  includes an adverse benefit determination as defined in paragraph  (a)(2)(i) of this section. Accordingly, in complying with 29 CFR  2560.503-1, as well as the other provisions of this paragraph (b)(2), a  plan or issuer must treat a rescission of coverage (whether or not the  rescission has an adverse effect on any particular benefit at that time)  as an adverse benefit determination. (Rescissions of coverage are  subject to the requirements of Sec. 2590.715-2712 of this part.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em>, a claim involving  urgent care has the meaning given in 29 CFR 2560.503-1(m)(1), as  determined by the attending provider, and the plan or issuer shall defer  to such determination of the attending provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Full and fair review. A plan and issuer must allow a claimant to  review the claim file and to present evidence and testimony as part of  the internal claims and appeals process. Specifically, in addition to  complying with the requirements of 29 CFR 2560.503-1(h)(2)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The plan or issuer must provide the claimant, free of charge,  with any new or additional evidence considered, relied upon, or  generated by the plan or issuer (or at the direction of the plan or  issuer) in connection with the claim; such evidence must be provided as  soon as possible and sufficiently in advance of the date on which the  notice of final internal adverse benefit determination is required to be  provided under 29 CFR 2560.503-1(i) to give the claimant a reasonable  opportunity to respond prior to that date; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Before the plan or issuer can issue a final internal adverse  benefit determination based on a new or additional rationale, the  claimant must be provided, free of charge, with the rationale; the  rationale must be provided as soon as possible and sufficiently in  advance of the date on which the notice of final internal adverse  benefit determination is required to be provided under 29 CFR 2560.503- 1(i) to give the claimant a reasonable opportunity to respond prior to  that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Avoiding conflicts of interest. In addition to the requirements  of 29 CFR 2560.503-1(b) and (h) regarding full and fair review, the plan  and issuer must ensure that all claims and appeals are adjudicated in a  manner designed to ensure the independence and impartiality of the  persons involved in making the decision. Accordingly, decisions  regarding hiring, compensation, termination, promotion, or other similar  matters with respect to any individual (such as a claims adjudicator or  medical expert) must not be made based upon the likelihood that the  individual will support the denial of benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The plan and issuer must ensure that any notice of adverse  benefit determination or final internal adverse benefit determination  includes information sufficient to identify the claim involved  (including the date of service, the health care provider, the claim  amount (if applicable), and a statement describing the availability,  upon request, of the diagnosis code and its corresponding meaning, and  the treatment code and its corresponding meaning).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The plan and issuer must provide to participants and  beneficiaries, as soon as practicable, upon request, the diagnosis code  and its corresponding meaning, and the treatment code and its  corresponding meaning, associated with any adverse benefit determination  or final internal adverse benefit determination. The plan or issuer must  not consider a request for such diagnosis and treatment information, in  itself, to be a request for an internal appeal under this paragraph (b)  or an external review under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The plan and issuer must ensure that the reason or reasons for  the adverse benefit determination or final internal adverse benefit  determination includes the denial code and its corresponding meaning, as  well as a description of the plan's or issuer's standard, if any, that  was used in denying the claim. In the case of a notice of final internal  adverse benefit determination, this description must include a  discussion of the decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The plan and issuer must provide a description of available  internal appeals and external review processes, including information  regarding how to initiate an appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The plan and issuer must disclose the availability of, and  contact information for, any applicable office of health insurance  consumer assistance or ombudsman established under PHS Act section 2793  to assist individuals with the internal claims and appeals and external  review processes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)(2)</em> of this section. Accordingly, the claimant may initiate  an external review under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, as  applicable. The claimant is also entitled to pursue any available  remedies under section 502(a) of ERISA or under State law, as  applicable, on the basis that the plan or issuer has failed to provide a  reasonable internal claims and appeals process that would yield a  decision on the merits of the claim. If a claimant chooses to pursue  remedies under section 502(a) of ERISA under such circumstances, the  claim or appeal is deemed denied on review without the exercise of  discretion by an appropriate fiduciary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, the claimant has the right to resubmit and pursue the  internal appeal of the claim. In such a case, within a reasonable time  after the external reviewer or court rejects the claim for immediate  review (not to exceed 10 days), the plan shall provide the claimant with  notice of the opportunity to resubmit and pursue the internal appeal of  the claim. Time periods for re-filing the claim shall begin to run upon  claimant's receipt of such notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Requirement to provide continued coverage pending the outcome  of an appeal. A plan and issuer subject to the requirements of this  paragraph (b)(2) are required to provide continued coverage pending the  outcome of an appeal. For this purpose, the plan and issuer must comply  with the requirements of 29 CFR 2560.503-1(f)(2)(ii), which generally  provides that benefits for an ongoing course of treatment cannot be  reduced or terminated without providing advance notice and an  opportunity for advance review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> State standards for external review--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a  State external review process that applies to and is binding on a health  insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage includes at a  minimum the consumer protections in the NAIC Uniform Model Act, then the  issuer must comply with the applicable State external review process and  is not required to comply with the Federal external review process of  paragraph (d) of this section. In such a case, to the extent that  benefits under a group health plan are provided through health insurance  coverage, the group health plan is not required to comply with either  this paragraph (c) or the Federal external review process of paragraph  (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To the extent that a group health plan provides benefits other  than through health insurance coverage (that is, the plan is self- insured) and is   subject to a State external review process that applies to and is  binding on the plan (for example, is not preempted by ERISA) and the  State external review process includes at a minimum the consumer  protections in the NAIC Uniform Model Act, then the plan must comply  with the applicable State external review process and is not required to  comply with the Federal external review process of paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a plan or issuer is not required under paragraph (c)(1)(i)  or (c)(1)(ii) of this section to comply with the requirements of this  paragraph (c), then the plan or issuer must comply with the Federal  external review process of paragraph (d) of this section, except to the  extent, in the case of a plan, the plan is not required under paragraph  (c)(1)(i) of this section to comply with paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>. The Department of Health  and Human Services will determine whether State external review  processes meet these requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State process must provide for the external review of  adverse benefit determinations (including final internal adverse benefit  determinations) by issuers (or, if applicable, plans) that are based on  the issuer's (or plan's) requirements for medical necessity,  appropriateness, health care setting, level of care, or effectiveness of  a covered benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The State process must require issuers (or, if applicable,  plans) to provide effective written notice to claimants of their rights  in connection with an external review for an adverse benefit  determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> To the extent the State process requires exhaustion of an  internal claims and appeals process, exhaustion must be unnecessary  where the issuer (or, if applicable, the plan) has waived the  requirement, the issuer (or the plan) is considered to have exhausted  the internal claims and appeals process under applicable law (including  by failing to comply with any of the requirements for the internal  appeal process, as outlined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), or the  claimant has applied for expedited external review at the same time as  applying for an expedited internal appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The State process provides that the issuer (or, if applicable,  the plan) against which a request for external review is filed must pay  the cost of the IRO for conducting the external review. Notwithstanding  this requirement, the State external review process may require a  nominal filing fee from the claimant requesting an external review. For  this purpose, to be considered nominal, a filing fee must not exceed  $25, it must be refunded to the claimant if the adverse benefit  determination (or final internal adverse benefit determination) is  reversed through external review, it must be waived if payment of the  fee would impose an undue financial hardship, and the annual limit on  filing fees for any claimant within a single plan year must not exceed  $75.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The State process may not impose a restriction on the minimum  dollar amount of a claim for it to be eligible for external review.  Thus, the process may not impose, for example, a $500 minimum claims  threshold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The State process must allow at least four months after the  receipt of a notice of an adverse benefit determination or final  internal adverse benefit determination for a request for an external  review to be filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The State process must provide that IROs will be assigned on a  random basis or another method of assignment that assures the  independence and impartiality of the assignment process (such as  rotational assignment) by a State or independent entity, and in no event  selected by the issuer, plan, or the individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The State process must provide for maintenance of a list of  approved IRO qualified to conduct the external review based on the  nature of the health care service that is the subject of the review. The  State process must provide for approval only of IROs that are accredited  by a nationally recognized private accrediting organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> The State process must provide that any approved IRO has no  conflicts   of interest that will influence its independence. Thus, the IRO may not  own or control, or be owned or controlled by a health insurance issuer,  a group health plan, the sponsor of a group health plan, a trade  association of plans or issuers, or a trade association of health care  providers. The State process must further provide that the IRO and the  clinical reviewer assigned to conduct an external review may not have a  material professional, familial, or financial conflict of interest with  the issuer or plan that is the subject of the external review; the  claimant (and any related parties to the claimant) whose treatment is  the subject of the external review; any officer, director, or management  employee of the issuer; the plan administrator, plan fiduciaries, or  plan employees; the health care provider, the health care provider's  group, or practice association recommending the treatment that is  subject to the external review; the facility at which the recommended  treatment would be provided; or the developer or manufacturer of the  principal drug, device, procedure, or other therapy being recommended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> The State process allows the claimant at least five business  days to submit to the IRO in writing additional information that the IRO  must consider when conducting the external review and it requires that  the claimant is notified of the right to do so. The process must also  require that any additional information submitted by the claimant to the  IRO must be forwarded to the issuer (or, if applicable, the plan) within  one business day of receipt by the IRO.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> The State process must provide that the decision is binding on  the plan or issuer, as well as the claimant, except to the extent other  remedies are available under State or Federal law, and except that the  requirement that the decision be binding shall not preclude the plan or  issuer from making payment on the claim or otherwise providing benefits  at any time, including after a final external review decision that  denies the claim or otherwise fails to require such payment or benefits.  For this purpose, the plan or issuer must provide benefits (including by  making payment on the claim) pursuant to the final external review  decision without delay, regardless of whether the plan or issuer intends  to seek judicial review of the external review decision and unless or  until there is a judicial decision otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> The State process must require, for standard external review,  that the IRO provide written notice to the issuer (or, if applicable,  the plan) and the claimant of its decision to uphold or reverse the  adverse benefit determination (or final internal adverse benefit  determination) within no more than 45 days after the receipt of the  request for external review by the IRO.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> The State process must provide for an expedited external  review if the adverse benefit determination (or final internal adverse  benefit determination) concerns an admission, availability of care,  continued stay, or health care service for which the claimant received  emergency services, but has not been discharged from a facility; or  involves a medical condition for which the standard external review  timeframe would seriously jeopardize the life or health of the claimant  or jeopardize the claimant's ability to regain maximum function. As  expeditiously as possible but within no more than 72 hours after the  receipt of the request for expedited external review by the IRO, the IRO  must make its decision to uphold or reverse the adverse benefit  determination (or final internal adverse benefit determination) and  notify the claimant and the issuer (or, if applicable, the plan) of the  determination. If the notice is not in writing, the IRO must provide  written confirmation of the decision within 48 hours after the date of  the notice of the decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> The State process must require that issuers (or, if  applicable, plans) include a description of the external review process  in or attached to the summary plan description, policy, certificate,  membership booklet, outline of coverage, or other evidence of coverage  it provides to participants, beneficiaries, or enrollees, substantially  similar to what is set forth in section 17 of the NAIC Uniform Model  Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xv)</em> The State process must require that IROs maintain written  records and make them available upon request to the State, substantially  similar to   what is set forth in section 15 of the NAIC Uniform Model Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvi)</em> The State process follows procedures for external review of  adverse benefit determinations (or final internal adverse benefit  determinations) involving experimental or investigational treatment,  substantially similar to what is set forth in section 10 of the NAIC  Uniform Model Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Transition period for external review processes. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Through  December 31, 2011, an applicable State external review process  applicable to a health insurance issuer or group health plan is  considered to meet the requirements of PHS Act section 2719(b).  Accordingly, through December 31, 2011, an applicable State external  review process will be considered binding on the issuer or plan (in lieu  of the requirements of the Federal external review process). If there is  no applicable State external review process, the issuer or plan is  required to comply with the requirements of the Federal external review  process in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For final internal adverse benefit determinations (or, in the  case of simultaneous internal appeal and external review, adverse  benefit determinations) provided on or after January 1, 2012, the  Federal external review process will apply unless the Department of  Health and Human Services determines that a State law meets all the  minimum standards of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(ii)</em> of this section and except to the extent provided  otherwise by the Secretary in guidance, the Federal external review  process established pursuant to this paragraph (d) applies, at a  minimum, to any adverse benefit determination or final internal adverse  benefit determination (as defined in paragraphs (a)(2)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> and (a)(2)(v)  of this section), except that a denial, reduction, termination, or a  failure to provide payment for a benefit based on a determination that a  participant or beneficiary fails to meet the requirements for  eligibility under the terms of a group health plan is not eligible for  the Federal external review process under this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Suspension of general rule. Unless or until this suspension is  revoked in guidance by the Secretary, with respect to claims for which  external review has not been initiated before September 20, 2011, the  Federal external review process established pursuant to this paragraph  (d) applies only to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An adverse benefit determination (including a final internal  adverse benefit determination) by a plan or issuer that involves medical  judgment (including, but not limited to, those based on the plan's or  issuer's requirements for medical necessity, appropriateness, health  care setting, level of care, or effectiveness of a covered benefit; or  its determination that a treatment is experimental or investigational),  as determined by the external reviewer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A rescission of coverage (whether or not the rescission has any  effect on any particular benefit at that time).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. This rules of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section  are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan provides coverage for 30  physical therapy visits generally. After the 30th visit, coverage is  provided only if the service is preauthorized pursuant to an approved  treatment plan that takes into account medical necessity using   the plan's definition of the term. Individual A seeks coverage for a  31st physical therapy visit. A's health care provider submits a  treatment plan for approval, but it is not approved by the plan, so  coverage for the 31st visit is not preauthorized. With respect to the  31st visit, A receives a notice of final internal adverse benefit  determination stating that the maximum visit limit is exceeded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(E)(3)</em> of this  section because it fails to make clear that the plan will pay for more  than 30 visits if the service is preauthorized pursuant to an approved  treatment plan that takes into account medical necessity using the  plan's definition of the term. Accordingly, the notice of final internal  adverse benefit determination should refer to the plan provision  governing the 31st visit and should describe the plan's standard for  medical necessity, as well as how the treatment fails to meet the plan's  standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan does not provide coverage  for services provided out of network, unless the service cannot  effectively be provided in network. Individual B seeks coverage for a  specialized medical procedure from an out-of-network provider because B  believes that the procedure cannot be effectively provided in network. B  receives a notice of final internal adverse benefit determination  stating that the claim is denied because the provider is out-of-network.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(E)(3)</em> of this section because the plan does  provide benefits for services on an out-of-network basis if the services  cannot effectively be provided in network. Accordingly, the notice of  final internal adverse benefit determination is required to refer to the  exception to the out-of-network exclusion and should describe the plan's  standards for determining effectiveness of services, as well as how  services available to the claimant within the plan's network meet the  plan's standard for effectiveness of services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> These standards will describe how a claimant initiates an  external review, procedures for preliminary reviews to determine whether  a claim is eligible for external review, minimum qualifications for  IROs, a process for approving IROs eligible to be assigned to conduct  external reviews, a process for random assignment of external reviews to  approved IROs, standards for IRO decisionmaking, and rules for providing  notice of a final external review decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> These standards will provide an expedited external review  process for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An adverse benefit determination, if the adverse benefit  determination involves a medical condition of the claimant for which the  timeframe for completion of an expedited internal appeal under paragraph  (b) of this section would seriously jeopardize the life or health of the  claimant, or would jeopardize the claimant's ability to regain maximum  function and the claimant has filed a request for an expedited internal  appeal under paragraph (b) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A final internal adverse benefit determination, if the claimant  has a medical condition where the timeframe for completion of a standard  external review pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section would  seriously jeopardize the life or health of the claimant or would  jeopardize the claimant's ability to regain maximum function, or if the  final internal adverse benefit determination concerns an admission,  availability of care, continued stay or health care service for which  the claimant received emergency services, but has not been discharged  from a facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> With respect to claims involving experimental or  investigational treatments, these standards will also provide additional  consumer protections to ensure that adequate clinical and scientific  experience and protocols are taken into account as part of the external  review process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> These standards will provide that an external review decision  is binding on the plan or issuer, as well as the claimant, except to the  extent other remedies are available under State or Federal law, and  except that the requirement that the decision be binding shall not  preclude the plan or issuer from making payment on the claim or  otherwise providing benefits at any time, including after a final  external review decision that denies the claim or otherwise fails to  require such payment or benefits. For this purpose, the plan or issuer  must provide any benefits (including by making payment on the claim)  pursuant to the final external review decision without delay, regardless  of whether the plan or issuer intends to seek judicial review of the  external review decision and unless or until there is a judicial  decision otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> These standards may establish external review reporting  requirements for IROs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> These standards will establish additional notice requirements  for plans and issuers regarding disclosures to participants and  beneficiaries describing the Federal external review procedures  (including the right to file a request for an external review of an  adverse benefit determination or a final internal adverse benefit  determination in the summary plan description, policy, certificate,  membership booklet, outline of coverage, or other evidence of coverage  it provides to participants or beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> These standards will require plans and issuers to provide  information relevant to the processing of the external review,  including, but not limited to, the information considered and relied on  in making the adverse benefit determination or final internal adverse  benefit determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Form and manner of notice--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of this  section, a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering  group health insurance coverage are considered to provide relevant  notices in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner if the  plan or issuer meets all the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this  section with respect to the applicable non-English languages described  in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The plan or issuer must provide oral language  services (such as a telephone customer assistance hotline) that include  answering questions in any applicable non-English language and providing  assistance with filing claims and appeals (including external review) in  any applicable non-English language;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The plan or issuer must provide, upon request, a notice in any  applicable non-English language; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The plan or issuer must include in the English versions of all  notices, a statement prominently displayed in any applicable non-English  language clearly indicating how to access the language services provided  by the plan or issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Applicable non-English language. With respect to an address in  any United States county to which a notice is sent, a non-English  language is an applicable non-English language if ten percent or more of  the population residing in the county is literate only in the same non- English language, as determined in guidance published by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Secretarial authority. The Secretary may determine that the  external review process of a group health plan or health insurance  issuer, in operation as of March 23, 2010, is considered in compliance  with the applicable process established under paragraph (c) or (d) of  this section if it substantially meets the requirements of paragraph (c)  or (d) of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Applicability date. The provisions of this section apply for  plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010. See Sec. 2590.715- 1251 of this part for determining the application of this section to  grandfathered health plans (providing that these rules regarding  internal claims and appeals and external review processes do not apply  to grandfathered health plans).  [75 FR 43354, July 23, 2010, as amended at 76 FR 37230, June 24, 2011;  76 FR 44492, July 26, 2011; 78 FR 68286, Nov. 13, 2013; 78 FR 68286,  Nov. 13, 2013]    Sec. 2590.715-2719A  Patient protections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Choice of health care professional--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Designation of primary  care provider--   </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If a group health plan, or a health insurance issuer  offering group health insurance coverage, requires or provides for  designation by a participant or beneficiary of a participating primary  care provider, then the plan or issuer must permit each participant or  beneficiary to designate any participating primary care provider who is  available to accept the participant or beneficiary. In such a case, the  plan or issuer must comply with the rules of paragraph (a)(4) of this  section by informing each participant of the terms of the plan or health  insurance coverage regarding designation of a primary care provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The rules of this paragraph (a)(1) are illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan requires individuals covered  under the plan to designate a primary care provider. The plan permits  each individual to designate any primary care provider participating in  the plan's network who is available to accept the individual as the  individual's primary care provider. If an individual has not designated  a primary care provider, the plan designates one until one has been  designated by the individual. The plan provides a notice that satisfies  the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section regarding the  ability to designate a primary care provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example, the plan has satisfied the  requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Designation of pediatrician as primary care provider--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. If a group health plan, or a health insurance issuer offering  group health insurance coverage, requires or provides for the  designation of a participating primary care provider for a child by a  participant or beneficiary, the plan or issuer must permit the  participant or beneficiary to designate a physician (allopathic or  osteopathic) who specializes in pediatrics as the child's primary care  provider if the provider participates in the network of the plan or  issuer and is available to accept the child. In such a case, the plan or  issuer must comply with the rules of paragraph (a)(4) of this section by  informing each participant of the terms of the plan or health insurance  coverage regarding designation of a pediatrician as the child's primary  care provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Construction. Nothing in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is  to be construed to waive any exclusions of coverage under the terms and  conditions of the plan or health insurance coverage with respect to  coverage of pediatric care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (a)(2) are illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan's HMO designates for each  participant a physician who specializes in internal medicine to serve as  the primary care provider for the participant and any beneficiaries.  Participant A requests that Pediatrician B be designated as the primary  care provider for A's child. B is a participating provider in the HMO's  network.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, the HMO must permit A's  designation of B as the primary care provider for A's child in order to  comply with the requirements of this paragraph (a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 1, except that A takes  A's child to B for treatment of the child's severe shellfish allergies.  B wishes to refer A's child to an allergist for treatment. The HMO,  however, does not provide coverage for treatment of food allergies, nor  does it have an allergist participating in its network, and it therefore  refuses to authorize the referral.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, the HMO has not violated the  requirements of this paragraph (a)(2) because the exclusion of treatment  for food allergies is in accordance with the terms of A's coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Patient access to obstetrical and gynecological care--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  General rights--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Direct access. A group health plan, or a health  insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, described in  paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section may not require authorization or  referral by the plan, issuer, or any person (including a primary care  provider) in the case of a female participant or beneficiary who seeks  coverage for obstetrical or gynecological care provided by a  participating health care professional who specializes in obstetrics or  gynecology. In such a case, the plan or issuer must comply with the  rules of paragraph (a)(4) of this section by informing each participant  that the plan may not require authorization or referral for obstetrical  or gynecological care by a participating health care professional who  specializes in obstetrics or gynecology. The plan or   issuer may require such a professional to agree to otherwise adhere to  the plan's or issuer's policies and procedures, including procedures  regarding referrals and obtaining prior authorization and providing  services pursuant to a treatment plan (if any) approved by the plan or  issuer. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(3), a health care  professional who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology is any  individual (including a person other than a physician) who is authorized  under applicable State law to provide obstetrical or gynecological care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Obstetrical and gynecological care. A group health plan or  health insurance issuer described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this  section must treat the provision of obstetrical and gynecological care,  and the ordering of related obstetrical and gynecological items and  services, pursuant to the direct access described under paragraph  (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section, by a participating health care  professional who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology as the  authorization of the primary care provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application of paragraph. A group health plan, or a health  insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, is described  in this paragraph (a)(3) if the plan or issuer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Provides coverage for obstetrical or gynecological care; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Requires the designation by a participant or beneficiary of a  participating primary care provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Construction. Nothing in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section  is to be construed to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Waive any exclusions of coverage under the terms and conditions  of the plan or health insurance coverage with respect to coverage of  obstetrical or gynecological care; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Preclude the group health plan or health insurance issuer  involved from requiring that the obstetrical or gynecological provider  notify the primary care health care professional or the plan or issuer  of treatment decisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (a)(3) are illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan requires each participant  to designate a physician to serve as the primary care provider for the  participant and the participant's family. Participant A, a female,  requests a gynecological exam with Physician B, an in-network physician  specializing in gynecological care. The group health plan requires prior  authorization from A's designated primary care provider for the  gynecological exam.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, the group health plan has  violated the requirements of this paragraph (a)(3) because the plan  requires prior authorization from A's primary care provider prior to  obtaining gynecological services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 1 except that A seeks  gynecological services from C, an out-of-network provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, the group health plan has not  violated the requirements of this paragraph (a)(3) by requiring prior  authorization because C is not a participating health care provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 1 except that the group  health plan only requires B to inform A's designated primary care  physician of treatment decisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 3, the group health plan has not  violated the requirements of this paragraph (a)(3) because A has direct  access to B without prior authorization. The fact that the group health  plan requires notification of treatment decisions to the designated  primary care physician does not violate this paragraph (a)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan requires each participant  to designate a physician to serve as the primary care provider for the  participant and the participant's family. The group health plan requires  prior authorization before providing benefits for uterine fibroid  embolization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 4, the plan requirement for prior  authorization before providing benefits for uterine fibroid embolization  does not violate the requirements of this paragraph (a)(3) because,  though the prior authorization requirement applies to obstetrical  services, it does not restrict access to any providers specializing in  obstetrics or gynecology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Notice of right to designate a primary care provider--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. If a group health plan or health insurance issuer requires the  designation by a participant or beneficiary of a primary care provider,  the plan or issuer must provide a notice informing each participant of  the terms of the plan or health insurance coverage regarding designation  of a primary care provider and of the rights--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, that any  participating primary   care provider who is available to accept the participant or beneficiary  can be designated;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, with respect to a  child, that any participating physician who specializes in pediatrics  can be designated as the primary care provider; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, that the plan may not  require authorization or referral for obstetrical or gynecological care  by a participating health care professional who specializes in  obstetrics or gynecology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Timing. The notice described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this  section must be included whenever the plan or issuer provides a  participant with a summary plan description or other similar description  of benefits under the plan or health insurance coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Model language. The following model language can be used to  satisfy the notice requirement described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this  section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For plans and issuers that require or allow for the designation  of primary care providers by participants or beneficiaries, insert:</p><p class="depth0">[Name of group health plan or health insurance issuer] generally  [requires/allows] the designation of a primary care provider. You have  the right to designate any primary care provider who participates in our  network and who is available to accept you or your family members. [If  the plan or health insurance coverage designates a primary care provider  automatically, insert: Until you make this designation, [name of group  health plan or health insurance issuer] designates one for you.] For  information on how to select a primary care provider, and for a list of  the participating primary care providers, contact the [plan  administrator or issuer] at [insert contact information].</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For plans and issuers that require or allow for the designation  of a primary care provider for a child, add:</p><p class="depth0">For children, you may designate a pediatrician as the primary care  provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For plans and issuers that provide coverage for obstetric or  gynecological care and require the designation by a participant or  beneficiary of a primary care provider, add:</p><p class="depth0">You do not need prior authorization from [name of group health plan  or issuer] or from any other person (including a primary care provider)  in order to obtain access to obstetrical or gynecological care from a  health care professional in our network who specializes in obstetrics or  gynecology. The health care professional, however, may be required to  comply with certain procedures, including obtaining prior authorization  for certain services, following a pre-approved treatment plan, or  procedures for making referrals. For a list of participating health care  professionals who specialize in obstetrics or gynecology, contact the  [plan administrator or issuer] at [insert contact information].</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Coverage of emergency services--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Scope. If a group health  plan, or a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance  coverage, provides any benefits with respect to services in an emergency  department of a hospital, the plan or issuer must cover emergency  services (as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section) consistent  with the rules of this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> General rules. A plan or issuer subject to the requirements of  this paragraph (b) must provide coverage for emergency services in the  following manner--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Without the need for any prior authorization determination, even  if the emergency services are provided on an out-of-network basis;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Without regard to whether the health care provider furnishing  the emergency services is a participating network provider with respect  to the services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the emergency services are provided out of network, without  imposing any administrative requirement or limitation on coverage that  is more restrictive than the requirements or limitations that apply to  emergency services received from in-network providers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the emergency services are provided out of network, by  complying with the cost-sharing requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this  section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Without regard to any other term or condition of the coverage,  other than--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The exclusion of or coordination of benefits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An affiliation or waiting period permitted under part 7 of  ERISA, part A of title XXVII of the PHS Act, or chapter 100 of the  Internal Revenue Code; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Applicable cost sharing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(C)</em> of this section (which are adjusted for in-network  cost-sharing requirements).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> is  disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> for an emergency service is the total (that is, 100  percent) of the usual, customary, and reasonable amount for the service,  not reduced by the 30 percent coinsurance that would generally apply to  out-of-network services (but reduced by the in-network copayment or  coinsurance that the individual would be responsible for if the  emergency service had been provided in-network).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The amount that would be paid under Medicare (part A or part B  of title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) for  the emergency service, excluding any in-network copayment or coinsurance  imposed with respect to the participant or beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other cost sharing. Any cost-sharing requirement other than a  copayment or coinsurance requirement (such as a deductible or out-of- pocket maximum) may be imposed with respect to emergency services  provided out of network if the cost-sharing requirement generally  applies to out-of-network benefits. A deductible may be imposed with  respect to out-of-network emergency services only as part of a  deductible that generally applies to out-of-network benefits. If an out- of-pocket maximum generally applies to out-of-network benefits, that  out-of-pocket maximum must apply to out-of-network emergency services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (b)(3) are illustrated  by the following examples. In all of these examples, the group health  plan covers benefits with respect to emergency services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan imposes a 25% coinsurance  responsibility on individuals who are furnished emergency services,  whether provided in network or out of network. If a covered individual  notifies the plan within two business days after the day an individual  receives treatment in an emergency department, the plan reduces the  coinsurance rate to 15%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, the requirement to notify the  plan in order to receive a reduction in the coinsurance rate does not  violate the requirement that the plan cover emergency services without  the need for any prior authorization determination. This is the result  even if the plan required that it be notified before or at the time of  receiving services at the emergency department in order to receive a  reduction in the coinsurance rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan imposes a $60 copayment on  emergency services without preauthorization, whether provided in network  or out of network. If emergency services are preauthorized, the plan  waives the copayment, even if it later determines the medical condition  was not an emergency medical condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, by requiring an individual to  pay more for emergency services if the individual does not obtain prior  authorization, the plan violates the requirement that the plan cover  emergency services without the need for any prior authorization  determination. (By contrast, if, to have the copayment waived, the plan  merely required that it be notified rather than a prior authorization,  then the plan would not violate the requirement that the plan cover  emergency services without the need for any prior authorization  determination.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan covers individuals who  receive emergency services with respect to an emergency medical  condition from an out-of-network provider. The plan has agreements with  in-network providers with respect to a certain emergency service. Each  provider has agreed to provide the service for a certain amount. Among  all the providers for the service: one has agreed to accept $85, two  have agreed to accept $100, two have agreed to accept $110, three have  agreed to accept $120, and one has agreed to accept $150. Under the  agreement, the plan agrees to pay the providers 80% of the agreed  amount, with the individual receiving the service responsible for the  remaining 20%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 3, the values taken into account in  determining the median are $85, $100, $100, $110, $110, $120, $120,  $120, and $150. Therefore, the median amount among those agreed to for  the emergency service is $110, and the amount under paragraph  (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section is 80% of $110 ($88).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 3. Subsequently, the  plan adds another provider to its network, who has agreed to accept $150  for the emergency service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 4, the median amount among those  agreed to for the emergency service is $115. (Because there is no one  middle amount, the median is the average of the two middle amounts, $110  and $120.) Accordingly, the amount under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this  section is 80% of $115 ($92).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 4. An individual covered  by the plan receives the emergency service from an out-of-network  provider, who charges $125 for the service. With respect to services  provided by out-of-network providers generally, the plan reimburses  covered individuals 50% of the reasonable amount charged by the provider  for medical services. For this purpose, the reasonable amount for any  service is based on information on charges by all providers collected by  a third party, on a zip code by zip code basis, with the plan treating  charges at a specified percentile as reasonable. For the emergency  service received by the individual, the reasonable amount calculated  using this method is $116. The amount that would be paid under Medicare  for the emergency service, excluding any copayment or coinsurance for  the service, is $80.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 5, the plan is responsible for  paying $92.80, 80% of $116. The median amount among those agreed to for  the emergency service is $115 and the amount the plan would pay is $92  (80% of $115); the amount calculated using the same method the plan uses  to determine payments for out-of-network services--$116--excluding the  in-network 20% coinsurance, is $92.80; and the Medicare payment is $80.  Thus, the greatest amount is $92.80. The individual is responsible for  the remaining $32.20 charged by the out-of-network provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 5. The group health plan  generally imposes a $250 deductible for in-network health care. With  respect to all health care provided by out-of-network providers, the  plan imposes a $500 deductible. (Covered in-network claims are credited  against the deductible.) The individual has incurred and submitted $260  of covered claims prior to receiving the emergency service out of  network.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 6, the plan is not responsible for  paying anything with respect to the emergency service furnished by the  out-of-network provider because the covered individual has not satisfied  the higher deductible that applies generally to all health care provided  out of network. However, the amount the individual is required to pay is  credited against the deductible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> govern in  applying the provisions of this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> refers to placing the health of the  individual (or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the  woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy; clause (ii) refers to  serious impairment to bodily functions; and clause (iii) refers to  serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Emergency services. The term emergency services means, with  respect to an emergency medical condition--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A medical screening examination (as required under section 1867  of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1395dd) that is within the  capability of the emergency department of a hospital, including  ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department to  evaluate such emergency medical condition, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Such further medical examination and treatment, to the extent  they are within the capabilities of the staff and facilities available  at the hospital, as are required under section 1867 of the Social  Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395dd) to stabilize the patient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Stabilize. The term to stabilize, with respect to an emergency  medical condition (as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section)  has the meaning given in section 1867(e)(3) of the Social Security Act  (42 U.S.C. 1395dd(e)(3)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Applicability date. The provisions of this section apply for  plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010. See Sec. 2590.715- 1251 of this part for determining the application of this section to  grandfathered health plans (providing that these rules regarding patient  protections do not apply to grandfathered health plans).
