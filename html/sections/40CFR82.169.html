Sec. Appendix A to Subpart F of Part 82--Specifications for Fluorocarbon</p><p class="depth0">and Other Refrigerants</p><p class="depth0">This appendix is based on the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute Standard 700-1995.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Purpose</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to evaluate and accept/reject refrigerants regardless of source (i.e., new, reclaimed and/or repackaged) for use in new and existing refrigeration and air-conditioning products as required under 40 CFR part 82.</p><p class="depth0">1.1.1 Intent. This standard is intended for the guidance of the industry including manufacturers, refrigerant reclaimers, repackagers, distributors, installers, servicemen, contractors and for consumers.</p><p class="depth0">1.1.2 Review and Amendment.

Sampling, Summary of Test Methods and Maximum Permissible</p><p class="depth0">Contaminant Levels</p><p class="depth0">5.1 Referee Test. The referee test methods for the various contaminants are summarized in the following paragraphs. Detailed test procedures are included in Appendix C to ARI Standard 700-1995: Analytical Procedures for ARI Standard 700-1995, 1995, Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute. Appendix C to ARI Standard 700-1995 is incorporated by reference. [This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute, 4301 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203. Copies may also be inspected at Public Docket No. A-92-01, Environmental Protection Agency, 1301 Constitution Ave., NW., Washington, DC, 20460 or at

the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., Suite 700, Washington, DC.] If alternative test methods are employed, the user must be able to demonstrate that they produce results equivalent to the specified referee method.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Refrigerant Sampling</p><p class="depth0">5.2.1 Sampling Precautions. Special precautions should be taken to assure that representative samples are obtained for analysis. Sampling shall be done by trained laboratory personnel following accepted sampling and safety procedures.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.2 Gas Phase Sample. A gas phase sample shall be obtained for determining the non-condensables. Since non-condensable gases, if present, will concentrate in the vapor phase of the refrigerant, care must be exercised to eliminate introduction of air during the sample transfer. Purging is not an acceptable procedure for a gas phase sample since it may introduce a foreign product. Since R-11, R-113, and R-123 have normal boiling points at or above room temperature, non-condensable determination is not required for these refrigerants.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.2.1 Connection. The sample cylinder shall be connected to an evacuated gas sampling bulb by means of a manifold. The manifold should have a valve arrangement that facilitates evacuation of all connecting tubing leading to the sampling bulb.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.2.2 Equalizing Pressures. After the manifold has been evacuated, close the valve to the pump and open the valve on the system. Allow the pressure to equilibrate and close valves.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.3 Liquid Phase Sample. A liquid phase sample is required for all tests listed in this standard except the test for non-condensables.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.3.1 Preparation. Place a clean, empty sample cylinder with the valve open in an oven at 110 C (230 F) for one hour. Remove it from the oven while hot, immediately connect to an evacuation system and evacuate to less than 1 mm mercury (1000 microns). Close the valve and allow it to cool. Weigh the empty cylinder.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.3.2 Manifolding. The valve and lines from the unit to be sampled shall be clean and dry. The cylinder shall be connected to an evacuated gas sampling cylinder by means of a manifold. The manifold should have a valve arrangement that facilitates evacuation of all connecting tubing leading to the sampling cylinder.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.3.3 Liquid Sampling. After the manifold has been evacuated, close the valve to the pump and open the valve on the system. Take the sample as a liquid by chilling the sample cylinder slightly. Accurate analysis requires that the sample container be filled to at least 60% by volume, however under no circumstances should the cylinder be filled to more than 80% by volume. This can be accomplished by weighing the empty cylinder and then the cylinder with refrigerant. When the desired amount of refrigerant has been collected, close the valve(s) and disconnect the sample cylinder immediately.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.3.4 Record Weight. Check the sample cylinder for leaks and record the gross weight.</p><p class="depth0">5.3 Refrigerant Characterization.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.1 Primary Method. The primary method shall be gas chromatography (GC) as described in Appendix C to ARI Standard 700-1995. The chromatogram of the sample shall be compared to known standards.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.2 Alternative Method. Determination of the boiling point and boiling point range is an acceptable alternative test method which can be used to characterize refrigerants. The test method shall be that described in the Federal Specification for ``Fluorocarbon Refrigerants,'' BB-F-1421 B, dated March 5, 1982, section 4.4.3.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.3 Required Values. The required values for boiling point and boiling point range are given in Table 1A, Physical Properties of Single Component Refrigerants; Table 1B, Physical Properties of Zeotropic Blends (400 Series Refrigerants); and Table 1C, Physical Properties of Azeotropic Blends (500 Series Refrigerants).</p><p class="depth0">5.4 Water Content.</p><p class="depth0">5.4.1 Method. The Coulometric Karl Fischer Titration shall be the primary test method for determining the water content of refrigerants. This method is described in Appendix C to ARI Standard 700-1995. This method can be used for refrigerants that are either a liquid or a gas at room temperature, including refrigerants 11, 113, and 123. For all refrigerants, the sample for water analysis shall be taken from the liquid phase of the container to be tested. Proper operation of the analytical method requires special equipment and an experienced operator. The precision of the results is excellent if proper sampling and handling procedures are followed. Refrigerants containing a colored dye can be successfully analyzed for water using this method.</p><p class="depth0">5.4.2 Limits. The value for water content shall be expressed as parts per million (ppm) by weight and shall not exceed the maximum specified (see Tables 1A, 1B, and 1C).</p><p class="depth0">5.5 Chloride.</p><p class="depth0">The refrigerant shall be tested for chloride as an indication of the presence of hydrochloric acid and/or metal chlorides. The recommended procedure is intended for use with new or reclaimed refrigerants. Significant amounts of oil may interfere with the results by indicating a failure in the absence of chloride.</p><p class="depth0">5.5.1 Method. The test method shall be that described in Appendix C to ARI Standard 700-1995. The test will show noticeable turbidity at chloride levels of about 3 ppm by weight or higher.</p><p class="depth0">5.5.2 Turbidity. The results of the test shall not exhibit any sign of turbidity. Report the results as ``pass'' or ``fail.''</p><p class="depth0">5.6 Acidity.</p><p class="depth0">5.6.1 Method. The acidity test uses the titration principle to detect any compound that is highly soluble in water and ionizes as an acid. The test method shall be that described in Appendix C to ARI Standard 700-1995. This test may not be suitable for determination of high molecular weight organic acids; however these acids will be found in the high boiling residue test outlined in 5.7. The test requires a 100 to 120 gram sample and has a detection limit of 0.1 ppm by weight calculated as HCl.</p><p class="depth0">5.6.2 Limits. The maximum permissible acidity is 1 ppm by weight as HCl.</p><p class="depth0">5.7 High Boiling Residue.</p><p class="depth0">5.7.1 Method. High boiling residue shall be determined by measuring the residue of a standard volume of refrigerant after evaporation. The refrigerant sample shall be evaporated at room temperature or at a temperature 45 C (115 F) for all refrigerants, except R-113 which shall be evaporated at 60 C (140 F), using a Goetz bulb as specified in Appendix C to ARI Standard 700-1995. Oils and/or organic acids will be captured by this method.</p><p class="depth0">5.7.2 Limits. The value for high boiling residue shall be expressed as a percentage by volume and shall not exceed the maximum percent specified (see Tables 1A, 1B, and 1C). An alternative gravimetric method is described in Appendix C to ARI Standard 700-1995.</p><p class="depth0">5.8 Method of Tests for Particulates and Solids.</p><p class="depth0">5.8.1 Method. A measured amount of sample is evaporated from a Goetz bulb under controlled temperature conditions. The particulates/solids shall be determined by visual examination of the Goetz bulb prior to the evaporation of refrigerant. Presence of dirt, rust or other particulate contamination is reported as ``fail.'' For details of this test method, refer to Part 3 of Appendix C to ARI Standard 700-1995.</p><p class="depth0">5.9 Non-Condensables.</p><p class="depth0">5.9.1 Sample. A vapor phase sample shall be used for determination of non-condensables. Non-condensable gases consist primarily of air accumulated in the vapor phase of refrigerants. The solubility of air in the refrigerants liquid phase is extremely low and air is not significant as a liquid phase contaminant. The presence of non-condensable gases may reflect poor quality control in transferring refrigerants to storage tanks and cylinders.</p><p class="depth0">5.9.2 Method. The test method shall be gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector as described in Appendix C to ARI Standard 700-1995.</p><p class="depth0">5.9.3 Limit. The maximum level of non-condensables in the vapor phase of a refrigerant in a container shall not exceed 1.5% by volume (see Tables 1A, 1B, and 1C).</p><p class="depth0">5.10 Impurities, including Other Refrigerants.</p><p class="depth0">5.10.1 Method. The amount of other impurities including other refrigerants in the subject refrigerant shall be determined by gas chromatography as described in Appendix C to ARI Standard 700-1995.</p><p class="depth0">5.10.2 Limit. The subject refrigerant shall not contain more than 0.5% by weight of impurities including other refrigerants (see Tables 1A, 1B, and 1C).</p><p class="depth0">Section 6. Reporting Procedure</p><p class="depth0">6.1 Reporting Procedure. The source (manufacturer, reclaimer or repackager) of the packaged refrigerant shall be identified. The refrigerant shall be identified by its accepted refrigerant number and/or its chemical name. Maximum permissible levels of contaminants are shown in Tables 1A, 1B, and 1C. Test results shall be tabulated in a like manner.

The apparatus as shown in Figure 1 consists of a 3 cubic foot [0.085 m\3\] mixing chamber with a conical-shaped bottom, although a larger mixing chamber is permissible. The size of the mixing chamber depends upon the size of the equipment. The outlet at the bottom of the cone and all restrictions and valves for liquid and vapor refrigerant lines in the test apparatus shall be a minimum of 0.375 in. [9.5 mm] inside diameter or equivalent. The minimum inside diameter for large equipment for use on chillers shall be 1.5 in. [38 mm.]. The mixing chamber shall contain various ports for receiving liquid refrigerant, oil, and contaminants. A recirculating line connected from the bottom outlet through a recirculating pump and then to a top vapor port shall be provided for stirring of the mixture. Isolation valves may be required for the pump. Alternative stirring means may be used if demonstrated to be equally effective.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.1 For liquid refrigerant feed, the liquid valve is opened. For vapor refrigerant feed, the vapor valve is opened and refrigerant passes through an evaporator coil. Flow is controlled by a thermostatic expansion valve to create 5 F [3 C] superheat at an evaporator temperature of 70 F [3 F[21 C[2]. The evaporator coil or equivalent evaporator means shall be either sized large enough for the largest system or be sized for each system.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.2 An alternative method for vapor refrigerant feed is to pass through a boiler and then an automatic pressure regulating valve set at refrigerant saturation pressure at 75 F [3 F [24 C [2 C].</p><p class="depth0">6.2 System Dependent Equipment Test Apparatus.

After the equipment reaches stabilized conditions of condensing temperature and/or storage tank pressure, the vapor feed recovery rate shall be measured. One method is to start measuring the vapor refrigerant recovery rate when 85% of refrigerant remains in the mixing chamber and continue for a period of time sufficient to achieve the accuracy in 9.2. If liquid feed is not elected, complete Step 7.1.2.4.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.2.3 Liquid refrigerant feed testing, if elected, shall be processed next. After the equipment reaches stabilized conditions, the liquid feed recovery rate shall be measured. One method is to wait 2 minutes after starting liquid feed and then measure the liquid refrigerant recovery rate for a period of time sufficient to achieve the accuracy in 9.1. Continue liquid recovery operation as called for in 7.1.2.4.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.2.4 Continue recovery operation until all liquid is removed from the mixing chamber and vapor is removed to the point where the equipment shuts down per automatic means or is manually stopped per the operating instructions.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.2.5 After collecting the first contaminated refrigerant sample batch, the liquid and vapor value of the apparatus shall be closed and the mixing chamber pressure recorded after 1 minute as required in 9.5. After preparing a second contaminated refrigerant sample batch, continue recovery until the storage container reaches 80% liquid fill level. After recycling and measuring

the recycle rate per section 7.1.3, set this container aside for the vapor sample in 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.2.6 Interruptions in equipment operations as called for in instruction manual are allowable.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.3 Recycle as called for in equipment operating instructions.

Sampling and Chemical Analysis Methods</p><p class="depth0">8.1 The referee test methods for the various contaminants are summarized in the following paragraphs. Detailed test procedures are included in Appendix A ``Test Procedures for ARI STD 700.'' If alternate test methods are employed, the user must be able to demonstrate that they produce results equivalent to the specified referee method.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 Refrigerant Sampling.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 Sampling Precautions. Special precautions should be taken to assure that representative samples are obtained for analysis. Sampling shall be done by trained laboratory personnel following accepted sampling and safety procedures.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Gas Phase Sample. A gas phase sample shall be obtained for determining the non-condensables. Since non-condensable gases, if present, will concentrate in the vapor phase of the refrigerant, care must be exercised to eliminate introduction of air during the sample transfer. Purging is not and acceptable procedure for a gas phase sample since it may introduce a foreign product. Since R11, R113 and R123 have normal boiling points at or above room temperature, noncondensable determination is not required for these refrigerants.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2.1 The sample cylinder shall be connected to an evacuated gas sampling bulb by means of a manifold. The manifold should have a valve arrangement that facilitates evacuation of all connecting tubing leading to the sampling bulb.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2.2 After the manifold has been evacuated, close the valve to the pump and open the valve on the system. Allow the pressure to equilibrate and close valves.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3 Liquid Phase Sample. A liquid phase sample is required for all tests listed in this standard, except the test for non-condensables.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3.1 Place an empty sample cylinder with the valve open in an oven at 230 F [110 C] for one hour. Remove it from the oven while hot, immediately connect to an evacuation system and evacuate to less than 1mm. mercury (1000 microns). Close the valve and allow it to cool.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3.2 The valve and lines from the unit to be sampled shall be clean and dry. Connect the line to the sample cylinder loosely. Purge through the loose connection. Make the connection tight at the end of the purge period. Take the sample as a liquid by chilling the sample cylinder slightly. Accurate analysis requires that the sample container be filled to at least 60% by volume; however under no circumstances should the cylinder be filled to more than 80% by volume. This can be accomplished by weighing the empty cylinder and then the cylinder with refrigerant. When the desired amount of refrigerant has been collected, close the valve(s) and disconnect the sample cylinder immediately.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3.3 Check the sample cylinder for leaks and record the gross weight.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 Water Content.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1. The Coulometric Karl Fischer Titration shall be the primary test method for determining the water content of refrigerants. This method is described in Appendix A. This method can be used for refrigerants that are either a liquid or a gas at room temperature, including Refrigerants 11 and 13. For all refrigerants, the sample for water analysis shall be taken from the liquid phase of the container to be tested. Proper operation of the analytical method requires special equipment and an experienced operator. The precision of the results is excellent if proper sampling and handling procedures are followed. Refrigerants containing a colored dye can be successfully analyzed for water using this method.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 The Karl Fischer Test Method is an acceptable alternative test method for determining the water content of refrigerants. This method is described in ASTM Standard for ``Water in gases Using Karl Fisher Reagent'' E700-79, reapproved 1984 (American Society for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia, PA).</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Report the moisture level in parts per million by weight if a sample is required.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 Chloride. The refrigerant shall be tested for chlorides as an indication of the presence of hydrochloric or similar acids. The recommended procedure is intended for use with new or reclaimed refrigerants. Significant amounts of oil may interfere with the results by indicating a failure in the absence of chlorides.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.1 The test method shall be that described in Appendix A ``Test Procedures for ARI-700.'' The test will show noticeable turbidity at equivalent chloride levels of about 3 ppm by weight or higher.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2 The results of the test shall not exhibit any sign of turbity. Report results as ``pass'' or ``fail.''</p><p class="depth0">8.5 Acidity.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.1 The acidity test uses the titration principle to detect any compound that is highly soluble in water and ionizes as an acid. The test method shall be that described in Appendix A. ``Test Procedures for ARI-700.'' The test may not be suitable for determination of high molecular weight organic acids; however these acids will be found in the high boiling residue test outlined in Section 5.7. The test requires about a 100 to 120 gram sample and has a low detection limit of 0.1 ppm by weight as HC1.</p><p class="depth0">8.6 High Boiling Residue.</p><p class="depth0">8.6.1 High boiling residue will be determined by measuring the residue of a standard volume of refrigerant after evaporation. The refrigerant sample shall be evaporated at room temperature or a temperature 50 F [10.0C], above the boiling point of the sample using a Goetz tube as specified in Appendix A ``Test Procedures for ARI-700.'' Oils and or organic acids will be captured by this method.</p><p class="depth0">8.6.2 The value for high boiling residue shall be expressed as a percentage by volume.</p><p class="depth0">8.7 Particulates/Solids.</p><p class="depth0">8.7.1 A measured amount of sample is evaporated from a Goetz bulb under controlled temperature conditions. The particulates/solids shall be determined by visual examination of the empty Goetz bulb after the sample has evaporated completely. Presence of dirt, rust or other particulate contamination is reported a ``fail.'' For details of this test method, refer to Appendix B ``Test Procedures for ARI-700.''</p><p class="depth0">8.8 Non-Condensables</p><p class="depth0">8.8.1 A vapor phase sample shall be used for determination of non-condensables. Non-condensable gases consist primarily of air accumulated in the vapor phase of refrigerant containing tanks. The solubility of air in the refrigerants liquid phase is extremely low and air is not significant as a liquid phase contaminant. The presence of non-condensable gases may reflect poor quality control in transferring refrigerants to storage tanks and cylinders.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.2 The test method shall be gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector as described in Appendix A ``Test Procedures for ARI-700.''</p><p class="depth0">8.8.2.1 The Federal Specification for ``Fluorocarbon Refrigerants,'' BB-F-1421B, dated March 5, 1992, section 4.4.2 (perchloroethylene method) is an acceptable alternate test method.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.3 Report the level of non-condensable as percent by volume.</p><p class="depth0">Section 9. Performance Calculation and Rating</p><p class="depth0">9.1 The liquid refrigerant recovery rate shall be expressed in pounds per minute [kg/min] and measured by weight change at the mixing chamber (See Figure 1) divided by elapsed time to an accuracy within .02 lbs/min. [.009 kg/min]. Ratings using the Push/Pull method shall be identified ``Push/Pull''. Equipment may be rated by both methods.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 The vapor refrigerant recovery rate shall be expressed in pounds per minute [kg/min] and measured by weight change at the mixing chamber (See Figure 1) divided by elapsed time to an accuracy within .02 lbs/min. [.0.009 kg/min].</p><p class="depth0">9.3 The recycle rate is defined in 3.7 and expressed in pounds per minute [kg/min] of flow and shall be per ASHRAE 41.7-84 ``Procedure For Fluid Measurement Of Gases'' or ASHRAE 41.8-89 ``Standard Method of Flow of Fluids--Liquids.''</p><p class="depth0">9.3.1 For equipment using multipass recycling or a separate sequence, the recycle rate shall be determined by dividing the net weight W of the refrigerant to be recycled by the actual time T required to recycle the refrigerant. Any set-up or operator interruptions shall not be included in the time T. The accuracy of the recycle rate shall be within .02 lbs/min. [.009 kg/min].</p><p class="depth0">9.3.2 If no separate recycling sequence is used, the recycle rate shall be the higher of the vapor refrigerant recovery rate or the liquid refrigerant recovery rate. The recycle rate shall match a process which leads to contaminant levels in 9.6. Specifically, a recovery rate determined from bypassing a contaminant removal device cannot be used as a recycle rate when the contaminant levels in 9.6 are determined by passing the refrigerant through the containment removal device.</p><p class="depth0">9.4 Refrigerant loss due to non-condensable purging shall be less than 5%. This rating shall be expressed as ``passed'' if less than 5%.</p><p class="depth0">This calculation will be based upon net loss of non-condensables and refrigerant due to the purge divided by the initial net content. The net loss shall be determined by weighing before and after the purge, by collecting purged gases, or an equivalent method.</p><p class="depth0">9.5 The final recovery vacuum shall be the mixing chamber pressure called for in 7.1.2.5 expressed in inches of mercury vacuum, [mm Hg or kP]. The accuracy of the measurement shall be within [.1 inch [[2.5mm] of Hg and rounding down to the nearest whole number.</p><p class="depth0">9.6 The contaminant levels remaining after testing shall be published as follows:

Appendix C to Subpart F of Part 82--Method for Testing Recovery</p><p class="depth0">Devices for Use With Small Appliances</p><p class="depth0">Recovery Efficiency Test Procedure for Refrigerant Recovery Equipment</p><p class="depth0">Used on Small Appliances</p><p class="depth0">The following test procedure is utilized to evaluate the efficiency of equipment designed to recover ozone depleting refrigerants (or any substitute refrigerant subject to the recycling rules promulgated pursuant to section 608 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990) from small appliances when service of those appliances requires entry into the sealed refrigeration system or when those appliances are destined for disposal. This procedure is designed to calculate on a weight or mass basis the percentage of a known charge of CFC-12 refrigerant removed and captured from a test stand refrigeration system. Captured refrigerant is that refrigerant delivered to a container suitable for shipment to a refrigerant reclaimer plus any refrigerant remaining in the recovery system in a manner that it will be transferred to a shipping container after additional recovery operations.</p><p class="depth0">The test stand refrigeration system required for this procedure is constructed with standard equipment utilized in currently produced household refrigerator and freezer products. The procedure also accounts for compressor oils that might be added to or removed from the test stand compressor or any compressor used in the recovery system.</p><p class="depth0">I. Test Stand</p><p class="depth0">Test stands are constructed in accordance with the following standards.</p><p class="depth0">1. Evaporator--\5/16\ in. outside dia. with 30 cu. in. volume.</p><p class="depth0">2. Condenser--\1/4\ in. outside dia. with 20 cu. in volume.</p><p class="depth0">3. Suction line capillary heat exchanger--appropriate for compressor used.</p><p class="depth0">4. An 800-950 Btu/hr high side case (rotary) compressor; or (depending on the test senario);</p><p class="depth0">5. An 800-9500 Btu/hr low side case (reciprocating) compressor.</p><p class="depth0">A person seeking to have its recovery system certified shall specify the compressors by manufacturer and model that are to be used in test stands constructed for evaluation of its equipment, and the type and quantity of compressor to be used in those compressors. Only a compressor oil approved for use by the compressor's manufacturer may be specified, and the quantity of compressor oil specified shall be an appropriate quantity for the type of oil and compressor to be used. In order to reduce the cost of testing, the person seeking certification of its recovery system may supply an EPA approved third party testing laboratory with test stands meeting these standards for use in evaluating its recovery system.</p><p class="depth0">II. Test Conditions</p><p class="depth0">Tests are to be conducted at 75 degrees F, plus or minus 2 degrees F (23.9 C [1.1 C). Separate tests are conducted on both high side case compressor stands and low side case compressor stands. Separate tests are also conducted with the test stand compressor running during the recovery operation, and without the test stand compressor running during the recovery operation, to calculate the system's recovery efficiency under either condition.</p><p class="depth0">These tests are to be performed using a representative model of all equipment used in the recovery system to deliver recovered refrigerant to a container suitable for shipment to a refrigerant reclaimer. The test stands are to be equipped with access valves permanently installed as specific by the recovery system's vendor to represent the valves used with that system in actual field operations.</p><p class="depth0">A series of five (5) recovery operations are to be performed for each compressor scenario and a recovery efficiency is calculated based on the total quantity of refrigerant captured during all five (5) recoveries. Alternatively, at the request of the recovery system's vendor, a recovery efficiency is to be calculated for each recovery event. In this case, a statistically significant number of recovery operations are to be performed. Determination of what is a statistically significant number of recoveries is to be calculated as set out below. These individual recovery efficiencies are then averaged.</p><p class="depth0">There are four (4) compressor scenarios to be tested. These are a high side case compressor in working condition; a high side case compressor in nonworking condition; a low side case compressor in working condition; and a low side case compressor in nonworking condition. Recovery efficiencies calculated for the two working compressor scenarios are to be averaged to report a working compressor performance. The two nonworking compressor efficiencies are also to be averaged to report a nonworking compressor performance.</p><p class="depth0">If large scale equipment is required in the system to deliver recovered refrigerant to a refrigerant reclaimer (eg. carbon desorption equipment) and it is not possible to have that equipment evaluated under the procedure, the system's vendor shall obtain engineering data on the performance of that large scale equipment that will reasonably demonstrate the percentage refrigerant lost when processed by that equipment. That data will be supplied to any person required to evaluate the performance of those systems. The following procedure will also be modified as needed to determine the weight

of refrigerant recovered from a test stand and delivered to a container for shipment to the large process equipment for further processing. The percentage loss documented to occur during processing is then to be applied to the recovery efficiencies calculated in this modified procedure to determine the overall capture efficiency for the entire system.</p><p class="depth0">The following are definitions of symbols used in the test procedure.
Test Stand:</p><p class="depth0">``TSO'' means an original test stand weight.</p><p class="depth0">``TSC'' means a charged test stand weight.Shipping Containers:</p><p class="depth0">``SCO'' means the original or empty weight of shipping container(s).</p><p class="depth0">``SCF'' means the final or full weight of shipping container(s).Recover/Transfer System:</p><p class="depth0">``RSO'' means the original weight of a recovery/transfer system.</p><p class="depth0">``RSF'' means the final weight of a recovery/transfer system.</p><p class="depth0">``OL'' means the net amount of oil added/removed from the recovery device and/or transfer device between the beginning and end of the test for one compressor scenario.Weighing steps are conducted with precision and accuracy of plus or</p><p class="depth0">minus 1.0 gram.</p><p class="depth0">III. Test Procedure</p><p class="depth0">1. Evacuate the test stand to 20 microns vacuum (pressure measured at a vacuum pump) for 12 hours.</p><p class="depth0">2. Weigh the test stand (TSO).</p><p class="depth0">3. If this is the first recovery operation being performed for a compressor scenario (or if a recovery efficiency is to be calculated for each recovery event), then weigh all devices used in the recovery system to deliver recovered refrigerant to a container suitable for shipment or delivery to a refrigerant reclaimer. Weigh only devices that can retain refrigerant in a manner that it will ultimately be transferred to a shipping container without significant release to the atmosphere (RSO).</p><p class="depth0">4. Weigh final shipping containers (SCO).</p><p class="depth0">5. Charge the test stand with an appropriate CFC-12 charge (either 6 oz. or 9 oz.).</p><p class="depth0">6. Run the test stand for four (4) hours with 100% run time.</p><p class="depth0">7. Turn off the test stand for twelve (12) hours. During this period evaporate all condensation that has collected on the test stand during step 6.</p><p class="depth0">8. Weigh the test stand (TSC).</p><p class="depth0">9. Recover CFC-12 from the test stand and perform all operations needed to transfer the recovered refrigerant to one of the shipping containers weighed in step 4. All recovery and transfer operations are to be performed in accordance with the operating instructions provided by the system's vendor. The compressor in the test stand is to remain ``off'' or be turned ``on'' during the recovery operation depending on whether the test is for a nonworking or working compressor performance evaluation. If a recovery efficiency is to be calculated for each recovery event, transfer the captured refrigerant to a shipping container and then skip to step 13. Otherwise continue. If the system allows for multiple recovery operations to be performed before transferring recovered refrigerant to a shipping container, the transfer operation can be delayed until either the maximum number of recovery operations allowed before a transfer is required have been performed, or the last of the five (5) recovery operations has been performed.</p><p class="depth0">10. Perform any oil removal or oil addition operations needed to properly maintain the test stand and the devices used for recovery or transfer operations. Determine the net weight of the oil added or removed from the recovery device and/or transfer device. (OP1 for oil added, OP2 for oil removed).</p><p class="depth0">11. Evacuate the test stand to 20 microns vacuum for 4 hours.</p><p class="depth0">12. Return to step 2 unless five (5) recovery operations have been performed.</p><p class="depth0">13. Weigh all final shipping containers that received recovered refrigerant (SCF).</p><p class="depth0">14. Weigh the equipment weighed in step three (3) above (RSF). If a recovery efficiency is to be calculated for each recovery event, perform calculations and return to step one (1) for additional recoveries.</p><p class="depth0">IV.

Appendix D to Subpart F of Part 82--Standards for Becoming a</p><p class="depth0">Certifying Program for Technicians</p><p class="depth0">Standards for Certifying Programs</p><p class="depth0">a. Test Preparation</p><p class="depth0">Certification for Type II, Type III and Universal technicians will be dependent upon passage of a closed-book, proctored test, administered in a secure environment, by an EPA-approved certifying program.</p><p class="depth0">Certification for Type I technicians will be dependent upon passage of an EPA-approved test, provided by an EPA-approved certifying program. Organizations providing Type I certification only, may chose either an on-site format, or a mail-in format, similar to what is permitted under the MVACs program.</p><p class="depth0">Each certifying program must assemble tests by choosing a prescribed subset from the EPA test bank. EPA expects to have a test bank with a minimum of 500 questions, which will enable the certifying program to generate multiple tests in order to discourage cheating. Each test must include 25 questions drawn from Group 1 and 25 questions drawn from each relevant technical Group. Tests for Universal technicians will include 100 questions (25 from Group 1 and 25 from each relevant technical Group). Each 50-question test represents 10 percent of the total test bank. Questions should be divided in order to sufficiently cover each topic within the Group.</p><p class="depth0">Each certifying program must show a method of randomly choosing which questions will be on the tests. Multiple versions of the test must be used during each testing event. Test answer sheets or (for those testing via the computer medium) computer files must include the name and address of the applicant, the name and address of the certifying program, and the date and location at which the test was administered.</p><p class="depth0">Training material accompanying mail-in Type I tests must not include sample test questions mimicking the language of the certification test. All mail-in material will be subject to review by EPA.</p><p class="depth0">Certifying programs may charge individuals reasonable fees for the administration of the tests. EPA will publish a list of all approved certifying programs periodically, including the fees charged by the programs. This information will be available from the Stratospheric Ozone Protection Hotline.</p><p class="depth0">b. Proctoring</p><p class="depth0">A certifying program for Type II, Type III and Universal technicians must designate or

arrange for the designation of at least one proctor registered for each testing event. If more than 50 people are taking tests at the same time at a given site, the certifying organization must adhere to normal testing procedures, by designating at least one additional proctor or monitor for every 50 people taking tests at that site.</p><p class="depth0">The certification test for Type II, Type III and Universal technicians is a closed-book exam. The proctors must ensure that the applicants for certification do not use any notes or training materials during testing. Desks or work space must be placed in a way that discourages cheating. The space and physical facilities are to be conducive to continuous surveillance by the proctors and monitors during testing.</p><p class="depth0">The proctor may not receive any benefit from the outcome of the testing other than a fee for proctoring. Proctors cannot know in advance which questions are on the tests they are proctoring.</p><p class="depth0">Proctors are required to verify the identity of individuals taking the test by examining photo identification. Acceptable forms of identification include but are not limited to drivers' licenses, government identification cards, passports, and military identification.</p><p class="depth0">Certifying programs for Type I technicians using the mail-in format, must take sufficient measures at the test site to ensure that tests are completed honestly by each technician. Each test for Type I certification must provide a means of verifying the identification of the individual taking the test. Acceptable forms of identification include but are not limited to drivers' licenses numbers, social security numbers, and passport numbers.</p><p class="depth0">c. Test Security</p><p class="depth0">A certifying program must demonstrate the ability to ensure the confidentiality and security of the test questions and answer keys through strict accountability procedures. An organization interested in developing a technician certification program will be required to describe these test security procedures to EPA.</p><p class="depth0">After the completion of a test, proctors must collect all test forms, answer sheets, scratch paper and notes. These items are to be placed in a sealed envelope.</p><p class="depth0">d. Test Content</p><p class="depth0">All technician certification tests will include 25 questions from Group I. Group I will ask questions in the following areas:</p><p class="depth0">I. Environmental impact of CFCs and HCFCs</p><p class="depth0">II. Laws and regulations</p><p class="depth0">III. Changing industry outlook</p><p class="depth0">Type I, Type II and Type III certification tests will include 25 questions from Group II. Group II will ask questions covering sector-specific issues in the following areas:</p><p class="depth0">IV. Leak detection</p><p class="depth0">V. Recovery Techniques</p><p class="depth0">VI. Safety</p><p class="depth0">VII. Shipping</p><p class="depth0">VII. Disposal</p><p class="depth0">Universal Certification will include 75 questions from Group II, with 25 from each of the three sector-specific areas.</p><p class="depth0">e. Grading</p><p class="depth0">Tests must be graded objectively. Certifying programs must inform the applicant of their test results no later than 30 days from the date of the test. Type I certifying programs using the mail-in format, must notify the applicants of their test results no later than 30 days from the date the certifying programs received the completed test and any required documentation. Certifying programs may mail or hand deliver the results.</p><p class="depth0">The passing score for the closed-book Type I, Type II, Type III and Universal certification test is 70 percent. For Type I certification tests using the mail-in format, passing score is 84 percent.</p><p class="depth0">f. Proof of Certification</p><p class="depth0">Certifying programs must issue a standard wallet-sized identification card no later than 30 days from the date of the test. Type I certifying programs using mail-in formats must issue cards to certified technicians no later than 30 days from the date the certifying program receives the completed test and any required documentation.</p><p class="depth0">Each wallet-sized identification card must include, at a minimum, the name of the certifying program including the date the certifying program received EPA approval, the name of the person certified, the type of certification, a unique number for the certified person and the following text:</p><p class="depth0">[name of person] has been certified as [Type I, Type II, Type III and/or Universal--as appropriate] technician as required by 40 CFR part 82, subpart F.</p><p class="depth0">g. Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements</p><p class="depth0">1. Certifying programs must maintain records that include, but are not limited to, the names and addresses of all individuals taking the tests, the scores of all certification tests administered, and the dates and locations of all testing administered.</p><p class="depth0">2. EPA must receive an activity report from all approved certifying programs by every January 30 and June 30, the first to be submitted following the first full six-month period for which the program has been approved by EPA. This report will include the pass/fail rate and testing schedules. This will allow the Agency to determine the relative progress and success of these programs. If

the certifying program believes a test bank question needs to be modified, information about that question should also be included.</p><p class="depth0">3. Approved certifying programs will receive a letter of approval from EPA. Each testing center must display a copy of that letter at their place of business.</p><p class="depth0">4. Approved technician certification programs that voluntarily plan to stop providing the certification test must forward all records required by this appendix, Sec. Sec. 82.161, and 82.166 to another program currently approved by EPA in accordance with this appendix and with Sec. 82.161. Approved technician certification programs that receive records of certified technicians from a program that no longer offers the certification test must inform EPA in writing at the address listed in Sec. 82.160 within 30 days of receiving these records. The notification notice must include the name and address of the program to which the records have been transferred. If another currently approved program willing to accept the records cannot be located, these records must be submitted to EPA at the address listed at Sec. 82.160.</p><p class="depth0">5. Technician certification programs that have had their certification revoked in accordance with Sec. 82.169 must forward all records required by this appendix, Sec. Sec. 82.161, and 82.166 to EPA at the address listed in Sec. 82.160.</p><p class="depth0">h. Additional Requirements</p><p class="depth0">EPA will periodically inspect testing sites to ensure compliance with EPA regulations. If testing center discrepancies are found, they must be corrected within a specified time period. If discrepancies are not corrected, EPA may suspend or revoke the certifying programs's approval. The inspections will include but are not limited to a review of the certifying programs' provisions for test security, the availability of space and facilities to conduct the administrative requirements and ensure the security of the tests, the availability of adequate testing facilities and spacing of the applicants during testing, a review of the proper procedures regarding accountability, and that there is no evidence of misconduct on the part of the certifying programs, their representatives and proctors, or the applicants for certification.</p><p class="depth0">If the certifying programs offer training or provide review materials to the applicants, these endeavors are to be considered completely separate from the administration of the certification test.</p><p class="depth0">i. Approval Process</p><p class="depth0">EPA anticipates receiving a large number of applications from organizations seeking to become certifying programs. In order to certify as many technicians as possible in a reasonable amount of time, EPA will give priority to national programs. Below are the guidelines EPA will use:</p><p class="depth0">First: Certifying programs providing at least 25 testing centers with a minimum of one site in at least 8 different states will be considered.</p><p class="depth0">Second: Certifying programs forming regional networks with a minimum of 10 testing centers will be considered.</p><p class="depth0">Third: Certifying programs providing testing centers in geographically isolated areas not sufficiently covered by the national or regional programs will be considered.</p><p class="depth0">Fourth: All other programs applying for EPA approval will be considered.</p><p class="depth0">Sample application forms may be obtained by contacting the Stratopheric Ozone Hotline at 1-800-296-1996.</p><p class="depth0">j. Grandfathering</p><p class="depth0">EPA will grandfather technicians who successfully completed voluntary programs whose operators seek and receive EPA approval to grandfather these technicians, in accordance with Sec. 82.161(g). As part of this process, these certifying programs may be required to send EPA-approved supplementary information to ensure the level of the technicians' knowledge. Technicians will be required to read this supplementary information as a condition of certification. The certifying programs will also issue new identification cards meeting the requirements specified above.</p><p class="depth0">k. Sample Application</p><p class="depth0">EPA has provided a sample application. The Agency designed the application to demonstrate the information certifying programs must provide to EPA. Programs are not required to use this form or this format.
