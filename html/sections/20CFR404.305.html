These circumstances are--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Waiver of benefits. If you have waived benefits and been granted a tax exemption on religious grounds as described in Secs. 404.1039 and 404.1075, no one may become entitled to any benefits or payments on your earnings record and

you may not be entitled to benefits on anyone else's earnings record; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Person's death caused by an intentional act. You may not become entitled to or continue to receive any survivor's benefits or payments on the earnings record of any person, or receive any underpayment due a person, if you were convicted of a felony or an act in the nature of a felony of intentionally causing that person's death. If you were subject to the juvenile justice system, you may not become entitled to or continue to receive survivor's benefits or payments on the earnings record of any person, or receive any underpayment due a person, if you were found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have intentionally caused that person's death by committing an act which, if committed by an adult, would have been considered a felony or an act in the nature of a felony.
