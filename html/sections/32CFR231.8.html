                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General policy. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Credit union services to authorized persons  and organizations may be provided by domestic on-base credit unions  operating under a geographic franchise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The extension of credit union service overseas is encouraged  consistent with the principles prescribed for domestic credit unions and  with applicable status of forces agreements or other intergovernmental  agreements, or host-country law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where permitted by the status of forces agreements or other  intergovernmental agreements, or host-country law, only federal credit  unions or federally insured state chartered credit unions may operate on  overseas DoD installations. The ultimate decision to provide services  overseas rests with the credit union itself.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Establishment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Commanders shall notify the Secretary of the  Military Department concerned (or designee), through command channels,  when overseas credit union services are needed. Such requests shall  include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Full information about available space and logistical support.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The name and location of the nearest credit union facility or  branch.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The distance between the installation and the nearest credit  union facility or branch.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The availability of any official or public transportation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The number of DoD personnel in duty assignments that confine  them to the installation or who cannot obtain transportation (such as  hospital patients).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> In countries not presently served, a statement concurred in by  the cognizant Combatant Command that the requirement has been  coordinated with the U.S. Chief of Diplomatic Mission or U.S. Embassy.  The statement shall include that the host country will permit credit  union operations and will indicate any conditions imposed by the host  country with respect to those operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subsequent to approval of the request from the installation or  community commander to establish an overseas credit union facility, the  Secretary of the Military Department concerned (or designee) shall  solicit proposals for the provision of full credit union services under  the following provisions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where there is a DoD designated geographic franchise with a  specific field of membership, the Secretary of the Military Department  (or designee)   shall direct the installation or community commander to contact the  supporting credit union and request that a branch or facility be  established. The basic decision concerning such extensions of service  rests with the servicing credit union. The Director, DFAS (or designee)  shall maintain a listing of all geographic franchises assigned to credit  unions serving DoD overseas installations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where there is no DoD designated geographic franchise, the  Secretary of the Military Department (or designee) shall:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Coordinate requests, through the Director, DFAS (or designee),  to obtain a geographic franchise. A geographic franchise is the  authorization granted to a credit union by the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) to provide financial  services in a specific geographic region located outside the United  States, its territories and possessions.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Solicit proposals from credit unions currently operating on DoD  installations.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Review proposals of interested credit unions.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Coordinate with field commands, as needed.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Recommend selection to the NCUA or applicable state regulatory  agency with a copy to the DFAS and the OUSD(C), requesting that the  appropriate field of membership adjustment be made. Such a  recommendation shall identify the primary installations on which the  credit union would operate and, if applicable, the contiguous geographic  boundaries for future facilities and branches.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where there is an existing field of membership, the Secretary of  the Military Department concerned (or designee) shall take the following  actions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a credit union on an installation terminates operation,  afford any other credit union having a geographic franchise within that  country an opportunity to assume the franchise being vacated. If all  such institutions decline, the geographic franchise shall be offered to  the federally insured credit union community. If, as a result of a  credit union decision to decline service to an installation or a  termination action, another credit union:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Offers to provide service.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Meets host country requirements (if any) and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Is assigned the former geographic franchise or portion thereof,  the NCUA or the applicable state regulatory agency shall be notified and  requested to make appropriate field of membership adjustments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this section apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No commitment may be made to a credit union regarding its  proposal until the appropriate regulatory agency has announced a  selection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Logistical support. Installation or community commanders shall  provide logistical credit union support. Such support normally shall  include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adequate office space, including steel bars; grillwork; security  doors; a vault, safes or both; security alarm systems and camera  surveillance equipment (where deemed necessary) that meet documented  requirements of the credit union's insurance carrier; construction of  counters, teller cages, and customer and work areas; necessary  modifications and alterations to existing buildings. The size and  arrangement of space should permit efficient operations. The credit  union shall pay for all improvements to the space given. Space assigned  may not exceed that prescribed in DoD 4270.1-M.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> DoD housing on a rental basis to key credit union personnel  unable to find suitable, reasonably priced housing in the vicinity of  the DoD installation, if available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Education, on a space-available, tuition-paying basis, provided  by the Department of Defense Education Activity to minor dependents of  assigned staff in accordance with DoD Directive 1342.13.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Utilities (i.e., electricity, natural gas or fuel oil, water and  sewage), heating, intrastation telephone service, and custodial and  janitorial services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> DSN voice and data communication to include, where feasible,  internet access.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> U.S. Military Postal Service support under DoD Directive 4525.6.  The use of free intra-theater delivery system (IDS) is authorized for  all routine mail sent and received between Army Post Offices (APOs) and  Fleet Post Offices (FPOs) within a theater.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Military guards, civilian guards (for use within the  installation), military police, or other protective services to  accompany shipments of money from the MBF to the credit union and return  where it is impractical or not authorized to have a local armored car  service or civilian police authorities entering a military installation  to provide cash escort service or when the cost of obtaining such  service is prohibitive. This level of protective service also shall be  provided at other times as required to include replenishment of ATM  currency and receipts, alarm system failures, and to avoid undue risks  or insurance costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Travel. Travel by credit union officials must be at no expense  to the U.S. Government. Overseas commanders may issue invitational  travel orders for official on-base visits by credit union officials at  no cost to the U.S. Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Operations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An overseas credit union shall confine its field  of membership to individuals or organizations eligible by law or  regulation to receive services and benefits from the installation.  Services shall not be provided to those personnel precluded such  services by the applicable status of forces agreement, other  intergovernmental agreements, or host-country law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Department assigns overseas credit unions a prescribed  geographic franchise. Any credit union, however, may continue to serve  its members stationed overseas by mail or telecommunications, to include  access to the Internet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A credit union proposing a new service to be offered by a branch  office that is not authorized by the operating agreement shall  coordinate the establishment of the new service through the cognizant  Component command to the Combatant Command. The new service shall be  offered only after the appropriate command's approval and coordination  with the U.S. Chief of Diplomatic Mission or U.S. Embassy to ensure that  the service does not conflict with the applicable status of forces  agreement, other intergovernmental agreements, or host-country law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Credit unions that operate full service branches shall have U.S.  currency and coin available for member transactions. In areas served by  currency custody accounts, transactional U. S. currency and coins shall  be made available from the servicing MBF with no direct or analysis  charge to the credit union, provided settlement is made via the local  MBF account or equivalent arrangements are made with the MBF.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In countries served by MBFs operated under contract, credit  unions shall purchase foreign currency only from the servicing MBF.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The bulk rate purchase price shall apply to currency used by the  credit union to make payments to vendors or to make payroll payments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Credit unions that desire and are authorized to provide  accommodation exchange services to its members shall acquire foreign  currency from the servicing MBF at the MBF wholesale rate and sell it at  a rate of exchange no more favorable than that available to customers of  the MBF.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Credit unions operating under a geographic franchise on an  overseas DoD installation shall not publicize, display or sell vehicles  on the installation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The NCUA or applicable state regulatory agency may review  operations of overseas credit union offices either when it examines the  main credit union or at other times of its choosing. For federally  insured, state chartered credit unions, the applicable state regulatory  agency also may examine credit unions operations.</p>
