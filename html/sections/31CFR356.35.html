                            <p class="depth0">The Office of Management and Budget approved the collections of information contained in Sec. Sec. 356.11, 356.12, 356.13, 356.14, and 356.15 and in appendix A of this part under control number 1535-0112.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 356--Bidder Categories</p><p class="depth0">I. Categories of Eligible Bidders</p><p class="depth0">We describe below various categories of bidders eligible to bid in Treasury auctions. You may use them to determine whether we consider you and other persons or entities to be one bidder or more than one bidder for auction bidding and compliance purposes. For example, we use these definitions to apply the competitive and noncompetitive award limitations and for other requirements. Notwithstanding these definitions, we consider any persons or entities that intentionally act together with respect to bidding in a Treasury auction to collectively be one bidder. Even if an auction participant does not fall under any of the categories listed below, it is our intent that no auction participant receives a larger auction award by acquiring securities through others than it could have received had it been considered one of these types of bidders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Corporation--We consider a corporation to be one bidder. A corporation includes all of its affiliates, which may be persons, partnerships, or other entities. We consider a business trust, such as a Massachusetts or Delaware business trust, to be a corporation. We use the term ``corporate structure'' to refer to the collection of affiliates that we consider collectively to be one bidder. An affiliate is any:</p><p class="depth0">Entity that is more than 50-percent owned, directly or indirectly, by the corporation;</p><p class="depth0">Entity that is more than 50-percent owned, directly or indirectly, by any other affiliate of the corporation;</p><p class="depth0">Person or entity that owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent of the corporation;</p><p class="depth0">Person or entity that owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent of any other affiliate of the corporation; or</p><p class="depth0">Entity, a majority of whose board of directors or a majority of whose general partners are directors or officers of the corporation, or of any affiliate of the corporation.</p><p class="depth0">An entity that is more than 50-percent owned as described in this definition is not an affiliate, however, if:</p><p class="depth0">The purpose of such ownership is to seek a return on investment and not to engage in the business of the entity;</p><p class="depth0">The owner does not routinely exercise operational or management control over the entity;</p><p class="depth0">The owner does not exercise any control over investment decisions of the entity regarding U.S. Treasury securities;</p><p class="depth0">The corporation has written policies or procedures, including ongoing compliance monitoring processes, that are designed to prevent it from acting together with the entity regarding participation in Treasury auctions or investment strategies regarding Treasury securities being auctioned; and</p><p class="depth0">The corporation submits notice and certification to us, as provided in this appendix A.</p><p class="depth0">A corporation that plans to make use of this exception to the definition of ``affiliate'' must inform us of this fact in writing and provide the following certification:</p><p class="depth0">[Name of corporation] hereby certifies that, with regard to any entity of which it owns more than 50 percent as defined in appendix A to 31 CFR part 356, but for which the purpose of such ownership is to seek a return on investment and not to engage in the business of the entity:</p><p class="depth0">We do not routinely exercise operational or management control over the entity;</p><p class="depth0">We do not exercise any control over investment decisions of the entity regarding U.S. Treasury securities;</p><p class="depth0">We have written policies or procedures, including ongoing compliance monitoring processes, that are designed to prevent the corporation from acting together with the entity regarding participation in Treasury auctions or investment strategies regarding Treasury securities being auctioned; and</p><p class="depth0">We will continue to meet the terms of this certification until we notify the Treasury of a change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Partnership--We consider a partnership to be one bidder if it is a partnership for which the Internal Revenue Service has assigned a tax-identification number. A partnership includes all of its affiliates, which

may be persons, corporations, general partners acting on behalf of the partnership, or other entities. We use the term ``partnership structure'' to refer to the collection of affiliates that we consider collectively to be one bidder. We may consider a partnership structure that contains one or more corporations as a ``partnership'' or a ``corporation,'' but not both.</p><p class="depth0">An affiliate is any:</p><p class="depth0">Entity that is more than 50-percent owned, directly or indirectly, by the partnership;</p><p class="depth0">Entity that is more than 50-percent owned, directly or indirectly, by any other affiliate of the partnership;</p><p class="depth0">Person or entity that owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent of the partnership;</p><p class="depth0">Person or entity that owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent of any other affiliate of the partnership; or</p><p class="depth0">Entity, a majority of whose general partners or a majority of whose board of directors are general partners or directors of the partnership or of any affiliate of the partnership.</p><p class="depth0">An entity that is more than 50-percent owned as described in this definition is not an affiliate, however, if:</p><p class="depth0">The purpose of such ownership is to seek a return on investment and not to engage in the business of the entity;</p><p class="depth0">The owner does not routinely exercise operational or management control over the entity;</p><p class="depth0">The owner does not exercise any control over investment decisions of the entity regarding U.S. Treasury securities;</p><p class="depth0">The partnership has written policies or procedures, including ongoing compliance monitoring processes, that are designed to prevent it from acting together with the entity regarding participation in Treasury auctions or investment strategies regarding Treasury securities being auctioned; and</p><p class="depth0">The partnership submits notice and certification to us, as provided in this appendix A.</p><p class="depth0">A partnership that plans to make use of this exception to the definition of ``affiliate'' must inform us of this fact in writing and provide the following certification:</p><p class="depth0">[Name of partnership] hereby certifies that, with regard to any entity of which it owns more than 50 percent as defined in appendix A to 31 CFR part 356, but for which the purpose of such ownership is to seek a return on investment and not to engage in the business of the entity:</p><p class="depth0">We do not routinely exercise operational or management control over the entity;</p><p class="depth0">We do not exercise any control over investment decisions of the entity regarding U.S. Treasury securities;</p><p class="depth0">We have written policies or procedures, including ongoing compliance monitoring processes, that are designed to prevent the partnership from acting together with the entity regarding participation in Treasury auctions or investment strategies regarding Treasury securities being auctioned; and</p><p class="depth0">We will continue to meet the terms of this certification until we notify the Treasury of a change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Government-related entity--We consider each of the following entities to be one bidder:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A state government or the government of the District of Columbia</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A unit of local government, including any county, city, municipality, or township, or other unit of general government as defined by the Bureau of the Census for statistical purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A governmental entity, body, or corporation established under Federal, State, or local law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A foreign central bank, the government of a foreign state, or an international organization in which the United States holds membership. This type of entity applies only when such entity is not using an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (See paragraph (f).).</p><p class="depth0">We generally consider an investment, reserve, or other fund of one of the above government-related entities as part of that entity and not a separate bidder. We will consider a government-related entity's fund to be a separate bidder if it meets the definition of the ``trust or other fiduciary estate'' category, or if applicable law requires that the investments of such fund be made separately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Trust or other fiduciary estate--We consider a legal entity created under a valid trust instrument, court order, or other legal authority that designates a trustee or fiduciary to act for the benefit of a named beneficiary to be one bidder. The following conditions must also be met for us to consider a trust entity to be one bidder:</p><p class="depth0">The legal entity must be able to be identified by:</p><p class="depth0">1. The name or title of the trustee or fiduciary;</p><p class="depth0">2. Specific reference to the trust instrument, court order, or legal authority under which the trustee or fiduciary is acting; and</p><p class="depth0">3. The unique IRS-assigned employer identification number (not social security number) for the entity.</p><p class="depth0">The trustee or fiduciary must make the decisions on participating in auctions on behalf of the trust or fiduciary estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Individual--We consider a person to be one bidder, regardless of whether he or she is acting as an individual, a sole proprietor, or for any entity not otherwise defined as a bidder. If a person meets the definition of an affiliate within a corporate or partnership

structure, we will consider him or her to be a bidder in this ``individual'' category if the corporation or partnership is not bidding in the same auction. We do not consider a person acting in an official capacity as an employee or other representative of a bidder defined in any other category to be an ``individual'' bidder. We consider a person, his or her spouse, and any children under the age of 21 having a common household to be one ``individual'' bidder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Foreign and International Monetary Authority (``FIMA'')--We consider one or more parties making up a foreign or international monetary organization that is not private in nature to be a bidder called a FIMA entity if at least one of the parties is a foreign or international entity that is (i) financial in nature, or (ii) not financial in nature but is authorized to open an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. We consider each of the following entities to be a single FIMA entity:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A foreign central bank or regional central bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A foreign governmental monetary or finance entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A non-governmental international financial organization that is not private in nature (for example, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A non-financial international organization that the United States participates in (for example, the United Nations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A multi-party arrangement of a governmental ministry and/or a foreign central bank or monetary authority with a United States Government Department and/or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A foreign or international monetary entity or an entity authorized by statute or by us to open accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Other Bidder--We do not consider a bidder defined by any of the above categories to be a bidder in this category. For purposes of this definition, ``other bidder'' means an institution or organization with a unique IRS-assigned employer identification number. This definition includes such entities as an association, church, university, union, or club. This category does not include any person or entity acting in a fiduciary or investment management capacity, a sole proprietorship, an investment account, an investment fund, a form of registration, or investment ownership designation.</p><p class="depth0">II. How To Obtain Separate Bidder Recognition</p><p class="depth0">Under certain circumstances, we may recognize a major organizational component (e.g., the parent or a subsidiary) in a corporate or partnership structure as a bidder separate from the larger corporate or partnership structure. We also may recognize two or more major organizational components collectively as one bidder. All of the following criteria must be met for such component(s) to qualify for recognition as a separate bidder:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Such component(s) must be prohibited by law or regulation from exchanging, or must have established written internal procedures designed to prevent the exchange of, information related to bidding in Treasury auctions with any other component in the corporate or partnership structure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Such component(s) must not be created for the purpose of circumventing our bidding and award limitations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Decisions related to purchasing Treasury securities at auction and participation in specific auctions must be made by employees of such component(s). Employees of such component(s) that make decisions to purchase or dispose of Treasury securities must not perform the same function for other components within the corporate or partnership structure; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The records of such component(s) related to the bidding for, acquisition of, and disposition of Treasury securities must be maintained by such component(s). Those records must be identifiable--separate and apart from similar records for other components within the corporate or partnership structure. To obtain recognition as a separate bidder, each component or group of components must request such recognition from us, provide a description of the component or group and its position within the corporate or partnership structure, and provide the following certification:</p><p class="depth0">[Name of the bidder] hereby certifies that to the best of its knowledge and belief it meets the criteria for a separate bidder as described in appendix A to 31 CFR part 356. The above-named bidder also certifies that it has established written policies or procedures, including ongoing compliance monitoring processes, that are designed to prevent the component or group of components from:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Exchanging any of the following information with any other part of the corporate [partnership] structure: (a) Yields, discount rates, or discount margins at which it plans to bid; (b) amounts of securities for which it plans to bid; (c) positions that it holds or plans to acquire in a security being auctioned; and (d) investment strategies that it plans to follow regarding the security being auctioned, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In any way intentionally acting together with any other part of the corporate [partnership] structure with respect to formulating or entering bids in a Treasury auction.</p><p class="depth0">The above-named bidder agrees that it will promptly notify the Department in writing

when any of the information provided to obtain separate bidder status changes or when this certification is no longer valid.

In some of the following examples, we use intermediate rounding for ease in following the calculations. In actual practice, we generally do not round prior to determining the final result.</p><p class="depth0">If you use a multi-decimal calculator, we recommend setting your calculator to at least 13 decimals and then applying normal rounding procedures. This should be sufficient to obtain the same final results. However, in the case of any discrepancies, our determinations will be final.</p><p class="depth0">I. Computation of Interest on Treasury Bonds and Notes</p><p class="depth0">A. Treasury Non-indexed Securities</p><p class="depth0">1. Regular Half-Year Payment Period. We pay interest on marketable Treasury non-indexed securities on a semiannual basis. The regular interest payment period is a full half-year of six calendar months. Examples of half-year periods are: (1) February 15 to August 15, (2) May 31 to November 30, and (3) February 29 to August 31 (in a leap year). Calculation of an interest payment for a non-indexed note with a par amount of $1,000 and an interest rate of 8% is made in this manner: ($1,000 x .08)/2 = $40. Specifically, a semiannual interest payment represents one half of one year's interest, and is computed on this basis regardless of the actual number of days in the half-year.</p><p class="depth0">2. Daily Interest Decimal. We compute a daily interest decimal in cases where an interest payment period for a non-indexed security is shorter or longer than six months or where accrued interest is payable by an investor. We base the daily interest decimal on the actual number of calendar days in the half-year or half-years involved. The number of days in any half-year period is shown in Table 1.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Beginning and ending days are   Beginning and ending days are</p><p class="depth0">1st or 15th of the months      the last days of the months</p><p class="depth0">listed under interest period    listed under interest period</p><p class="depth0">Interest period                         (number of days)                (number of days)</p><p class="depth0">---------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Regular year      Leap year     Regular year      Leap year----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------January to July.................................             181             182             181             182February to August..............................             181             182             184             184March to September..............................             184             184             183             183April to October................................             183             183             184             184May to November.................................             184             184             183             183June to December................................             183             183             184             184July to January.................................             184             184             184             184August to February..............................             184             184             181             182September to March..............................             181             182             182             183October to April................................             182             183             181             182November to May.................................             181             182             182             183December to June................................             182             183             181             182----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Table 2 below shows the daily interest decimals covering interest from \1/8\% to 20% on $1,000 for one day in increments of \1/8\ of one percent.

Short First Payment Period. In cases where the first interest payment period for a Treasury non-indexed security covers less than a full half-year period (a ``short coupon''), we multiply the daily interest decimal by the number of days from, but not including, the issue date to, and including, the first interest payment date. This calculation results in the amount of the interest payable per $1,000 par amount. In cases where the par amount of securities is a multiple of $1,000, we multiply the appropriate multiple by the unrounded interest payment amount per $1,000 par amount.</p><p class="depth0">Example</p><p class="depth0">A 2-year note paying 8\3/8\% interest was issued on July 2, 1990, with the first interest payment on December 31, 1990. The number of days in the full half-year period of June 30 to December 31, 1990, was 184 (See Table 1.). The number of days for which interest actually accrued was 182 (not including July 2, but including December 31). The daily interest decimal, $0.227581522 (See Table 2, line for 8\3/8\%, under the column for half-year of 184 days.), was multiplied by 182, resulting in a payment of $41.419837004 per $1,000. For $20,000 of these notes, $41.419837004 would be multiplied by 20, resulting in a payment of $828.39674008 ($828.40).</p><p class="depth0">4. Long First Payment Period. In cases where the first interest payment period for a bond or note covers more than a full half-year period (a ``long coupon''), we multiply the daily interest decimal by the number of days from, but not including, the issue date to, and including, the last day of the fractional period that ends one full half-year before the interest payment date. We add that amount to the regular interest amount for the full half-year ending on the first interest payment date, resulting in the amount of interest payable for $1,000 par amount. In cases where the par amount of securities is a multiple of $1,000, the appropriate multiple should be applied to the unrounded interest payment amount per $1,000 par amount.</p><p class="depth0">Example</p><p class="depth0">A 5-year 2-month note paying 7\7/8\% interest was issued on December 3, 1990, with the first interest payment due on August 15, 1991. Interest for the regular half-year portion of the payment was computed to be $39.375 per $1,000 par amount. The fractional portion of the payment, from December 3 to February 15, fell in a 184-day half-year (August 15, 1990, to February 15, 1991). Accordingly, the daily interest decimal for 7\7/8\% was $0.213994565. This decimal, multiplied by 74 (the number of days from but not including December 3, 1990, to and including February 15), resulted in interest for the fractional portion of $15.835597810. When added to $39.375 (the normal interest payment portion ending on August 15, 1991), this produced a first interest payment of $55.210597810, or $55.21 per $1,000 par amount. For $7,000 par amount of these notes, $55.210597810 would be multiplied by 7, resulting in an interest payment of $386.474184670 ($386.47).</p><p class="depth0">B. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities</p><p class="depth0">1. Indexing Process. We pay interest on marketable Treasury inflation-protected securities on a semiannual basis. We issue inflation-protected securities with a stated rate of interest that remains constant until maturity. Interest payments are based on the security's inflation-adjusted principal at the time we pay interest. We make this adjustment by multiplying the par amount of the security by the applicable Index Ratio.</p><p class="depth0">2. Index Ratio. The numerator of the Index Ratio, the Ref CPIDate, is the index number applicable for a specific day. The denominator of the Index Ratio is the Ref CPI applicable for the original issue date. However, when the dated date is different from the original issue date, the denominator is the Ref CPI applicable for the dated date. The formula for calculating the Index Ratio is:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28JY04.000
Where Date = valuation date</p><p class="depth0">3. Reference CPI. The Ref CPI for the first day of any calendar month is the CPI for the third preceding calendar month. For example, the Ref CPI applicable to April 1 in any year is the CPI for January, which is reported in February. We determine the Ref CPI for any other day of a month by a linear interpolation between the Ref CPI applicable to the first day of the month in which the day falls (in the example, January) and the Ref CPI applicable to the first day of the next month (in the example, February). For interpolation purposes, we truncate calculations with regard to the Ref CPI and the Index Ratio for a specific date to six decimal places, and round to five decimal places.</p><p class="depth0">Therefore the Ref CPI and the Index Ratio for a particular date will be expressed to five decimal places.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The formula for the Ref CPI for a specific date is:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28JY04.001</p><p class="depth0">Where Date = valuation date

Index Contingencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a previously reported CPI is revised, we will continue to use the previously reported (unrevised) CPI in calculating the principal value and interest payments.</p><p class="depth0">If the CPI is rebased to a different year, we will continue to use the CPI based on the base reference period in effect when the security was first issued, as long as that CPI continues to be published.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> We will replace the CPI with an appropriate alternative index if, while an inflation-protected security is outstanding, the applicable CPI is:</p><p class="depth0">Discontinued,</p><p class="depth0">In the judgment of the Secretary, fundamentally altered in a manner materially adverse to the interests of an investor in the security, or</p><p class="depth0">In the judgment of the Secretary, altered by legislation or Executive Order in a manner materially adverse to the interests of an investor in the security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If we decide to substitute an alternative index we will consult with the Bureau of Labor Statistics or any successor agency. We will then notify the public of the substitute index and how we will apply it. Determinations of the Secretary in this regard will be final.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the CPI for a particular month is not reported by the last day of the following month, we will announce an index number based on the last available twelve-month change in the CPI. We will base our calculations of our payment obligations that rely on that month's CPI on the index number we announce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For example, if the CPI for month M is not reported timely, the formula for calculating the index number to be used is:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28JY04.004</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Generalizing for the last reported CPI issued N months prior to month M:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28JY04.005</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If it is necessary to use these formulas to calculate an index number, we will use that number for all subsequent calculations that rely on the month's index number. We will not replace it with the actual CPI when it is reported, except for use in the above formulas. If it becomes necessary to use the above formulas to derive an index number, we will use the last CPI that has been reported to calculate CPI numbers for months for which the CPI has not been reported timely.</p><p class="depth0">5. Computation of Interest for a Regular Half-Year Payment Period. Interest on marketable Treasury inflation-protected securities is payable on a semiannual basis. The regular interest payment period is a full half-year or six calendar months. Examples of half-year periods are January 15 to July 15, and April 15 to October 15. An interest payment will be a fixed percentage of the value of the inflation-adjusted principal, in current dollars, for the date on which it is paid. We will calculate interest payments by multiplying one-half of the specified annual interest rate for the inflation-protected securities by the inflation-adjusted principal for the interest payment date.</p><p class="depth0">Specifically, we compute a semiannual interest payment on the basis of one-half of one year's interest regardless of the actual number of days in the half-year.</p><p class="depth0">Example</p><p class="depth0">A 10-year inflation-protected note paying 3\7/8%\ interest was issued on January 15, 1999, with the first interest payment on July 15, 1999. The Ref CPI on January 15, 1999 (Ref CPIIssueDate) was 164, and the Ref CPI on July 15, 1999 (Ref CPIDate) was 166.2. For a par amount of $100,000, the inflation-adjusted principal on July 15, 1999, was (166.2/164) x $100,000, or $101,341. This amount was multiplied by .03875/2, or .019375, resulting in a payment of $1,963.48.</p><p class="depth0">C. Treasury Floating Rate Notes</p><p class="depth0">1. Indexing and Interest Payment Process. We issue floating rate notes with a daily interest accrual feature. This means that the interest rate ``floats'' based on changes in the representative index rate. We pay interest on a quarterly basis. The index rate is the High Rate of the 13-week Treasury bill auction announced on the auction results press release that has been converted into a simple-interest money market yield computed on an actual/360 basis and rounded to nine decimal places. Interest payments are based on the floating rate note's variable interest rate from, and including, the dated date or last interest payment date to, but excluding, the next interest payment or maturity date. We make quarterly interest payments by accruing the daily interest amounts and adding those amounts together for the interest payment period.</p><p class="depth0">2. Interest Rate. The interest rate on floating rate notes will be the spread plus the index rate (as it may be adjusted on the calendar day following each auction of 13-week bills).</p><p class="depth0">3. Interest Accrual. In general, accrued interest for a particular calendar day in an accrual period is calculated by using the index rate from the most recent auction of 13-week bills that took place before the accrual day, plus the spread determined at the time of a new floating rate note auction, divided by 360, subject to a zero-percent minimum daily interest accrual rate. However, a 13-week bill auction that takes place in the two-business-day period prior to a settlement date or interest payment date will be excluded from the calculation of accrued interest for purposes of the settlement amount or interest payment. Any changes in the index rate that would otherwise have occurred during this two-business-day period will occur on the first calendar day following the end of the period.</p><p class="depth0">4. Index Contingencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If Treasury were to discontinue auctions of 13-week bills, the Secretary has authority to determine and announce a new index for outstanding floating rate notes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If Treasury were to not conduct a 13-week bill auction in a particular week, then the interest rate in effect for the notes at the time of the last 13-week bill auction results announcement will remain in effect until such time, if any, as the results of a 13-week Treasury auction are again announced by Treasury. Treasury reserves the right to change the index rate for any newly issued floating rate note.</p><p class="depth0">D. Accrued Interest</p><p class="depth0">1. You will have to pay accrued interest on a Treasury bond or note when interest accrues prior to the issue date of the security. Because you receive a full interest payment despite having held the security for only a portion of the interest payment period, you must compensate us through the payment of accrued interest at settlement.</p><p class="depth0">2. For a Treasury non-indexed security, if accrued interest covers a fractional portion of a full half-year period, the number of days in the full half-year period and the stated interest rate will determine the daily interest decimal to use in computing the accrued interest. We multiply the decimal by the number of days for which interest has accrued.</p><p class="depth0">3. If a reopened bond or note has a long first interest payment period (a ``long coupon''), and the dated date for the reopened issue is less than six full months before the first interest payment, the accrued interest will fall into two separate half-year periods. A separate daily interest decimal must be multiplied by the respective number of days in each half-year period during which interest has accrued.</p><p class="depth0">4. We round all accrued interest computations to five decimal places for a $1,000 par amount, using normal rounding procedures. We calculate accrued interest for a par amount of securities greater than $1,000 by applying the appropriate multiple to accrued interest payable for a $1,000 par amount, rounded to five decimal places. We calculate accrued interest for a par amount of securities less than $1,000 by applying the appropriate fraction to accrued interest payable for a $1,000 par amount, rounded to five decimal places.</p><p class="depth0">5. For an inflation-protected security, we calculate accrued interest as shown in section III, paragraphs A and B of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">Examples--(1) Treasury Non-indexed Securities--(i) Involving One Half-Year: A note paying interest at a rate of 6\3/4%\, originally issued on May 15, 2000, as a 5-year note with a first interest payment date of November 15, 2000, was reopened as a 4-year 9-month note on August 15, 2000. Interest had accrued for 92 days, from May 15 to August 15. The regular interest period from May 15 to November 15, 2000, covered 184 days. Accordingly, the daily interest decimal, $0.183423913, multiplied by 92, resulted in accrued interest payable of $16.874999996, or $16.87500, for each $1,000 note purchased. If the notes have a par amount of $150,000, then 150 is multiplied by $16.87500, resulting in an amount payable of $2,531.25.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Involving Two Half-Years:</p><p class="depth0">A 10\3/4%\ bond, originally issued on July 2, 1985, as a 20-year 1-month bond, with a first interest payment date of February 15, 1986, was reopened as a 19-year 10-month bond on November 4, 1985. Interest had accrued for 44 days, from July 2 to August 15, 1985, during a 181-day half-year (February 15 to August 15); and for 81 days, from August 15 to November 4, during a 184-day half-year (August 15, 1985, to February 15, 1986). Accordingly, $0.296961326 was multiplied by 44, and $0.292119565 was multiplied by 81, resulting in products of $13.066298344 and $23.661684765 which, added together, resulted in accrued interest payable of $36.727983109, or $36.72798, for each $1,000 bond purchased. If the bonds have a par amount of $11,000, then 11 is multiplied by $36.72798, resulting in an amount payable of $404.00778 ($404.01).</p><p class="depth0">6.

payments and expressed in decimals, e.g., .0719.n = number of full semiannual periods from the issue date to maturity, except that, if the issue date is a coupon frequency date, n will be one less than the number of full semiannual periods remaining to maturity. Coupon frequency dates are the two semiannual dates based on the maturity date of each note or bond issue. For example, a security maturing on November 15, 2015, would have coupon frequency dates of May 15 and November 15.r = (1) number of days from the issue date to the first interest payment (regular or short first payment period), or (2) number of days in fractional portion (or ``initial short period'') of long first payment period.s = (1) number of days in the full semiannual period ending on the first interest payment date (regular or short first payment period), or (2) number of days in the full semiannual period in which the fractional portion of a long first payment period falls, ending at the onset of the regular portion of the first interest payment.

a1 = 100 x max(0.00095022819 + 0.00120,0)/360 = 0.000597286
Ai represents the projected cash flow the floating rate note holder will receive, for a $100 par value, at the future interest payment date Ti, where i = 1,2, . . . ,8. Ti - Ti-1 is the number of days between the future interest payment dates Ti-1 and Ti. To account for the payback of the par value, the variable 1{i=8{time}  takes the value 1 if the payment date is the maturity date, or 0 otherwise. For example:
Ai = 92 x 0.000597286 = 0.054950312
and
A8 = 92 x 0.000597286 + 100 = 100.054950312
Let
Bi = 1 + (r + m) x (Ti - Ti - 1)/360
Bi represents the projected compound factor between the future dates Ti-1 and Ti, where i = 1,2, . . . ,8. All Bi's are computed using the discount margin m = 0.120% (equals the spread determined at the auction), and the fixed index rate of r = 0.095022819% applicable to the issue date (7/31/2012). For example:
B3 = 1 + (0.00095022819 + 0.00120) x 89/360 = 1.000531584.
The following table shows the projected daily accrued interest values for $100 par value (ai's), cash flows at interest payment dates (Ai's), and the compound factors between payment dates (Bi's).</p><p class="depth0">Table 3--Projected Cash Flows and Compound Factors----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">i                               ai                       Ai                       Bi----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1....................................              0.000597286              0.054950312              1.0005495032....................................              0.000597286              0.054950312              1.0005495033....................................              0.000597286              0.053158454              1.0005315844....................................              0.000597286              0.054950312              1.0005495035....................................              0.000597286              0.054950312              1.0005495036....................................              0.000597286              0.054950312              1.0005495037....................................              0.000597286              0.053158454              1.0005315848....................................              0.000597286            100.054950312              1.000549503----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Computing the Price</p><p class="depth0">The price is computed as follows:

Computation of Adjusted Values and Payment Amounts for Stripped</p><p class="depth0">Inflation-Protected Interest Components</p><p class="depth0">Note: Valuing an interest component stripped from an inflation-protected security at its adjusted value enables this interest component to be interchangeable (fungible) with other interest components that have the same maturity date, regardless of the underlying inflation-protected security from which the interest components were stripped. The adjusted value provides for fungibility of these various interest components when buying, selling, or transferring them or when reconstituting an inflation-protected security.Definitions:
c = C/100 = the regular annual interest rate, payable semiannually, e.g., .03625 (the decimal equivalent of a 3\5/8\% interest rate)Par = par amount of the security to be strippedRef CPIIssueDate = reference CPI for the original issue date (or dated date, when the dated date is different from the original issue date) of the underlying (unstripped) securityRef CPIDate = reference CPI for the maturity date of the interest componentAV = adjusted value of the interest componentPA = payment amount at maturity by Treasury



Formulas:
AV = Par(C/2)(100/Ref CPIIssueDate) (rounded to 2 decimals with no intermediate rounding)PA = AV(Ref CPIDate/100) (rounded to 2 decimals with no intermediate rounding)
Example:
A 10-year inflation-protected note paying 3\7/8\% interest was issued on January 15, 1999, with the second interest payment on January 15, 2000. The Ref CPI of January 15, 1999 (Ref CPIIssueDate) was 164.00000, and the Ref CPI on January 15, 2000 (Ref CPIDate) was 168.24516. Calculate the adjusted value and the payment amount at maturity of the interest component.
Definitions:
c = .03875Par = $1,000,000Ref CPIIssueDate = 164.00000Ref CPIDate = 168.24516
Resolution:
For a par amount of $1 million, the adjusted value of each stripped interest component was $1,000,000(.03875/2)(100/164.00000), or $11,814.02 (no intermediate rounding).For an interest component that matured on January 15, 2000, the payment amount was $11,814.02 (168.24516/100), or $19,876.52 (no intermediate rounding).</p><p class="depth0">VI.

That multiple times 98.098000 results in a purchase price of $9,809.80.</p><p class="depth0">2. To determine the discount amount for any bill, subtract the purchase price from the par amount of the bill.
Example:</p><p class="depth0">For a $10,000 bill with a purchase price of $9,809.80, the discount amount would be $190.20, or $10,000 - $9,809.80.</p><p class="depth0">C. Conversion of prices to discount rates for Treasury bills of all maturities:
