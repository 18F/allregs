Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.099-10 is identical and applicable to Sec. 86.005-10, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.099-10.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> Exhaust emissions from new 2005 and later model year Otto-cycle HDEs, except for Otto-cycle HDEs subject to the alternative standards in paragraph (f) of this section, shall not exceed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exhaust emissions from new 2005 and later model year Otto-cycle HDEs, except for Otto-cycle HDEs subject to the alternative standards in paragraph (f) of this section, shall not exceed:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(A)</em> Oxides of Nitrogen plus Non-methane Hydrocarbons (NOX + NMHC) for engines fueled with either gasoline, natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas. 1.0 grams per brake horsepower-hour (0.37 grams per megajoule).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Oxides of Nitrogen plus Non-methane Hydrocarbons (NOX + NMHC) for engines fueled with either gasoline, natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas. 1.0 grams per brake horsepower-hour (0.37 grams per megajoule).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Oxides of Nitrogen plus Non-methane Hydrocarbon Equivalent (NOX + NMHCE) for engines fueled with methanol. 1.0 grams per brake horsepower-hour (0.37 grams per megajoule).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A manufacturer may elect to include any or all of its Otto-cycle HDE families in any or all of the emissions ABT programs for HDEs, within the restrictions described in Sec. 86.098-15. If the manufacturer elects to include engine families in any of these programs, the NOX plus NMHC (or NOX plus NMHCE for methanol-fueled engines) FELs may not exceed 4.5 grams per brake horsepower-hour (1.7 grams per megajoule).
