                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">All construction work will be performed by one, or a combination, of  the following methods: Contract, borrower, mutual self-help, or owner- builder. All   development work must be performed by a person, firm or organization  qualified to provide the service. The mutual self-help method is  performance of work by a group of families by mutual labor under the  direction of a construction supervisor, as described in 7 CFR part 3550.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Contract method. This method of development will be used for all  major construction except in cases where it is clearly not possible to  obtain a contract at a reasonable or competitive cost. Work under this  method is performed in accordance with a written contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Forms used. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 1924-6, ``Construction Contract,'' will be used for SFH  construction. Other contract documents for more complex construction,  acceptable to the loan approval official and containing the requirements  of subpart E of part 1901 of this chapter, may be used provided they are  customarily used in the area and protect the interest of the borrower  and the Government with respect to compliance with items such as the  drawings, specifications, payments for work, inspections, completion,  nondiscrimination in construction work and acceptance of the work. If  needed, the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) will be consulted. The  United States (including FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354) will not become a party to a construction contract or incur any  liability under it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contract provisions. Contracts will have a listing of  attachments and the provisions of the contract will include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The contract sum.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The dates for starting and completing the work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The amount of liquidated damages to be charged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The amount, method, and frequency of payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Whether or not surety bonds will be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The requirement that changes or additions must have prior  written approval of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Surety requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Unless an exception is granted in  accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section or when interim  financing will be used, surety that guarantees both payment and  performance in the amount of the contract will be furnished when one or  more of the following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The contract exceeds the applicable Rural Development Single  Family Housing area loan limit as per 7 CFR 3550.63. (Loan limits are  available at the local Rural Development field office.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The loan approval official determines that a surety bond appears  advisable to protect the borrower against default of the contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The applicant requests a surety bond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The contract provides for partial payments in excess of the  amount of 60 percent of the value of the work in place.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The contract provides for partial payments for materials  suitably stored on the site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If surety bonds are required the construction contract must  indicate that the contractor will furnish properly executed surety bonds  prior to the start of any work. Exhibits F and G of this subpart as  revised by OGC if necessary to comply with local or state statutory  requirements will be used as the forms of payment bond and performance  bond to be provided. Unless noncorporate surety is provided, the surety  bonds may only be obtained from a corporate bonding company listed on  the current Department of the Treasury Circular 570 (published annually  in the Federal Register), as holding a certificate of authority as an  acceptable surety on Federal bonds and as legally doing business in the  State where the land is located. Noncorporate sureties are not  recommended and the State Director will be responsible for determining  the acceptability of the individual or individuals proposed as sureties  on the bonds. The State Director must determine that an individual or  individuals proposed as sureties must have cash or other liquid assets  easily convertible to cash in an amount at least equal to 25 percent  more than the contract amount in order to be acceptable. The  individual(s) will pledge such liquid assets in an amount equal to the  contract amount. Fees charged for noncorporate   sureties may not exceed fees charged by corporate sureties on bonds of  equal amount and, in no case, may surety be provided by the applicant or  any person or organization with an identity of interest in the  applicant's operation. The United States (including FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354) will incur no liability  related in any way to a performance or payment bond provided in  connection with a construction contract. FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 will be named as co-obligee in the performance  and payment bonds unless prohibited by state law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When an experienced and reliable contractor cannot obtain  payment and performance bonds meeting the surety requirements of  paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, the State Director may entertain a  request from the applicant for an exception to the surety requirements.  The applicant's request must specifically state why the proposed  contractor is unable to obtain payment and performance bonds meeting the  surety requirements, and why it is financially advantageous for the  applicant to award the contract to the proposed contractor without the  required bonds.  If the applicant's request is reasonable and justified, and if the  proposed contractor is reliable and experienced in the construction of  projects of similar size, design, scope, and complexity, the State  Director may grant an exception to the surety requirements for loans or  grants within the State Director's approval authority and accept one or  a combination of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit issued by a  lending institution which has been reviewed and approved by OGC. In such  cases, the construction contract must indicate that the contractor will  furnish a properly executed letter of credit from a lending institution  acceptable to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  prior to the start of any work. The letter of credit must remain in  effect until the date of final acceptance of work by the owner and FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. In addition, the  letter of credit must stipulate that the lending institution, upon  written notification by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 of the contractor's failure to perform under the terms of the  contract, will advance funds up to the amount of the contract (including  all FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 approved  contract change orders) to satisfy all prior debts incurred by the  contractor in performing the contract and all funds necessary to  complete the work. Payments may be made to the contractor in accordance  with paragraph (a)(12)(i)(C) of this section as if full surety bonds  were being provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If a letter of credit satisfying the conditions of paragraph  (a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section cannot be obtained, the State Director  may accept a deposit in the amount of the contract, into an interest or  non-interest bearing supervised bank account. In such cases, the  construction contract must indicate that the contractor will furnish the  required deposit prior to the start of any work and that the funds shall  remain on deposit until final acceptance of work by the owner and FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. Payments may be made  to the contractor in accordance with paragraph (a)(12)(i)(C) of this  section as if full surety bonds were being provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> When the provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(iii) (A) or (B) of this  section can be met except that a surety bond, a letter of credit, and/or  deposits are not obtainable in full amount of the contract, the State  Director may accept an amount less than the full amount of the contract  provided all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The contractor provides a surety bond, a letter of credit, or  deposits in the greatest amount possible, and provides documentation  indicating the reasons why amounts exceeding the proposed amount cannot  be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The applicant agrees to the amount of the surety bond, letter of  credit, or deposits proposed, and the State Director determines that the  applicant has the financial capability to withstand any financial loss  due to default of the contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the opinion of the State Director, the proposed amount and  the method of payment will provide adequate protection for the borrower  and   the Government against default of the contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The contract provides for partial payments not to exceed 90  percent of the value of the work in place for that portion of the total  contract which is guaranteed by an acceptable surety bond, letter of  credit, or deposits, and partial payments not to exceed 60 percent of  the value of the work in place for that portion of the total contract  which is not guaranteed by surety, letter of credit, or deposits.</p><p class="depth0">Example:</p><p class="depth0">Contractor has a surety bond which guarantees payment and  performance in an amount of $150,000 which represents 75 percent of the  total contract amount of $200,000. The contractor's first request for  payment appears thus:  --Value of work in place is $10,000. --Payment for work guaranteed by surety is 75 percent times $10,000  times 90 percent is $6,750. --Payment for work not guaranteed by surety is 25 percent times $10,000  times 60 percent is $1,500. --Authorized payment is $8,250.</p><p class="depth0">(Each partial payment shall reflect values for work guaranteed by  surety, letter of credit, or deposits, and work not so guaranteed).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In cases where the contractor does not obtain payment and  performance bonds in accordance with the surety requirements of  paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, or where an exception to the  surety requirements is granted by the State Director, the following  steps will be taken to protect the borrower and the government against  latent obligations or defects in connection with the construction:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The contractor will furnish a properly executed corporate latent  defects bond or a maintenance bond in the amount of 10 percent of the  construction contract; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit in the amount  of 10 percent of the construction contract issued by a lending  institution which has been reviewed and approved by OGC; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A cash deposit into an interest or non-interest bearing  supervised bank account in the amount of 10 percent of the construction  contract;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The period of protection against latent obligations and/or  defects shall be one year from the date of final acceptance of work by  the owner and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Final payment shall not be rendered to the contractor until the  provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(iv) (A), (B) or (C) of this section have  been met;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The contract will contain a clause indicating that the  contractor agrees to provide surety or guarantee acceptable to the owner  and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 against latent  obligations and/or defects in connection with the construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Equal opportunity. Section 1901.205 of subpart E of part 1901 of  this chapter applies to all loans or grants involving construction  contracts and subcontracts in excess of $10,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Labor standards provisions. The provisions of the Davis-Bacon  and related acts, which are published by the Department of Labor (29 CFR  parts 1, 3 and 5), will apply when the contract involves either LH grant  assistance, or 9 or more units in a project being assisted under the HUD  section 8 housing assistance payment program for new construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Historical and archaeological preservation. The provisions of  subpart F of part 1901 of this chapter concerning the protection of  historical and archaeological properties will apply to all construction  financed, in whole or in part, by FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 loans and grants. These provisions have special  applicability to development in areas designated by NRCS as Resource  Conservation and Development (RC&D;) areas. (See part 1942, subpart I of  this chapter.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Air and water acts. Under Executive Order 11738, all loans or  grants involving construction contracts for more than $100,000 must meet  all the requirements of section 114 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C.  7414) and section 308 of the Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C.,  section 1813). The contract should contain provisions obligating the  contractor as a condition for the award of the contract as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To notify the owner of the receipt of any communication from  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) indicating that a facility to be  utilized in the performance of the contract is under consideration to be  listed on the EPA list of Violating Facilities. Prompt notification is  required prior to contract award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To certify that any facility to be utilized in the performance  of any nonexempt contractor subcontract is not listed on the EPA list of  Violating Facilities as of the date of contract award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> To include or cause to be included the above criteria and  requirements of paragraphs (a)(7) (i) and (ii) of this section in every  nonexempt subcontract, and that the contractor will take such action as  the Government may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Architectural barriers. In accordance with the Architectural  Barriers Act of 1968 (Pub. L. 90-480), as implemented by the General  Services Administration regulations (41 CFR 101-19.6) and section 504 of  the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-112) as implemented by 7 CFR,  parts 15 and 15b, all facilities financed with FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 loans and grants and which are  accessible to the public or in which people with disabilities may be  employed or reside must be developed in compliance with this Act. Copies  of the Act and Federal accessibility design standards may be obtained  from the Executive Director, Architectural and Transportation Barriers  Compliance Board, Washington, DC 20201.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> National Environmental Policy Act. The provisions of subpart G  of part 1940 of this chapter concerning environmental requirements will  apply to all loans and grants including those being assisted under the  HUD section 8 housing assistance payment program for new construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Obtaining bids and selecting a contractor. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The applicant  may select a contractor and negotiate a contract or contact several  contractors and request each to submit a bid. For complex construction  projects, refer also to Sec. 1924.13(e) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When a price has already been negotiated by an applicant and a  contractor, the County Supervisor, District Director or other  appropriate FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  official will review the proposed contract. If the contractor is  qualified to perform the development and provide a warranty of the work  and the price compares favorably with the cost of similar construction  in the area, further negotiation is unnecessary. If the FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 official determines the price  is too high or otherwise unreasonable, the applicant will be requested  to negotiate further with the contractor. If a reasonable price cannot  be negotiated or if the contractor is not qualified, the applicant will  be requested to obtain competitive bids.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When an applicant has a proposed development plan and no  contractor in mind, competitive bidding will be encouraged. The  applicant should obtain bids from as many qualified contractors, dealers  or tradespeople as feasible depending on the method and type of  construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the award of the contract is by competitive bidding, Form  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-5,  ``Invitation for Bid (Construction Contract),'' or another similar  invitation bid form containing the requirements of subpart E of part  1901 of this chapter, may be used. All contractors from whom bids are  requested should be informed of all conditions of the contract including  the time and place of opening bids. Conditions shall not be established  which would give preference to a specific bidder or type of bidder. When  applicable, copies of Forms FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 1924-6 and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 400-6, ``Compliance Statement,'' also should be provided to the  prospective bidders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Awarding the contract. The borrower, with the assistance of the  County Supervisor or District Director, will consider the amount of the  bids or proposals, and all conditions which were listed in the  ``Invitation for Bid.'' On the basis of these considerations, the   borrower will select and notify the lowest responsible bidder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Before work commences, the County Supervisor, District Director  or other FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 employee  having knowledge of contracts and construction practices will hold a  preconstruction conference with the borrower(s), contractor and  architect/engineer (if applicable). The purpose of the conference is to  reach a mutual understanding of each party's responsibilities under the  terms and conditions of the contract documents and the loan agreement  during the construction and warranty periods. Form FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-16, ``Record of Preconstruction  Conference,'' may be used as a guide for an agenda.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A summary of the items covered will be entered in the running  case record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The contract will then be prepared, signed and copies  distributed in accordance with the FMI for Form FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> After a borrower/contractor's contract or subcontract in excess  of $10,000 is received in the FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 County or District Office, the responsible FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 official will send within 10  calendar days of the date of the contract or subcontract, a report  similar in form and content to exhibit C of subpart E of part 1901 of  this chapter to the Area Director, Office of Federal Contract Compliance  Programs, U.S. Department of Labor, at the applicable address listed in  exhibit E, subpart E of part 1901 of this chapter. The report must  contain, at least, the following information: contractor's name, address  and telephone number; employer's identification number; amount, starting  date and planned completion date of the contract; contract number; and  city and DOL region of the contract site. The information for this  report should be obtained from the contractor when the contract is  awarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Payments for work done by the contract method. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Payments  will be made in accordance with one of the following methods unless  prohibited by state statute, in which case the State Director shall  issue a State Supplement to this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The ``One-Lump-Sum'' payment method will be used when the  payment will be made in one lump-sum for the whole contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The ``Partial payments not to exceed 60 percent of the value of  the work in place'' payment method will be used when the contractor does  not provide surety bond, a letter of credit, or deposits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The ``Partial payments in the amount of 90 percent of the value  of the work in place and of the value of the materials suitably stored  at the site'' payment method will be used when the contractor provides a  surety bond equal to the total contract amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The ``Partial payments which reflect the portions of the  contract amount which is guaranteed'' method will be used when the  contractor provides surety bonds, a letter of credit, or deposits less  than the total amount of the contract in accordance with the provisions  of paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  1924-6 is used, the appropriate payment clause will be checked and the  other payment clauses not used will be effectively crossed out.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When a contract form other than Form FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-6 is used, the payment clause must  conform with paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this section and the appropriate  clause as set forth in Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 1924-6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The borrower and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 must take precautionary measures to see that all payments made  to the contractor are properly applied against bills for materials and  labor procured under the contract. Prior to making any partial payment  on any contract where a surety bond is not used, the contractor will be  required to furnish the borrower and the FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 with a statement showing the total amount owed  to date for materials and   labor procured under the contract. The contractor also may be required  to submit evidence showing that previous partial payments were applied  properly. When the borrower and the County Supervisor or District  Director have reason to believe that partial payments may not be applied  properly, checks may be made jointly to the contractor and persons who  furnished materials and labor in connection with the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> When partial payments are requested by the contractor and  approved by the owner, the amount of the partial payment will be  determined by one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Based upon the percentage completed as shown on a recently  completed and properly executed Form FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 1924-12, ``Inspection Report.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When the structure will be covered by an insured 10-year  warranty, the insurer's construction inspector must provide FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 with any available copies of  inspection reports showing percentage of completion immediately after  the inspections are completed. To make partial payments when copies of  inspection reports are not available, the responsible FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 official will make the  inspections or will be guided by the provisions of  Sec. 1924.6(a)(12)(v)(C) of this subpart. If further assurance is deemed  necessary to justify partial payments, the FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 official may make onsite inspections or require  additional information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Based upon an application for payment containing an estimate of  the value of work in place which has been prepared by the contractor and  accepted by the borrower and FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354. When the contract provides for partial payments for  materials satisfactorily stored at the site, the application for payment  may include these items. Prior to receiving the first partial payment,  the contractor should be required to submit a list of major  subcontractors and suppliers and a schedule of prices or values of the  various phases of the work aggregating the total sum of the contract  such as excavation, foundations, framing, roofing, siding, mill work,  painting, plumbing, heating, electric wiring, etc., made out in such  form as agreed upon by the borrower, FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354, and the contractor. In applying for payments, the  contractor should submit a statement based upon this schedule. See  exhibit A of this subpart for guidance in reviewing the contractor's  schedule of prices and estimating the value of the work in place.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Final payment. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> When the structure will be covered by an  insured 10-year warranty, the insurer must provide an insured 10-year  warranty policy (or a binder if the policy is not available) before  final payment is made to the builder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Final payment of the amount due on the contract or disbursal of  the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan funds  where an interim loan was used will be made only upon completion of the  entire contract, final inspection by FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354, acceptance of the work by FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 and the borrower, issuance of any and  all final permits and approvals for the use and occupancy of the  structure by any applicable state and local governmental authorities,  and compliance by the contractor with all terms and conditions of the  contract. In the event the work of construction is delayed or  interrupted by reason of fire, flood unusually stormy weather, war,  riot, strike, an order, requisition or regulation of any governmental  body (excluding delays related to possible defects in the contractor's  performance and excluding delays caused by the necessity of securing  building permits or any required inspection procedures connected  therewith) or other contingencies reasonably unforeseeable and beyond  the reasonable control of the contractor, then with the written consent  of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, the date of  completion of the work may be extended by the owner by the period of  such delay, provided that the contractor shall give the owner and FmHA   or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 written notice within  72 hours of the occurrence of the event causing the delay or  interruption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Prior to making final payment on the contract when a surety bond  is not used or disbursing the FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 loan funds when an interim loan was used, FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be provided with a Form  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-9,  ``Certificate of Contractor's Release,'' and Form FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-10, ``Release by Claimants.''  executed by all persons who furnished materials or labor in connection  with the contract. The borrower should furnish the contractor with a  copy of the ``Release by Claimants'' form at the beginning of the work  in order that the contractor may obtain these releases as the work  progresses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If such releases cannot be obtained, the funds may be disbursed  provided all the following can be met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Release statements to the extent possible are obtained;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The interests of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 can be adequately protected and its security position is not  impaired; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Adequate provisions are made for handling the unpaid account  by withholding or escrowing sufficient funds to pay any such claims or  obtaining a release bond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The State Director may issue a State Supplement which will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Not require the use of Form FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 1924-10, if, under existing state statutes, the  furnishing of labor and materials gives no right to a lien against the  property, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Provide an alternative method to protect against mechanic's and  materialmen's liens. In this case, the use of Form FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-10 is optional.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Borrower method. The borrower method means performance of work  by or under the direction of the borrower, using one or more of the ways  specified in this paragraph. Development work may be performed by the  borrower method only when it is not practicable to do the work by the  contract method; the borrower possesses or arranges through an approved  self-help plan for the necessary skill and managerial ability to  complete the work satisfactorily; such work not interfere seriously with  the borrower's farming operation or work schedule, and the County Office  caseload will permit a County Supervisor to properly advise the borrower  and inspect the work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ways of performing the work. The borrower will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Purchase the material and equipment and do the work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Utilize lump-sum agreements for (A) minor items or minor  portions of items of development, the total cost of which does not  exceed $5,000 per agreement, such as labor, material, or labor and  material for small service buildings, repair jobs, or land development;  or (B) material and equipment which involve a single trade and will be  installed by the seller, such as the purchase and installation of  heating facilities, electric wiring, wells, painting, liming, or  sodding. All agreements will be in writing, however, the County  Supervisor may make an exception to this requirement when the agreement  involves a relatively small amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Acceptance and storage of material on site. The County  Supervisor will advise the borrower that the acceptance of material as  delivered to the site and the proper storage of material will be the  borrower's responsibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Payment for work done by the borrower method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Payments for  labor. Before the County Supervisor countersigns checks for labor, the  borrower must submit a completed Form FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 1924-11, ``Statement of Labor Performed,'' for each  hired worker performing labor during the pay period. Ordinarily, checks  for labor will be made payable to the workers involved. However, under  justifiable circumstances, when the borrower has paid for labor with  personal funds and has obtained signatures of the workers on Form FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-11 as having  received payment, the County Supervisor may countersign a check   made payable to the borrower for reimbursement of these expenditures.  Under no circumstances will the County Supervisor permit loan funds or  funds withdrawn from the supervised bank account to be used to pay the  borrower for the borrower's own labor or labor performed by any member  of the borrower's household.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payment for equipment, materials or lump-sum agreements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  Before countersigning checks for equipment or materials, the County  Supervisor must normally have an invoice from the seller covering the  equipment or materials to be purchased. When an invoice is not available  at the time the check is issued, an itemized statement of the equipment  or materials to be purchased may be substituted until a paid invoice  from the seller is submitted, at which time the prepurchase statement  may be destroyed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When an invoice is available at the time the check is drawn, the  check will include a reference to the invoice number, the invoice date  if unnumbered and, if necessary, the purpose of the expenditure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The check number and date of payment will be indicated on the  appropriate Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  1924-11, invoice, itemized statement of equipment or materials and/or  lump-sum agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Ordinarily, checks for equipment or materials will be made  payable to the seller. Under justifiable circumstances, when the  borrower has paid for equipment or materials with personal funds and  furnished a paid invoice, the County Supervisor may countersign a check  made payable to the borrower for reimbursement of these expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> When an invoice includes equipment or materials for more than  one item of development, the appropriate part of the cost to be charged  against each item of development will be indicated on the invoice by the  borrower, with the assistance of the County Supervisor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Payment made under lump-sum agreements will be made only when  all items of equipment and materials have been furnished, labor has been  performed as agreed upon, and the work has been accepted by the borrower  and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Each paid Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 1924-11, invoice, itemized statement for equipment or material  and/or lump-sum agreement will be given to the borrower in accordance  with the FMI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Mutual self-help method. The mutual self-help method is  performance of work by a group of families by mutual labor under the  direction of a construction supervisor, as described in 7 CFR part 3550.  The ways of doing the work, buying materials, and contracting for  special services are like those used for the borrower method. Materials  can be bought jointly by the group of families, but payments will be  made individually by each family. In the case of RH loans to families  being assisted by Self-Help Technical Assistance (TA) grants in  accordance with subpart I of part 1944 of this chapter, the County  Supervisor may countersign checks for materials and necessary contract  work made payable directly to the TA grantee, provided the District  Director determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The grantee acts in the same capacity as a construction manager  in the group purchase of material and services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The grantee has an adequate bookkeeping system approved by the  District Director to assure that funds in each RH account are properly  distributed and maintained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The grantee receives no compensation in the way of profit or  overhead for this service and all discounts and rebates received in  connection with the purchase of materials or services are passed on to  the participating families.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The grantee has a record-keeping system which shows that the  costs of the materials and services were prorated to each borrower's  account in relation to the actual material and service used by each  borrower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Owner-builder method. This method of construction applies only  to RRH loans made under subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter.  Regulations governing   this method are found at Sec. 1924.13(e)(2) of this subpart.  [52 FR 8002, Mar. 13, 1987, as amended at 55 FR 41833, Oct. 16, 1990; 60  FR 55122, Oct. 27, 1995; 61 FR 56116, Oct. 31, 1996; 71 FR 25740, May 2,  2006]    Sec. 1924.7  [Reserved]</p>
