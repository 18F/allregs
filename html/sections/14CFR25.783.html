                                Sec. 25.783  Fuselage doors.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section applies to fuselage doors, which includes  all doors, hatches, openable windows, access panels, covers, etc., on  the exterior of the fuselage that do not require the use of tools to  open or close. This also applies to each door or hatch through a  pressure bulkhead, including any bulkhead that is specifically designed  to function as a secondary bulkhead under the prescribed failure  conditions of part 25. These doors must meet the requirements of this  section, taking into account both pressurized and unpressurized flight,  and must be designed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each door must have means to safeguard against opening in flight  as a result of mechanical failure, or failure of any single structural  element.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each door that could be a hazard if it unlatches must be  designed so that unlatching during pressurized and unpressurized flight  from the fully closed, latched, and locked condition is extremely  improbable. This must be shown by safety analysis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each element of each door operating system must be designed or,  where impracticable, distinctively and permanently marked, to minimize  the probability of incorrect assembly and adjustment that could result  in a malfunction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All sources of power that could initiate unlocking or unlatching  of any door must be automatically isolated from the latching and locking  systems prior to flight and it must not be possible to restore power to  the door during flight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Each removable bolt, screw, nut, pin, or other removable  fastener must meet the locking requirements of Sec. 25.607.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Certain doors, as specified by Sec. 25.807(h), must also meet  the applicable requirements of Sec. Sec. 25.809 through 25.812 for  emergency exits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Opening by persons. There must be a means to safeguard each door  against opening during flight due to inadvertent action by persons. In  addition, design precautions must be taken to minimize the possibility  for a person to open a door intentionally during flight. If these  precautions include the use of auxiliary devices, those devices and  their controlling systems must be designed so that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No single failure will prevent more than one exit from being  opened; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failures that would prevent opening of the exit after landing  are improbable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pressurization prevention means. There must be a provision to  prevent pressurization of the airplane to an unsafe level if any door  subject to pressurization is not fully closed, latched, and locked.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provision must be designed to function after any single  failure, or after any combination of failures not shown to be extremely  improbable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Doors that meet the conditions described in paragraph (h) of  this section are not required to have a dedicated pressurization  prevention means if, from every possible position of the door, it will  remain open to the extent that it prevents pressurization or safely  close and latch as pressurization takes place. This must also be shown  with any single failure and malfunction, except that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> With failures or malfunctions in the latching mechanism, it need  not latch after closing; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> With jamming as a result of mechanical failure or blocking  debris, the door need not close and latch if it can be shown that the  pressurization loads on the jammed door or mechanism would not result in  an unsafe condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Latching and locking. The latching and locking mechanisms must  be designed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There must be a provision to latch each door.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The latches and their operating mechanism must be designed so  that, under all airplane flight and ground loading conditions, with the  door latched, there is no force or torque tending to unlatch the  latches. In addition, the latching system must include a means to secure  the latches in the latched position. This means must be independent of  the locking system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each door subject to pressurization, and for which the initial  opening movement is not inward, must--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Have an individual lock for each latch;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Have the lock located as close as practicable to the latch; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Be designed so that, during pressurized flight, no single  failure in the locking system would prevent the locks from restraining  the latches necessary to secure the door.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each door for which the initial opening movement is inward, and  unlatching of the door could result in a hazard, must have a locking  means to prevent the latches from becoming disengaged. The locking means  must ensure sufficient latching to prevent opening of the door even with  a single failure of the latching mechanism.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> It must not be possible to position the lock in the locked  position if the latch and the latching mechanism are not in the latched  position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> It must not be possible to unlatch the latches with the locks in  the locked position. Locks must be designed to withstand the limit loads  resulting from--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The maximum operator effort when the latches are operated  manually;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The powered latch actuators, if installed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The relative motion between the latch and the structural  counterpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Each door for which unlatching would not result in a hazard is  not required to have a locking mechanism meeting the requirements of  paragraphs (d)(3) through (d)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Warning, caution, and advisory indications. Doors must be  provided with the following indications:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There must be a positive means to indicate at each door  operator's station that all required operations to close, latch, and  lock the door(s) have been completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There must be a positive means clearly visible from each  operator station for any door that could be a hazard if unlatched to  indicate if the door is not fully closed, latched, and locked.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There must be a visual means on the flight deck to signal the  pilots if any door is not fully closed, latched, and locked. The means  must be designed such that any failure or combination of failures that  would result in an erroneous closed, latched, and locked indication is  improbable for--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each door that is subject to pressurization and for which the  initial opening movement is not inward; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each door that could be a hazard if unlatched.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> There must be an aural warning to the pilots prior to or during  the initial portion of takeoff roll if any door is not fully closed,  latched, and locked, and its opening would prevent a safe takeoff and  return to landing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Visual inspection provision. Each door for which unlatching of  the door could be a hazard must have a provision for direct visual  inspection to determine, without ambiguity, if the door is fully closed,  latched, and locked. The provision must be permanent and discernible  under operational lighting conditions, or by means of a flashlight or  equivalent light source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Certain maintenance doors, removable emergency exits, and access  panels. Some doors not normally opened except for maintenance purposes  or emergency evacuation and some access panels need not comply with  certain paragraphs of this section as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Access panels that are not subject to cabin pressurization and  would not be a hazard if open during flight need not comply with  paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, but must have a means to  prevent inadvertent opening during flight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inward-opening removable emergency exits that are not normally  removed, except for maintenance purposes or emergency evacuation, and  flight deck-openable windows need not comply with paragraphs (c) and (f)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Maintenance doors that meet the conditions of paragraph (h) of  this section, and for which a placard is provided limiting use to  maintenance access, need not comply with paragraphs (c) and (f) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Doors that are not a hazard. For the purposes of this section, a  door is considered not to be a hazard in the unlatched condition during  flight, provided it can be shown to meet all of the following  conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Doors in pressurized compartments would remain in the fully  closed position if not restrained by the latches when subject to a  pressure greater than \1/2\ psi. Opening by persons, either  inadvertently or intentionally, need not be considered in making this  determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The door would remain inside the airplane or remain attached to  the airplane if it opens either in pressurized or unpressurized portions  of the flight. This determination must include the consideration of  inadvertent and intentional opening by persons during either pressurized  or unpressurized portions of the flight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The disengagement of the latches during flight would not allow  depressurization of the cabin to an unsafe level. This safety assessment  must include the physiological effects on the occupants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The open door during flight would not create aerodynamic  interference that could preclude safe flight and landing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The airplane would meet the structural design requirements with  the door open. This assessment must include the aeroelastic stability  requirements of Sec. 25.629, as well as the strength requirements of  subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The unlatching or opening of the door must not preclude safe  flight and landing as a result of interaction with other systems or  structures.
