                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority. Subparts A, B and C of this part and subpart L of part 747 of this chapter are issued by the National Credit Union Administration pursuant to section 216 of the Federal Credit Union Act (FCUA), 12 U.S.C. 1790d (section 1790d), as added by section 301 of the Credit Union Membership Access Act, Pub. L. No. 105-219, 112 Stat. 913 (1998). Subpart D of this part is issued pursuant to FCUA section 120, 12 U.S.C. 1766.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose. The express purpose of prompt corrective action under section 1790d is to resolve the problems of federally-insured credit unions at the least possible long-term loss to the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. This part carries out the purpose of prompt corrective action by establishing a framework of mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions, applicable according to a credit union's net worth ratio, designed primarily to restore and improve the net worth of federally-insured credit unions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scope. This part implements the provisions of section 1790d as they apply to federally-insured credit unions, whether federally- or state-chartered; to such credit unions defined as ``new'' pursuant to section 1790d(b)(2); and to such credit unions defined as ``complex'' pursuant to section 1790d(d). Certain of these provisions also apply to officers and directors of federally-insured credit unions. This part does not apply to corporate credit unions. Procedures for issuing, reviewing and enforcing orders and directives issued under this part are set forth in subpart L of part 747 of this chapter, 12 CFR 747.2001 et seq.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other supervisory authority. Neither Sec. 1790d nor this part in any way limits the authority of the NCUA Board or appropriate State official under any other provision of law to take additional supervisory actions to address unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, or violations of applicable law or regulations. Action taken under this part may be taken independently of, in conjunction with, or in addition to any other enforcement action available to the NCUA Board or appropriate State official, including issuance of

cease and desist orders, orders of prohibition, suspension and removal, or assessment of civil money penalties, or any other actions authorized by law.</p>
