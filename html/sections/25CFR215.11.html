                                Sec. 215.11  New leases where prior leases have been forfeited or abandoned.

                            <p class="depth0">In cases where the lands have heretofore been leased and lead and  zinc ores have been discovered but the mines and mining operations have  been abandoned and the leases have been canceled or forfeited or have  expired, special arrangements in the matter of the leasing and mining of  said lands may be made provided the consent thereto of the Secretary of  the Interior be first obtained. Applications containing special offers  as to the terms and conditions may be considered by the Secretary of the  Interior and the leasing of said lands may be made upon such special  terms and conditions as the Secretary of the Interior may in each case  deem to be for the best interests of the Indian owners of the land.   If, however, in any case, it shall appear to the Secretary of the  Interior that the granting of such lease would not be to the best  interest of the Indian owners of the land, the Secretary of the Interior  may cause the mining lease rights on said land to be offered for sale at  public auction to the highest bidder. If the lead and zinc mining lease  on said land be offered for sale at public auction, the same procedure  shall be followed as provided in Sec. Sec. 215.7 through 215.9.</p>
