                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After the close of the legislative hearing conducted under Sec. 750.7, any participant in that hearing may submit a written request for cross-examination. The request shall be received by EPA within one week after a full transcript of the legislative hearing becomes available and shall specify:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The disputed issue(s) of material fact as to which cross-examination is requested. This shall include an explanation of why the questions at issue are ``factual'', rather than of an analytical or policy nature, the extent to which they are in ``dispute'' in the light of the record made thus far, and the extent to which and why they can reasonably be considered ``material'' to the decision on the final rule; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The person(s) the participant desires to cross-examine, and an estimate of the time necessary. This shall include a statement by the cross-examination requested can be expected to result in ``full and true disclosure'' resolving the issue of material fact involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Within one week after receipt of all requests for cross-examination under paragraph (a) of this section the hearing panel shall rule on them. The ruling shall be served by the Record and Hearing Clerk on all participants who have requested cross-examination and shall be inserted in the record. Written notice of the ruling shall be given to all persons requesting cross-examination and all persons to be cross-examined. The ruling shall specify:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The issues as to which cross-examination is granted,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The persons to be cross-examined on each issue,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The persons to be allowed to conduct cross-examination, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Time limits for the examination of each witness by each cross-examiner.
In issuing this ruling, the panel may determine that one or more participants who have requested cross-examination have the same or similar interests and should be required to choose a single representative for purposes of cross-examination. In such a case the order shall simply assign time for cross-examination by that single representative without identifying the representative further. Subpoenas for witnesses may be issued where necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Within one week after the insertion into the record of the ruling under paragraph (b) of this section, the hearing at which the cross-examination will be conducted shall commence. One or more members of the original panel shall preside for the Agency. The panel shall have authority to conduct cross-examination on behalf of any participant, although as a general rule this right will not be exercised. The panel shall also have authority to modify the governing ruling in any respect and to make new rulings on group representation under section 6(c)(3)(C) of TSCA. A verbatim transcript of the hearing shall be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> No later than the time set for requesting cross-examination, a hearing participant may request that other alternative methods of clarifying the record (such as informal conferences or the submittal of additional information) be used. Such requests may be submitted either in lieu of cross-examination requests, or in conjunction with them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No later than the time set for requesting cross-examination, a hearing participant may request that other alternative methods of clarifying the record (such as informal conferences or the submittal of additional information) be used. Such requests may be submitted either in lieu of cross-examination requests, or in conjunction with them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The panel in passing on a cross-examination request may as a precondition to ruling on its merits require that alternative means of clarifying the record be used whether or not that has been requested under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. In such a case the results of the use of such alternative means shall be made available to the person requesting cross-examination of a one-week comment period, and the panel shall make a final ruling on cross-examination within one week thereafter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Waivers or extensions of any deadline in this section applicable to persons other than EPA may be granted on the record of the hearing by the person chairing it or in writing by the Record and Hearing Clerk.</p>
