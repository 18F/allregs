                                Sec. 733.5  Determination of paternity and support of illegitimate children.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Illegitimate children. If the service member desires marriage,  leave for this purpose is recommended whenever consistent with the needs  or exigencies of the service. When the blood parents of an illegitimate  child marry, the child is considered to be legitimized by the marriage  unless a court finds the child to be illegitimate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Judicial order or decree of paternity or support. Normally any  order or decree which specifies the obligation to render support of  illegitimate children will include within it a determination of  paternity of such children; however, some jurisdictions provide for  determinations of the legal obligation to support illegitimate children  without a determination of paternity. Either type of order or decree  falls within the scope of this paragraph. If a judicial order or decree  of paternity or support is rendered by a United States or foreign court  of competent jurisdiction   against a member of the Navy or Marine Corps on active duty, the member  concerned will be informed of his moral and legal obligations as well as  his legal rights in the matter. The member will be advised that he is  expected to render financial assistance to the child regardless of any  doubts of paternity that the member may have. If the court order or  decree specifies an amount of support to be provided the member will be  expected to comply with the terms of such decree or order. If no amount  is specified, support should be rendered in accordance with such  reasonable agreement as may be made with the mother or legal guardian of  the child or, in the absence of such agreement, in accordance with the  applicable guide set forth above. If the member refuses to comply with  the terms of the court order, administrative action will be taken as  indicated in Sec. 733.4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Court of competent jurisdiction. A court of competent  jurisdiction is generally a court that has jurisdiction over the subject  matter and the parties involved. As a general rule, the competency of  the court to render the judicial order or decree may be tested by the  enforceability of the order or decree. Normally, although not always,  personal service of the court's process on the member is considered  essential. With respect to a foreign judicial order or decree, the  general rule is that where the defendant was a citizen or subject of the  foreign country in which the order or decree was issued, the court may  have acquired jurisdiction over the member by any mode of service or  notice recognized as sufficient by the laws of that country. It should  be noted, however, that an order or decree against a citizen or  permanent resident of another country, without personal service or  personal notice of the action to him or her, is null and void unless the  member voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction by appearing and  contesting the action. In the event there is doubt as to the competency  of the court to enter the order or decree, the question shall be  referred to the Judge Advocate General.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nonjudicial determination. In the absence of an adjudication of  paternity or of a court-ordered obligation to furnish support, the  member shall be privately consulted and asked, where appropriate,  whether he or she admits either paternity of, or the legal obligation to  support, the child or expected child. If the answer is affirmative, the  member shall be informed that he or she is expected to furnish support  as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Where paternity or the  legal obligation to support is admitted by a male member, such member  should be informed of his moral obligation to assist in the payment of  prenatal expenses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Members not on active duty. Allegations of paternity against  members of the naval service who are not on active duty will be  forwarded to the individual concerned in such a manner as to insure that  the charges are delivered to the addressee only. The correspondence  should be forwarded via the commandant of the naval district in which  the member resides.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Former members. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a certified copy of a judicial order or  decree of paternity or support duly rendered by a United States or  foreign court of competent jurisdiction against a former member of the  Navy or Marine Corps is submitted, his or her last-known address will be  furnished to the complainant with return of the correspondence and court  order. The complainant will be informed of the date of discharge and  advised that the individual concerned is no longer a member of the Navy  or Marine Corps in any capacity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where there has been no court adjudication, the correspondence  will be returned to the complainant with an appropriate letter stating  that the individual is no longer a member of the Navy or the Marine  Corps in any capacity and giving the date of his or her discharge or  final separation except that the last-known address of the former member  shall be furnished to the claimant if the complaint against the former  member is supported by a document which establishes that the former  member has made an admission or statement acknowledging paternity or  responsibility for support of a child before a court of competent  jurisdiction, administrative or executive agency, or official authorized  to receive it.   In cases where the complaint, along with the corroboration of a  physician's affidavit, alleges and explains an unusual medical situation  which makes it essential to obtain information from the alleged father  in order to protect the physical health of either the prospective mother  or the unborn child, the last-known address of the former member shall  likewise be furnished to the claimant.  [44 FR 42190, July 19, 1979, as amended at 65 FR 62618, Oct. 19, 2000]</p>
