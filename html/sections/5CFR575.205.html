                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An agency may pay a relocation incentive under the conditions prescribed in this subpart to an employee who--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Relocates to a different geographic area (permanently or temporarily) to accept a position listed in Sec. 575.203 in an agency when the position is likely to be difficult to fill, as determined under Sec. 575.206; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is an employee of the Federal Government immediately before the relocation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An agency may pay a relocation incentive under paragraph (a) of this section when an employee must relocate to accept a position or assignment in a different geographic area. A position is considered to be in a different geographic area if the worksite of the new position is 50 or more miles from the worksite of the position held immediately before the move. If the worksite of the new position is less than 50 miles from the worksite of the position held immediately before the move, but the employee must relocate (i.e., establish a new residence) to accept the position, an authorized agency official may waive the 50-mile requirement and pay the employee a relocation incentive subject to the requirements of this subpart. In all cases, the employee must establish a residence in the new geographic area before the agency may pay a relocation incentive to the employee. A relocation incentive may be paid only if the employee maintains residency in the new geographic area for the duration of the service agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A relocation incentive may be paid only when the employee's rating of record (or an official performance appraisal or evaluation under a system not covered by 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 or 5 CFR part 430) for the position held immediately before the move is at least ``Fully Successful'' or equivalent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An agency may not commence a relocation incentive service agreement during--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A period of employment established under any service agreement required for a recruitment incentive under 5 CFR part 575, subpart A, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A period of employment established under any service agreement required for a relocation incentive previously authorized under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An agency may commence a relocation incentive service agreement during a period of employment established under a service agreement for a previously authorized retention incentive or for which an employee is receiving previously authorized retention incentive payments without a service agreement under 5 CFR part 575, subpart C. The service period under such a relocation incentive service agreement and the service period required by the retention incentive service agreement, if applicable, must be fulfilled concurrently.
