In addition, any interested person, including the Postal Service or a public representative, may submit a petition to the Commission to initiate such a proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form and content of notice or petition. The notice of proceeding or petition shall identify the accepted analytical principle proposed for review, explain its perceived deficiencies, and suggest how those deficiencies should be remedied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the notice of proceeding or petition proposes that a specific alternative analytical principle be followed, it should include the data, analysis, and documentation on which the proposal is based, and, where feasible, include an estimate of the impact of the proposed change on the relevant characteristics of affected postal products, including their attributable cost, avoided cost, average revenue, or service attainment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the petitioner requests access to data from the Postal Service to support the assertions or conclusions in

its petition, and such data are not otherwise available, it shall accompany the petition with a request to gain access to such data.

To expedite its evaluation of the data request, the Commission may, after reasonable public notice, order that answers or objections be presented orally or in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedures for processing a notice or petition. To better evaluate a notice or petition to change an accepted analytical principle, the Commission may order that it be made the subject of discovery.

(1) After the conclusion of discovery procedures, if any, the Commission shall determine whether to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking based on the petition and the supporting material received. Such notice shall be evaluated by procedures that are consistent with 5 U.S.C. 553. Interested parties will be afforded an opportunity to present written comments and reply comments, and, if the Commission so orders, to present oral comments as well.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After the conclusion of discovery procedures, if any, the Commission shall determine whether to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking based on the petition and the supporting material received.
