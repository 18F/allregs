                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. If a taxpayer makes the election described in  paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.9004-1, he shall be deemed to have consented to  the application of the Act with respect to all the clay and shale  described in that paragraph for all taxable years for which the election  is effective whether or not the taxpayer is litigating the issue for any  of such years. Thus, in applying section 613 of the Internal Revenue  Code of 1954 (and corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code  of 1939) to those years:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The ``gross income from the property'' for purposes of section  613(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and corresponding  provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) shall be 50 percent of  the amount for which the mineowner or operator sold, during the taxable  year, the building or paving brick, drainage and roofing tile, sewer  pipe, flower pots, and kindred products manufactured from the clay and  shale described in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.9004-1, but shall not exceed  an amount equal to $12.50 multiplied by the number of short tons of all  such clay or shale mined and used by the mineowner or operator in the  manufacture of the products sold during the taxable year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The ``taxable income from the property'' (computed without  allowance for depletion) for purposes of section 613(a) of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1954 (and corresponding provisions of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1939) shall be 50 percent of the taxable income from the  manufactured products sold during the taxable year (computed without  allowance for depletion).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effect on depletion rates and other items. The election shall  have no effect on the applicable rate of percentage depletion for the  taxable years to which the election is effective. In applying the  election to the years affected there shall be taken into account the  effect that any adjustments resulting from the election shall have on  other items affected thereby, such as charitable contributions, foreign  tax credit, net operating loss, and the effect that adjustments to any  such items shall have on other taxable years. The provisions of the Act  are applicable with respect to taxable years subject to the Internal  Revenue Code of 1939 for purposes of applying sections 450 and 453 of  that Code.
