                            <p class="depth0">A new vessel that is a U.S. vessel must meet the following  subdivision and damage stability criteria after assuming side and bottom  damages, as defined in appendix B of this part. A U.S. vessel that meets  the requirements in this section is considered by   the Coast Guard as meeting 46 CFR 42.20-5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The final waterline, taking into account sinkage, heel, and  trim, must be below the lower edge of an opening through which  progressive flooding may take place, such as an air pipe, or any opening  that is closed by means of a weathertight door or hatch cover. This  opening does not include an opening closed by a:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Watertight manhole cover;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Flush scuttle;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Small watertight cargo tank hatch cover that maintains the high  integrity of the deck;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Remotely operated watertight sliding door; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Side scuttle of the non-opening type.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the final stage of flooding, the angle of heel due to  unsymmetrical flooding must not exceed 25 degrees, except that this  angle may be increased to 30 degrees if no deck edge immersion occurs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For acceptable stability in the final stage of flooding, the  righting lever curve must have a range of at least 20 degrees beyond the  position of equilibrium in association with a maximum residual righting  lever of at least 0.1 meter. For the calculations required in this  section, weathertight openings or openings fitted with automatic  closures (e.g., a vent fitted with a ball check valve), need not be  considered as points of downflooding within the range of residual  stability, but other openings must be accounted for in the calculation.
