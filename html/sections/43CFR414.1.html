This release may only take place in accordance with the Secretary's obligations under Federal law and may occur in either the year of storage or in years subsequent to storage; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Allow only voluntary interstate water transactions. These water transactions can help to satisfy regional water demands by increasing the efficiency, flexibility, and certainty in Colorado River management in accordance with the Secretary's authority under Article II (B) (6) of the Decree entered March 9, 1964 (376 U.S. 340) in the case of Arizona v. California, (373 U.S. 546) (1963), as supplemented and amended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What this part does not do.
