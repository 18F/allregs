                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The information specified in this section is required for shipments transmitted to the AES. The data elements identified as ``mandatory'' shall be reported for each transaction. The data elements identified as ``conditional'' shall be reported if they are required for or apply to the specific shipment. The data elements identified as ``optional'' may be reported at the discretion of the USPPI or the authorized agent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Mandatory data elements are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> USPPI and USPPI identification. The name, address, identification, and contact information of the USPPI shall be reported to the AES as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name of the USPPI. In all export transactions, the name listed in the USPPI field in the EEI shall be the USPPI in the transaction. (See Sec. 30.1 for the definition of the USPPI and Sec. 30.3 for details on the USPPI's reporting responsibilities.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Address of the USPPI. In all EEI filings, the USPPI shall report the address or location (no post office box number) from which the goods actually begin the journey to the port of export even if the USPPI does not own/lease the facility. For example, the EEI covering goods laden aboard a truck at a warehouse in Georgia for transport to Florida for loading onto a vessel for export to a foreign country shall show the address of the warehouse in Georgia. For shipments with multiple origins, report the address from which the commodity with the greatest value begins its export journey. If such information is not known, report the address in the state where the commodities are consolidated for export.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> USPPI identification number. The USPPI shall report its own IRS EIN in the USPPI field of the EEI. If the USPPI has only one EIN, report that EIN. If the USPPI has more than one EIN, report the EIN that the USPPI uses to report employee wages and withholdings, and not the EIN that is used to report only company earnings or receipts. If the USPPI does not have an EIN, the USPPI must obtain an EIN for reporting to the AES. Use of another company's or individual's EIN or other identification number is prohibited. The appropriate Party type code shall be reported through the AES. When a foreign entity is in the United States when the items are purchased or obtained for export, the foreign entity is the USPPI for filing purposes. In such situations, the foreign entity shall report a DUNS, border crossing number, passport number, or any number assigned by CBP.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Contact information. Show contact name and telephone number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Date of export. The date of export is the date when goods are scheduled to leave the port of export on the exporting carrier that is taking the goods out of the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ultimate consignee. The ultimate consignee is the person, party, or designee that is located abroad and actually receives the export shipment. The name and address of the ultimate consignee, whether by sale in the United States or abroad or by consignment, shall be reported in the EEI. The ultimate consignee as known at the time of export shall be reported. For shipments requiring an export license including shipments to international waters, the ultimate consignee reported in the AES shall be the person so designated on the export license or authorized to be the ultimate consignee under the applicable license exemption or exception in conformance with the EAR or ITAR, as applicable. For goods sold en route, report the appropriate ``To be Sold En Route'' indicator in the EEI, and report corrected information as soon as it is known (see Sec. 30.9 for procedures on correcting AES information).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> U.S. state of origin. The U.S. state of origin is the 2-character postal code for the state in which the goods begin their journey to the port of export. For example, a shipment covering goods laden aboard a truck at a warehouse in Georgia for transport to Florida for loading onto a vessel for export to a foreign country shall show Georgia as the state of origin. The U.S. state of origin may be different from the U.S.

state where the goods were produced, mined, or grown. For shipments of multi-state origin, reported as a single shipment, report the U.S. state of the commodity with the greatest value. If such information is not known, report the state in which the commodities are consolidated for export.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Country of ultimate destination. The country of ultimate destination is the country in which goods are to be consumed, further processed, stored, or manufactured, as known to the USPPI at the time of export. The country of ultimate destination is the code issued by the ISO.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Shipments under an export license, license exception or license exemption. For shipments under an export license or license exemption issued by the Department of State, DDTC or export license or license exception issued by the Department of Commerce, BIS, the country of ultimate destination shall conform to the country of ultimate destination as shown on the license. In the case of a Department of State license, the country of ultimate destination is the country specified with respect to the end user. For goods licensed by other government agencies, refer to their specific requirements concerning providing country of destination information. For shipments to international waters for items that are being exported pursuant to a BIS license exception or No License Required (NLR), the country of destination to be reported is the nationality of the person(s) or entity assuming control of the item(s) subject to the Export Administration Regulations that are being exported.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Shipments not moving under an export license. The country of ultimate destination is the country known to the USPPI at the time of exportation. The country to which the goods are being shipped is not the country of ultimate destination if the USPPI has knowledge at the time the goods leave the United States that they are intended for reexport or transshipment in their present form to another known country. For goods shipped to Canada, Mexico, Panama, Hong Kong, Belgium, United Arab Emirates, The Netherlands, or Singapore, for example, special care should be exercised before reporting these countries as the ultimate destination, since these are countries through which goods from the United States are frequently transshipped. If the USPPI does not know the ultimate destination of the goods, the country of destination to be shown is the last country, as known to the USPPI at the time of shipment from the United States, to which the goods are to be shipped in their present form. (For instructions as to the reporting of country of destination for vessels sold or transferred from the United States to foreign ownership, see Sec. 30.26.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For goods to be sold en route, report the country of the first port of call and then report corrected information as soon as it is known.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Method of transportation. The method of transportation is the means by which the goods are exported from the United States.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Conveyances exported under their own power. The mode of transportation for aircraft, vessels, or locomotives (railroad stock) transferring ownership or title and moving out of the United States under its own power is the mode of transportation by which the conveyance moves out of the United States.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exports through Canada, Mexico, or other foreign countries for transshipment to another destination. For transshipments through Canada, Mexico, or another foreign country, the mode of transportation is the mode of the carrier transporting the goods out of the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Conveyance name/carrier name. The conveyance name/carrier name is the name of the conveyance/carrier transporting the goods out of the United States as known at the time of exportation. For exports by sea, the conveyance name is the vessel name. For exports by air, rail, or truck, the carrier name is that which corresponds to the carrier identification as specified in paragraph (a)(8) of this section. Terms, such as airplane, train, rail, truck, vessel, barge, or international footbridge are not acceptable. For shipments by other methods of transportation, including mail, fixed methods (pipeline), the conveyance/carrier name is not required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Carrier identification. The carrier identification is the Standard Carrier

Alpha Code (SCAC) for vessel, rail, and truck shipments or the International Air Transport Association (IATA) code for air shipments. The carrier identification specifies the carrier that transports the goods out of the United States. The carrier transporting the goods to the port of export and the carrier transporting the goods out of the United States may be different. For vessel shipments, report the carrier identification code of the party whose booking number was reported in the AES. For transshipments through Canada, Mexico, or another foreign country, the carrier identification is that of the carrier that transports the goods out of the United States. For modes other than vessel, air, rail and truck valid methods of transportation, including but not limited to mail, fixed transport (pipeline), and passenger hand carried, the carrier identification is not required. The National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) issues and maintains the SCAC. (See www.nmfta.org.) The IATA issues and maintains the IATA codes. (See www.census.gov/trade for a list of IATA codes.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Port of export. The port of export is the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seaport or airport where the goods are loaded on the carrier that is taking the goods out of the United States, or the CBP port where exports by overland transportation cross the U.S. border into Canada or Mexico. For EEI reporting purposes only, for goods loaded aboard a conveyance (aircraft or vessel) that stops at several ports before clearing to the foreign country, the port of export is the first port where the goods were loaded on this conveyance. For goods off-loaded from the original conveyance to another conveyance (even if the aircraft or vessel belongs to the same carrier) at any of the ports, the port where the goods were loaded on the last conveyance before going foreign is the port of export. The port of export shall be reported in terms of Schedule D, ``Classification of CBP Districts and Ports.'' Use port code 8000 for shipments by mail.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Related party indicator. Used to indicate when a transaction involving trade between a USPPI and an ultimate consignee where either party owns directly or indirectly 10 percent or more of the other party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Domestic or foreign indicator. Indicates if the goods exported are of domestic or foreign origin. Report foreign goods separately from goods of domestic production even if the commodity classification number is the same.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Domestic. Exports of domestic goods include: Those commodities that are grown, produced, or manufactured (including commodities incorporating foreign components) in the United States, including goods exported from U.S. FTZs, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands; and those articles of foreign origin that have been enhanced in value or changed from the form in which they were originally imported by further manufacture or processing in the United States, including goods exported from U.S. FTZs, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Foreign. Exports of foreign goods include those commodities that are grown, produced, or manufactured in foreign countries that entered the United States including goods admitted to U.S. FTZs as imports and that, at the time of exportation, have undergone no change in form or condition or enhancement in value by further manufacture in the United States, in U.S. FTZs, in Puerto Rico, or in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Commodity classification number. Report the 10-digit commodity classification number as provided in Schedule B, Statistical Classification of Domestic and Foreign Commodities Exported from the United States in the EEI. The 10-digit commodity classification number provided in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUSA) may be reported in lieu of the Schedule B commodity classification number except as noted in the headnotes of the HTSUSA. The HTSUSA is a global classification system used to describe most world trade in goods. Furnishing the correct Schedule B or HTSUSA number does not relieve the USPPI or the authorized agent of furnishing a complete and accurate commodity description. When reporting the Schedule B number or HTSUSA number, the decimals shall be omitted. (See http://www.census.gov/

trade for a list of Schedule B classification numbers.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Commodity description. Report the description of the goods shipped in English in sufficient detail to permit verification of the Schedule B or HTSUSA number. Clearly and fully state the name of the commodity in terms that can be identified or associated with the language used in Schedule B or HTSUSA (usually the commercial name of the commodity), and any and all characteristics of the commodity that distinguish it from commodities of the same name covered by other Schedule B or HTSUSA classifications. If the shipment requires a license, the description reported in the EEI shall conform with that shown on the license. If the shipment qualifies for a license exemption, the description shall be sufficient to ensure compliance with that license exemption. However, where the description on the license does not state all of the characteristics of the commodity that are needed to completely verify the commodity classification number, as described in this paragraph, report the missing characteristics, as well as the description shown on the license, in the commodity description field of the EEI.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Primary unit of measure. The unit of measure shall correspond to the primary quantity as prescribed in the Schedule B or HTSUSA. If neither Schedule B nor HTSUSA specifies a unit of measure for the item, an ``X'' is required in the unit of measure field.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Primary quantity. The quantity is the total number of units that correspond to the first unit of measure specified in the Schedule B or HTSUSA. Where the unit of measure is in terms of weight (grams, kilograms, metric tons, etc.), the quantity reflects the net weight, not including the weight of barrels, boxes, or other bulky coverings, and not including salt or pickle in the case of salted or pickled fish or meats. For a few commodities where ``content grams'' or ``content kilograms'' or some similar weight unit is specified in Schedule B or HTSUSA, the quantity may be less than the net weight. The quantity is reported as a whole unit only, without commas or decimals. If the quantity contains a fraction of a whole unit, round fractions of one-half unit or more up and fractions of less than one-half unit down to the nearest whole unit. (For example, where the unit for a given commodity is in terms of ``tons,'' a net quantity of 8.4 tons would be reported as 8 for the quantity. If the quantity is less than one unit, the quantity is 1.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Shipping weight. The shipping weight is the weight in kilograms, which includes the weight of the commodity, as well as the weight of normal packaging, such as boxes, crates, barrels, etc. The shipping weight is required for exports by air, vessel, rail, and truck, and required for exports of household goods transported by all methods. For exports (except household goods) by mail, fixed transport (pipeline), or other valid methods, the shipping weight is not required and shall be reported as zero. For containerized cargo in lift vans, cargo vans, or similar substantial outer containers, the weight of such containers is not included in the shipping weight. If the shipping weight is not available for each Schedule B or HTSUSA item included in one or more containers, the approximate shipping weight for each item is estimated and reported. The total of these estimated weights equals the actual shipping weight of the entire container or containers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Value. In general, the value to be reported in the EEI shall be the value of the goods at the U.S. port of export in U.S. dollars. The value shall be the selling price (or the cost, if the goods are not sold), plus inland or domestic freight, insurance, and other charges to the U.S. seaport, airport, or land border port of export. Cost of goods is the sum of expenses incurred in the USPPI's acquisition or production of the goods. Report the value to the nearest dollar, omit cents. Fractions of a dollar less than 50 cents should be ignored, and fractions of 50 cents or more should be rounded up to the next dollar.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Selling price. The selling price for goods exported pursuant to sale, and the value to be reported in the EEI, is the USPPI's price to the FPPI (the foreign buyer). Deduct from the selling price any unconditional discounts, but

do not deduct discounts that are conditional upon a particular act or performance on the part of the foreign buyer. For goods shipped on consignment without a sale actually having been made at the time of export, the selling price to be reported in the EEI is the market value at the time of export at the U.S. port.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Adjustments. When necessary, make the following adjustments to obtain the value.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Where goods are sold at a point other than the port of export, freight, insurance, and other charges required in moving the goods from their U.S. point of origin to the exporting carrier at the port of export or border crossing point shall be added to the selling price (as defined in paragraph (a)(17)(i) of this section) for purposes of reporting the value in the EEI.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Where the actual amount of freight, insurance, and other domestic costs is not available, an estimate of the domestic costs shall be made and added to the cost of the goods or selling price to derive the value to be reported in the EEI. Add the estimated domestic costs to the cost or selling price of the goods to obtain the value to be reported in the EEI.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Where goods are sold at a ``delivered'' price to the foreign destination, the cost of loading the goods on the exporting carrier, if any, and freight, insurance, and other costs beyond the port of export shall be subtracted from the selling price for purposes of reporting value in the EEI. If the actual amount of such costs is not available, an estimate of the costs should be subtracted from the selling price.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Costs added to or subtracted from the selling price in accordance with the instructions in this paragraph (a)(17)(ii) should not be shown separately in the EEI, but the value reported should be the value after making such adjustments, where required, to arrive at the value of the goods at the U.S. port of export.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Exclusions. Exclude the following from the selling price of goods exported.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Commissions to be paid by the USPPI to its agent abroad or commissions to be deducted from the selling price by the USPPI's agent abroad.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The cost of loading goods on the exporting carrier at the port of export.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Freight, insurance, and any other charges or transportation costs beyond the port of export.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Any duties, taxes, or other assessments imposed by foreign countries.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For definitions of the value to be reported in the EEI for special types of transactions where goods are not being exported pursuant to commercial sales, or where subsidies, government financing or participation, or other unusual conditions are involved, see Subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> Export information code. A code that identifies the type of export shipment or condition of the exported items (e.g., goods donated for relief or charity, impelled shipments, shipments under the Foreign Military Sales program, household goods, and all other shipments). (For the list of the codes see Appendix B.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(19)</em> Shipment reference number. A unique identification number assigned by the filer that allows for the identification of the shipment in the filer's system. The reuse of the shipment reference number is prohibited.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(20)</em> Line number. A number that identifies the specific commodity line item within a shipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(21)</em> Hazardous material indicator. An indicator that identifies whether the shipment is hazardous as defined by the Department of Transportation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(22)</em> Inbond code. The code indicating whether the shipment is being transported under bond.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(23)</em> License code/license exemption code. The code that identifies the commodity as having a federal government agency requirement for a license, permit, authorization, license exception or exemption or that no license is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(24)</em> Routed export transaction indicator. An indicator that identifies that the shipment is a routed export transaction as defined in Sec. 30.3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(25)</em> Shipment filing action request indicator. An indicator that allows the filer to add, change, replace, or cancel an export shipment transaction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(26)</em> Line item filing action request indicator. An indicator that allows the filer to add, change, or delete a commodity

line within an export shipment transaction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(27)</em> Filing option indicator. An indicator of whether the filer is reporting export information predeparture or postdeparture. See Sec. 30.4 for more information on EEI filing options.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(28)</em> Ultimate consignee type. Provide the business function of the ultimate consignee that most often applies. If more than one type applies to the ultimate consignee, report the type that applies most often. For purposes of this paragraph, the ultimate consignee will be designated as a Direct Consumer, Government Entity, Reseller, or Other/Unknown, defined as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Direct Consumer--a non-government institution, enterprise, or company that will consume or use the exported good as a consumable, for its own internal processes, as an input to the production of another good or as machinery or equipment that is part of a manufacturing process or a provision of services and will not resell or distribute the good.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Government Entity--a government-owned or government-controlled agency, institution, enterprise, or company.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reseller--a non-government reseller, retailer, wholesaler, distributor, distribution center or trading company.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Other/Unknown--an entity that is not a Direct Consumer, Government Entity or Reseller, as defined above, or whose ultimate consignee type is not known at the time of export.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conditional data elements are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Authorized agent and authorized agent identification. The authorized agent is the person or entity in the United States who is authorized by the USPPI or the FPPI to prepare and file the EEI or the person or entity, if any, named on the export license. If an authorized agent is used, the following information shall be provided to the AES:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> U.S. Authorized agent's identification number. Report the U.S. authorized agent's own EIN or DUNS for the first shipment and for each subsequent shipment. Use of another company's or individual's EIN or other identification number is prohibited. The party ID type of agent identification (E=EIN, D=DUNS) shall be indicated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Name of the authorized agent. Report the name of the authorized agent. (See Sec. 30.3 for details on the specific reporting responsibilities of authorized agents and Subpart B of this part for export control licensing requirements for authorized agents.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Address of the authorized agent. Report the address or location (no post office box number) of the authorized agent. The authorized agent's address shall be reported with the initial shipment. Subsequent shipments may be identified by the agent's identification number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Contact information. Report the contact name and telephone number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Intermediate consignee. The name and address of the intermediate consignee (if any) shall be reported. The intermediate consignee acts in a foreign country as an agent for the principal party in interest or the ultimate consignee for the purpose of effecting delivery of the export shipment to the ultimate consignee. The intermediate consignee is the person named as such on the export license or authorized to act as such under the applicable general license and in conformity with the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> FTZ identifier. If goods are removed from a FTZ and not entered for consumption, report the FTZ identifier. This is the unique 7-digit alphanumeric identifier assigned by the Foreign Trade Zone Board that identifies the FTZ, subzone or site from which goods are withdrawn for export.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Foreign port of unlading. The foreign port of unlading is the foreign port in the country where the goods are removed from the exporting carrier. The foreign port does not have to be located in the country of destination. For exports by sea to foreign countries, not including Puerto Rico, the foreign port of unlading is the code in terms of Schedule K, Classification of Foreign Ports by Geographic Trade Area and Country. For exports by sea or air between the United States and Puerto Rico, the foreign port of unlading is the code in terms of Schedule D, Classification of CBP Districts and Ports. The foreign port of unlading is not required

for exports by other modes of transportation, including rail, truck, mail, fixed (pipeline), or air (unless between the U.S. and Puerto Rico).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Export license number/CFR citation/KPC number. License number, permit number, citation, or authorization number assigned by the Department of Commerce, BIS; Department of State, DDTC; Department of the Treasury, OFAC; Department of Justice, DEA; Nuclear Regulatory Commission; or any other federal government agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Export Control Classification Number (ECCN). The number used to identify items on the CCL, Supplement No. 1 to Part 774 of the EAR. The ECCN consists of a set of digits and a letter. Items that are not classified under an ECCN are designated ``EAR99''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Secondary unit of measure. The unit of measure that corresponds to the secondary quantity as prescribed in the Schedule B or HTSUSA. If neither Schedule B nor HTSUSA specifies a secondary unit of measure for the item, the unit of measure is not required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Secondary quantity. The total number of units that correspond to the secondary unit of measure, if any, specified in the Schedule B or HTSUSA. See the definition of primary quantity for specific instructions on reporting the quantity as a weight and whole unit, rounding fractions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)/Product ID. The identification number found on the reported used vehicle. For used self-propelled vehicles that do not have a VIN, the Product ID is reported. ``Used'' vehicle refers to any self-propelled vehicle where the equitable or legal title to which has been transferred by a manufacturer, distributor, or dealer to an ultimate purchaser. See U.S. Customs and Border Protection regulations 19 CFR 192.1 for more information on exports of used vehicles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Vehicle ID qualifier.

For goods imported into the United States for export to a third country of ultimate destination, where the importer of record on the entry is a foreign entity, the USPPI will be the authorized agent designated by the foreign importer for service of process. The USPPI, in this circumstance, is required to report the import entry number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Transportation reference number (TRN). The TRN is as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Vessel shipments. Report the booking number for vessel shipments. The booking number is the reservation number assigned by the carrier to hold space on the vessel for cargo being exported. The TRN is required for all vessel shipments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Air shipments. Report the master air waybill number for air shipments. The air waybill number is the reservation number assigned by the carrier to hold space on the aircraft for cargo being exported.
