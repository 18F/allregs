                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Allowance of deduction. Section 812 provides that a life insurance company shall be allowed a deduction in computing gain or loss from operations for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, in an amount equal to the aggregate of the operations loss carryovers and operations loss carrybacks to such taxable year. This deduction is referred to as the operations loss deduction. The loss from operations (computed under section 809), is the basis for the computation of the operations loss carryovers and operations loss carrybacks and ultimately for the operations loss deduction itself. Section 809(e)(5) provides that the net operating loss deduction provided in section 172 shall not be allowed a life insurance company since the operations loss deduction provided in section 812 and this paragraph shall be allowed in lieu thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Steps in computation of operations loss deduction. The three steps to be taken in the ascertainment of the operations loss deduction for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compute the loss from operations for any preceding or succeeding taxable year from which a loss from operations may be carried over or carried back to such taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Compute the operations loss carryovers to such taxable year from such preceding taxable years and the operations loss carrybacks to such taxable year from such succeeding taxable years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Add such operations loss carryovers and carrybacks in order to determine the operations loss deduction for such taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Statement with tax return. Every life insurance company claiming an operations loss deduction for any taxable year shall file with its return for such year a concise statement setting forth the amount of the operations loss deduction claimed and all material and pertinent facts relative thereto, including a detailed schedule showing the computation of the operations loss deduction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Ascertainment of deduction dependent upon operations loss carryback. If a life insurance company is entitled in computing its operations loss deduction to a carryback which it is not able to ascertain at the time its return is due, it shall compute the operations loss deduction on its return without regard to such operations loss carryback. When the life insurance company ascertains the operations loss carryback, it may within the applicable period of limitations file a claim for credit or refund of the overpayment, if any, resulting from the failure to compute the operations loss deduction for the taxable year with the inclusion of such carryback; or it may file an application under the provisions of section 6411 for a tentative carryback adjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Law applicable to computations. The following rules shall apply to all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In determining the amount of any operations loss carryback or carryover to any taxable year, the necessary computations involving any other taxable year shall be made under the law applicable to such other taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The loss from operations for any taxable year shall be determined under the law applicable to that year without regard to the year to which it is to be carried and in which, in effect, it is to be deducted as part of the operations loss deduction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amount of the operations loss deduction which shall be allowed for

any taxable year shall be determined under the law applicable for that year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Special rules. For purposes of taxable years beginning after December 31, 1954, and before January 1, 1958:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount of any:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Loss from operations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Operations loss carryback; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Operations loss carryover
shall be computed as if part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code (as in effect for 1958) and section 381(c)(22) applied to such taxable years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A loss from operations (determined in accordance with the provisions of section 812(b)(1)(C) and this paragraph) for such taxable years shall in no way affect the tax liability of any life insurance company for such taxable years. However, such loss may, to the extent allowed as an operations loss carryover under section 812, affect the tax liability of a life insurance company for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957. For example, for the taxable year 1956, X, a life insurance company, has a loss from operations (determined in accordance with the provisions of section 812(b)(1)(C) and this paragraph). Such loss shall in no way affect X's tax liability for the taxable years 1956 (the year of the loss), 1955 (a year to which such loss shall be carried back), or 1957 (a year to which such loss shall be carried forward). However, to the extent allowed under section 812, any amount of the loss for 1956 remaining after such carryback and carryforward shall be taken into account in determining X's tax liability for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957.
