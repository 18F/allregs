                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. The following requirements apply to  disclosures required in advertisements under Sec. Sec. 308.3 (b)-(d),  and (f):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The disclosures shall be made in the same language as that  principally used in the advertisement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Television video and print disclosures shall be of a color or  shade that readily contrasts with the background of the advertisement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In print advertisements, disclosures shall be parallel with the  base of the advertisement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Audio disclosures, whether in television or radio, shall be  delivered in a slow and deliberate manner and in a reasonably  understandable volume.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Nothing contrary to, inconsistent with, or in mitigation of, the  required disclosures shall be used in any advertisement in any medium;  nor shall any audio, video or print technique be used that is likely to  detract significantly from the communication of the disclosures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In any program-length commercial, required disclosures shall be  made at least three times (unless more frequent disclosure is otherwise  required) near the beginning, middle and end of the commercial.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cost of the call. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provider of pay-per-call services  shall clearly and conspicuously disclose the cost of the call, in Arabic  numerals, in any advertisement for the pay-per-call service, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If there is a flat fee for the call, the advertisement shall  state the total cost of the call.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the call is billed on a time-sensitive basis, the  advertisement shall state the cost per minute and any minimum charges.  If the length of the program can be determined in advance,   the advertisement shall also state the maximum charge that could be  incurred if the caller listens to the complete program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the call is billed on a variable rate basis, the  advertisement shall state, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 308.3(b)(1) (i)  and (ii), the cost of the initial portion of the call, any minimum  charges, and the range of rates that may be charged depending on the  options chosen by the caller.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The advertisement shall disclose any other fees that will be  charged for the service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> if the caller may be transferred to another pay-per-call  service, the advertisement shall disclose the cost of the other call, in  accordance with Sec. Sec. 308.3(b)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of Sec. 308.3(b), disclosures shall be made  ``clearly and conspicuously'' as set forth in Sec. 308.3(a) and as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In a television or videotape advertisement, the video disclosure  shall appear adjacent to each video presentation of the pay-per-call  number. However, in an advertisement displaying more than one pay-per- call number with the same cost, the video disclosure need only appear  adjacent to the largest presentation of the pay-per-call number. Each  letter or numeral of the video disclosure shall be, at a minimum, one- half the size of each letter or numeral of the pay-per-call number to  which the disclosure is adjacent. In addition, the video disclosure  shall appear on the screen for the duration of the presentation of the  pay-per-call number. An audio disclosure shall be made at least once,  simultaneously with a video presentation of the disclosure. However, no  audio presentation of the disclosure is required in: (A) An  advertisement fifteen (15) seconds or less in length in which the pay- per-call number is not presented in the audio portion, or (B) an  advertisement in which there is no audio presentation of information  regarding the pay-per-call service, including the pay-per-call number.  In an advertisement in which the pay-per-call number is presented only  in the audio portion, the cost of the call shall be delivered  immediately following the first and last delivery of the pay-per-call  number, except that in a program-length commercial, the disclosure shall  be delivered immediately following each delivery of the pay-per-call  number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In a print advertisement, the disclosure shall be placed  adjacent to each presentation of the pay-per-call number. However, in an  advertisement displaying more than one pay-per-call number with the same  cost, the disclosure need only appear adjacent to the largest  presentation of the pay-per-call number. Each letter or numeral of the  disclosure shall be, at a minimum, one-half the size of each letter or  numeral of the pay-per-call number to which the disclosure is adjacent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In a radio advertisement, the disclosure shall be made at  least once, and shall be delivered immediately following the first  delivery of the pay-per-call number. In a program-length commercial, the  disclosure shall be delivered immediately following each delivery of the  pay-per-call number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sweepstakes; games of chance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provider of pay-per-call  services that advertises a prize or award or a service or product at no  cost or for a reduced cost, to be awarded to the winner of any  sweepstakes, including games of chance, shall clearly and conspicuously  disclose in the advertisement the odds of being able to receive the  prize, award, service, or product at no cost or reduced cost. If the  odds are not calculable in advance, the advertisement shall disclose the  factors used in calculating the odds. Either the advertisement or the  preamble required by Sec. 308.5(a) for such service shall clearly and  conspicuously disclose that no call to the pay-per-call service is  required to participate, and shall also disclose the existence of a free  alternative method of entry, and either instructions on how to enter, or  a local or toll-free telephone number or address to which consumers may  call or write for information on how to enter the sweepstakes. Any  description or characterization of the prize, award, service, or product  that is being offered at no cost or reduced cost shall be truthful and  accurate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of Sec. 308.3(c), disclosures shall be made  ``clearly and conspicuously'' as set forth in Sec. 308.3(a) and as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In a television or videotape advertisement, the disclosures may  be made in either the audio or video portion of the advertisement.

Advertisements providing information  on a Federal program shall include, but not be limited to,  advertisements that contain a seal, insignia, trade or brand name, or  any other term or symbol that reasonably could be interpreted or  construed as implying any Federal government connection, approval, or  endorsement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of Sec. 308.3(d), disclosures shall be made  ``clearly and conspicuously'' as set forth in Sec. 308.3(a) and as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In a television or videotape advertisement, the disclosure may  be made in either the audio or video portion of the advertisement.

The disclosure shall begin within  the first fifteen (15) seconds of the advertisement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In a print advertisement, the disclosure shall appear in a  sufficient size and prominence and such location to be readily  noticeable, readable and comprehensible. The disclosure shall appear in  the top one-third of the advertisement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In a radio advertisement, the disclosure shall begin within  the first fifteen (15) seconds of the advertisement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Prohibition on advertising to children. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provider of pay- per-call services shall not direct advertisements for such pay-per-call  services to children under the age of 12, unless the service is a bona  fide educational service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the purposes of this regulation, advertisements directed to  children under 12 shall include: any pay-per-call advertisement  appearing during or immediately adjacent to programming for which  competent and reliable audience composition data demonstrate that more  than 50% of the audience is composed of children under 12, and any pay- per-call advertisement appearing in a periodical for which competent and  reliable readership data demonstrate that more than 50% of the  readership is composed of children under 12.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For the purposes of this regulation, if competent and reliable  audience composition or readership data does not demonstrate that more  than 50% of the audience or readership is composed of children under 12,  then the Commission shall consider the following criteria in determining  whether an advertisement is directed to children under 12:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the advertisement appears in a publication directed to  children under 12, including, but not limited to, books, magazines and  comic books;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the advertisement appears during or immediately  adjacent to television programs directed to children under 12,  including, but not limited to, children's programming as defined by the  Federal Communications Commission, animated programs, and after-school  programs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether the advertisement appears on a television station or  channel directed to children under 12;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the advertisement is broadcast during or immediately  adjacent to radio programs directed to children under 12, or broadcast  on a radio station directed to children under 12;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Whether the advertisement appears on the same video as a  commercially-prepared video directed to children under 12, or preceding  a movie directed to children under 12 shown in a movie theater;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Whether the advertisement or promotion appears on product  packaging directed to children under 12; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Whether the advertisement, regardless of when or where it  appears, is directed to children under 12 in light of its subject  matter, visual content, age of models, language, characters, tone,  message, or the like.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Advertising to individuals under the age of 18. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provider  of pay-per-call services shall ensure that any pay-per-call  advertisement directed primarily to individuals under the age of 18  shall contain a clear and conspicuous disclosure that all individuals  under the age of 18 must have the permission of such individual's parent  or legal guardian prior to calling such pay-per-call service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of Sec. 308.3(f), disclosures shall be made  ``clearly and conspicuously'' as set forth in Sec. 308.3(a) and as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In a television or videotape advertisement, each letter or  numeral of the video disclosure shall be, at a minimum, one-half the  size of each letter or numeral of the largest presentation of the pay- per-call number.
