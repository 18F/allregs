                            <p class="depth0">Authorized common carriers may interchange equipment under the  following conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Interchange agreement. There shall be a written contract, lease,  or other arrangement providing for the interchange and specifically  describing the equipment to be interchanged. This written agreement  shall set forth the specific points of interchange, how the equipment is  to be used, and the compensation for such use. The interchange agreement  shall be signed by the parties or by their authorized representatives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Operating authority. The carriers participating in the  interchange shall be registered with the Secretary to provide the  transportation of the commodities at the point where the physical  exchange occurs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Through bills of lading. The traffic transported in interchange  service must move on through bills of lading issued by the originating  carrier. The rates charged and the revenues collected must be accounted  for in the same manner as if there had been no interchange. Charges for  the use of the interchanged equipment shall be kept separate from  divisions of the joint rates or the proportions of such rates accruing  to the carriers by the application of local or proportional rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Identification of equipment. The authorized common carrier  receiving the   equipment shall identify equipment operated by it in interchange service  as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The authorized common carrier shall identify power units in  accordance with the FMCSA's requirements in 49 CFR part 390 of this  chapter (Identification of Vehicles). Before giving up possession of the  equipment, the carrier shall remove all identification showing it as the  operating carrier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless a copy of the interchange agreement is carried on the  equipment, the authorized common carrier shall carry a statement with  each vehicle during interchange service certifying that it is operating  the equipment. The statement shall also identify the equipment by  company or State registration number and shall show the specific point  of interchange, the date and time it assumes responsibility for the  equipment, and the use to be made of the equipment. This statement shall  be signed by the parties to the interchange agreement or their  authorized representatives. The requirements of this paragraph shall not  apply where the equipment to be operated in interchange service consists  only of trailers or semitrailers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Authorized carriers under common ownership and control may  interchange equipment with each other without complying with the  requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section pertaining to removal  of identification from equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Connecting carriers considered as owner--An authorized carrier  receiving equipment in connection with a through movement shall be  considered to the owner of the equipment for the purpose of leasing the  equipment to other authorized carriers in furtherance of the movement to  destination or the return of the equipment after the movement is  completed.
