                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When reduction is effective. A reduction for other disability  benefits begins with the first month the employee is receiving both a  disability annuity and workers' compensation or a public disability  benefit. The reduction ends with the month before the month in which the  employee becomes 65 years old or with the month in which the workers  compensation or public disability benefit ends.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amount of reduction. The reduction for other disability benefits  equals the difference between--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The total tier I rates of the employee, spouse, and divorced  spouse, before any reductions (age, public pension, social security  benefits, etc.) plus the monthly amount of the workers' compensation of  public disability benefit; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The higher of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Eighty percent of the employee's average current earnings, as  defined in this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The total tier I rates, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of  this section.</p><p class="depth4">Example 1: Harold is entitled to a monthly disability annuity with a  tier I component of $507 and a monthly public disability benefit of $410  from the state. Eighty percent of Harold's average current earnings is  $800. Because this amount is higher than Harold's tier I component, to  determine the reduction for other disability benefits the Board  subtracts this amount ($800) from the total of Harold's tier I component  ($507) and public disability benefit ($410) which results in a reduction  amount of $117 ($917-$800). This leaves Harold with a reduced tier I  amount of $390 ($507-$117).</p><p class="depth4">Example 2: Tom is entitled to a disability annuity with a tier I  component of $560. His wife and divorced wife are both entitled to  annuities with tier I components of $280 each. Total benefits are  $1,120. Tom is receiving a monthly workers' compensation benefit of $500  from the state. Eighty percent of Tom's average current earnings is  $820. Because the total benefit ($1,120) is higher than Tom's average  current earnings, to determine the reduction for other disability  benefits the Board subtracts this amount from $1,620 ($1,120 plus $500)  which results in a reduction amount of $500. This means that the tier I  of the spouse and divorced spouse annuity are each reduced by $250.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Average current earnings, defined. An employee's ``average  current earnings'' is the highest of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The average monthly wage (AMW) used to compute the tier I AMW  PIA. (The earnings are not indexed, even if the tier I PIA which is  being paid is based on average indexed monthly earnings. See part 225 of  this chapter.); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> One-sixtieth of the employee's total earnings covered under  either the Social Security or Railroad Retirement Acts (including  earnings that exceed the maximum earnings used in computing social  security benefits) for the five consecutive years after 1950 in which  the employee had the highest earnings. The result, if not a multiple of  $1, is rounded to the next lower multiple of $1; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> One-twelfth of the employee's total earnings covered under  either the Social Security or Railroad Retirement Acts (including  earnings that exceed the maximum earnings used in computing social  security benefits) for the year of highest earnings in the period which  includes the year in which the employee became disabled and the five  preceding years. The result, if not a multiple of $1, is rounded to the  next lower multiple of $1.</p>
