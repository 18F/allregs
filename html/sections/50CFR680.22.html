                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The regulations in this section restrict the owners of vessels with  a history of participation in the Bering Sea snow crab fishery from  using the increased flexibility provided by the CR Program to expand  their level of participation in GOA groundfish fisheries. These  restrictions are commonly known as ``sideboards.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Vessels and LLP licenses subject to sideboard restrictions. The  sideboard fishing restrictions described in this section are based on a  vessel's fishing history and apply both to the fishing vessel itself and  to any LLP license generated by that vessel's fishing history. The  criteria used to determine which vessels and LLP licenses are subject to  GOA groundfish sideboard fishing restrictions are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Vessels subject to GOA groundfish sideboard directed fishing  closures. Any vessel that NMFS has determined meets one or both of the  following criteria is subject to GOA groundfish sideboard directed  fishing closures issued under paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any non-AFA vessel that made a legal landing of Bering Sea snow  crab (C. opilio) between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2000, that  generated any amount of Bering Sea snow crab (C. opilio) fishery QS; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any vessel named on an LLP license that was generated in whole  or in part by the fishing history of a vessel meeting the criteria in  paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Vessels prohibited from directed fishing for Pacific cod in the  GOA. Any vessel that NMFS has determined meets either of the following  two criteria is prohibited from directed fishing for Pacific cod in the  GOA:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this section that landed less   than 50 mt (110,231 lb), in round weight equivalents, of groundfish  harvested from the GOA between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2000,  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any vessel named on an LLP license that was generated in whole  or in part by the fishing history of a vessel meeting the criteria in  paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Vessels and LLP licenses exempt from Pacific cod sideboard  closures in the GOA. Any vessel or LLP license that NMFS has determined  meets either of the following criteria is exempt from sideboard directed  fishing closures for Pacific cod in the GOA:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this section that landed less than 750,000 lb (340.2 mt),  in raw weight equivalents, of Bering Sea snow crab and more than 680 mt  (1,499,143 lb), in round weight equivalents, of Pacific cod harvested  from the GOA between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2000; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any LLP license that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Was initially issued based on the catch history of a vessel  meeting the criteria in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Did not generate crab QS based on legal landings from any vessel  other than the vessel meeting the criteria in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Vessels and LLP licenses exempt from pollock sideboard closures  in the GOA. Any vessel or LLP license that NMFS has determined meets  either of the following criteria is exempt from sideboard directed  fishing closures for pollock in the GOA:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this section that landed less than 1,212,673 lb (550 mt),  in raw weight equivalents, of Bering Sea snow crab, and had 20 or more  legal landings of pollock harvested from the GOA between January 1,  1996, and December 31, 2000; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any LLP license that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Was initially issued based on the catch history of a vessel  meeting the criteria in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Did not generate crab QS based on legal landings from any vessel  other than the vessel meeting the criteria in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notification of affected vessel owners and LLP license holders.  After NMFS determines which vessels and LLP licenses meet the criteria  described in paragraph (a) of this section, NMFS will inform each vessel  owner and LLP license holder in writing of the type of sideboard  restriction and issue a revised Federal Fisheries Permit and/or LLP  license that displays the restriction on the face of the permit or  license.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appeals. A vessel owner or LLP license holder who believes that  NMFS has incorrectly identified his or her vessel or LLP license as  meeting the criteria for a GOA groundfish sideboard restriction may  request reconsideration. All requests for reconsideration must be  submitted in writing to the RAM Division, Alaska Region, NMFS, together  with any documentation or evidence supporting the request. If the  request for reconsideration is denied, affected persons may appeal using  the procedures described at Sec. 680.43.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determination of GOA groundfish sideboard ratios. Except for  fixed gear sablefish, sideboard ratios for each GOA groundfish species,  species group, season, operation type, gear type, and area, for which  annual specifications are made, are established according to the  following formulas:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section and that do not meet the criteria in paragraphs  (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section by the total retained catch of Pacific  cod by all groundfish vessels between 1996 and 2000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pollock. The sideboard ratios for pollock are calculated by  dividing the aggregate retained catch of pollock by vessels that are  subject to sideboard directed fishing closures under paragraph (a)(1) of  this section and that do not meet the criteria in paragraph (a)(4) of  this section by the total retained catch of pollock by all groundfish  vessels between 1996 and 2000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Groundfish other than Pacific cod and pollock. The sideboard  ratios for   groundfish species and species groups other than Pacific cod and pollock  are calculated by dividing the aggregate landed catch by vessels subject  to sideboard directed fishing closures under paragraph (a)(1) of this  section by the total landed catch of that species by all groundfish  vessels between 1996 and 2000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Conversion of sideboard ratios into annual sideboard harvest  limits. NMFS will convert sideboard ratios into annual sideboard harvest  limits according to the following procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Annual sideboard harvest limits. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in  paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, annual sideboard harvest limits  for each groundfish species, except fixed-gear sablefish, will be  established by multiplying the sideboard ratios calculated under  paragraph (d) of this section by the proposed and final TACs in each  area for which a TAC is specified. If a TAC is further apportioned by  season, the sideboard harvest limit also will be apportioned by season  in the same ratio as the overall TAC. The resulting harvest limits  expressed in metric tons will be published in the annual GOA groundfish  harvest specification notices.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii))</em>.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Central GOA. For the Central GOA Regulatory Area (Statistical  Areas 620 and 630; see Figure 3 to 50 CFR part 679), the holders of all  LLP licenses listed in Column A of Table 10 to this part must submit to  NMFS a completed Request to Extinguish Pacific Cod Sideboard Limits for  Hook-and-Line Catcher/Processors in the Western or Central GOA, and the  request must be received by NMFS on or before May 18, 2016.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Western GOA. For the Western GOA Regulatory Area (Statistical  Area 610; see Figure 3 to 50 CFR part 679), the holders of all LLP  licenses listed in Column B of Table 10 to this part must submit to NMFS  a completed Request to Extinguish Pacific Cod Sideboard Limits for Hook- and-Line Catcher/Processors in the Western or Central GOA, and the  request must be received by NMFS on or before May 18, 2016.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sideboard directed fishing allowance. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the Regional  Administrator determines that a harvest limit for a species or species  group has been or will be reached, the Regional Administrator may  establish a sideboard directed fishing allowance for the species or  species group applicable only to the group of crab vessels to which the  sideboard limit applies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the Regional Administrator determines that a harvest limit  is insufficient to support a directed fishery for that species or  species group, then the Regional Administrator may set the sideboard  directed fishing allowance at zero for that species or species group.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Directed fishing closures. Upon attainment of a sideboard  directed fishing allowance, the Regional Administrator will publish  notification in the Federal Register prohibiting directed fishing for  the species or species group in the specified subarea, regulatory area,  or district. A directed fishing closure is effective for the duration of  the fishing year or season.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Sideboard protections in the State of Alaska parallel groundfish  fisheries. Vessels subject to the sideboard restrictions under paragraph  (a) of this section, with a Federal Fisheries Permit or LLP license,  shall be subject to the regulations of this section while participating  in any groundfish fishery in State waters adjacent to the GOA   opened by the State of Alaska and for which the State of Alaska adopts a  Federal fishing season.  [70 FR 10241, Mar. 2, 2005, as amended at 71 FR 38301, July 6, 2006; 76  FR 35780, June 20, 2011; 76 FR 74690, Dec. 1, 2011; 80 FR 28545, May 19,  2015]</p>
