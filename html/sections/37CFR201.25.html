This section prescribes the procedures relating to the submission of Visual Arts Registry Statements by visual artists and owners of buildings, or their duly authorized representatives, for recordation in the Copyright Office under section 113(d)(3) of title 17 of the United States Code, as amended by Public Law 101-650, effective June 1, 1991.

Either the artist or owner of the building or both may record statements updating previously recorded information by submitting an updated statement and paying the recording fee specified in paragraph (d) of this section. Such statements should repeat the information disclosed in the previous filing as regarding the name of the artist(s), the name of the work(s) of visual art, the name and address of the building, and the name of the owner(s) of the building. The remaining portion of the statement should correct or supplement the information disclosed in the previously recorded statement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fee.

The date of recordation is the date when all of the elements required for recordation, including the prescribed fee have been received in the Copyright Office. After recordation of the statement, the sender will receive a certificate of record from the Copyright Office. Any documentation or photographs accompanying any submission will be retained and filed by the Copyright Office. They may also be transferred to the Library of Congress, or destroyed after preparing suitable copies, in accordance with usual procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effect of recordation. The Copyright Office will record statements in the Visual Arts Registry without examination or verification of the accuracy or completeness of the statement, if the statement is designated as a ``Visual Arts Registry Statement'' and pertains to a work of visual art incorporated in or made part of a building. Recordation of the statement and payment of the recording fee shall establish only the fact of recordation in the official record. Acceptance for recordation shall not be considered a determination that the statement is accurate, complete, and otherwise in compliance with section 113(d), title 17, U.S. Code. The accuracy and completeness of the statement is the responsibility of the artist or building owner who submits it for recordation. Artists and building owners are encouraged to submit accurate and complete statements. Omission of any information, however, shall not itself invalidate the recordation, unless a court of competent jurisdiction finds the statement is materially deficient and fails to meet the minimum requirements of section 113(d) of title 17, U.S. Code.
