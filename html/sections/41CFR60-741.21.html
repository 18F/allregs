                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The term discrimination includes, but is not limited to, the  acts described in this section and Sec. 60-741.23.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disparate treatment. It is unlawful for the contractor to deny  an employment opportunity or benefit or otherwise to discriminate  against a qualified individual on the basis of disability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limiting, segregating and classifying. Unless otherwise  permitted by this part, it is unlawful for the contractor to limit,  segregate, or classify a job applicant or employee in a way that  adversely affects his or her employment opportunities or status on the  basis of disability. For example, the contractor may not segregate  employees into separate work areas or into separate lines of advancement  on the basis of disability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Contractual or other arrangements--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. It is  unlawful for the contractor to participate in a contractual or other  arrangement or relationship that has the effect of subjecting the  contractor's own qualified applicant or employee with a disability to  the discrimination prohibited by this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contractual or other arrangement defined. The phrase  contractual or other arrangement or relationship includes, but is not  limited to, a relationship with: an employment or referral agency; a  labor organization, including a collective bargaining agreement; an  organization providing fringe benefits to an employee of the contractor;  or an organization providing training and apprenticeship programs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Application. This paragraph (a)(3) applies to the contractor,  with respect to its own applicants or employees, whether the contractor  offered the contract or initiated the relationship, or whether the  contractor accepted the contract or acceded to the relationship. The  contractor is not liable for the actions of the other party or parties  to the contract which only affect that other party's employees or  applicants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Standards, criteria or methods of administration. It is unlawful  for the contractor to use standards, criteria, or methods of  administration, that are not job-related and consistent with business  necessity, and that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Have the effect of discriminating on the basis of disability; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Perpetuate the discrimination of others who are subject to  common administrative control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Relationship or association with an individual with a  disability. It is unlawful for the contractor to exclude or deny equal  jobs or benefits to, or otherwise discriminate against, a qualified  individual because of the known disability of an individual with whom  the qualified individual is known to have a family, business, social, or  other relationship or association.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Not making reasonable accommodation. (i) It is unlawful for the  contractor to fail to make reasonable accommodation to the known  physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified applicant or  employee with a disability as defined in Sec. Sec. 60-741.2(g)(1)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> or  (ii), unless such contractor can demonstrate that the accommodation  would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its business.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It is unlawful for the contractor to deny employment  opportunities to an otherwise qualified job applicant or employee with a  disability based on the need of such contractor to make reasonable  accommodation to such an individual's physical or mental impairments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The reasonable accommodation obligation extends to the  contractor's use of electronic or online job application systems. If a  contractor uses such a system, it must provide necessary reasonable  accommodation to ensure that an otherwise qualified individual with a  disability who is not able to fully utilize that system is nonetheless  provided with equal opportunity to apply and be considered for all jobs.  Though not required by this part, it is a best practice for the  contractor to make its online job application system accessible and  compatible with assistive technologies used by individuals with  disabilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A qualified individual with a disability is not required to  accept an accommodation, aid, service, opportunity, or benefit which  such qualified individual chooses not to accept. However, if such  individual rejects a reasonable accommodation, aid, service, opportunity  or benefit that is necessary to enable the individual to perform the  essential functions of the position held or desired, and cannot, as a  result of that rejection, perform the essential functions of the  position, the individual will not be considered a qualified individual  with a disability.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Reasonable accommodation procedures. The development and use of  written procedures for processing requests for reasonable accommodation  is a best practice that may assist the contractor in meeting its  reasonable accommodation obligations under section 503 and this part.  Such procedures help ensure that applicants and employees are informed  as to how to request a reasonable accommodation and are aware of how  such a request will be processed by the contractor. They also help  ensure that the contractor's supervisors and managers know what to do  should they receive a request for reasonable accommodation, and that all  requests for accommodation are processed swiftly, within a reasonable  period of time. The development and use of written reasonable  accommodation procedures is not required by this part, and it is not a  violation of this part for a contractor not to have or use such  procedures. However, Appendix B of this part provides guidance to  contractors that choose to develop and use written reasonable  accommodation procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Qualification standards, tests and other selection criteria--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  In general. It is unlawful for the contractor to use qualification  standards, employment tests, or other selection criteria that screen out  or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of  individuals with disabilities, on the basis of disability, unless the  standard, test, or other selection criterion, as used by the contractor,  is shown to be job-related for the position in question and is  consistent with business necessity. Selection criteria that concern an  essential function may not be used to exclude an individual with a  disability if that individual could satisfy the criteria with provision  of a reasonable accommodation. Selection criteria that exclude or tend  to exclude an individual with a disability or a class of individuals  with disabilities on the basis of disability but concern only marginal  functions of the job would not be consistent with business necessity.  The contractor may not refuse to hire an applicant with a disability  because the applicant's disability prevents him or her from performing  marginal functions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Qualification standards and tests related to uncorrected  vision. It is unlawful for the contractor to use qualification  standards, employment tests, or other selection criteria based on an  individual's uncorrected vision unless the standard, test, or other  selection criteria, as used by the contractor, is shown to be job- related for the position in question and consistent with business  necessity. An individual challenging a contractor's application of a  qualification standard, test, or other criterion based on uncorrected  vision need not be an individual with a disability, but must be  adversely affected by the application of the standard, test, or other  criterion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, 41  CFR part 60-3, do not apply to the Rehabilitation Act and are similarly  inapplicable to this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Administration of tests. It is unlawful for the contractor to  fail to select and administer tests concerning employment in the most  effective manner to ensure that, when a test is administered to a job  applicant or employee who has a disability that impairs sensory, manual,  or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the skills,  aptitude, or whatever other factor of the applicant or employee that the  test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the impaired sensory,  manual, or speaking skills of such employee or applicant, except where  such skills are the factors that the test purports to measure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Compensation. In offering employment or promotions to  individuals with disabilities, it is unlawful for the contractor to  reduce the amount of compensation offered because of any income based  upon a disability-related pension or other disability-related benefit  the applicant or employee receives from another source. Nor may the  contractor reduce the amount of compensation offered to an individual  with a disability because of the actual or anticipated cost of a  reasonable accommodation the individual needs or may request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Claims of No Disability. Nothing in this part shall provide the  basis for a claim that an individual without a disability was subject to  discrimination because of the lack of disability, or because an  individual with a disability was granted an accommodation that was  denied to an individual without a disability.</p>
