                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Authority. 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh), 24a, 25b, 93a, 3101 et seq.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Licensing requirements. A national bank must file a notice or application as prescribed in this section to acquire or establish an operating subsidiary, or to commence a new activity in an existing operating subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Scope. This section sets forth authorized activities and application or notice procedures for national banks engaging in activities through an operating subsidiary. The procedures in this section do not apply to financial subsidiaries authorized under Sec. 5.39. Unless provided otherwise, this section applies to a Federal branch or agency that acquires, establishes, or maintains any subsidiary that a national bank is authorized to acquire or establish under this section in the same manner and to the same extent as if the Federal branch or agency were a national bank, except that the ownership interest required in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(5)(i)(B) of this section shall apply to the parent foreign bank of the Federal branch or agency and not to the Federal branch or agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this Sec. 5.34:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Authorized product means a product that would be defined as insurance under section 302(c) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Public Law 106-102, 113 Stat. 1338, 1407) (GLBA) (15 U.S.C. 6712) that, as of January 1, 1999, the OCC had determined in writing that national banks may provide as principal or national banks were in fact lawfully providing the product as principal, and as of that date no court of relevant jurisdiction had, by final judgment, overturned a determination by the OCC that national banks may provide the product as principal. An authorized product does not include title insurance, or an annuity contract the income of which is subject to treatment under section 72 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 72).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Well capitalized means the capital level described in 12 CFR 6.4 or, in the case of a Federal branch or agency, the capital level described in 12 CFR 4.7(b)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Well managed means, unless otherwise determined in writing by the OCC:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a national bank:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The national bank has received a composite rating of 1 or 2 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System in connection with its most recent examination; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of any national bank that has not been examined, the existence and use of managerial resources that the OCC determines are satisfactory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a Federal branch or agency:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Federal branch or agency has received a composite ROCA supervisory rating (which rates risk management, operational controls, compliance, and asset quality) of 1 or 2 at its most recent examination; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a Federal branch or agency that has not been examined, the existence and use of managerial resources that the OCC determines are satisfactory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Standards and requirements--(1) Authorized activities. A national bank may conduct in an operating subsidiary activities that are permissible for a national bank to engage in directly either as part of, or incidental

to, the business of banking, as determined by the OCC, or otherwise under other statutory authority, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Authorized activities. A national bank may conduct in an operating subsidiary activities that are permissible for a national bank to engage in directly either as part of, or incidental

to, the business of banking, as determined by the OCC, or otherwise under other statutory authority, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Providing authorized products as principal; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Providing title insurance as principal if the national bank or subsidiary thereof was actively and lawfully underwriting title insurance before November 12, 1999, and no affiliate of the national bank (other than a subsidiary) provides insurance as principal. A subsidiary may not provide title insurance as principal if the state had in effect before November 12, 1999, a law which prohibits any person from underwriting title insurance with respect to real property in that state.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Qualifying subsidiaries. (i) An operating subsidiary in which a national bank may invest includes a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, or similar entity if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An operating subsidiary in which a national bank may invest includes a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, or similar entity if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The bank has the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The parent bank owns and controls more than 50 percent of the voting (or similar type of controlling) interest of the operating subsidiary, or the parent bank otherwise controls the operating subsidiary and no other party controls more than 50 percent of the voting (or similar type of controlling) interest of the operating subsidiary; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The operating subsidiary is consolidated with the bank under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> However, the following subsidiaries are not operating subsidiaries subject to this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A subsidiary in which the bank's investment is made pursuant to specific authorization in a statute or OCC regulation (e.g., a bank service company under 12 U.S.C. 1861 et seq. or a financial subsidiary under section 5136A of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 24a)); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A subsidiary in which the bank has acquired, in good faith, shares through foreclosure on collateral, by way of compromise of a doubtful claim, or to avoid a loss in connection with a debt previously contracted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examination and supervision. An operating subsidiary conducts activities authorized under this section pursuant to the same authorization, terms and conditions that apply to the conduct of such activities by its parent national bank, except as otherwise provided with respect to the application of state law under sections 1044(e) and 1045 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (12 U.S.C. 25b). If, upon examination, the OCC determines that the operating subsidiary is operating in violation of law, regulation, or written condition, or in an unsafe or unsound manner or otherwise threatens the safety or soundness of the bank, the OCC will direct the bank or operating subsidiary to take appropriate remedial action, which may include requiring the bank to divest or liquidate the operating subsidiary, or discontinue specified activities. OCC authority under this paragraph is subject to the limitations and requirements of section 45 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831v) and section 115 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (12 U.S.C. 1820a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Consolidation of figures--(i) National banks. Pertinent book figures of the parent national bank and its operating subsidiary shall be combined for the purpose of applying statutory or regulatory limitations when combination is needed to effect the intent of the statute or regulation, e.g., for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 56, 60, 84, and 371d.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> National banks.

Transactions conducted by all of a foreign bank's Federal branches and agencies and State branches and agencies, and their operating subsidiaries, shall be combined for the purpose of applying any limitation or restriction as provided in 12 CFR 28.14.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Procedures--(i) Notice required. (A) Except for operating subsidiaries subject to the application procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section or exempt from notice or application procedures under paragraph (e)(5)(vi) of this section, a national bank that is ``well capitalized'' and ``well managed'' may establish or acquire an operating subsidiary, or perform a new activity in an existing operating subsidiary, by providing the appropriate district office written notice

within 10 days after acquiring or establishing the subsidiary, or commencing the new activity, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notice required. (A) Except for operating subsidiaries subject to the application procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section or exempt from notice or application procedures under paragraph (e)(5)(vi) of this section, a national bank that is ``well capitalized'' and ``well managed'' may establish or acquire an operating subsidiary, or perform a new activity in an existing operating subsidiary, by providing the appropriate district office written notice

within 10 days after acquiring or establishing the subsidiary, or commencing the new activity, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The activity is listed in paragraph (e)(5)(v) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The entity is a corporation, limited liability company, or limited partnership; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The bank:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Has the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary by holding voting interests sufficient to select the number of directors needed to control the subsidiary's board and to select and terminate senior management (or, in the case of a limited partnership, has the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary by controlling the selection and termination of senior management);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Holds more than 50 percent of the voting, or equivalent, interests in the subsidiary, and, in the case of a limited partnership, the bank or an operating subsidiary thereof is the sole general partner of the limited partnership, provided that under the partnership agreement, limited partners have no authority to bind the partnership by virtue solely of their status as limited partners; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Is required to consolidate its financial statements with those of the subsidiary under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The written notice must include a complete description of the bank's investment in the subsidiary and of the activity conducted and a representation and undertaking that the activity will be conducted in accordance with OCC policies contained in guidance issued by the OCC regarding the activity. To the extent that the notice relates to the initial affiliation of the bank with a company engaged in insurance activities, the bank should describe the type of insurance activity in which the company is engaged and has present plans to conduct. The bank also must list for each State the lines of business for which the company holds, or will hold, an insurance license, indicating the State where the company holds a resident license or charter, as applicable. Any bank receiving approval under this paragraph is deemed to have agreed that the subsidiary will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with published OCC guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application required. (A) Except where the operating subsidiary is exempt from notice or application requirements under paragraph (e)(5)(vi) of this section, or subject to the notice procedures in paragraph (e)(5)(i), a national bank must first submit an application to, and receive approval from, the OCC with respect to the establishment or acquisition of an operating subsidiary, or the performance of a new activity in an existing operating subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Except where the operating subsidiary is exempt from notice or application requirements under paragraph (e)(5)(vi) of this section, or subject to the notice procedures in paragraph (e)(5)(i), a national bank must first submit an application to, and receive approval from, the OCC with respect to the establishment or acquisition of an operating subsidiary, or the performance of a new activity in an existing operating subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The application must explain, as appropriate, how the bank ``controls'' the enterprise, describing in full detail structural arrangements where control is based on factors other than bank ownership of more than 50 percent of the voting interest of the subsidiary and the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary by holding voting interests sufficient to select the number of directors needed to control the subsidiary's board and to select and terminate senior management. In the case of a limited partnership that does not qualify for the notice procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(5)(i), the bank should provide a statement explaining why it is not eligible. The application also must include a complete description of the bank's investment in the subsidiary, the proposed activities of the subsidiary, the organizational structure and management of the subsidiary, the relations between the bank and the subsidiary, and other information necessary to adequately describe the proposal. To the extent that the application relates to the initial affiliation of the bank with a company engaged in insurance activities, the bank should describe the type of insurance activity in which the company is engaged and has present plans to conduct. The bank must also list for each State the lines of business for which the company holds, or will hold, an insurance license, indicating the State where the company holds a resident license or charter, as applicable. The application must state whether the operating subsidiary will conduct any activity at a location other than the main office or

a previously approved branch of the bank. The OCC may require an applicant to submit a legal analysis if the proposal is novel, unusually complex, or raises substantial unresolved legal issues. In these cases, the OCC encourages applicants to have a pre-filing meeting with the OCC. Any bank receiving approval under this paragraph is deemed to have agreed that the subsidiary will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with published OCC guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exceptions to rules of general applicability. Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant and novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that some or all provisions in Secs. 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> OCC review and approval. The OCC reviews a national bank's application to determine whether the proposed activities are legally permissible and to ensure that the proposal is consistent with safe and sound banking practices and OCC policy and does not endanger the safety or soundness of the parent national bank. As part of this process, the OCC may request additional information and analysis from the applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Activities eligible for notice. The following activities qualify for the notice procedures, provided the activity is conducted pursuant to the same terms and conditions as would be applicable if the activity were conducted directly by a national bank:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Holding and managing assets acquired by the parent bank, including investment assets and property acquired by the bank through foreclosure or otherwise in good faith to compromise a doubtful claim, or in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Providing services to or for the bank or its affiliates, including accounting, auditing, appraising, advertising and public relations, and financial advice and consulting;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Making loans or other extensions of credit, and selling money orders, savings bonds, and travelers checks;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Purchasing, selling, servicing, or warehousing loans or other extensions of credit, or interests therein;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Providing courier services between financial institutions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Providing management consulting, operational advice, and services for other financial institutions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Providing check guaranty, verification and payment services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Providing data processing, data warehousing and data transmission products, services, and related activities and facilities, including associated equipment and technology, for the bank or its affiliates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Acting as investment adviser (including an adviser with investment discretion) or financial adviser or counselor to governmental entities or instrumentalities, businesses, or individuals, including advising registered investment companies and mortgage or real estate investment trusts, furnishing economic forecasts or other economic information, providing investment advice related to futures and options on futures, and providing consumer financial counseling;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Providing tax planning and preparation services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> Providing financial and transactional advice and assistance, including advice and assistance for customers in structuring, arranging, and executing mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, leveraged buyouts, swaps, foreign exchange, derivative transactions, coin and bullion, and capital restructurings;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(L)</em> Underwriting and reinsuring credit related insurance to the extent permitted under section 302 of the GLBA (15 U.S.C. 6712);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(M)</em> Leasing of personal property and acting as an agent or adviser in leases for others;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(N)</em> Providing securities brokerage or acting as a futures commission merchant, and providing related credit and other related services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(O)</em> Underwriting and dealing, including making a market, in bank permissible securities and purchasing and selling as principal, asset backed obligations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(P)</em> Acting as an insurance agent or broker, including title insurance to the extent permitted under section 303 of the GLBA (15 U.S.C. 6713);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Q)</em> Reinsuring mortgage insurance on loans originated, purchased, or serviced by the bank, its subsidiaries, or its affiliates, provided that if the subsidiary enters into a quota share agreement, the subsidiary assumes less than 50 percent of the aggregate insured risk covered by the quota share agreement.
