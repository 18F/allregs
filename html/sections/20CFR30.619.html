                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The type of tort suits described in Sec. 30.615 may be filed by  more than one individual, each with a different cause of action. For  example, a tort suit may be filed against a beryllium vendor by both a  covered Part B employee and his or her spouse, with the covered Part B  employee claiming for chronic beryllium disease and the spouse claiming  for loss of consortium due to the covered Part B employee's exposure to  beryllium. However, since the spouse of a living covered Part B employee  could not be an eligible surviving beneficiary under Part B of EEOICPA,  the spouse would not have to comply with the termination requirements of  Sec. Sec. 30.616 through 30.618. A similar result would occur if a tort  suit were filed by both the spouse of a deceased covered Part B employee  and other family members (such as children of the deceased covered part  B employee). In this case, the spouse would be the only eligible  surviving beneficiary of the deceased covered Part B employee under Part  B of the EEOICPA because the other family members could not be eligible  for benefits while he or she was alive. As a result, the spouse would be  the only party to the tort suit who would have to comply with the  termination requirements of Sec. Sec. 30.616 through 30.618.</p>
