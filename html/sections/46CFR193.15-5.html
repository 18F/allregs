A separate supply of carbon dioxide need not be provided for each space protected. The total available supply shall be at least sufficient for the space requiring the greatest amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Enclosed ventilation systems for rotating electrical propulsion equipment. (1) The number of pounds of carbon dioxide required for the initial charge shall be equal to the gross volume of the system divided by 10 for systems having a volume of less than 2,000 cubic feet, and divided by 12 for systems having a volume of 2,000 cubic feet or more.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The number of pounds of carbon dioxide required for the initial charge shall be equal to the gross volume of the system divided by 10 for systems having a volume of less than 2,000 cubic feet, and divided by 12 for systems having a volume of 2,000 cubic feet or more.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In addition to the amount required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section there shall be sufficient carbon dioxide available to permit delayed discharges of such quantity as to maintain at least a 25-percent concentration until the equipment can be stopped. If the initial discharge is such as to achieve this concentration until the equipment is stopped, no delayed discharge need be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The piping for the delayed discharge shall not be less than \1/2\-inch standard pipe, and no specific discharge rate need be applied to such systems. On small systems, this pipe may be incorporated with the initial discharge piping.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The piping for the initial charge shall be in accordance with Table 193.15-5(d)(4), and the discharge of the required amount shall be completed within 2 minutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Machinery spaces, paint lockers, tanks, chemical storerooms, and similar spaces. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the number of pounds of carbon dioxide required for each space shall be equal to the gross volume of the space divided by the appropriate factor noted in Table 193.15-5(d)(1). If fuel can drain from the compartment being protected to an adjacent compartment, or if the compartments are not entirely separate, the requirements for both compartments shall be used to determine the amount of carbon dioxide to be provided. The carbon dioxide shall be arranged to discharge into both such compartments simultaneously.</p><p class="depth0">Table 193.15-5(d)(1)</p><p class="depth0">[Gross volume of compartment, cubic feet]------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Over                           Not over   Factor------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">500       15500.................................................      1,600       161,600...............................................      4,500       184,500...............................................     50,000       2050,000..............................................  .........       22------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For the purpose of the requirements of this paragraph, the volume of the machinery space shall be taken as exclusive of the normal machinery casing unless the boiler, internal combustion machinery, or fuel oil installations extend into such space, in which case the volume shall be taken to the top of the casing or the next material reduction in casing area, whichever is lower. ``Normal machinery casing'' and ``material reduction in casing area'' shall be defined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> By ``normal machinery casing'' shall be meant a casing the area of which is not more than 40 percent of the maximum area of the machinery space.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> By ``material reduction in casing area'' shall be meant a reduction to at least 40 percent of the casing area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For vessels on an international voyage contracted for on or after May 26, 1965, the amount of carbon dioxide required for a space containing propulsion boilers or internal combustion propulsion machinery shall be as given by paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section or by dividing the entire volume, including the casing, by a factor of 25, whichever is the larger.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Branch lines to the various spaces shall be as noted in Table 193.15-5(d)(4).</p><p class="depth0">Table 193.15-5(d)(4)------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Minimum</p><p class="depth0">pipe</p><p class="depth0">Maximum quantity of carbon dioxide required, pounds         size,</p><p class="depth0">inches------------------------------------------------------------------------100...........................................................     \1/2\225...........................................................     \3/4\300...........................................................         1600...........................................................    1\1/4\1,000.........................................................    1\1/2\2,450.........................................................         22,500.........................................................    2\1/2\4,450.........................................................         37,100.........................................................    3\1/2\10,450........................................................         415,000........................................................    4\1/2\------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Distribution piping within the space shall be proportioned from the supply line to give proper distribution to the outlets without throttling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The number, type, and location of discharge outlets shall be such as to give a uniform distribution throughout the space.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The total area of all discharge outlets shall not exceed 85 percent nor be less than 35 percent of the normal cylinder outlet area or the area of the supply pipe, whichever is smaller.
