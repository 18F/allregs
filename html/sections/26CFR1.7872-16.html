                                Sec. 1.7872-16  Loans to an exchange facilitator under Sec. 1.468B-6.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exchange facilitator loans. This section provides rules in applying section 7872 to an exchange facilitator loan (within the meaning of Sec. 1.468B-6(c)(1)). For purposes of this section, the terms deferred exchange, exchange agreement, exchange facilitator, exchange funds, qualified intermediary, replacement property, and taxpayer have the same meanings as in Sec. 1.468B-6(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Treatment as demand loans. For purposes of section 7872, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, an exchange facilitator loan is a demand loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Treatment as compensation-related loans. If an exchange facilitator loan is a below-market loan, the loan is a compensation-related loan under section 7872(c)(1)(B).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applicable Federal rate (AFR) for exchange facilitator loans. For purposes of section 7872, in the case of an exchange facilitator loan, the applicable Federal rate is the lower of the short-term AFR in effect under section 1274(d)(1) (as of the day on which the loan is made), compounded semiannually, or the 91-day rate. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the 91-day rate is equal to the investment rate on a 13-week (generally 91-day) Treasury bill with an issue date that is the same as the date that the exchange facilitator loan is made or, if the two dates are not the same, with an issue date that most closely precedes the date that the exchange facilitator loan is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Use of approximate method permitted. The taxpayer and exchange facilitator may use the approximate method to determine the amount of forgone interest on any exchange facilitator loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Exemption for certain below-market exchange facilitator loans. If an exchange facilitator loan is a below-market loan, the loan is not eligible for the exemptions from section 7872 listed under Sec. 1.7872-5T. However, the loan may be eligible for the exemption from section 7872 under Sec. 1.7872-5(b)(16) (relating to exchange facilitator loans in which the amount treated as loaned does not exceed $2,000,000).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to exchange facilitator loans issued on or after October 8, 2008.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Example. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> T enters into a deferred exchange with QI, a qualified intermediary. The exchange is governed by an exchange agreement. The exchange funds held by QI pursuant to the exchange agreement are treated as loaned to QI under Sec. 1.468B-6(c)(1). The loan between T and QI is an exchange facilitator loan. The exchange agreement between T and QI provides that no earnings will be paid to T. On December 1, 2008, T transfers property to QI, QI transfers the property to a purchaser for $2,100,000, and QI deposits $2,100,000 in a money market account. On March 1, 2009, QI uses $2,100,000 of the funds in the account to purchase replacement property identified by T, and transfers the replacement property to T. The amount loaned for purposes of section 7872 is $2,100,000 and the loan is outstanding for three months. For purposes of section 7872, under paragraph (d) of this section, T uses the 91-day rate, which is 4 percent, compounded semi-annually. T uses the approximate method for purposes of section 7872.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the loan from T to QI is a compensation-related demand loan. Because there is no interest payable on the loan from T to QI, the loan is a below-market loan under section 7872. The loan is not exempt under Sec. 1.7872-5(b)(16) because the amount treated as loaned exceeds $2,000,000. Under section 7872(e)(2), the amount of forgone interest on the loan for 2008 is $7000 ($2,100,000*.04/2*1/6). Under section 7872(e)(2), the amount of forgone interest for 2009 is $14,000 ($2,100,000*.04/2*2/6). The $7000 for 2008 is deemed transferred as compensation by T to QI and retransferred as interest by QI to T on December 31, 2008. The $14,000 for 2009 is deemed transferred as compensation by T to QI and retransferred as interest by QI to T on March 1, 2009.
