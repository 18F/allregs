                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. Instrumentation for clinical multiplex test systems is a device intended to measure and sort multiple signals generated by an assay from a clinical sample. This instrumentation is used with a specific assay to measure multiple similar analytes that establish a single indicator to aid in diagnosis. Such instrumentation may be compatible with more than one specific assay. The device includes a signal reader unit, and may also integrate reagent handling, hybridization, washing, dedicated instrument control, and other hardware components, as well as raw data storage mechanisms, data acquisition software, and software to process detected signals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II (special controls). The special control is FDA's guidance document entitled ``Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Instrumentation for Clinical Multiplex Test Systems.'' See Sec. 862.1(d) for the availability of this guidance document.
