                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Appeals to the Assistant General Counsel for Administration.  Whenever   Ex-Im Bank denies a request for access or for waiver or reduction of  fees, the requester may appeal the denial to the Assistant General  Counsel for Administration within 30 working days of the date of Ex-Im  Bank's issuance of notice of such action. Appeals must be made in  writing and must be signed by the appellant. Appeals should be addressed  to the Assistant General Counsel for Administration at the address in  Sec. 404.12(e). Both the envelope and the appeal letter should be  clearly marked in capital letters: ``PRIVACY ACT APPEAL.'' Failure to  properly mark or address the appeal may slow its processing. An appeal  shall not be deemed to have been received by Ex-Im Bank until the  Assistant General Counsel for Administration receives the appeal letter.  The letter should include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A copy of the denied request or a description of the records  requested;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The name and title of the Ex-Im Bank employee who denied the  request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The date on which the request was denied; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Ex-Im Bank identification number assigned to the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Final determination. The disposition of an access appeal shall  be made in writing within twenty working days after the date of receipt  of the appeal. The Assistant General Counsel for Administration may  extend the time for response an additional ten working days for good  cause, provided that the requester is notified in writing. A decision  affirming the denial of a request for access shall include a brief  statement of the reasons for affirming the denial and shall advise the  requester of the right to seek judicial review. If the initial  determination is reversed, then the request shall be remanded to the  Freedom of Information and Privacy Office to be processed in accordance  with the decision on appeal.</p>
