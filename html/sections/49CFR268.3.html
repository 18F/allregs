                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Maglev Deployment Program includes five phases, as described in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section. The current projected timing for implementing these phases is indicated to assist applicants in planning their projects. All dates beyond the first date (the deadline for the submission of preconstruction planning applications) are for planning purposes only and are subject to change--including possible acceleration of deadlines--based on the progress of the Maglev Deployment Program; grantees will be notified accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Phase I--Competition for Planning Grants (Early October 1998--September 15, 1999)--(1) Description. In Phase I, States will apply for funds for preconstruction planning activities. As required by Sec. 268.13, applications must be filed with FRA by February 15, 1999. FRA will select one or more projects to receive preconstruction planning financial assistance awarded under this part to perform Phase II of the Maglev Deployment Program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Description.

In Phase II, each grant recipient will prepare and submit to FRA a project description, supporting preconstruction planning reports, and an EA. Supporting reports may include demand and revenue analyses, project specification, cost estimates, scheduling, financial studies, a system safety plan (including supporting analysis), and other information in support of the project description. FRA will use this information in reaching a decision on which projects to down-select for completion of site-specific environmental studies, investment grade revenue forecasts, and other studies and analyses necessary prior to initiation of construction. FRA will initiate documentation of environmental factors considered in the project selection process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Description.
