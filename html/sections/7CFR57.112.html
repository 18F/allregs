                            <p class="depth0">Pending final action by the Secretary, any person authorized to  countersign a license to perform surveillance inspection services may,  whenever such action is necessary to assure that any inspection service  is properly performed, suspend or revoke any license to perform  inspection services issued pursuant to this part by giving notice of  such action to the respective licensee, accompanied by a statement of  the reasons. Within 7 days after the receipt of the suspension or  revocation notice and statement of reasons, the licensee may file an  appeal in writing to the Secretary, supported by any argument or  evidence that the licensee may wish to offer as to why the license  should not be suspended or revoked. After the expiration of the 7-day  period and consideration of such argument and evidence, the Secretary  will take appropriate action regarding the suspension or revocation.  When no appeal is filed within the prescribed 7 days, the license is  revoked or suspended.  [69 FR 57166, Sept. 24, 2004]</p>
