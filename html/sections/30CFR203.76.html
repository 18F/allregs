                            <p class="depth0">We will withdraw approval of relief for any of the following  reasons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You change the type of development system proposed in your  application (e.g., change from a fixed platform to floating production  system, or from an independent development and production system to one  with subsea wells tied back to a host production facility, etc.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You do not start building the proposed development and  production system within 18 months of the date we approved your  application, unless the BSEE Director grants you an extension under  Sec.  203.79(c). If you start building the proposed system and then  suspend its construction before completion, and you do not restart  continuous building of the proposed system within 18 months of our  approval, we will withdraw the relief we granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Your actual development costs are less than 80 percent of the  eligible development costs estimated in your application's most likely  scenario, and you do not report that fact in your post-production  development report (Sec.  203.70). Development costs are those  expenditures defined in Sec.  203.89(b) incurred between the application  submission date and start of production. If you report this fact in the  post-production development report, you may retain the lesser of 50  percent of the original royalty suspension volume or 50 percent of the  median of the distribution of the potentially recoverable resources  anticipated in your application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We granted you a royalty-suspension volume after you qualified  for a redetermination under Sec.  203.74(c), and we find out your actual  development costs are less than 90 percent of the eligible development  costs associated with your application's most likely scenario.  Development costs are those   expenditures defined in Sec.  203.89(b) incurred between your  application submission date and start of production.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You do not send us the fabrication confirmation report or the  post-production development report, or you provide false or  intentionally inaccurate information that was material to our granting  royalty relief under this section. You must pay royalties and late- payment interest determined under 30 U.S.C. 1721 and 30 CFR 1218.54 on  all volumes for which you used the royalty suspension. You also may be  subject to penalties under other provisions of law.</p>
