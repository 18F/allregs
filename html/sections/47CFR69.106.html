                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 69.118, charges that are expressed  in dollars and cents per access minute of use shall be assessed by local  exchange carriers that are not subject to price cap regulation upon all  interexchange carriers that use local exchange switching facilities for  the provision of interstate or foreign services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The per minute charge described in paragraph (a) of this section  shall be computed by dividing the projected annual revenue requirement  for the Local Switching element, excluding any local switching support  received by the carrier pursuant to Sec. 54.301 of this chapter, by the  projected annual access minutes of use for all interstate or foreign  services that use local exchange switching facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If end users of an interstate or foreign service that uses local  switching facilities pay message unit charges for such calls in a  particular exchange, a credit shall be deducted from the Local Switching  element charges to such carrier for access service in such exchange. The  per minute credit for each such exchange shall be multiplied by the  monthly access minutes for such service to compute the monthly credit to  such a carrier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If all local exchange subscribers in such exchange pay message  unit charges, the per minute credit described in paragraph (c) of this  section shall be computed by dividing total message unit charges to all  subscribers in a particular exchange in a representative month by the  total minutes of use that were measured for purposes of   computing message unit charges in such month.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If some local exchange subscribers pay message unit charges and  some do not, a per minute credit described in paragraph (c) of this  section shall be computed by multiplying a credit computed pursuant to  paragraph (d) of this section by a factor that is equal to total minutes  measured in such month for purposes of computing message unit charges  divided by the total local exchange minutes in such month.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 69.118, price cap local exchange  carriers shall establish rate elements for local switching as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Price cap local exchange carriers shall separate from the  projected annual revenues for the Local Switching element those costs  projected to be incurred for ports (including cards and DS1/voice-grade  multiplexers required to access end offices equipped with analog  switches) on the trunk side of the local switch. Price cap local  exchange carriers shall further identify costs incurred for dedicated  trunk ports separately from costs incurred for shared trunk ports.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Price cap local exchange carriers shall recover dedicated trunk  port costs identified pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section  through flat-rated charges expressed in dollars and cents per trunk port  and assessed upon the purchaser of the dedicated trunk terminating at  the port.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Price cap local exchange carriers shall recover shared trunk  port costs identified pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section  through charges assessed upon purchasers of shared transport. This  charge shall be expressed in dollars and cents per access minute of use.  The charge shall be computed by dividing the projected costs of the  shared ports by the historical annual access minutes of use calculated  for purposes of recovery of common transport costs in Sec. 69.111(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Price cap local exchange carriers shall recover the projected  annual revenues for the Local Switching element that are not recovered  in paragraph (f)(1) of this section through charges that are expressed  in dollars and cents per access minute of use and assessed upon all  interexchange carriers that use local exchange switching facilities for  the provision of interstate or foreign services. The maximum charge  shall be computed by dividing the projected remainder of the annual  revenues for the Local Switching element by the historical annual access  minutes of use for all interstate or foreign services that use local  exchange switching facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A local exchange carrier may recover signaling costs associated  with call setup through a call setup charge imposed upon all interstate  interexchange carriers that use that local exchange carrier's facilities  to originate or terminate interstate interexchange or foreign services.  This charge must be expressed as dollars and cents per call attempt and  may be assessed on originating calls handed off to the interexchange  carrier's point of presence and on terminating calls received from an  interexchange carrier's point of presence, whether or not that call is  completed at the called location. Local exchange carriers may not  recover through this charge any costs recovered through other rate  elements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 69.118, non-price cap local exchange  carriers may establish rate elements for local switching as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Non-price cap local exchange carriers may separate from the  projected annual revenue requirement for the Local Switching element  those costs projected to be incurred for ports (including cards and DS1/ voice-grade multiplexers required to access end offices equipped with  analog switches) on the trunk side of the local switch. Non-price cap  local exchange carriers electing to assess these charges shall further  identify costs incurred for dedicated trunk ports separately from costs  incurred for shared trunk ports.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Non-price cap local exchange carriers electing to assess trunk  port charges shall recover dedicated trunk port costs identified  pursuant to paragraph (h)(1) of this section through flat-rated charges  expressed in dollars and cents per trunk port and assessed upon the  purchaser of the dedicated trunk terminating at the port.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Non-price cap local exchange carriers electing to assess trunk  port charges shall recover shared trunk port   costs identified pursuant to paragraph (h)(1) of this section through  charges assessed upon purchasers of shared transport. This charge shall  be expressed in dollars and cents per access minute of use.
