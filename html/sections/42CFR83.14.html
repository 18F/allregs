NIOSH will report to the Board and to petitioner(s) the results of this determination, together with its finding under 42 CFR part 82 that there was insufficient information to complete the dose reconstruction. HHS will consider this finding under 42 CFR part 82 sufficient, without further consideration, to determine that it is not feasible to estimate the levels of radiation doses of individual members of the class with sufficient accuracy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> NIOSH will evaluate the petition as it may concern a class of co-workers, as described under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, according to the procedures under Sec.  83.13.</p>
