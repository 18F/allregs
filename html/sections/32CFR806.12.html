                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> HQ AFCIC/ITC will make the traditional FOIA-processed (a)(2) materials (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(A), (B), and (C)) available to the public. Each Air Force activity must make 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(D) records (``FOIA-processed (a)(2)(D) records''--records which they determine will, or have become, the subject of frequent or subsequent requests) available to the public in a reading room in hard copy and electronically by posting it to their appropriate web site. There is no requirement to make all FOIA-released records available electronically. The FOIA manager, in coordination with the functional OPR, or the owner of the records, determines qualifying records, after coordination with any interested OCRs. As required by AFIs 33-129 and 35-205, OPRs request clearance of these records with the PAO before posting on the WWW.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Normally, if the FOIA office or OPR receives, or anticipates receiving, five or more requests for the same record in a quarter, they will consider it a frequently requested record (FOIA-processed (a)(2)(D) record) and make it publicly available in hard copy and electronically as outlined in Sec. 806.12(a). OPRs may elect to make other records publicly available if they receive, or expect to receive, less than five requests a quarter. The purpose is to make records available in an ERR to potential future FOIA requesters instead of waiting to receive a FOIA request, and reduce the number of multiple FOIA requests for the same records requiring separate responses. In making these determinations, recognize there are some situations in which a certain type of record becomes the subject of simultaneous FOIA requests from all interested parties and then ceases to be of interest. Activities may typically receive a ``flurry'' of FOIA requests for contract records immediately after a contract is awarded, but do not receive any subsequent requests for such bulky records after that point. In some cases, activities may decide that placing records in the ERR would not serve the statutory purpose of ``diverting some potential FOIA requests for previously released records.'' The following types of records should be considered for inclusion in the ERR (excluding individuals assigned to overseas, sensitive, and routinely deployable units): organizational charts and limited staff directories; lists of personnel reassigned with gaining base; MAJCOM FOIA supplements; lists of International Merchant Purchase Authority Card (IMPAC) card holders. Do not post lists of e-mail addresses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> GILS. Each activity that posts FOIA-processed (a)(2)(D) records (records which they determine will, or

have become, the subject of frequent or subsequent requests) must create a GILS record for each FOIA-processed (a)(2)(D) record and post it to DefenseLINK. The OPR prepares the GILS record. You can complete and submit a GILS record on-line using a web browser. Instructions for completing the GILS record, and an on-line form are at http://www.defenselink.mil/locator/index.html. Follow the steps listed on the web page. The GILS site on DefenseLINK will serve as the central index of Air Force FOIA-processed (a)(2)(D) records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In addition, installations will post a list, or index, of locally produced FOIA-processed (a)(2)(D) records on their web page at their FOIA site. Each listing will point or link to the particular record. In addition, MAJCOMs may choose to post their own index of MAJCOM specific FOIA-processed (a)(2)(D) records to their appropriate web site. Installation web pages will include the following phrase (or similar words) on their FOIA site if they do not have any frequently requested FOIA records: ``There are no frequently requested FOIA records to post at this time.'' Include the following statement, or a similar one, on the installation web page with the records: ``Some records are released to the public under the FOIA, and may therefore reflect deletion of some information in accordance with the FOIA's nine statutory exemptions. A consolidated list of such records is on DefenseLINK.'' Link the word ``DefenseLINK'' to www.defenselink.mil/locator/fpr--index.html. Qualifying releasable records with exempt information redacted must show on the record the amount of information withheld and the exemption reason (for example, (b)(6)). Activities with such records should provide the public an index and explanation of the FOIA exemptions. All installation FOIA pages will include a link to the Air Force page.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> FOIA web pages should be clearly accessed from the main installation page, either by a direct link to ``FOIA'' or ``Freedom of Information Act'' from the main page, or found under a logical heading such as ``Library'' or ``Sites.''
