The initial determination of the average daily feed production level is based on the one-year period prior to the compliance date for existing sources, or the design rate for new sources. The subsequent average daily feed production levels are determined annually and are based on the amount of animal feed products produced in a calendar year divided by the number of days in which the production processes were in operation.</p><p class="depth0">Cyclone means a mechanically aided collector that uses inertia to separate particulate matter from the gas stream as it spirals through the cyclone.</p><p class="depth0">Material containing chromium means a material that contains chromium (Cr, atomic number 24) in amounts greater than or equal to 0.1 percent by weight.</p><p class="depth0">Material containing manganese means a material that contains manganese (Mn, atomic number 25) in amounts greater than or equal to 1.0 percent by weight.</p><p class="depth0">Pelleting operations means all operations that make pelleted animal feed, including but not limited to, steam conditioning, die-casting, drying, cooling, and crumbling, and granulation.</p><p class="depth0">Prepared feeds manufacturing facility means a facility that is primarily engaged in manufacturing animal feed.
