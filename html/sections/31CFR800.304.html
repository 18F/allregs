                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of determining whether to include the rights that a  holder of convertible voting instruments will acquire upon conversion of  those instruments in the Committee's assessment of whether a notified  transaction is a covered transaction, the Committee will consider  factors that include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The imminence of conversion;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether conversion depends on factors within the control of the  acquiring party; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the amount of voting interest and the rights that would  be acquired upon conversion can be reasonably determined at the time of  acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the Committee, applying paragraph (a) of this section,  determines that the rights that the holder will acquire upon conversion  will not be included in the Committee's assessment of whether a notified  transaction is a covered transaction, the Committee will disregard the  convertible voting instruments for purposes of that transaction except  to the extent that they convey immediate rights to the holder with  respect to the governance of the entity that issued the instruments.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Corporation A, a foreign person, notifies the Committee  that it intends to buy common stock and debentures of Corporation X, a  U.S. business. By their terms, the debentures are convertible into  common stock only upon the occurrence of an event the timing of which is  not in the control of Corporation A, and the number of common shares  that would be acquired upon conversion cannot now be determined.  Assuming no other relevant facts, the Committee will disregard the  debentures in the course of its covered transaction analysis at the time  that Corporation A acquires the debentures. In the event that it  determines that the acquisition of the common stock is not a covered  transaction, the Committee will so inform the parties. Once the  conversion of the instruments becomes imminent, it may be appropriate  for the Committee to consider the rights that would result from the  conversion and whether the conversion is a covered transaction. The  conversion of those debentures into common stock could be a covered  transaction, depending on what percentage of Corporation X's voting  securities Corporation A would receive and what powers those securities  would confer on Corporation A.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Same facts as Example 1, except that the debentures at  issue are convertible at the sole discretion of Corporation A after six  months, and if converted, would represent a 50 percent interest in  Corporation X. The Committee may consider the rights that would result  from the conversion as part of its assessment.</p>
