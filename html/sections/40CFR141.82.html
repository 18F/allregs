                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Each system shall complete the corrosion control treatment  requirements described below which are applicable to such system under  Sec.  141.81.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> System recommendation regarding corrosion control treatment.  Based upon the results of lead and copper tap monitoring and water  quality parameter monitoring, small and medium-size   water systems exceeding the lead or copper action level shall recommend  installation of one or more of the corrosion control treatments listed  in paragraph (c)(1) of this section which the system believes  constitutes optimal corrosion control for that system. The State may  require the system to conduct additional water quality parameter  monitoring in accordance with Sec.  141.87(b) to assist the State in  reviewing the system's recommendation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> State decision to require studies of corrosion control treatment  (applicable to small and medium-size systems). The State may require any  small or medium-size system that exceeds the lead or copper action level  to perform corrosion control studies under paragraph (c) of this section  to identify optimal corrosion control treatment for the system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Performance of corrosion control studies. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any public water  system performing corrosion control studies shall evaluate the  effectiveness of each of the following treatments, and, if appropriate,  combinations of the following treatments to identify the optimal  corrosion control treatment for that system:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Alkalinity and pH adjustment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Calcium hardness adjustment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The addition of a phosphate or silicate based corrosion  inhibitor at a concentration sufficient to maintain an effective  residual concentration in all test tap samples.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The water system shall evaluate each of the corrosion control  treatments using either pipe rig/loop tests, metal coupon tests,  partial-system tests, or analyses based on documented analogous  treatments with other systems of similar size, water chemistry and  distribution system configuration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The water system shall measure the following water quality  parameters in any tests conducted under this paragraph before and after  evaluating the corrosion control treatments listed above:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Lead;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Copper;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> pH;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Alkalinity;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Calcium;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Conductivity;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Orthophosphate (when an inhibitor containing a phosphate  compound is used);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Silicate (when an inhibitor containing a silicate compound is  used);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Water temperature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The water system shall identify all chemical or physical  constraints that limit or prohibit the use of a particular corrosion  control treatment and document such constraints with at least one of the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Data and documentation showing that a particular corrosion  control treatment has adversely affected other water treatment processes  when used by another water system with comparable water quality  characteristics; and/or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Data and documentation demonstrating that the water system has  previously attempted to evaluate a particular corrosion control  treatment and has found that the treatment is ineffective or adversely  affects other water quality treatment processes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The water system shall evaluate the effect of the chemicals used  for corrosion control treatment on other water quality treatment  processes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> On the basis of an analysis of the data generated during each  evaluation, the water system shall recommend to the State in writing the  treatment option that the corrosion control studies indicate constitutes  optimal corrosion control treatment for that system. The water system  shall provide a rationale for its recommendation along with all  supporting documentation specified in paragraphs (c) (1) through (5) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> State designation of optimal corrosion control treatment. (1)  Based upon consideration of available information including, where  applicable, studies performed under paragraph (c) of this section and a  system's recommended treatment alternative, the State shall either  approve the corrosion control treatment option recommended by the  system, or designate alternative corrosion control treatment(s) from  among those listed in paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section. When designating  optimal treatment the State shall consider the   effects that additional corrosion control treatment will have on water  quality parameters and on other water quality treatment processes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State shall notify the system of its decision on optimal  corrosion control treatment in writing and explain the basis for this  determination. If the State requests additional information to aid its  review, the water system shall provide the information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Installation of optimal corrosion control. Each system shall  properly install and operate throughout its distribution system the  optimal corrosion control treatment designated by the State under  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> State review of treatment and specification of optimal water  quality control parameters. The State shall evaluate the results of all  lead and copper tap samples and water quality parameter samples  submitted by the water system and determine whether the system has  properly installed and operated the optimal corrosion control treatment  designated by the State in paragraph (d) of this section. Upon reviewing  the results of tap water and water quality parameter monitoring by the  system, both before and after the system installs optimal corrosion  control treatment, the State shall designate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A minimum value or a range of values for pH measured at each  entry point to the distribution system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A minimum pH value, measured in all tap samples. Such value  shall be equal to or greater than 7.0, unless the State determines that  meeting a pH level of 7.0 is not technologically feasible or is not  necessary for the system to optimize corrosion control;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a corrosion inhibitor is used, a minimum concentration or a  range of concentrations for the inhibitor, measured at each entry point  to the distribution system and in all tap samples, that the State  determines is necessary to form a passivating film on the interior walls  of the pipes of the distribution system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If alkalinity is adjusted as part of optimal corrosion control  treatment, a minimum concentration or a range of concentrations for  alkalinity, measured at each entry point to the distribution system and  in all tap samples;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If calcium carbonate stabilization is used as part of corrosion  control, a minimum concentration or a range of concentrations for  calcium, measured in all tap samples.  The values for the applicable water quality control parameters listed  above shall be those that the State determines to reflect optimal  corrosion control treatment for the system. The State may designate  values for additional water quality control parameters determined by the  State to reflect optimal corrosion control for the system. The State  shall notify the system in writing of these determinations and explain  the basis for its decisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Continued operation and monitoring. All systems optimizing  corrosion control shall continue to operate and maintain optimal  corrosion control treatment, including maintaining water quality  parameters at or above minimum values or within ranges designated by the  State under paragraph (f) of this section, in accordance with this  paragraph for all samples collected under Sec.  141.87(d) through (f).  Compliance with the requirements of this paragraph shall be determined  every six months, as specified under Sec.  141.87(d). A water system is  out of compliance with the requirements of this paragraph for a six- month period if it has excursions for any State-specified parameter on  more than nine days during the period. An excursion occurs whenever the  daily value for one or more of the water quality parameters measured at  a sampling location is below the minimum value or outside the range  designated by the State. Daily values are calculated as follows. States  have discretion to delete results of obvious sampling errors from this  calculation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On days when more than one measurement for the water quality  parameter is collected at the sampling location, the daily value shall  be the average of all results collected during the day regardless of  whether they are collected through continuous monitoring, grab sampling,  or a combination of both. If EPA has approved an alternative formula  under Sec.  142.16 of this chapter in the State's application for a   program revision submitted pursuant to Sec.  142.12 of this chapter, the  State's formula shall be used to aggregate multiple measurements taken  at a sampling point for the water quality parameter in lieu of the  formula in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On days when only one measurement for the water quality  parameter is collected at the sampling location, the daily value shall  be the result of that measurement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> On days when no measurement is collected for the water quality  parameter at the sampling location, the daily value shall be the daily  value calculated on the most recent day on which the water quality  parameter was measured at the sample site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Modification of State treatment decisions. Upon its own  initiative or in response to a request by a water system or other  interested party, a State may modify its determination of the optimal  corrosion control treatment under paragraph (d) of this section or  optimal water quality control parameters under paragraph (f) of this  section. A request for modification by a system or other interested  party shall be in writing, explain why the modification is appropriate,  and provide supporting documentation. The State may modify its  determination where it concludes that such change is necessary to ensure  that the system continues to optimize corrosion control treatment. A  revised determination shall be made in writing, set forth the new  treatment requirements, explain the basis for the State's decision, and  provide an implementation schedule for completing the treatment  modifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Treatment decisions by EPA in lieu of the State. Pursuant to the  procedures in Sec.  142.19, the EPA Regional Administrator may review  treatment determinations made by a State under paragraphs (d), (f), or  (h) of this section and issue federal treatment determinations  consistent with the requirements of those paragraphs where the Regional  Administrator finds that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A State has failed to issue a treatment determination by the  applicable deadlines contained in Sec.  141.81,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A State has abused its discretion in a substantial number of  cases or in cases affecting a substantial population, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The technical aspects of a State's determination would be  indefensible in an expected Federal enforcement action taken against a  system.
