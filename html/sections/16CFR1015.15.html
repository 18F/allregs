                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The regulations of this subpart provide information concerning  the types of records which may be withheld from production and  disclosure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the internal  Commission procedure for withholding exempt records. These regulations  also provide information on the method whereby persons submitting  information to the Commission may request that the information be  considered exempt from disclosure, and information concerning the  Commission's treatment of documents submitted with a request that they  be treated as exempt from disclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> unless the Commission determines that disclosure is contrary to  the public interest. In this regard the Commission will not ordinarily  release documents that provide legal advice to the Commission concerning  pending or prospective litigation where the release of such documents  would significantly interfere with the Commission's regulatory or  enforcement proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Draft documents that are agency records are subject to release  upon request in accordance with this regulation. However, in order to  avoid any misunderstanding of the preliminary nature of a draft  document, each draft document released will be marked to indicate its  tentative nature. Similarly, staff briefing packages, which have been  completed but not yet transmitted to the Commission by the Office of the  Secretary are subject to release upon request in accordance with this  regulation. Each briefing package or portion thereof released will be  marked to indicate that it has not been transmitted to or acted upon by  the Commission. In addition, briefing packages, or portions thereof,  which the Secretary upon the advice of the Office of the General Counsel  has determined would be released upon request in accordance with this  regulation, will be publicly available in the public reference facility  established under Sec. 1015.2 promptly after the briefing package has  been transmitted to the Commissioners by the Office of the Secretary.  Such packages will be marked to indicate that they have not been acted  upon by the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The exceptions contained in Sec. 1015.16 are as contained in 5  U.S.C.   552(b). These exemptions will be interpreted in accordance with the  applicable law at the time a request for production or disclosure is  considered.
