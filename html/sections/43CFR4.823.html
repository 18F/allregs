                            <p class="depth0">Except as provided in Sec. 4.809(e), a ruling of the administrative  law judge may not be appealed to the Director, Office of Hearings and  Appeals, prior to consideration of the entire proceeding by the  administrative law judge unless permission is first obtained from the  Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, and the administrative law  judge has certified the interlocutory ruling on the record or abused his  discretion in refusing a request to so certify. Permission will not be  granted except upon a showing that the ruling complained of involves a  controlling question of law and that an immediate appeal therefrom may  materially advance the final decision. An interlocutory appeal shall not  operate to suspend the hearing unless otherwise ordered by the Director,  Office of Hearings and Appeals. If an appeal is allowed, any party may  file a brief within such period as the Director, Office of Hearings and  Appeals, directs. Upon affirmance, reversal, or modification of the  administrative law judge's interlocutory ruling or order, by the  Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, the case will be remanded  promptly to the administrative law judge for further proceedings.</p>
