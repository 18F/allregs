BIS will inform the company in writing of the earliest date the shipment may occur under the advance notification procedure. This advance notification requirement is imposed in addition to any export license requirements under the Department of Commerce's Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730 through 774) or the Department of State's International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120 through 130) or any import license requirements under the Department of Justice's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Regulations (27 CFR part 447).</p><p class="depth0">Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).
