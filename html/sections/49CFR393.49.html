                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, every motor vehicle manufactured after June 30, 1953, which is equipped with power brakes, must have the braking system so arranged that one application valve must when activated cause all of the service brakes on the motor vehicle or combination motor vehicle to operate. This requirement must not be construed to prohibit motor vehicles from being equipped with an additional valve to be used to operate the brakes on a trailer or trailers or as required for buses in Sec. 393.44.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Driveaway-Towaway Exception. This section is not applicable to driveaway-towaway operations unless the brakes on such operations are designed to be operated by a single valve.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Surge brake exception. This requirement is not applicable to trailers equipped with surge brakes that satisfy the conditions specified in Sec. 393.48(d).
