                            <p class="depth0">Unless otherwise noted, these terms and their definitions are for  the purpose of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Area of combat operations. An area of operations designated as such  by the Secretary of Defense for the purpose of this part, when enhanced  coordination of PSCs working for U.S.G. agencies is required.</p><p class="depth0">Contingency operation. A military operation that is either  designated by the Secretary of Defense as a contingency operation or  becomes a contingency operation as a matter of law (10 U.S.C.  101(a)(13)). It is a military operation that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Is designated by the Secretary of Defense as an operation in  which members of the Armed Forces are or may become involved in military  actions, operations, or hostilities against an enemy of the United  States or against an opposing military force; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Results in the call or order to, or retention on, active duty of  members of the uniformed services under section 688, 12301(a), 12302,  12304, 12305, 12406, of 10 U.S.C., chapter 15 of 10 U.S.C. or any other  provision of law during a war or during a national emergency declared by  the President or Congress.</p><p class="depth0">Contractor. The contractor, subcontractor, grantee, or other party  carrying out the covered contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> A DoD contract for performance of services  and/or delivery of supplies in an area of contingency operations outside  the United States or a contract of a non-DoD Federal agency for  performance of services and/or delivery of supplies in an area of combat  operations or other significant military operations, as designated by  the Secretary of Defense; a subcontract at any tier under such a  contract; or a task order or delivery order issued under such a contract  or subcontract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Also includes contracts or subcontracts funded under grants and  sub-grants by a Federal agency for performance in an area of combat  operations or other significant military operations as designated by the  Secretary of Defense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Excludes temporary arrangements entered into by non-DoD  contractors or grantees for the performance of private security  functions by individual indigenous personnel not affiliated with a local  or expatriate security company. Such arrangements must still be in  compliance with local law.</p><p class="depth0">Other significant military operations. For purposes of this part,  the term `other significant military operations` means activities, other  than combat operations, as part of an overseas contingency operation  that are carried out by United States Armed Forces in an uncontrolled or  unpredictable high-threat environment where personnel performing  security functions may be called upon to use deadly force.\1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ With respect to an area of other significant military  operations, the requirements of this part shall apply only upon  agreement of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State. Such  an agreement of the Secretaries may be made only on an area-by-area  basis. With respect to an area of combat operations, the requirements of  this part shall always apply. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Private security functions. Activities engaged in by a contractor  under a covered contract as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Guarding of personnel, facilities, designated sites, or property  of a Federal agency, the contractor or subcontractor, or a third  party.\2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\2\ Contractors performing private security functions are not  authorized to perform inherently governmental functions. In this regard,  they are limited to a defensive response to hostile acts or demonstrated  hostile intent. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Any other activity for which personnel are required to carry  weapons in the performance of their duties in accordance with the terms  of their contract. For the DoD, DoDI Instruction 3020.41, ``Contractor  Personnel Authorized to Accompany the U.S. Armed Forces,'' \3\  prescribes policies related to personnel allowed to carry weapons for  self defense. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\3\ Available at http://www.dtic.mil/ whs/directives/ corres/pdf/  302041p.pdf. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">PSC. During contingency operations ``PSC'' means a company employed  by the DoD performing private security functions under a covered  contract. In a designated area of combat operations or other significant  military operations, the term ``PSC'' expands to include all companies  employed by U.S.G. agencies performing private security functions under  a covered contract.</p><p class="depth2">PSC personnel.
