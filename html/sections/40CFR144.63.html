(1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by establishing a plugging and abandonment trust fund which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting an originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement to the Regional Administrator. An owner or operator of a Class I well injecting hazardous waste must submit the originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement to the Regional Administrator with the permit application or for approval to operate under rule.

Schedule A of the trust agreement must be updated within 60 days after a change in the amount of the current plugging and abandonment cost estimate covered by the agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Payments into the trust fund must be made annually by the owner or operator over the term of the initial permit or over the remaining operating life of the injection well as estimated in the plugging and abandonment plan, whichever period is shorter; this period is hereafter referred to as the ``pay-in period.'' The payments into the plugging and abandonment trust fund must be made as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For a new well, the first payment must be made before the initial injection of hazardous waste. A receipt from the trustee for this payment must be submitted by the owner or operator to the Regional Administrator before this initial injection of hazardous waste. The first payment must be at least equal to the current plugging and abandonment cost estimate, except as provided in Sec.  144.70(g), divided by the number of years in the pay-in period. Subsequent payments must be made no later than 30 days after each anniversary date of the first payment. The amount of each subsequent payment must be determined by this formula:

Payments must continue to be made no later than 30 days after each anniversary date of the first payment made pursuant to part 144 of this chapter.

However, he must maintain the value of the fund at no less than the value that the fund would have if annual payments were made as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the owner or operator establishes a plugging and abandonment trust fund after having used one or more alternate mechanisms specified in this section or in Sec.  144.63 of this chapter, his first payment must be in at least the amount that the fund would contain if the trust fund were established initially and annual payments made according to specifications of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> After the pay-in period is completed, whenever the current plugging and abandonment cost estimate changes, the owner or operator must compare the new estimate with the trustee's most recent annual valuation of the trust fund. If the value of the fund is less than the amount of the new estimate, the owner or operator, within 60 days after the change in the cost estimate, must either deposit an amount into the fund so that its value after this deposit at least equals the amount of the current plugging and abandonment cost estimate, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this section to cover the difference.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the value of the trust fund is greater than the total amount of the current plugging and abandonment cost estimate, the owner or operator may submit a written request to the Regional Administrator for release of

If the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that the cost of plugging and abandonment will be significantly greater than the value of the trust fund, he may withhold reimbursement of such amounts as he deems prudent until he determines, in accordance with Sec.  144.63(i), that the owner or operator is no longer required to maintain financial assurance for plugging and abandonment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The Regional Administrator will agree to termination of the trust when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with Sec.  144.63(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Surety bond guaranteeing payment into a plugging and abandonment trust fund.

To pass this test the owner or operator must meet the criteria of either paragraph (f)(1)(i) or (f)(1)(ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator must have:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Two of the following three ratios: A ratio of total liabilities to net worth less than 2.0; a ratio of the sum of net income plus depreciation, depletion, and amortization to total liabilities greater than 0.1; and a ratio of current assets to current liabilities greater than 1.5; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Net working capital and tangible net worth each at least six times the sum of the current plugging and abandonment cost estimate; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Tangible net worth of at least $10 million; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Assets in the United States amounting to at least 90 percent of his total assets or at least six times the sum of the current plugging and abandonment cost estimate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator must have:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A current rating for his most recent bond issuance of AAA, AA, A or BBB as issued by Standard and Poor's or Aaa, Aa, A, or Baa as issued by Moody's; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Tangible net worth at least six times the sum of the current plugging and abandonment cost estimate; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Tangible net worth of at least $10 million; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Assets located in the United States amounting to at least 90 percent of his total assets or at least six times the sum of the current plugging and abandonment cost estimates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The phrase ``current plugging and abandonment cost estimate'' as used in paragraph (f)(1) of this section refers to the cost estimate required to be shown in paragraphs 1 through 4 of the letter from the owner's or operator's chief financial officer Sec.  144.70(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To demonstrate that he meets this test, the owner or operator must submit the following items to the Regional Administrator:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A letter signed by the owner's or operator's chief financial officer and worded as specified in Sec.  144.70(f); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A copy of the independent certified public accountant's report on examination of the owner's or operator's financial statements for the latest completed fiscal year; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A special report from the owner's or operator's independent certified public accountant to the owner or operator stating that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> He has compared the data which the letter from the chief financial officer specifies as having been derived from the independently audited, year-end financial statements for the latest fiscal year with the amounts in such financial statements; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In connection with that procedure, no matters came to his attention which caused him to believe that the specified data should be adjusted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An owner or operator of a new injection well must submit the items specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section to the Regional Administrator within 90 days after the close of each succeeding fiscal year. This information must consist of all three items specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> After the initial submission of items specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, the owner or operator must send updated information to the Regional Administrator within 90 days after the close of each succeeding fiscal year. This information must consist of all three items specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, he must send notice to the Regional Administrator of intent to establish alternate financial assurance as specified in this section. The notice must be sent by certified mail within 90 days after the end of the fiscal year for which the year-end financial data show that the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements. The owner or operator must provide the alternate financial assurance within 120 days after the end of such fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The Regional Administrator may, based on a reasonable belief that the owner or operator may no longer meet the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, require reports of financial condition at any time from the owner or operator in addition to those specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. If the Regional Administrator finds, on the basis of such reports or other information, that the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the owner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section within 30 days after notification of such a finding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The Regional Administrator may disallow use of this test on the basis of qualifications in the opinion expressed by the independent certified public accountant in his report on examination of the owner's or operator's financial statements [see paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section]. An adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion will be cause for disallowance. The Regional Administrator will evaluate other qualifications on an individual basis. The owner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section within 30 days after notification of the disallowance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The owner or operator is no longer required to submit the items specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with Sec.  144.63(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> An owner or operator may meet the requirements of this section by obtaining a written guarantee, hereafter referred to as ``corporate guarantee.'' The guarantee must be the parent corporation of the owner or operator. The guarantee must meet the requirements for owners or operators in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(8) of this section and must comply with the terms of the corporate guarantee. The wording of the corporate guarantee must be identical to the wording specified in Sec.  144.70(h). The corporate guarantee must accompany the items sent to the Regional Administrator as specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. The terms of the corporate guarantee must provide that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the owner or operator fails to perform plugging and abandonment of the injection well covered by the corporate guarantee in accordance with the plugging and abandonment plan and other permit requirements whenever required to do so, the guarantee will do so or establish a trust fund as specified in Sec.  144.63(a) in the name of the owner or operator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The corporate guarantee will remain in force unless the guarantor sends notice of cancellation by certified mail to the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator, as evidenced by the return receipts. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120 days beginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation

by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator, as evidenced by the return receipts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the owner or operator fails to provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section and obtain the written approval of such alternate assurance from the Regional Administrator within 90 days after receipt by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator of a notice of cancellation of the corporate guarantee from the guarantor, the guarantor will provide such alternative financial assurance in the name of the owner or operator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Use of multiple financial mechanisms. An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by establishing more than one financial mechanism per injection well. These mechanisms are limited to trust funds, surety bonds, guaranteeing payment into a trust fund, letters of credit, and insurance. The mechanisms must be as specified in paragraphs (a), (b), (d), and (e), respectively, of this section, except that it is the combination of mechanisms, rather than the single mechanism, which must provide financial assurance for an amount at least equal to the adjusted plugging and abandonment cost. If an owner or operator uses a trust fund in combination with a surety bond or letter of credit, he may use that trust fund as the standby trust fund for the other mechanisms. A single standby trust may be established for two or more mechanisms. The Regional Administrator may invoke any or all of the mechanisms to provide for plugging and abandonment of the injection well.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Use of a financial mechanism for multiple facilities. An owner or operator may use a financial assurance mechanism specified in this section to meet the requirements of this section for more than one injection well. Evidence of financial assurance submitted to the Regional Administrator must include a list showing, for each injection well, the EPA Identification Number, name, address, and the amount of funds for plugging and abandonment assured by the mechanism. If the injection wells covered by the mechanism are in more than one Region, identical evidence of financial assurance must be submitted to and maintained with the Regional Administrators of all such Regions. The amount of funds available through the mechanism must be no less than the sum of funds that would be available if a separate mechanism had been established and maintained for each injection well. In directing funds available through the mechanism for plugging and abandonment of any of the injection wells covered by the mechanism, the Regional Administrator may direct only the amount of funds designated for that injection well, unless the owner or operator agrees to use additional funds available under the mechanism.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Release of the owner or operator from the requirements of this section. Within 60 days after receiving certifications from the owner or operator and an independent registered professional engineer that plugging and abandonment has been accomplished in accordance with the plugging and abandonment plan, the Regional Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing that he is no longer required by this section to maintain financial assurance for plugging and abandonment of the injection well, unless the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that plugging and abandonment has not been in accordance with the plugging and abandonment plan.</p>
