                                Sec. 706.30  Clearance of certain local union representatives.

                            <p class="depth0">It is recognized that security clearance of certain union  representatives may be necessary to assure opportunity for effective  representation of employees in collective bargaining relationships with  DOE contractors. Accordingly, DOE managers may authorize investigation  for ``Q'' clearance of union officials whose functions as  representatives of employees may reasonably be expected to require  access to Restricted Data under NLRB and other procedures according to  applicable law (LMRA, 1947); to effectively perform their representation  functions in the resolution of grievances and in other collective  bargaining relationships with contractors; to effectuate the  recommendation of the President's Commission on Labor Relations in the  Atomic Energy Installations in respect to integration of the union into  the plant organization ``as to two-way channel of communication and a  medium of understanding between management and workers''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the pre-contract stage of union-management relations, the  requirements of the Labor Management Relations Act normally will be the  applicable criteria for determining which bargaining representatives, if  any, will need access to classified material in the exercise of their  functions as employee representatives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After a bargaining relationship has been established between the  contractor and the representatives of its employees the nature of this  relationship and the procedures followed in it normally will be the  controlling criteria for determination of the access to be granted to  particular persons in carrying out their functions as employee  representatives. For example, many contract grievance procedures  designate by title certain union and management officials who are to  have definite roles in the resolution of grievances under the procedure.  Investigation for ``Q'' clearance will normally be   in order for such officials, both company and union, employee, and non- employee. In addition, persons not so designated may be investigated for  clearance where the company and the union advise DOE manager that their  established relationships contemplate access for such persons.</p>
