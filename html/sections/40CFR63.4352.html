                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must meet all the requirements of this section to  demonstrate continuous compliance with the organic HAP overall control  efficiency. The organic HAP overall control efficiency for each  compliance period, determined according to the procedures in Sec.  63.4351(d), must be equal to or greater than the applicable organic HAP  overall control efficiency limit in Table 1 to this subpart. Each month  following the initial compliance period described in Sec. 63.4350 is a  compliance period. You must perform the calculations in Sec. 63.4351(d)  on a monthly basis. You must meet the applicable requirements of  paragraphs (c) through (j) of this section to demonstrate continuous  compliance with the oxidizer outlet organic HAP concentration limit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the organic HAP overall control efficiency for any compliance  period failed to meet the applicable organic HAP overall control  efficiency in Table 1 to this subpart, this is a deviation from the  emission limitation for that compliance period and must be reported as  specified in Sec. Sec. 63.4310(c)(6) and 63.4311(a)(7).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each operating  limit required by Sec. 63.4292 that applies to you, as specified in  Table 2 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an operating parameter is out of the allowed range specified  in Table 2 to this subpart, this is a deviation from the operating limit  that must be reported as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.4310(c)(6) and  63.4311(a)(7).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an operating parameter deviates from the operating limit  specified in Table 2 to this subpart, then you must assume that the  emission capture system and add-on control device were achieving zero  efficiency during the time period of the deviation. For the purposes of  completing the compliance calculations specified in Sec. 63.4351(d)(4),  you must treat the coating, printing, thinning, and cleaning materials  applied during a deviation on a controlled web coating/printing  operation as if they were applied on an uncontrolled web coating/ printing operation for the time period of the deviation as indicated in  Equation 1 of Sec. 63.4341.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(4)</em>, you must treat the coating, printing, thinning, and  cleaning materials applied during a deviation on a controlled web  coating/printing operation as if they were applied on an uncontrolled  web coating/printing operation for the time period of the deviation as  indicated in Equation 1 of Sec. 63.4341.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the work  practice standards in Sec. 63.4293. If you did not develop a work  practice plan, or you did not implement the plan, or you did not keep  the records required by Sec. 63.4312(j)(8), this is a deviation from  the work practice standards that must be reported as specified in  Sec. Sec. 63.4310(c)(6) and 63.4311(a)(7).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> As part of each semiannual compliance report required in Sec.  63.4311, you must identify the web coating/printing operation(s) for  which you use the organic HAP overall control efficiency option or the  oxidizer outlet organic HAP concentration option. If there were no  deviations from the organic HAP overall control efficiency limitations,  submit a statement that you were in compliance with the emission  limitations during the reporting period because the organic HAP overall  control efficiency for each compliance period was greater than or equal  to the applicable organic HAP overall control efficiency in Table 1 to  this subpart, and you achieved the operating limits required by Sec.  63.4292 and the work practice standards required by Sec. 63.4293 during  each compliance period. If there were no deviations from the oxidizer  outlet organic HAP concentration limit, submit a statement that you were  in compliance with the oxidizer outlet organic HAP concentration limit,  the efficiency of the capture system is 100 percent, and you achieved  the operating limits required by Sec. 63.4292 and the work practice  standards required by Sec. 63.4293 during each compliance period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Consistent with Sec. Sec. 63.6(e) and 63.7(e)(1), deviations  that occur during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction of the  emission capture system, add-on control device, or web coating/printing  operation that may affect emission capture or control device efficiency  are not violations if you demonstrate to the Administrator's  satisfaction that you were operating in accordance with Sec.  63.6(e)(1). The Administrator will determine whether deviations that  occur during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are  violations according to the provisions in Sec. 63.6(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> You must maintain records as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.4312 and  63.4313.  [68 FR 32189, May 29, 2003, as amended at 71 FR 20465, Apr. 20, 2006]</p><p class="depth2">Performance Testing and Monitoring Requirements</p>
