                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The fact that a proposed action is of a classified nature does  not relieve the proponent of the action from complying with NEPA and the  CEQ regulations. Therefore, environmental documents shall be prepared,  safeguarded   and disseminated in accordance with the requirements applicable to  classified information. When feasible, these documents shall be  organized in such a manner that classified portions are included as  appendices so that unclassified portions can be made available to the  public. Review of classified NEPA documentation will be coordinated with  the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to fulfill requirements of  section 309 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7609 et seq.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It should be noted that a classified EA/EIS serves the same  ``informed decisionmaking'' purpose as does a published unclassified EA/ EIS. Even though the classified EA/EIS does not undergo general public  review and comment, it must still be part of the information package to  be considered by the decisionmaker for the proposed action. The content  of a classified EA/EIS (or the classified portion of a public EA/EIS)  will therefore meet the same content requirements applicable to a  published unclassified EA/EIS.</p>
