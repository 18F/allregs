Amounts deferred under this  program can be used to cover costs to install all or part of a  distributed generation system that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Borrower will own and operate, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The consumer owns, provided the system owned by the consumer  does not exceed 5KW.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A distributed generation project may include one or more  individual systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Deferments for contributions-in-aid of construction. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A  Borrower may request RUS to defer principal payments to enable the  Borrower to make funds available to new full time residential consumers  to assist them in paying their share of the construction costs  (contribution-in-aid of construction) needed to connect them to the  Borrower's system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amounts available for this purpose will be limited to the amount  of the construction costs that are in excess of the average cost per  residential consumer incurred by the Borrower to connect new full time  residential consumers during the last calendar year for which data are  available.
