The timeline shall include the date by which the refinery will produce conventional gasoline that complies with the annual average statutory NOX baseline on a quarterly basis as determined according to Sec. 80.101(k)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A demonstration that the conditions for which the refinery was granted small refiner status under Sec. 80.235 are still applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Information already submitted to the Administrator as part of a prior petition under paragraph (k) of this section, shall be updated if applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Approval or disapproval of petitions. The Administrator may approve a petition under this paragraph (l) if it includes information sufficient to demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that cost and/or technological constraints make it infeasible for the refinery to comply with an alternative anti-dumping compliance baseline of five years or less, or that ends on or before January 1, 2006.

(i) If the refiner's application for an extended compliance period under this paragraph (l) is approved, then the refinery must comply with the statutory baseline NOX standard, on average, for gasoline produced beginning by not later than the 19th quarter (for a six year compliance period) or by no later than the 22nd quarter (for a seven year compliance period).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The refinery must meet all other applicable requirements in paragraph (k) of this section, including the production of a net NOX benefit under paragraph (k)(3)(ii) of this section, except that the following provisions shall apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For any cumulative NOX deficit remaining at the expiration of the fifth year, based on the NOX emission performance of gasoline actually produced at the refinery, and as calculated under paragraph (k)(3)(ii) of this section, the refiner shall provide an additional NOX benefit equal to one half ton of NOX emissions per ton of deficit remaining by the end of the refinery's alternative anti-dumping averaging period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For any cumulative NOX deficit remaining at the expiration of the sixth year, based on the NOX emission performance of gasoline actually produced at the refinery, and as calculated under paragraph (k)(3)(ii) of this section, the refiner shall provide an additional NOX benefit equal to one ton of NOX emissions per ton of deficit remaining by the end of the refinery's alternative anti-dumping averaging period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The additional NOX benefits required under this paragraph (l)(6)(ii) of this section may come from the production of gasoline at the refinery that is cleaner than the statutory baseline or from the purchase and retirement of stationary source NOX credits or allowances as provided in paragraph (k)(3)(iii) of this section.
