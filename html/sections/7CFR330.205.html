                            <p class="depth0">When an outstanding permit for the movement of a plant pest is  canceled by the Deputy Administrator and not reinstated under Sec.  330.204(c), the further movement of the plant pest covered thereby into  or through the United States, or interstate, is prohibited by the Plant  Protection Act unless authorized in another permit. The permittee should  arrange for disposal of the plant pest involved in a manner satisfactory  to the Deputy Administrator to prevent plant pest dissemination. The  Deputy Administrator may, whenever he deems it necessary as an emergency  measure in order to prevent the dissemination of any plant pest new to  or not theretofore known to be widely prevalent or distributed within  and throughout the United States, seize, quarantine, treat, apply other  remedial measures to, destroy, or otherwise dispose of, in such manner  as he deems appropriate, any plant pest which is moving without  compliance with any conditions in the permit or the provisions of this  part or after the permit has been canceled.
