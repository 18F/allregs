                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A debtor who intends to inspect or copy agency or USDA records  with respect to the debt must notify the creditor agency in writing  within 30 days of the date of the Notice of Intent to Collect by  Administrative Offset. In response, the agency must notify the debtor of  the location, time, and any other conditions, consistent with part 1,  subpart A, of this title, for inspecting and copying, and that the  debtor may be liable for reasonable copying expenses. A decision by the  agency under this paragraph shall not be subject to review under subpart  F or by NAD under 7 CFR part 11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The debtor may, in response to the Notice of Intent to Collect  by Administrative Offset, propose to the creditor agency a written  agreement to repay the debt as an alternative to administrative offset.  Any debtor who wishes to do this must submit a written proposal for  repayment of the debt, which must be received by the creditor agency  within 30 days of the date of the Notice of Intent to Collect by  Administrative Offset or 15 days after the date of a decision adverse to  the debtor under subpart F. In response, the creditor agency must notify  the debtor in writing whether the proposed agreement is acceptable. In  exercising its discretion, the creditor agency must balance the  government's interest in collecting the debt against fairness to the  debtor. A decision by the agency under this paragraph shall not be  subject to review under subpart F or by NAD under 7 CFR part 11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A debtor must request an administrative review of the debt under  subpart F within 30 days of the date of the Notice of Intent to Collect  by Administrative Offset for purposes of a proposed collection by non- centralized administrative offset and within 60 days of the date of the  Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset for purposes of a  proposed collection by referral to Treasury for offset against other  Federal payments that would include tax refunds.</p>
