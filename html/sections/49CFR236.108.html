                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Insulation resistance of wires and cables, except wires connected directly to track rails, shall be tested when wires, cables, and insulation are dry. Insulation resistance tests shall be made between all conductors and ground, and between conductors in each multiple conductor cable, and between conductors in trunking, when wires or cables are installed and at least once every ten years thereafter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Then insulation resistance of wire or cable is found to be less than 500,000 ohms, prompt action shall be taken to repair or replace the defective wire or cable and until such defective wire or cable is replaced, insulation resistance test shall be made annually.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In no case shall a circuit be permitted to function on a conductor having an insulation resistance to ground or between conductors of less than 200,000 ohms during the period required for repair or replacement.
