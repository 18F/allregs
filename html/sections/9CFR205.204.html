                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If an EFS is filed somewhere other than with the system  operator, and if notice of it is filed with the system operator, such  notice could be electronic filing, telephoned information, or any other  form of notice which gives the system operator the information needed  for the master list. Such notice need not be signed. Note that the  Section does not contain any requirement for such notice except the one  in subsection (c)(4)(B) that an EFS must be filed somewhere pursuant to  State law as discussed above.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Countermeasures against falsifications, errors or omissions in  such notices or in the handling of them by the system operator, such as  requirements that the notices be on paper and signed, with copies date- stamped and returned to the persons filing them, however advisable they  might be from other standpoints, are discretionary with the State and  not required by the Section.
