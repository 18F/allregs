the payment by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 of not more than three points. The payment must be a customary requirement of the lender for the seller within the community where the property is located. Terms of payment will be incorporated in Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1955-45 and will be fixed as of the date the form is signed by the appropriate FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 official. Points will not be paid to reduce the purchaser's interest rate. The payment will be deducted from the funds to be received by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 at closing.
