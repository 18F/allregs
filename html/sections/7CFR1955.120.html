                            <p class="depth0">To effect regular sale of inventory SFH property to a purchaser who is financing the purchase of the property with a non-Rural Development loan, the County Supervisor may authorize the payment by Rural Development of not more than three points. The payment must be a customary requirement of the lender for the seller within the community where the property is located. Terms of payment will be incorporated in Form RD 1955-45 and will be fixed as of the date the form is signed by the appropriate Rural Development official. Points will not be paid to reduce the purchaser's interest rate. The payment will be deducted from the funds to be received by Rural Development at closing.
