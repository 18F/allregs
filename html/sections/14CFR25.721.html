The overloads must be assumed to act in the upward and aft directions in combination with side loads acting inboard and outboard. In the absence of a more rational analysis, the side loads must be assumed to be up to 20 percent of the vertical load or 20 percent of the drag load, whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The airplane must be designed to avoid any rupture leading to the spillage of enough fuel to constitute a fire hazard as a result of a wheels-up landing on a paved runway, under the following minor crash landing conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Impact at 5 feet-per-second vertical velocity, with the airplane under control, at Maximum Design Landing Weight--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> With the landing gear fully retracted; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> With any one or more landing gear legs not extended.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sliding on the ground, with--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The landing gear fully retracted and with up to a 20[deg] yaw angle; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any one or more landing gear legs not extended and with 0[deg] yaw angle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For configurations where the engine nacelle is likely to come into contact with the ground, the engine pylon or engine mounting must be designed so that when it fails due to overloads (assuming the overloads to act predominantly in the upward direction and separately, predominantly in the aft direction), the failure mode is not likely to cause the spillage of enough fuel to constitute a fire hazard.
