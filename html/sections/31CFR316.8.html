If a bond bearing an issue date of January 1,  1951, or thereafter, was held for the 11-year period from the first  semianual interest accrual period that began on or after January 1,  1980, its guaranteed minimum investment yield for such period was  increased by one-half of one percent per annum, compounded semiannually.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Market-based variable investment yield. In order to be eligible  for the market-based variable investment yield, Series E savings bonds  had to be held at least five years beginning with the first semiannual  interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982. The  market-based variable investment yield shall be determined by the  Secretary of the Treasury as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For each 6-month period, starting with the period beginning May  1, 1982, the average market yield on outstanding marketable Treasury  securities with a remaining term to maturity of approximately 5 years  during such period is determined.

The redemption value of a bond on a given interest accrual date  during any extended maturity period will be the higher of the value  produced by using the applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield or  the value produced by using the appropriate market-based variable  investment yield. The calculation of these values is described below:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Guaranteed minimum investment yield and resulting values during  an extended maturity period. A bond has a guaranteed minimum investment  yield for each of its extended maturity periods. The applicable  guaranteed minimum investment yields for the current extended maturity  period and any subsequent periods are specified in paragraph (c) of this  section. In order to determine the value of a bond during an extended  maturity period, the value of the bond either at the end of the next  preceding maturity period or when the guaranteed minimum investment  yield last increased, \8\ whichever occurs later, is determined using  the applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield. This value is then  used as the base upon which interest accrues during the extended  maturity period at the guaranteed minimum investment yield in effect for  savings bonds at the beginning of that period. The resulting semiannual  values are then compared with the corresponding values determined by  using the applicable market-based variable investment yields. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\8\ The 11-year bonus was the last increase in the guaranteed  minimum investment yield (see paragraph (b)(2)). Series E bonds which  were eligible to receive this bonus received it on the first semiannual  interest accrual date occuring on or after January 1, 1991. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Market-based variable investment yield and resulting values  during an extended maturity period. The market-based variable investment  yield from the first semiannual interest accrual date occuring on or  after November 1, 1982 to each semiannual interest accrual date  occurring on or after November 1, 1987, is determined as specified in  paragraph (d) of this section. The value of a bond on its first  seimannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982  is used as the base upon which interest accrues during an extended  maturity period at the applicable market-based variable investment  yield. If redeemed, the bond will receive the higher of the two values  produced by using the applicable guaranteed minimum investment   yield and the applicable market-based variable investment yield.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Market-based variable investment yields and tables of redemption  values. The market-based variable investment yields for bonds redeemed  during each 6-month period, beginning on May 1 and November 1 of each  year, are made available prior to each of those dates by the Bureau of  the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, West Virginia 26106-1328, accompanied  by tables of the redemption values of bonds for the following 6 months,  based on either the applicable market-based variable investment yields  or guaranteed minimum investment yields.
