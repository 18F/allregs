                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determination of CCC's liability. Upon receipt in good order of  the information and documents required under Sec. 1493.170, CCC will  determine whether or not a default has occurred for which CCC is liable  under the applicable Payment Guarantee. Such determination shall  include, but not be limited to, CCC's determination that all  documentation conforms to the specific requirements contained in this  subpart, and that all documents submitted for payment conform to the  requirements of the Letter of Credit and, if applicable, the Terms and  Conditions Document. If CCC determines that it is liable to the Holder  of the Payment Guarantee, CCC will pay the Holder of the Payment  Guarantee in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amount of CCC's liability. CCC's maximum liability for any  claims submitted with respect to any Payment Guarantee, not including  any CCC Late Interest payments due in accordance with paragraph (c) of  this section, will be limited to the lesser of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Guaranteed Value as stated in the Payment Guarantee, plus  Eligible Interest, less any payments received or funds realized from  insurance, security or collateral arrangements prior to claim by the  Exporter or the Assignee from or on behalf of the defaulting party or  otherwise related to the obligation in default (other than payments  between CCC, the Exporter or the Assignee); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The guaranteed percentage (as indicated in the Payment  Guarantee) of the Exported Value indicated in the evidence of export,  plus Eligible Interest, less any payments received or funds realized  from insurance, security or collateral arrangements prior to claim by  the Exporter or the Assignee from or on behalf of the defaulting party  or otherwise related to the obligation in default (other than payments  between CCC, the Exporter or the Assignee).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> CCC Late Interest. If CCC does not pay a claim within 15  Business Days of receiving the claim in good order, CCC Late Interest  will accrue in favor of the Holder of the Payment Guarantee beginning  with the sixteenth Business Day after the day of receipt of a complete  and valid claim found by CCC to be in good order and continuing until  and including the date that payment is made by CCC. CCC Late Interest  will be paid on the guaranteed amount, as determined by paragraphs  (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and will be calculated at a rate equal  to the average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day bill  auction as announced by the Department of Treasury as of the due date.  If there has been no 91-day auction within 90 calendar days of the date  CCC Late Interest begins to accrue, CCC will apply an alternative rate  in a manner to be described on the USDA Web site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Accelerated payments. CCC will pay claims only on amounts not  paid as scheduled. CCC will not pay claims for amounts due under an  accelerated payment clause in the Firm Export Sales Contract, the  Foreign Financial Institution Letter of Credit, the Terms and Conditions  Document (if applicable), or any obligation owed by the Foreign  Financial Institution to the Holder of the Payment Guarantee that is  related to the Letter of Credit issued in favor of the Exporter, unless  it is determined to be in the best interests of CCC. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, CCC at its   option may declare up to the entire amount of the unpaid balance, plus  accrued Ordinary Interest, in default, require the Holder of the Payment  Guarantee to invoke the acceleration provision in the Foreign Financial  Institution Letter of Credit or, if applicable, in the Terms and  Conditions Document, require submission of all claims documents  specified in Sec. 1493.170, and make payment to the Holder of the  Payment Guarantee in addition to such other claimed amount as may be due  from CCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Action against the Assignee. If an Assignee submits a claim for  default pursuant to Section 1493.170 and all documents submitted appear  on their face to conform with the requirements of such section, CCC will  not hold the Assignee responsible or take any action or raise any  defense against the Assignee for any action, omission, or statement by  the Exporter of which the Assignee has no knowledge.</p>
