If there is no delegated agency in the COA, then EPA will issue the permit and implement and enforce the requirements of this part. The Administrator may retain authority for implementing and enforcing the requirements of this part if the NOA and the COA are in different States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Administrator shall designate the COA for each source only once in the source's lifetime.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Offset requirements.
