                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If you were moving yourself for a new job, with no help from  your employer, then you probably would be able to deduct some of your  relocation expenses. However, if you are eligible for WTA and RITA under  this part, your Federal agency reimburses you or pays directly for many  relocation expenses that otherwise would be deductible. Since you could  have deducted these expenses if you had paid them yourself, the benefits  you receive from your agency for these ``deductible'' relocation  expenses are nontaxable. Therefore, you do not report them as income and  you cannot take them as deductions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> However, many other relocation benefits are taxable income to  you, the employee, because you could not have deducted them. You also  may not deduct the additional taxes you incur, as a result of taxable  benefits (except that you may deduct state and local income taxes on  your Federal tax return). Your agency will reimburse you for most of  these taxable expenses and for substantially all of the additional taxes  that you incur as a result of the taxable benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The following table summarizes the FTR allowances, limitations,  and tax treatment of each reimbursement, allowance, or direct payment to  a vendor.
