                            <p class="depth0">If it is an expenditure-based award, your agreement must require the  recipient to obtain the agreement administrator's prior approval if  there is to be a change in plans that results in a need for additional  Federal funding (this is unnecessary for a fixed-support TIA because the  recipient is responsible for additional costs of achieving the  outcomes). Other than that, the program official's substantial  involvement in the project should ensure that the Government has advance  notice of changes in plans.</p>
