Acceptance, as used in this clause, means the act  of an authorized representative of the Government by which the  Government assumes for itself, or as an agent of another, ownership of  existing and identified supplies, or approves specific services, as  partial or complete performance of the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance by the Government or  any provision concerning the conclusiveness thereof, the Contractor  warrants that all services performed under this contract will, at the  time of acceptance, be free from defects in workmanship and conform to  the requirements of this contract. The Contracting Officer shall give  written notice of any defect or nonconformance to the Contractor ----  [Contracting Officer shall insert the specific period of time in which  notice shall be given to the Contractor; e.g., within 30 days from the  date of acceptance by the Government,; within 1000 hours of use by the  Government,; or other specified event whose occurrence will terminate  the period of notice, or combination of any applicable events or period  of time]. This notice shall state either (1) that the Contractor shall  correct or reperform any defective or nonconforming services, or (2)  that the Government does not require correction or reperformance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the Contractor is required to correct or reperform, it shall  be at no cost to the Government, and any services corrected or  reperformed by the Contractor shall be subject to this clause to the  same extent as work initially performed. If the Contractor fails or  refuses to correct or reperform, the Contracting Officer may, by  contract or otherwise, correct or replace with similar services and  charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned to the Government thereby,  or make an equitable adjustment in the contract price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the Government does not require correction or reperformance,  the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the  contract price.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)  [48 FR 42478, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 66 FR 2136, Jan. 10, 2001]</p>
