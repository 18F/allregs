Initial start-up does not include operation solely for testing equipment. Initial start-up does not include subsequent start-ups (as defined in this section) of process units following malfunctions or process unit shutdowns.</p><p class="depth0">Instrumentation system means a group of equipment components used to condition and convey a sample of the process fluid to analyzers and instruments for the purpose of determining process operating conditions (e.g., composition, pressure, flow, etc.). Valves and connectors are the predominant type of equipment used in instrumentation systems; however, other types of equipment may also be included in these systems. Only valves nominally 0.5 inches and smaller, and connectors nominally 0.75 inches and smaller in diameter are considered instrumentation systems for the purposes of this subpart. Valves greater than nominally 0.5 inches and connectors greater than nominally 0.75 inches associated with instrumentation systems are not considered part of instrumentation systems and must be monitored individually.</p><p class="depth0">Liquids dripping means any visible leakage from the seal including dripping, spraying, misting, clouding, and ice formation. Indications of liquid dripping include puddling or new stains that are indicative of an existing evaporated drip.</p><p class="depth0">Nonrepairable means that it is technically infeasible to repair a piece of equipment from which a leak has been detected without a process unit shutdown.</p><p class="depth0">On-site or On site means, with respect to records required to be maintained by this subpart, that the records are stored at a location within a major source which encompasses the affected source. On-site includes, but is not limited to, storage at the chemical manufacturing process unit to which the records pertain, or storage in central files elsewhere at the major source.</p><p class="depth0">Open-ended valve or line means any valve, except pressure relief valves, having one side of the valve seat in contact with process fluid and one side open to atmosphere, either directly or through open piping.</p><p class="depth0">Plant site means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under common control, including properties that are separated only by a road or other public right-of-way. Common control includes properties that are owned, leased, or operated by the same entity, parent entity, subsidiary, or any combination thereof.</p><p class="depth0">Polymerizing monomer means a molecule or compound usually containing carbon and of relatively low molecular weight and simple structure (e.g., hydrogen cyanide, acrylonitrile, styrene), which is capable of conversion to polymers, synthetic resins, or elastomers by combination with itself due to heat generation caused by a pump mechanical seal surface, contamination by a seal fluid (e.g., organic peroxides or chemicals that will form organic peroxides), or a combination of both with the resultant polymer buildup causing rapid mechanical seal failure.</p><p class="depth0">Pressure release means the emission of materials resulting from the system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the pressure relief device. This release can be one release or a series of releases over a short time period due to a malfunction in the process.</p><p class="depth0">Pressure relief device or valve means a safety device used to prevent operating pressures from exceeding the maximum allowable working pressure of the process equipment. A common pressure relief device is a spring-loaded pressure relief valve. Devices that are actuated either by a pressure of less than or equal to 2.5 psig or by a vacuum are not pressure relief devices.</p><p class="depth0">Process unit means a chemical manufacturing process unit as defined in subpart F of this part, a process subject to the provisions of subpart I of this part, or a process subject to another subpart in 40 CFR part 63 that references this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Process unit shutdown means a work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit or part of a process unit during which it is technically feasible to clear process material from a process unit or part of a process unit consistent with safety constraints and during which repairs can be effected. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit or part of a process unit for less than 24 hours is not a process unit shutdown. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that would stop production from a process unit or part of a process unit for a shorter period of time than would be required to clear the process unit or part of the process unit of materials and start up the unit, and would result in greater emissions than delay of repair of leaking components until the next scheduled process unit shutdown, is not a process unit shutdown. The use of spare equipment and technically feasible bypassing of equipment without stopping production are not process unit shutdowns.</p><p class="depth0">Recapture device means an individual unit of equipment capable of and used for the purpose of recovering chemicals, but not normally for use, reuse, or sale. Recapture devices include, but are not limited to, absorbers, carbon absorbers, and condensers.</p><p class="depth0">Recovery device means an individual unit of equipment capable of and normally used for the purpose of recovering chemicals for fuel value (i.e., net positive heating value), use, reuse, or

for sale for fuel value, use or reuse. Recovery devices include, but are not limited to, absorbers, carbon absorbers, and condensers. For purposes of the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this subpart, recapture devices are considered recovery devices.</p><p class="depth0">Repaired means that equipment:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Is adjusted, or otherwise altered, to eliminate a leak as defined in the applicable sections of this subpart, and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Unless otherwise specified in applicable provisions of this subpart, is monitored as specified in Sec. 63.180 (b) and (c), as appropriate, to verify that emissions from the equipment are below the applicable leak definition.</p><p class="depth2">Routed to a process or route to a process means the emissions are conveyed by hard-piping or a closed vent system to any enclosed portion of a process unit where the emissions are predominately recycled and/or consumed in the same manner as a material that fulfills the same function in the process; and/or transformed by chemical reaction into materials that are not organic hazardous air pollutants; and/or incorporated into a product; and/or recovered.</p><p class="depth2">Sampling connection system means an assembly of equipment within a process unit used during periods of representative operation to take samples of the process fluid. Equipment used to take non-routine grab samples is not considered a sampling connection system.</p><p class="depth2">Screwed connector means a threaded pipe fitting where the threads are cut on the pipe wall and the fitting requires only two pieces to make the connection (i.e., the pipe and the fitting).</p><p class="depth2">Sensor means a device that measures a physical quantity or the change in a physical quantity, such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, pH, or liquid level.</p><p class="depth2">Set pressure means the pressure at which a properly operating pressure relief device begins to open to relieve atypical process system operating pressure.</p><p class="depth2">Start-up means the setting in operation of a piece of equipment or a control device that is subject to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2">Surge control vessel means feed drums, recycle drums, and intermediate vessels. Surge control vessels are used within a process unit (as defined in the specific subpart that references this subpart) when in-process storage, mixing, or management of flow rates or volumes is needed to assist in production of a product.
