                            <p class="depth0">Denaturants prescribed in this part shall comply with the specifications set forth in this subpart. However, in order to meet requirements of national defense or for other valid reasons, the appropriate TTB officer may, pursuant to written application filed by the denaturer, authorize variations from such specifications or authorize the use of substitute denaturants if such variation or substitution will not jeopardize the revenue. Each such application shall identify the applicant by name, address, and permit number; state the number of each formula of specially denatured alcohol involved; explain why the use of the substitute denaturant, or the variation from specifications, as the case may be, is necessary; and include, as applicable, either the identity of the approved denaturant for which substitution is desired

and the identity of the substitute denaturant (including the name of the manufacturer) or the identity of the prescribed specifications and the proposed variation from those specifications. The application shall be accompanied by an 8-ounce sample of the proposed denaturing material for analysis.
