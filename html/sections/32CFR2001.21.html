                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Primary markings. At the time of original classification, the  following shall be indicated in a manner that is immediately apparent:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Classification authority. The name and position, or personal  identifier, of the original classification authority shall appear on the  ``Classified By'' line. An example might appear as:  Classified By: David Smith, Chief, Division 5</p><p class="depth3">or  Classified By: IDIMNO1</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Agency and office of origin. If not otherwise evident, the  agency and office of origin shall be identified and follow the name on  the ``Classified By'' line. An example might appear as:  Classified By: David Smith, Chief, Division 5, Department of Good Works,  Office of Administration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reason for classification. The original classification authority  shall identify the reason(s) for the decision to classify. The original  classification authority shall include on the ``Reason'' line the number  1.4 plus the letter(s) that corresponds to that classification category  in section 1.4 of the Order.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> These categories, as they appear in the Order, are as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Military plans, weapons systems, or operations;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Foreign government information;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Intelligence activities (including covert action), intelligence  sources or methods, or cryptology;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States,  including confidential sources;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to the  national security;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> United States Government programs for safeguarding nuclear  materials or facilities;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations,  infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services relating to the  national security; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> The development, production, or use of weapons of mass  destruction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An example might appear as:  Classified By: David Smith, Chief, Division 5, Department of Good Works,  Office of Administration Reason: 1.4(g)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Declassification instructions. The duration of the original  classification decision shall be placed on the ``Declassify On'' line.  When declassification dates are displayed numerically, the following  format shall be used: YYYYMMDD. Events must be reasonably definite and  foreseeable. The original classification authority will apply one of the  following instructions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A date or event for declassification that corresponds to the  lapse of the information's national security sensitivity, which is equal  to or less than 10 years from the date of the original decision. The  duration of classification would be marked as:  Classified By: David Smith, Chief, Division 5, Department of Good Works,  Office of Administration Reason: 1.4(g) Declassify On: 20201014 or Declassify On: Completion of Operation</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A date not to exceed 25 years from the date of the original  decision. For example, on a document that contains information  classified on October 10, 2010, apply a date up to 25 years on the  ``Declassify On'' line:  Classified By: David Smith, Chief, Division 5, Department of Good Works,  Office of Administration Reason: 1.4(g) Declassify On: 20351010</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the classified information should clearly and demonstrably  be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a  human intelligence source, no date or event is required and the marking  ``50X1-HUM'' shall be used in the ``Declassify On'' line; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the classified information should clearly and demonstrably  be expected to reveal key design concepts of weapons of mass  destruction, no date or event is required and the marking ``50X2-WMD''  shall be used in the ``Declassify On'' line.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Overall marking. The highest level of classification is  determined by the highest level of any one portion within the document  and shall appear in a way that will distinguish it clearly from the  informational text.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conspicuously place the overall classification at the top and  bottom of the outside of the front cover (if any), on the title page (if  any), on the first page, and on the outside of the back cover (if any).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For documents containing information classified at more than one  level, the overall marking shall be the highest level. For example, if a  document contains some information marked ``Secret'' and other  information marked ``Confidential,'' the overall marking would be  ``Secret.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each interior page of a classified document shall be marked at  the top and bottom either with the highest level of classification of  information contained on that page, including the designation  ``Unclassified'' when it is applicable, or with the highest overall  classification of the document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Portion marking. Each portion of a document, ordinarily a  paragraph, but including subjects, titles, graphics, tables, charts,  bullet statements, sub-paragraphs, classified signature blocks,   bullets and other portions within slide presentations, and the like,  shall be marked to indicate which portions are classified and which  portions are unclassified by placing a parenthetical symbol immediately  preceding the portion to which it applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To indicate the appropriate classification level, the symbols  ``(TS)'' for Top Secret, ``(S)'' for Secret, and ``(C)'' for  Confidential will be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Portions which do not meet the standards of the Order for  classification shall be marked with ``(U)'' for Unclassified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In cases where portions are segmented such as paragraphs, sub- paragraphs, bullets, and sub-bullets and the classification level is the  same throughout, it is sufficient to put only one portion marking at the  beginning of the main paragraph or main bullet. If there are different  levels of classification among these segments, then all segments shall  be portion marked separately in order to avoid over-classification of  any one segment. If the information contained in a sub-paragraph or sub- bullet is a higher level of classification than its parent paragraph or  parent bullet, this does not make the parent paragraph or parent bullet  classified at that same level. Each portion shall reflect the  classification level of that individual portion and not any other  portions. At the same time, any portion, no matter what its status, is  still capable of determining the overall classification of the document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Dissemination control and handling markings. Many agencies  require additional control and handling markings that supplement the  overall classification markings. See Sec. 2001.24(j) for specific  guidance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Date of origin of document. The date of origin of the document  shall be indicated in a manner that is immediately apparent.</p>
