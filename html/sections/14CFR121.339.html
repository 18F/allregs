Unless excess rafts of enough capacity are provided, the  buoyancy and seating capacity beyond the rated capacity of the rafts  must accommodate all occupants of the airplane in the event of a loss of  one raft of the largest rated capacity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At least one pyrotechnic signaling device for each life raft.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An approved survival type emergency locator transmitter.  Batteries used in this transmitter must be replaced (or recharged, if  the battery is rechargeable) when the transmitter has been in use for  more than 1 cumulative hour, or when 50 percent of their useful life (or  for rechargeable batteries, 50 percent of their useful life of charge)  has expired, as established by the transmitter manufacturer under its  approval. The new expiration date for replacing (or recharging) the  battery must be legibly marked on the outside of the transmitter. The  battery useful life (or useful life of charge) requirements of this  paragraph do not apply to batteries (such as water-activated batteries)  that are essentially unaffected during probable storage intervals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The required life rafts, life preservers, and survival type  emergency locator transmitter must be easily accessible in the event of  a ditching without appreciable time for preparatory procedures. This  equipment must be installed in conspicuously marked, approved locations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A survival kit, appropriately equipped for the route to be  flown, must be attached to each required life raft.
