                            <p class="depth0">The determination of the amount of an award shall be in the discretion of the Commission. The Commission may exercise this discretion directly or through delegated authority pursuant to Sec. 165.15.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In determining the amount of an award, the Commission shall take into consideration--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The significance of the information provided by the whistleblower to the success of the covered judicial or administrative action or related action;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The degree of assistance provided by the whistleblower and any legal representative of the whistleblower in a covered judicial or administrative action or related action;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The programmatic interest of the Commission in deterring violations of

the Commodity Exchange Act by making awards to whistleblowers who provide information that leads to the successful enforcement of such laws;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether the award otherwise enhances the Commission's ability to enforce the Commodity Exchange Act, protect customers, and encourage the submission of high quality information from whistleblowers; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Potential adverse incentives from oversize awards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Factors that may increase the amount of a whistleblower's award. In determining whether to increase the amount of an award, the Commission will consider the following factors, which are not listed in order of importance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Significance of the information provided by the whistleblower. The Commission will assess the significance of the information provided by a whistleblower to the success of the Commission action or related action. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The nature of the information provided by the whistleblower and how it related to the successful enforcement action, including whether the reliability and completeness of the information provided to the Commission by the whistleblower resulted in the conservation of Commission resources; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The degree to which the information provided by the whistleblower supported one or more successful claims brought in the Commission action or related action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assistance provided by the whistleblower. The Commission will assess the degree of assistance provided by the whistleblower and any legal representative of the whistleblower in the Commission action or related action. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the whistleblower provided ongoing, extensive, and timely cooperation and assistance by, for example, helping to explain complex transactions, interpreting key evidence, or identifying new and productive lines of inquiry;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The timeliness of the whistleblower's initial report to the Commission or to an internal compliance or reporting system of business organizations committing, or impacted by, the violations of the Commodity Exchange Act, where appropriate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The resources conserved as a result of the whistleblower's assistance;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the whistleblower appropriately encouraged or authorized others to assist the staff of the Commission who might otherwise not have participated in the investigation or related action;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The efforts undertaken by the whistleblower to remediate the harm caused by the violations of the Commodity Exchange Act, including assisting the authorities in the recovery of the fruits and instrumentalities of the violations; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Any unique hardships experienced by the whistleblower as a result of his or her reporting and assisting in the enforcement action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Law enforcement interest. The Commission will assess its programmatic interest in deterring violations of the Commodity Exchange Act by making awards to whistleblowers who provide information that leads to the successful enforcement of such laws. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The degree to which an award enhances the Commission's ability to enforce the commodity laws;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The degree to which an award encourages the submission of high quality information from whistleblowers by appropriately rewarding whistleblower submissions of significant information and assistance, even in cases where the monetary sanctions available for collection are limited or potential monetary sanctions were reduced or eliminated by the Commission because an entity self-reported a commodities violation following the whistleblower's related internal disclosure, report, or submission;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether the subject matter of the action is a Commission priority, whether the reported misconduct involves regulated entities or fiduciaries, whether the whistleblower exposed an industry-wide practice, the type and severity of the commodity violations, the age and duration of misconduct,

the number of violations, and the isolated, repetitive, or ongoing nature of the violations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The dangers to market participants or others presented by the underlying violations involved in the enforcement action, including the amount of harm or potential harm caused by the underlying violations, the type of harm resulting from or threatened by the underlying violations, and the number of individuals or entities harmed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The degree, reliability and effectiveness of the whistleblower's assistance, including the consideration of the whistleblower's complete, timely truthful assistance to the Commission and criminal authorities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Participation in internal compliance systems. The Commission will assess whether, and the extent to which, the whistleblower and any legal representative of the whistleblower participated in internal compliance systems. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether, and the extent to which, a whistleblower reported the possible Commodity Exchange Act violations through internal whistleblower, legal or compliance procedures before, or at the same time as, reporting them to the Commission; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether, and the extent to which, a whistleblower assisted any internal investigation or inquiry concerning the reported Commodity Exchange Act violations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Factors that may decrease the amount of a whistleblower's award. In determining whether to decrease the amount of an award, the Commission will consider the following factors, which are not listed in order of importance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Culpability. The Commission will assess the culpability or involvement of the whistleblower in matters associated with the Commission's action or related actions. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The whistleblower's role in the Commodity Exchange Act violations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The whistleblower's education, training, experience, and position of responsibility at the time the violations occurred;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether the whistleblower acted with scienter, both generally and in relation to others who participated in the violations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the whistleblower financially benefitted from the violations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Whether the whistleblower is a recidivist;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The egregiousness of any wrongdoing committed by the whistleblower; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Whether the whistleblower knowingly interfered with the Commission's investigation of the violations or related enforcement actions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unreasonable reporting delay. The Commission will assess whether the whistleblower unreasonably delayed reporting the Commodity Exchange Act violations. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the whistleblower was aware of the relevant facts but failed to take reasonable steps to report or prevent the violations from occurring or continuing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the whistleblower was aware of the relevant facts but only reported them after learning about a related inquiry, investigation, or enforcement action; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether there was a legitimate reason for the whistleblower to delay reporting the violations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Interference with internal compliance and reporting systems. The Commission will assess, in cases where the whistleblower interacted with his or her entity's internal compliance or reporting system, whether the whistleblower undermined the integrity of such system. In considering this factor, the Commission will take into account whether there is evidence provided to the Commission that the whistleblower knowingly:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Interfered with an entity's established legal, compliance, or audit procedures to prevent or delay detection of the reported Commodity Exchange Act violation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Made any material false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations that hindered an entity's

efforts to detect, investigate, or remediate the reported Commodity Exchange Act violations; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provided any false writing or document knowing the writing or document contained any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or entries that hindered an entity's efforts to detect, investigate, or remediate the reported Commodity Exchange Act violations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Commission shall not take into consideration the balance of the Fund in determining the amount of an award.</p>
