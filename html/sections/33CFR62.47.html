                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Often sound signals are located on or adjacent to aids to navigation. When visual signals are obscured, sound signals warn mariners of the proximity of danger.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sound signals are distinguished by their tone and phase characteristics.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Tones are determined by the devices producing the sound (i.e., diaphones, diaphragm horns, reed horns, sirens, whistles, bells and gongs).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Phase characteristics are defined by the signal's sound pattern, i.e., the number of blasts and silent periods per minute and their durations. Sound signals emanating from fixed structures generally produce a specific number of blasts and silent periods each minute when operating. Buoy sound signals are generally actuated by the motion of the sea and therefore do not emit a regular signal characteristic.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where no live watch is maintained, sound signals are normally operated continuously. However, some are equipped with fog detectors which activate sound signals when visibility falls below a predetermined limit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mariners should not rely solely on sound signals to determine their positions for the following reasons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Distance cannot be accurately determined by sound intensity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Occasionally sound signals may not be heard in areas close to their location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Signals may not sound in cases where fog exists close to, but not at, the location of the sound signal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As buoy signals are generally activated by sea motion, they may produce no signals when seas are calm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> As previously noted, buoy positions are not always reliable. Therefore their sound signals cannot be assumed to be emanating from a fixed position.</p>
