The information collected meets the ONRR congressionally  mandated accounting and auditing responsibilities relating to Federal  and Indian minerals revenue management. Information collected regarding  production, royalties, and other payments due the Government from  activities on leased Federal or Indian land is authorized by the Federal  Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982, as amended (30 U.S.C. 1701  et seq.), as well as 43 U.S.C. 1334 and 30 U.S.C. 189, 359, 396, and  396d for oil and gas production; and by 30 U.S.C. 189, 359, 396, and  396d for solid minerals production.</p>
