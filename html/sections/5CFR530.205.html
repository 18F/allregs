An agency must make such records available to any  agency that may employ the employee later during the same calendar year.  An agency's records must document the source of any deferred excess  amount remaining to the employee's credit at the time of separation from  the agency. In the case of an employee who separates from Federal  service for at least 30 days, the agency records also must document any  payment of a deferred excess amount made by the agency after separation.</p>
