                            <p class="depth0">If a National Service Life Insurance policy on any plan other than  5-year level premium term or limited convertible 5-year level premium  term plan has not been surrendered for cash, upon written request of the  insured and complete surrender of the insurance with all claims  thereunder, after the expiration of the first policy year and while the  policy is in force under premium-paying conditions, the United States  will issue paid-up insurance for such amount as the cash value less any  indebtedness, and a charge for administrative cost for insurance issued  under 38 U.S.C. 1925, will purchase when applied as a net single premium  at the attained age of the insured. For this purpose the attained age is  the age on the birthday anniversary nearest to the effective date of the  policy plus the number of years and months from that date to the date  the paid-up insurance becomes effective. Such paid-up insurance will be  effective as of the expiration of the period for which premiums have  been paid and earned; and, any premiums paid in advance for months  subsequent to that in which the application for paid-up insurance is  made shall be refunded to the insured. The paid-up insurance, if  eligible to participate in and to receive dividends, shall be with the  right to dividends. The insured may at any time surrender the paid-up  policy for its cash value or obtain a loan on such paid-up insurance.  [30 FR 3648, Mar. 19, 1965.
