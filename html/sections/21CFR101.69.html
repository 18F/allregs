Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800)Food and Drug Administration,Department of Health and Human Services,Washington, DC 20204.To Whom It May Concern:</p><p class="depth3">The undersigned, ------------------------ submits this petition under section 403(r)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) with respect to (statement of the claim and its proposed use).</p><p class="depth3">Attached hereto and constituting a part of this petition, are the following:</p><p class="depth3">A. A statement identifying the descriptive term and the nutrient that the term is intended to characterize with respect to the level of such nutrient. The statement should address why the use of the term as proposed will not be misleading. The statement should provide examples of the nutrient content claim as it will be used on labels or labeling, as well as the types of foods on which the claim will be used. The statement shall specify the level at which the nutrient must be present or what other conditions concerning the food must be met for the use of the term in labels or labeling to be appropriate, as well as any factors that would make the use of the term inappropriate.</p><p class="depth3">B. A detailed explanation, supported by any necessary data, of why use of the food component characterized by the claim is of importance in human nutrition by virtue of its presence or absence at the levels that such claim would describe. This explanation shall also state what nutritional benefit to the public will derive from use of the claim as proposed, and why such benefit is not available through the use of existing terms defined by regulation under section 403(r)(2)(A)(i) of the act. If the claim is intended for a specific group within the population, the analysis should specifically address nutritional needs of such group, and should include scientific data sufficient for such purpose.</p><p class="depth3">C. Analytical data that shows the amount of the nutrient that is the subject of the claim and that is present in the types of foods for which the claim is intended. The assays should be performed on representative samples using the AOAC INTERNATIONAL (AOAC International) methods where available. If no AOAC International method is available, the petitioner shall submit the assay method used, and data establishing the validity of the method for assaying the nutrient in the particular food. The validation data should include a statistical analysis of the analytical and product variability.</p><p class="depth3">D. A detailed analysis of the potential effect of the use of the proposed claim on food consumption and of any corresponding changes in nutrient intake. The latter item shall specifically address the intake of nutrients that have beneficial and negative consequences in the total diet. If the claim is intended for a specific group within the population, the above analysis shall specifically address the dietary practices of such group and shall include data sufficient to demonstrate that the dietary analysis is representative of such group.</p><p class="depth3">E.

If FDA does not act within such 100 days, the petition shall be deemed to be denied unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the FDA and the petitioner. A petition that has been denied, or has been deemed to be denied, without filing shall not be made available to the public. A filed petition shall be available to the public as provided under paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within 90 days of the date of filing FDA will by letter of notification to the petitioner:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Deny the petition; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Inform the petitioner that a proposed regulation to provide for the requested use of the new term will be
