Any person subject  to the general recordkeeping requirements of section 6001 must keep the  permanent books of account or records, as required by section 6001, that  may be relevant to determining whether that person is a party to a  financing arrangement and whether that financing arrangement is a  conduit financing arrangement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application of Sections 6038 and 6038A. A financed entity that  is a reporting corporation within the meaning of section 6038A(a) and  the regulations under that section, and any other person that is subject  to the recordkeeping requirements of Sec. 1.6038A-3, must comply with  those recordkeeping requirements with respect to records that may be  relevant to determining whether the financed entity is a party to a  financing arrangement and whether that financing arrangement is a  conduit financing arrangement. Such records, including records that a  person is required to maintain pursuant to paragraph (c) of this  section, shall be considered records that are required to be maintained  pursuant to section 6038 or 6038A. Accordingly, the provisions of  sections 6038 and 6038A (including, without limitation, the penalty  provisions thereof), and the regulations under those sections, shall  apply to any records required to be maintained pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Records to be maintained--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.

An entity described in paragraph (b) of  this section must also retain all records relating to the circumstances  surrounding its participation in the financing transactions and  financing arrangements. Such documents may include, but are not limited  to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Minutes of board of directors meetings;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Board resolutions or other authorizations for the financing  transactions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Private letter rulings;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Financial reports (audited or unaudited);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Notes to financial statements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Bank statements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Copies of wire transfers;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Offering documents;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Materials from investment advisors, bankers and tax advisors;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Evidences of indebtedness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Effect of record maintenance requirement. Record maintenance in  accordance with paragraph (b) of this section generally does not require  the original creation of records that are ordinarily not created by  affected entities. If, however, a document that is actually created is  described in this paragraph (c), it is to be retained even if the  document is not of a type ordinarily created by the affected entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. This section is effective September 11, 1995.  This section shall not apply to interest payments covered by section  127(g)(3) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984, and to interest payments with  respect to other debt obligations issued prior to October 15, 1984  (whether or not such debt was issued by a Netherlands Antilles  corporation).
