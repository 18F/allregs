                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. If a manufacturer has paid the tax imposed by  chapter 32 of the Code on the price of any article sold by the  manufacturer and thereafter has repaid a portion of the price to the  purchaser or any subsequent vendee in reimbursement of expenses for  local advertising of the article or any other article sold by the  manufacturer which is taxable at the same rate under the same section of  chapter 32 of the Code, the reimbursement will be considered a price  readjustment constituting an overpayment which the manufacturer may  claim as a credit or refund. The amount of the reimbursement may not,  however, exceed the limitation provided by section 4216(e)(2) of the  Code and Sec. 53.101, determined as of the close of the calendar  quarter in which the reimbursement is made or as of the close of any  subsequent calendar quarter of the same calendar year in which it is  made. The term ``local advertising,'' as used in this section, has the  same meaning as prescribed by section 4216(e)(4) of the Code and  includes generally, advertising which is broadcast over a radio station  or television station, or appears in a newspaper or magazine, or is  displayed by means of an outdoor advertising sign or poster.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Local advertising charges excluded from taxable price in one  year but repaid in following year--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determination of price  readjustments for year in which charge is repaid. If the tax imposed by  chapter 32 of the Code was paid with respect to local advertising  charges that were excluded in computing the taxable price of an article  sold in any calendar year but are not repaid to the manufacturer's  purchaser or any subsequent vendee before May 1 of the following  calendar year, the subsequent repayment of those charges by the  manufacturer in reimbursement of expenses for local advertising will be  considered a price readjustment constituting an overpayment which the  manufacturer may claim as a credit or refund. The amount of the  reimbursement may not, however, exceed the limitation provided by  section 4216(e)(2) of the Code and Sec. 53.101, determined as of the  close of the calendar quarter in which the reimbursement is made or as  of the close of any subsequent calendar quarter of the same calendar  year in which it is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Redetermination of price readjustments for year in which charge  was made. If the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code was paid with  respect to local advertising charges that were excluded in computing the  taxable price of an article sold in any calendar year but are not repaid  to the manufacturer's purchaser or any subsequent vendor before May 1 of  the following calendar year, the manufacturer may make a  redetermination, in respect of the calendar year in which the charge was  made, of the price readjustments constituting an overpayment which the  manufacturer may claim as a credit or refund. This redetermination may  be made by excluding the local advertising charges made in the calendar  year that became taxable as of May 1 of the following calendar year.</p>
