                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Composition of allowable costs. In general, a cost  item will be deemed allowable if it is reasonable and necessary for  SFMNP purposes and otherwise satisfies allowability criteria set forth  in part 3016.22 of this title and this part. SFMNP purposes include the  administration and operation of the SFMNP. Allowable SFMNP costs may be  classified as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Food costs and administrative costs. Food costs are the costs of  eligible foods provided to SFMNP participants. Administrative costs are  the costs associated with providing SFMNP benefits and services to  participants and generally administering the SFMNP. Specific examples of  allowable administrative costs are listed in paragraph (b) of this  section. A State agency may use up to 10 percent of its total Federal  SFMNP grant to cover administrative costs. Any costs incurred for food  and/or administration above the Federal grant level will be the State  agency's responsibility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Direct and indirect costs. Direct costs are food and  administrative costs incurred specifically for the SFMNP. Indirect costs  are administrative costs that benefit multiple programs or activities,  and cannot be identified to any one program or activity without effort  disproportionate to the results achieved. In accordance with the  provisions of part 3016 of this title, a claim for reimbursement of  indirect costs shall be supported by an approved allocation plan for the  determination of such costs. An indirect cost rate developed through  such an allocation plan may not be applied to a base that includes food  costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Costs allowable with prior approval. A State or local agency  must obtain prior approval in accordance with part 3016.22 of this title  before charging to the SFMNP any capital expenditures and other cost  items designated by part 3016.22 of this title as requiring such  approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unallowable costs. Costs that are not reasonable and necessary  for SFMNP purposes, or that do not otherwise satisfy the cost principles  of part 3016.22 of this title, are unallowable. Notwithstanding any  other provision of part 3016 of this title or this Part, the cost of  constructing or operating a farmers' market is unallowable. The use of  SFMNP funds to supplement congregate meal programs is prohibited.  Unallowable costs may never be claimed for Federal reimbursement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specified allowable administrative costs. Allowable  administrative costs include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The costs associated with administration and start-up;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The costs associated with the provision of nutrition education  that meets the requirements of Sec. 249.9;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The costs of SFMNP coupon issuance, or participant education  covering proper coupon redemption procedures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The cost of eligibility determinations and outreach services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The costs associated with the coupon and market management  process, such as printing SFMNP coupons, processing redeemed coupons,  purchasing bags or other containers to be used in home-delivery and bulk  purchase operations, and training farmers, market managers, and/or  farmers who operate CSA programs on SFMNP operations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The cost of monitoring and reviewing Program operations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The cost of SFMNP training;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The cost of required reporting and recordkeeping;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The cost of determining which local sites will be utilized;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The cost of recruiting and authorizing farmers, farmers'  markets, roadside stands, and/or CSA programs to participate in the  SFMNP;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The cost of preparing contracts for farmers, farmers' markets,  roadside stands, and/or CSA programs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> The cost of developing a data processing system for redemption  and reconciliation of SFMNP coupons;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> The cost of designing program training and informational  materials; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> The cost of coordinating SFMNP responsibilities between  designated administering agencies.</p>
