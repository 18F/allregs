                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Petitions for reconsideration or modification of the Board's findings and determination of probable cause filed by a party to an investigation or hearing or other person having a direct interest in the accident investigation will be entertained only if based on the discovery of new evidence or on a showing that the Board's findings are erroneous. The petitions shall be in writing. Petitions which are repetitious of proposed findings submitted pursuant to Sec. 845.27, or of positions previously advanced, and petitions filed by a party to the hearing who failed to submit proposed findings pursuant to Sec. 845.27 will not be entertained. Petitions based on the discovery of new matter shall: identify the new matter; contain affidavits of prospective witnesses, authenticated documents, or both, or an explanation of why such substantiation is unavailable; and state why the new matter was not available prior to Board's adoption of its findings. Petitions based on a claim of erroneous findings shall set forth in detail the grounds relied upon.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a petition for reconsideration or modification is filed with the Board, copies of the petition and any supporting documentation shall be served on all other parties to the investigation or hearing and proof of service shall be attached to the petition. The other parties may file comments no later than 90 days after service of the petition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Oral presentation before the Board normally will not form a part of proceedings under this part. However, the Board may permit oral presentation where a party or interested person makes an affirmative showing that the written petition for reconsideration or modification is an insufficient means to present the party's or person's position to the Board. Where oral presentation is allowed, the Board will specify the issues to be addressed and all parties to the investigation or hearing will be given notice and the opportunity to participate.
