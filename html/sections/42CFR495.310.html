                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Rules for Medicaid EPs. The Medicaid EP's incentive payments are  subject to all of the following limitations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> First payment year. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For the first payment year, payment  under this subpart may not exceed 85 percent of the maximum threshold of  $25,000, which equals $21,250.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An EP may not begin receiving payments any later than CY 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Subsequent annual payment years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For subsequent payment years, payment may not exceed 85 percent  of the maximum threshold of $10,000, which equals $8,500.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Payments after the first payment year may continue for a  maximum of 5 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Medicaid EPs may receive payments on a non-consecutive, annual  basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> No payments may be made after CY 2021.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Maximum incentives. In no case may a Medicaid EP participate for  more than a total of 6 years, and in no case will the maximum incentive  over a 6-year period exceed $63,750.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Limitation. For a Medicaid EP who is a pediatrician described in  paragraph (b) of this section payment is limited as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The maximum payment in the first payment year is further reduced  by two-thirds, which equals $14,167.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The maximum payment in subsequent payment years is further  reduced by two-thirds, which equals $5,667.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In no case will the maximum incentive payment to a  pediatrician under this limitation exceed $42,500 over a 6-year period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Optional exception for pediatricians. A pediatrician described  in this paragraph is a Medicaid EP who does not meet the 30 percent  patient volume requirements described in Sec. 495.304 and Sec.  495.306, but who meets the 20 percent patient volume requirements  described in such sections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Limitation to only one EHR incentive program. An EP may only  receive an incentive payment from either Medicare or Medicaid in a  payment year, but not both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exception for EPs to switch programs. An EP may change his or  her EHR incentive payment program election once, consistent with Sec.  495.10 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Limitation to one State only. A Medicaid EP or eligible hospital  may receive an incentive payment from only one State in a payment year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Incentive payments to hospitals. Incentive payments to an  eligible hospital under this subpart are subject to all of the following  conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The payment is provided over a minimum of a 3-year period and  maximum of a 6-year period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The total incentive payment received over all payment years of  the program is not greater than the aggregate EHR incentive amount, as  calculated under paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> No single incentive payment for a payment year may exceed 50  percent of the aggregate EHR hospital incentive amount calculated under  paragraph (g) of this section for an individual hospital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> No incentive payments over a 2-year period may exceed 90 percent  of the aggregate EHR hospital incentive amount calculated under  paragraph (g) of this section for an individual hospital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> No hospital may begin receiving incentive payments for any year  after FY 2016, and after FY 2016, a hospital may not receive an  incentive payment unless it received an incentive payment in the prior  fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Prior to FY 2016, payments can be made to an eligible hospital  on a non-consecutive, annual basis for the fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A multi-site hospital with one CMS Certification Number is  considered one hospital for purposes of calculating payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The aggregate EHR hospital incentive amount calculated under  paragraph (g) of this section is determined by the State from which the  eligible hospital receives its first payment year incentive. If a  hospital receives incentive payments from other States in subsequent  years, total incentive payments received over all payment years of the  program can be no greater than   the aggregate EHR incentive amount calculated by the initial State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Calculation of the aggregate EHR hospital incentive amount. The  aggregate EHR hospital incentive amount is calculated as the product of  the (overall EHR amount) times (the Medicaid Share).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Overall EHR amount. The overall EHR amount for an eligible  hospital is based upon a theoretical 4 years of payment the hospital  would receive based, for each of such 4 years, upon the product of the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Initial amount. The initial amount is equal to the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The base amount which is set at $2,000,000 for each of the  theoretical 4 years; plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The discharge-related amount for the most recent continuous 12- month period selected by the State, but ending before the federal fiscal  year that serves as the first payment year. The discharge-related amount  is the sum of the following, with acute-care inpatient discharges over  the 12-month period and based upon the total acute-care inpatient  discharges for the eligible hospital (regardless of any source of  payment):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For the first through 1,149th acute-care inpatient discharge,  $0.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For the 1,150th through the 23,000th acute-care inpatient  discharge, $200.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For any acute-care inpatient discharge greater than the  23,000th, $0.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For purposes of calculating the discharge-related amount under  paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) of this section, for the last 3 of the  theoretical 4 years of payment, acute-care inpatient discharges are  assumed to increase by the provider's average annual rate of growth for  the most recent 3 years for which data are available per year. Negative  rates of growth must be applied as such.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Medicare share. The Medicare share, which equals 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Transition factor. The transition factor which equals as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For the first of the theoretical 4 years, 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For the second of the theoretical 4 years, \3/4\.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For the third of the theoretical 4 years, \1/2\.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For the fourth of the theoretical 4 years, \1/4\.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Medicaid share. The Medicaid share specified under this  paragraph for an eligible hospital is equal to a fraction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The numerator of which is the sum (for the 12-month period  selected by the State and with respect to the eligible hospital) of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The estimated number of acute-care inpatient-bed-days which are  attributable to Medicaid individuals; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The estimated number of acute-care inpatient-bed-days which are  attributable to individuals who are enrolled in a managed care  organization, a pre-paid inpatient health plan, or a pre-paid ambulatory  health plan under part 438 of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The denominator of which is the product of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The estimated total number of acute-care inpatient-bed-days with  respect to the eligible hospital during such period; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The estimated total amount of the eligible hospital's charges  during such period, not including any charges that are attributable to  charity care, divided by the estimated total amount of the hospital's  charges during such period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In computing acute-care inpatient-bed-days under paragraph  (g)(2)(i) of this section, a State may not include estimated acute-care  inpatient-bed-days attributable to individuals with respect to whom  payment may be made under Medicare Part A, or acute-care inpatient-bed- days attributable to individuals who are enrolled with a Medicare  Advantage organization under Medicare Part C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Approximate proxy for charity care. If the State determines that  an eligible provider's data are not available on charity care necessary  to calculate the portion of the formula specified in paragraph  (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the State may use that provider's data on  uncompensated care to determine an appropriate proxy for charity care,  but must include a downward adjustment to eliminate bad debt from  uncompensated care data. The State must use auditable data sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(B)</em> of this section, the amount under  such clause must be deemed to be 0.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Dual eligibility for incentives payments. A hospital may receive  incentive payments from both Medicare and Medicaid if it meets all  eligibility criteria in the payment year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Payments to State-designated entities. Payments to entities  promoting the adoption of certified EHR technology as designated by the  State must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A Medicaid EP may reassign his or her incentive payment to an  entity promoting the adoption of certified EHR technology, as defined in  Sec. 495.302, and as designated by the State, only under the following  conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State has established a method to designate entities  promoting the adoption of EHR technology that comports with the Federal  definition in Sec. 495.302.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The State publishes and makes available to all EPs a voluntary  mechanism for reassigning annual payments and includes information about  the verification mechanism the State will use to ensure that the  reassignment is voluntary and that no more than 5 percent of the annual  payment is retained by the entity for costs not related to certified EHR  technology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]  [75 FR 44565, July 28, 2010, as amended at 77 FR 54161, Sept. 4, 2012]</p>
