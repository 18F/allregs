                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Suspension of benefit payments is required effective with the  month following the month in which it is determined in accordance with  Sec. 416.714(b) that the individual is ineligible for payment due to his  or her failure to comply with our request for necessary information.  When we have information to establish that benefit payments are again  payable, the benefit payments will be reinstated for any previous month  for which the individual continued to meet the eligibility requirements  of Sec. 416.202. If the reason that an individual's benefits were  suspended was failure to comply with our request for information, the  payments for the months that benefits are reinstated will not be  prorated under Sec. 416.421.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A suspension of payment for failure to comply with our request  for information will not apply with respect to any month for which a  determination as to eligibility for or amount of payment can be made  based on information on record, whether or not furnished by an  individual specified in Sec. 416.704(a). Where it is determined that the  information of record does not permit a determination with respect to  eligibility for or amount of payment, notice of a suspension of payment  due to a recipient's failure to comply with a request for information  will be sent in accordance with Secs. 416.1336 and 416.1404.
