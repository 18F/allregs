accordance with part 147 of this subchapter, when the flock reaches 4 months of age and every 30 days thereafter. Once the flock is in egg production and chicks are hatching from it, the samples must include at least 4 individual test assay results every 30 days in flocks of more than 500 birds or 2 individual assays per month in flocks of 500 birds or fewer. One of these results must come from samples collected from hatched chicks at a participating hatchery derived from said flock. These individual test assays may be derived from pooled samples from the farm or hatchery in accordance with part 147 of this subchapter, but must be run as separate test assays in the laboratory.

If only 1 bird from the 25-bird sample is found positive for SE., the participant may request bacteriological examination of a second 25-bird sample from the flock. In addition, if the flock with the SE isolation is in egg production and eggs are under incubation, the next four consecutive hatches shall be examined bacteriologically in accordance with part 147 of this subchapter. Samples shall be collected from all of the hatching unit's chick trays and basket trays of hatching eggs, or from all chick box papers from the flock, and tested, pooling the samples into a minimum of 10 separate assays. Any followup hatchery-positive SE isolations shall result in discontinuation of subsequent hatches until the flock status is determined by bird culture. The flock will be disqualified for the U.S. S.

the flock, with either pullorum antigen or by a federally licensed Salmonella enteritidis enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test when the flock is more than 4 months of age.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Perform other corrective actions including, but not limited to, vaccination, medication, cleaning and disinfection of houses, rodent control, and movement of uninfected birds to premises that have been determined to be environmentally negative for S. enteritidis in accordance with par 147 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> One hundred percent of blood samples from the birds moved to the clean premises are tested negative for Salmonella pullorum and group D Salmonella. All birds with positive or inconclusive reactions, up to a maximum of 25 birds, shall be submitted to an authorized laboratory and examined for the presence of group D Salmonella, in accordance with part 147 of this subchapter. Cultures from positive samples shall be serotyped.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Two consecutive environmental drag swabs taken at the clean premises collected in accordance with part 147 of this subchapter 4 weeks apart are negative for S. enteritidis.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Other corrective measures at the discretion of the Official State Agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Following reinstatement, a flock will remain eligible for this classification if the flock is tested in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section every 30 days and no positive samples are found and the flock meets the requirements set forth in Sec. 145.83(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> U.S. Salmonella Monitored. This program is intended to be the basis from which the breeding-hatching industry may conduct a program for the prevention and control of salmonellosis. It is intended to reduce the incidence of Salmonella organisms in hatching eggs and chicks through an effective and practical sanitation program at the breeder farm and in the hatchery. This will afford other segments of the poultry industry an opportunity to reduce the incidence of Salmonella in their products.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A flock and the hatching eggs and chicks produced from it that have met the following requirements, as determined by the Official State Agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The flock is maintained in accordance with part 147 of this subchapter with respect to flock sanitation, cleaning and disinfection, and Salmonella isolation, sanitation, and management;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If feed contains animal protein, the protein products must have a minimum moisture content of 14.5 percent and must have been heated throughout to a minimum temperature of 190 [deg]F or above, or to a minimum temperature of 165 [deg]F for at least 20 minutes, or to a minimum temperature of 184 [deg]F under 70 lbs. pressure during the manufacturing process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Feed shall be stored and transported in a manner to prevent possible contamination;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Chicks shall be hatched in a hatchery whose sanitation is maintained in accordance with part 147 of this subchapter and sanitized or fumigated in accordance with part 147 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> An Authorized Agent shall take environmental samples from the hatchery every 30 days; i.e., meconium or chick papers.

sampling on 4 separate collection dates over a minimum of a 2-week period. Sampling and testing must be performed as described in paragraph (f)(1)(vi) of this section. An unconfirmed environmental Salmonella isolation shall not change this Salmonella negative status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Official State Agency may monitor the effectiveness of the sanitation practices in accordance with part 147 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In order for a hatchery to sell products of paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (f)(1)(vii) of this section, all products handled shall meet the requirements of the classification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> This classification may be revoked by the Official State Agency if the participant fails to follow recommended corrective measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> U.S. Avian Influenza Clean. This program is intended to be the basis from which the breeding-hatchery industry may conduct a program for the prevention and control of avian influenza. It is intended to determine the presence of avian influenza in primary breeding chickens through routine surveillance of each participating breeding flock. A flock and the hatching eggs and chicks produced from it will qualify for this classification when the Official State Agency determines that they have met the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is a primary breeding flock in which a minimum of 30 birds have been tested negative for antibodies to avian influenza using an approved test as described in Sec. 145.14 when more than 4 months of age. To retain this classification:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A sample of at least 30 birds must be tested negative at intervals of 90 days; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A sample of fewer than 30 birds may be tested, and found to be negative, at any one time if all pens are equally represented and a total of 30 birds is tested within each 90-day period; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The flock is tested as provided in Sec. 145.14(d) at intervals of 30 days or less and found to be negative, and a total of 30 samples are collected and tested within each 90-day period; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During each 90-day period, all primary spent fowl, up to a maximum of 30, must be tested serologically and found negative for antibodies for avian influenza within 21 days prior to movement to slaughter.
