A safety approval may be issued independent of a license, and it does not confer any authority to conduct activities for which a license is required under 14 CFR chapter III. A safety approval does not relieve its holder of the duty to comply with all applicable requirements of law or regulation that may apply to the holder's activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Launch vehicle, reentry vehicle, safety system, process, service, or any identified component thereof; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Qualified and trained personnel, performing a process or function related to licensed launch activities or vehicles.</p><p class="depth2">Safety element.
