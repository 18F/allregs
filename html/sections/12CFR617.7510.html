                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A qualified lender should respond to the notice by stating why  FCA should not issue a distressed loan restructuring directive, by  proposing changes to the directive, or by seeking other suitable relief.  The response   must include any information, documentation, or other relevant evidence  that supports the qualified lender's position. The response may include  a plan for achieving compliance with the distressed loan restructuring  requirements of the Act. The response must be in writing and delivered  to FCA within 30 days after the date on which the qualified lender  received the notice. In its discretion, FCA may extend the time period  for good cause. FCA may shorten the 30-day period with the consent of  the qualified lender or when FCA determines that providing the full 30  days would result in a borrower not receiving distressed loan  restructuring rights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the qualified lender fails to respond within 30 days or such  other time period specified by FCA, this failure will constitute a  waiver of any objections to the proposed distressed loan restructuring  directive.</p>
