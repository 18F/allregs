                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A drydock examination conducted in compliance with Sec.  115.600  of this part must be conducted while the vessel is hauled out of the  water or placed in a drydock or slipway. During the examination all  accessible parts of the vessel's underwater body and all through hull  fittings, including the hull plating, appendages, propellers, shafts,  bearings, rudders, sea chests, sea valves, and sea strainers shall be  made available for examination. Sea chests, sea valves, and sea  strainers must be opened for examination. The accuracy of draft or  loading marks, if required by Sec.  122.602 of this subpart, must be  verified if not already verified at construction or a previous drydock  examination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An internal structural examination conducted in compliance with  Sec.  115.600 of this part may be conducted while the vessel is afloat  or out of the water and consists of a complete examination of the  vessel's main strength members, including the major internal framing,  the hull plating, voids, and ballast, cargo, and fuel oil tanks. Where  the internal framing or plating of the vessel is concealed, sections of  the lining, ceiling or insulation may be removed or the parts otherwise  probed or exposed so that the inspector may be satisfied as to the  condition of the hull structure. Fuel oil tanks need not be cleaned out  and internally examined if the marine inspector is able to determine by  external examination that the general condition of the tanks is  satisfactory.
