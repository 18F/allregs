                                Sec. 1406.2  Background.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Fire data analyzed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission  disclose a number of incidents involving coal and wood burning  appliances. Many of these cases involve improper   installation of the appliances, especially where they are installed with  insufficient clearances to adjacent combustibles such as walls,  ceilings, floors, draperies, carpets, or furnishings. Another common  installation problem involves the use of improper types of chimneys or  chimney connectors and insufficient clearances between these devices and  combustibles. Other incidents involve improper operation of the  appliance, such as by overfiring it or using flammable liquids to start  the fire. Still other incidents occur when appliances are improperly  maintained and develop mechanical defects or excessive deposits of  flammable creosote.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After considering the available data on the causes of fires in  these appliances, the Commission concludes that there is an unreasonable  risk of injury associated with appliances that are sold without  notifying consumers of the information they need to prevent many of  these occurrences. Accordingly, the Commission has determined that  disclosure of the information required by Sec. 1406.4 is necessary to  help the Commission in carrying out the purposes of the Consumer Product  Safety Act of (1) helping to protect the public against unreasonable  risks of injury associated with consumer products and (2) assisting  consumers in evaluating the comparative safety of consumer products.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Commission has also determined that in carrying out these  purposes of the act, it is necessary for manufacturers to provide to the  Commission a copy of the information provided to consumers and a  statement of the reasons why some of the information was selected, in  accordance with Sec. 1406.5.  [48 FR 21914, May 16, 1983, as amended at 48 FR 50706, Nov. 3, 1983]</p>
