Alternatively, the Commissioner shall by order deny the petition, and notify the petitioner of such order and the reasons therefor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The regulation shall list any use or uses in meat, meat food product, or poultry product subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) or the Poultry Products Inspection (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.) for which the color additive has been found suitable and for which it may safely be employed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whenever the Commissioner finds that batch certification is not necessary for the protection of the public health he will, by order, exempt the color additive from the certification procedure. In determining whether certification of a color additive is necessary, the Commissioner will consider the composition of the additive, its

manufacturing process, possible impurities, its toxic potential, control and analytical procedures necessary to assure compliance with the listing specifications, and the variability of its composition.
