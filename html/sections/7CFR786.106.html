                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligible payable losses are calculated on a dairy operation by  dairy operation basis and are limited to those occurring during the  applicable disaster claim period, as provided by Sec. 786.104(g), that  corresponds with the applicable natural disaster declaration.  Specifically, dairy production losses incurred by producers under this  part are determined on the established history of the dairy operation's  average number of cows in the dairy herd and actual commercial  production marketed during the base period and applicable disaster claim  period that corresponds with the applicable natural disaster  declaration, as provided by the dairy operation consistent with Sec.  786.105. Except as otherwise provided in this part, the base annual  production, as defined in Sec. 786.102 and established in Sec.  786.104(g) is determined for each applicable disaster year based on the  average annual production per cow determined according to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The average of annual marketed production during the base period  calendar years of 2003 and 2004, divided by;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The average number of cows in the dairy operation's herd during  the base period calendar years of 2003 and 2004.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If relevant information to calculate the average annual  production per cow for one or both of the base period calendar years of  2003 and 2004, is not available, an alternative method of determining  the average annual production per cow may be established by the FSA  Administrator. For example, for new dairies not in operation during 2003  and 2004, information from three similar farms may be obtained by FSA to  estimate base annual production.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The average annual production per cow, as determined according  to   paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, is multiplied by the  average number of cows in the dairy operation's herd during the  applicable disaster year (excluding cow losses resulting from the  disaster occurrence), to determine base annual production for the dairy  operation for each applicable disaster claim period year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The eligible dairy production losses for a dairy operation for  each of the authorized disaster claim period years will be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The relevant period's base annual production for the dairy  operation calculated under paragraph (c) of this section less,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each such disaster claim period for each dairy operation the  actual commercially-marketed production relevant to that period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Spoiled or dumped milk, disposed of for reasons unrelated to the  disaster occurrence, must be counted as production for the relevant  disaster claim period. Actual production losses may be adjusted to the  extent the reduction in production is not certified by the producer to  be the result of the disaster identified in the natural disaster  declaration or is determined by FSA not to be related to the natural  disaster identified in the natural disaster declaration. FSA county  committees will determine production losses that are not caused by the  disaster associated with the natural disaster declaration. The  calculated production loss determined in Sec. 786.106(d) will be  adjusted to account for pounds of production losses determined by the  FSA county committee to not have been associated with the declared  natural disaster for an eligible disaster county. The FSA county  committee may convert cow numbers to actual pounds of production used in  the adjustment, by multiplying the average annual production per cow  determined from base period information, by the applicable number of  cows determined to be ineligible to generate claims for benefits. Other  appropriate adjustments will be made on such basis as the Deputy  Administrator finds to be consistent with the objectives of the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Actual production, as adjusted, that exceeds the base annual  production will mean that the dairy operation incurred no eligible  production losses for the corresponding claim period as a result of the  natural disaster.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Eligible production losses as otherwise determined under  paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section for each authorized year of  the program are added together to determine total eligible losses  incurred by the dairy operation under DDAP-III subject to all other  eligibility requirements as may be included in this part or elsewhere,  including the deduction for previous payments including those made under  a previous DDAP program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Payment on eligible dairy operation losses will be calculated  using whole pounds of milk. No double counting is permitted, and only  one payment will be made for each pound of milk calculated as an  eligible loss after the distribution of the dairy operation's eligible  production loss among the producers of the dairy operation according to  Sec. 786.107(b). Payments under this part will not be affected by any  payments for dumped or spoiled milk that the dairy operation may have  received from its milk handler, marketing cooperative, or any other  private party; however, produced milk that was dumped or spoiled for  reasons unrelated to the disaster occurrence will still count as  production.</p>
