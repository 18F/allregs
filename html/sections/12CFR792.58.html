The date of receipt of the request will be determined as of the date of receipt by the system manager.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Within 10 working days of receipt of the request, the appropriate system manager shall advise the individual that the request has been received. The appropriate system manager will promptly (under normal circumstances, not later than 30 working days after receipt of the request) advise

the individual that the record will be amended or corrected, or inform the individual of rejection of the request to amend the record, the reason for the rejection, and the procedures established by Sec. 792.59 for the individual to request a review of that rejection.
