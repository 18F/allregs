The employer shall assess the workplace to identify employees exposed to  hazards from flames or from electric arcs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Estimate of available heat energy. For each employee exposed to  hazards from electric arcs, the employer shall make a reasonable  estimate of the incident heat energy to which the employee would be  exposed.</p><p class="depth3">Note 1 to paragraph (g)(2): Appendix E to this subpart provides  guidance on estimating available heat energy. The Occupational Safety  and Health Administration will deem employers following the guidance in  appendix E to this subpart to be in compliance with paragraph (g)(2) of  this section. An employer may choose a method of calculating incident  heat energy not included in appendix E to this subpart if the chosen  method reasonably predicts the incident energy to which the employee  would be exposed.</p><p class="depth3">Note 2 to paragraph (g)(2): This paragraph does not require the  employer to estimate the incident heat energy exposure for every job  task performed by each employee. The employer may make broad estimates  that cover multiple system areas provided the employer uses reasonable  assumptions about the energy-exposure distribution throughout the system  and provided the estimates represent the maximum employee exposure for  those areas. For example, the employer could estimate the heat energy  just outside a substation feeding a radial distribution system and use  that estimate for all jobs performed on that radial system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Prohibited clothing. The employer shall ensure that each  employee who is exposed to hazards from flames or electric arcs does not  wear clothing that could melt onto his or her skin or that could ignite  and continue to burn when exposed to flames or the heat energy estimated  under paragraph (g)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (g)(3): 1This paragraph prohibits clothing made  from acetate, nylon, polyester, rayon and polypropylene, either alone or  in blends, unless the employer demonstrates that the fabric has been  treated to withstand the conditions that may be encountered by the  employee or that the employee wears the clothing in such a manner as to  eliminate the hazard involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Flame-resistant clothing. The employer shall ensure that the  outer layer of clothing worn by an employee, except for clothing not  required to be arc rated under paragraphs (g)(5)(i) through (g)(5)(v) of  this section, is flame resistant under any of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The employee is exposed to contact with energized circuit parts  operating at more than 600 volts,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An electric arc could ignite flammable material in the work  area that,   in turn, could ignite the employee's clothing,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Molten metal or electric arcs from faulted conductors in the  work area could ignite the employee's clothing, or</p><p class="depth4">Note to paragraph (g)(4)(iii): This paragraph does not apply to  conductors that are capable of carrying, without failure, the maximum  available fault current for the time the circuit protective devices take  to interrupt the fault.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The incident heat energy estimated under paragraph (g)(2) of  this section exceeds 2.0 cal/cm\2\.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Arc rating. The employer shall ensure that each employee exposed  to hazards from electric arcs wears protective clothing and other  protective equipment with an arc rating greater than or equal to the  heat energy estimated under paragraph (g)(2) of this section whenever  that estimate exceeds 2.0 cal/cm\2\. This protective equipment shall  cover the employee's entire body, except as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Arc-rated protection is not necessary for the employee's hands  when the employee is wearing rubber insulating gloves with protectors  or, if the estimated incident energy is no more than 14 cal/cm\2\,  heavy-duty leather work gloves with a weight of at least 407 gm/m\2\ (12  oz/yd\2\),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Arc-rated protection is not necessary for the employee's feet  when the employee is wearing heavy-duty work shoes or boots,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Arc-rated protection is not necessary for the employee's head  when the employee is wearing head protection meeting Sec.  1926.100(b)(2) if the estimated incident energy is less than 9 cal/cm\2\  for exposures involving single-phase arcs in open air or 5 cal/cm\2\ for  other exposures,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The protection for the employee's head may consist of head  protection meeting Sec. 1926.100(b)(2) and a faceshield with a minimum  arc rating of 8 cal/cm\2\ if the estimated incident-energy exposure is  less than 13 cal/cm\2\ for exposures involving single-phase arcs in open  air or 9 cal/cm\2\ for other exposures, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> For exposures involving single-phase arcs in open air, the arc  rating for the employee's head and face protection may be 4 cal/cm\2\  less than the estimated incident energy.</p><p class="depth4">Note to paragraph (g): See appendix E to this subpart for further  information on the selection of appropriate protection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Dates. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The obligation in paragraph (g)(2) of this section  for the employer to make reasonable estimates of incident energy  commences January 1, 2015.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The obligation in paragraph (g)(4)(iv) of this section for the  employer to ensure that the outer layer of clothing worn by an employee  is flame-resistant when the estimated incident heat energy exceeds 2.0  cal/cm\2\ commences April 1, 2015.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The obligation in paragraph (g)(5) of this section for the  employer to ensure that each employee exposed to hazards from electric  arcs wears the required arc-rated protective equipment commences April  1, 2015.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Fuse handling. When an employee must install or remove fuses  with one or both terminals energized at more than 300 volts, or with  exposed parts energized at more than 50 volts, the employer shall ensure  that the employee uses tools or gloves rated for the voltage. When an  employee installs or removes expulsion-type fuses with one or both  terminals energized at more than 300 volts, the employer shall ensure  that the employee wears eye protection meeting the requirements of  subpart E of this part, uses a tool rated for the voltage, and is clear  of the exhaust path of the fuse barrel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Covered (noninsulated) conductors. The requirements of this  section that pertain to the hazards of exposed live parts also apply  when an employee performs work in proximity to covered (noninsulated)  wires.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Non-current-carrying metal parts. Non-current-carrying metal  parts of equipment or devices, such as transformer cases and circuit- breaker housings, shall be treated as energized at the highest voltage  to which these parts are exposed, unless the employer inspects the  installation and determines that these parts are grounded before  employees begin performing the work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Opening and closing circuits under load. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employer shall  ensure that   devices used by employees to open circuits under load conditions are  designed to interrupt the current involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employer shall ensure that devices used by employees to  close circuits under load conditions are designed to safely carry the  current involved.
