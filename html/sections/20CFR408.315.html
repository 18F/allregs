                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When you must sign. If you are mentally competent, and  physically able to do so, you must sign your own application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When someone else may sign for you. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you are mentally  incompetent, or physically unable to sign, your application may be  signed by a court-appointed representative or a person who is  responsible for your care, including a relative. If you are in the care  of an institution, the manager or principal officer of the institution  may sign your application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If it is necessary to protect you from losing benefits and there  is good cause why you could not sign the application, we may accept an  application signed by someone other than you or a person described in  paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3">Example: Mr. Smith comes to a Social Security office a few days  before the end of a month to file an application for SVB for his  neighbor, Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones, a 68-year-old widower, just suffered a  heart attack and is in the hospital. He asked Mr. Smith to file the  application for him. We will accept an application signed by Mr. Smith  because it would not be possible to have Mr. Jones sign and file the  application until the next calendar month and a loss of one month's  benefits would result.</p>
