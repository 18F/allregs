Electric motors shall be segregated from  these spaces by a gastight bulkhead. Electric lighting of the explosion- proof type may be installed in these spaces provided all switching is  done from outside the space.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All cargo tanks, piping, valves, etc., shall be effectively  grounded to the vessel's hull. Tanks with an insulated inner shell  (primary barrier) shall have an effective grounding bond to the outer  shell (secondary barrier) or to the vessel's hull.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Electric submerged motor cargo pumps may be used, when in  compliance with the following requirements and subject to approval by  the Commandant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Design details of the submerged motor pump, with an evaluation  of the cooling efficiency of the product being pumped, shall be  submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provisions shall be made to exclude air from the tanks  containing cargo in either vapor or liquid phase. The pump motor shall  be deenergized when this condition is not satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A liquid level sensing device shall automatically shut down the  motor and sound an alarm at a predetermined low liquid level. The alarm  location may be the station from which cargo handling is controlled or  such other location outside the cargo area as is acceptable to the  Commandant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Details of the power cable, tank penetrations and pump  connections shall be submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An auxiliary means of emptying the cargo tanks shall be provided  in accordance with Sec. 38.10-10(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Means for positively disconnecting the power supply between the  switchboard and the pump power panel shall be provided, i.e., disconnect  links, lockable breakers, etc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> All materials used in the fabrication of the submerged motor  cargo pumps shall be suitable for use with the liquid cargo at the  design pressures and temperatures.</p>
