                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Under Secs. 501.52, 504.5 and 504.6 of these regulations, OFP may prohibit, in accordance with section 301 and section 303 (a) or (b) of FUA, as amended, the use of natural gas or petroleum, or both, as a primary energy source in any certifying powerplant. Under sections 301(c) and 303(a) of FUA, as amended, and Secs. 501.52, 504.6, and 504.8 of

these regulations, OFP may prohibit the excessive use of natural gas or petroleum in a mixture with an alternate fuel as a primary energy source in a certifying powerplant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> NEPA compliance. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, where the owner or operator of a powerplant seeks to obtain an OFP prohibition order through the certification procedure, and did not hold either a proposed prohibition order under former section 301 of FUA or pending order under section 2 of ESECA, it will be responsible for the costs of preparing any necessary Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) arising from OFP's obligation to comply with NEPA. The powerplant owner or operator shall enter into a contract with an independent party selected by OFP, who is qualified to conduct an environmental review and prepare an EA or EIS, as appropriate, and who does not have a financial or other interest in the outcome of the proceedings, under the supervision of OFP. The NEPA process must be completed and approved before OFP will issue a final prohibition order based on the certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Environmental review procedure. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, environmental documents, including the EA and EIS, where necessary, will be prepared utilizing the process set forth above. OFP, the powerplant owner or operator and the independent third party shall enter into an agreement for the owner or operator to engage and pay directly for the services of the qualified third party to prepare the necessary documents. The third party will execute an OFP prepared disclosure document stating that he does not have any conflict of interest, financial or otherwise, in the outcome of either the environmental process or the prohibition order proceeding. The agreement shall outline the responsibilities of each party and his relationship to the other two parties regarding the work to be done or supervised. OFP shall approve the information to be developed and supervise the gathering, analysis and presentation of the information. In addition, OFP will have the authority to approve and modify any statement, analysis, and conclusion contained in the third party prepared environmental documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Financial hardship. Whenever the bona fide estimate of the costs associated with NEPA compliance, if borne by the powerplant owner or operator, would make the conversion financially infeasible, OFP may waive the requirement set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and perform the necessary environmental review.

[46 FR 59920, Dec. 7, 1981]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix II to Part 504--Fuel Price Computation</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. This appendix provides the equations and parameters needed to specify the price of the delivered fuels to be used in the cost calculations associated with parts 503 and 504 of these regulations. The delivered price of the fuel to be used to calculate delivered fuel expenses must reflect (1) the price of each fuel at the time of the petition, and (2) the effects of future real price increases for each fuel. The delivered price of an alternate fuel used to calculate delivered fuel expenses must reflect the petitioner's delivered price of the alternate fuel and the effects of real increases in the price of that alternate fuel. Paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) below provide the procedure to: (1) Calculate fuel price and inflation indices; (2) account for projected real increases in fuel prices when planning to burn one or more than one fuel; and (3) account for projected real increases in the price of the alternate fuel. Table II-1 of this appendix (See paragraph (b)) contains example fuel price and inflation indices based on the latest data appearing in the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) Annual Energy Outlook (AEO).</p><p class="depth0">The fuel price and inflation indices will change yearly with the publication of the AEO. Revisions shall become effective after final publication. However, the relevant set of parameters for a specific petition for exemption will be the set in effect at the time the petition is submitted or the set in effect at the time a decision is rendered, whichever is more favorable to the petitioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Computation of Fuel Price and Inflation Indices. (1) the Petitioner is responsible for computing the annual fuel price and inflation indices by using Equation II-1 and Equation II-2, respectively. The petitioner may compute the fuel price index specified in Equation II-1 or use his own price index. However, if he uses his own price index, the source or the derivation of the index must be fully documented and be contained in the evidential summary.</p><p class="depth0">EQ II-2 is:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01OC91.007</p><p class="depth0">where:

If necessary, the petitioner must rebase the projection to the same year used for the fuel price projections. For example, in 1989 AEO projects the price deflator in 1982 dollars; this must be rebased to the year in which the petition is filed. The methodology used to rebase the inflation indices must follow standard statistical procedures and must be fully documented within the petition. This index will remain frozen at the last year of the AEO's projection for the remainder of the unit'(s) useful life.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Table II-1 is provided as an example of the application of equations II-1 and II-2.

where:
FPB i = Price of the proposed fuel (distillate oil, residual</p><p class="depth0">oil, or natural gas) in year i.MPB = The current delivered market price of the proposed fuel.PX i = The fuel price index value in year i, computed with</p><p class="depth0">Equation II-1.

The petitioner then must estimate the proportion of each fuel to be burned annually over the useful life of the unit(s). With these proportions and the respective annual fuel prices for each fuel, the petitioner must compute an annual weighted average fuel price. The methodology used to calculate the weighted average fuel price must follow standard statistical procedures and be fully documented within the petition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Fuel Price Computation--Alternate Fuel. The delivered price of alternate fuel (PFAi) must reflect the real escalation rate of alternate fuel and must be computed with Equation II-4.Equation II-4 is:
