                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The transfer, lease, or sale of National Register-eligible historic property to a non-Federal entity at installations subject to this part may constitute an ``adverse effect'' under the regulations implementing the National Historic Preservation Act (36 CFR 800.5(a)(2)(vii)). One way of resolving this adverse effect is to restrict the use that may be made of the property subsequent to its transfer out of Federal ownership or control through the imposition of legally enforceable restrictions or conditions. The Secretary concerned may include such restrictions or conditions (typically a real property interest in the form of a restrictive covenant or preservation easement) in any deed or lease conveying an interest in historic property to a non-Federal entity. Before doing so, the Secretary should first consider whether the historic character of the property can be protected effectively through planning and zoning actions undertaken by units of State or local government; if so, working with such units of State or local government to protect the property through these means is preferable to encumbering the property with such a covenant or easement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Before including such a covenant or easement in a deed or lease, the Secretary concerned shall consider--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the jurisdiction that encompasses the property authorizes such a covenant or easement; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the Secretary can give or assign to a third party the responsibility for monitoring and enforcing such a covenant or easement.</p>
