                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">When HUD conducts competitive sales of individual properties to individual buyers, it will sell the properties on an ``as-is'' basis, without repairs or warranties, and it will follow the sales procedures provided in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. (1) Properties that are sold on an individual competitive bid basis are sold through local real estate brokers, except as provided in Sec. 291.100(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For properties being offered with insured mortgages, priority will be given to owner-occupant purchasers, as defined in Sec. 291.5, for a period of up to 30 days, as determined by HUD. For properties offered without insured mortgages, priority will be given to governmental entities and nonprofit organizations prior to other owner-occupant purchasers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Net offer. (1) The net offer is calculated by subtracting from the bid price the dollar amounts for the financing and loan closing costs and the broker's sales commission, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If requested by the purchaser in the bid, HUD will pay all or a portion of the financing and loan closing costs and the broker's sales commission, not to exceed the percentage of the purchase price determined appropriate by the Secretary for the area. In no event will the total amount for broker's sales commission exceed 6 percent of the purchase price, except for cash bonuses offered to brokers by HUD for the sale of hard-to-sell properties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Acceptable bid. HUD will accept the bid producing the greatest net return to HUD and otherwise meeting the terms of HUD's offering of the property, with priority given to owner-occupant purchasers as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The greatest net return is calculated based on the net offer, as described in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Bid period. (1) HUD will establish a bid period for properties available for sale. Generally, the bid period will be 10 days, but may be lengthened or shortened by HUD. After properties are initially advertised, bids may be submitted by all potential purchasers. However, in the case of properties offered with insured mortgages, HUD may give priority to owner-occupant purchasers for a period of up to 30-days, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> HUD may treat all bids received during a specified period of time during the bid period to have been received simultaneously. HUD may also choose to review bids on a daily basis, with all bids submitted during each day considered to have been received simultaneously. HUD may use either (or both) of these methods during the bid period, as described in the bid materials accompanying a particular sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Offers received on a property before the bid period begins will be returned. Offers received after the bid period will not be considered at the bid opening, but will be considered during the extended listing period if no acceptable bid was received during the bid period (see paragraph (f) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Full price offers. HUD local offices that operate under a ``full price offer'' program open offers at specified times during the bid period. If an offer for the full list price and otherwise meeting the terms of the offering is received, it will be accepted at the time of the opening and the bid period cancelled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Extended listing period. Properties not sold during the bid period will remain available for an extended listing period. All bids received on each day of the extended listing period will be considered as being received simultaneously, and will be opened together at the next scheduled daily bid opening. Properties that fail to sell within 45 days after being offered for competitive bidding will be reanalyzed and made available for sale. If a property's price or terms are changed, it may be subject to another competitive bid period as described in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Bid requirements. (1) All successful bids submitted, whether during the bid period or the extended listing period, must be in a form prescribed by HUD, and must be submitted in accordance with procedures established by HUD. If the purchase is to be an insured sale, a local HUD office may also require that supporting exhibits for mortgage credit analysis accompany the initial submission of the bid. All bids not indicating that the purchaser will occupy the property will be considered as offers from investor purchasers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Noncomplying bids will be returned to the broker with an explanation for the noncompliance decision and information about whether the property is still available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Earnest money deposits. (1) The amount of earnest money deposit required for a property with a sales price of $50,000 or less is $500, except that for vacant lots the amount is 50 percent of the list price. For a property with a sales price greater than $50,000, the amount of earnest money deposit required in the area is set by the local HUD office, in an amount not less than $500 or more than $2,000. Information on the amount of the required earnest money deposit is available from the local HUD office or participating real estate brokers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All bids must be accompanied by earnest money deposits in the form of a cash equivalent as prescribed by the Secretary, or a certification from the real estate broker that the earnest money has been deposited in the broker's escrow account. If a bid is accepted by HUD, the earnest money deposit will be credited to the purchaser at closing; if the bid is rejected, the earnest money deposit will be returned. Earnest money deposits are subject to total or partial forfeiture for failure to close a sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Multiple bids. Real estate brokers may submit unlimited numbers of bids on an individual property provided each bid is from a different prospective purchaser. If a purchaser submits multiple bids on the same property, only the bid producing the highest net return to HUD will be considered. If a prospective owner-occupant purchaser submits a bid on more than one property, the bid that produces the greatest net return to HUD will be accepted and all other bids from that purchaser will

be eliminated from consideration. However, if the prospective owner-occupant purchaser has submitted the only acceptable bid on another property, then that bid must be accepted and all other bids from that purchaser on any other properties will be eliminated from consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Identical bids. In the case of identical bids submitted by an owner-occupant purchaser and an investor purchaser, HUD will select the bid submitted by the owner-occupant purchaser. If identical bids are submitted by two or more owner-occupant purchasers, or by two or more investor purchasers, award will be determined by drawing lots.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Opening the bids. Unless the Secretary specifically authorizes another bid process:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The successful bids will be opened publicly at a time and place designated by the local HUD office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Successful bidders will be notified through their real estate brokers by mail, telephone, or other means. Information regarding losing bids will also be made available either through electronic posting or by contacting the local HUD office. Acceptance of a bid is final and effective only upon HUD's execution of the sales contract, signed by both the submitting real estate broker and the prospective purchaser, and mailing of a copy of the executed contract to the successful bidder or the bidder's agent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Counteroffers. If all bids received on a property are unacceptable, a local HUD office may notify all bidders or their brokers that HUD will accept an offer equalling a predetermined net acceptable price. Bidders must submit an acceptable offer before the established bid cut-off period, to be determined by the local HUD office. The highest acceptable offer received within the specified period of time, including any offer received from a bidder who did not submit a bid during the bid period, will be accepted, thus terminating the counteroffer negotiations.</p>
