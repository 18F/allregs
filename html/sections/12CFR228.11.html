                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board) issues this part to implement the Community Reinvestment Act (12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.) (CRA). The regulations comprising this part are issued under the authority of the CRA and under the provisions of the United States Code authorizing the Board:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To conduct examinations of State-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System (12 U.S.C. 325);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To conduct examinations of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries (12 U.S.C. 1844) and savings and loan holding companies and their subsidiaries (12 U.S.C. 1467a); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To consider applications for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Domestic branches by State member banks (12 U.S.C. 321);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Mergers in which the resulting bank would be a State member bank (12 U.S.C. 1828(c));</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Formations of, acquisitions of banks by, and mergers of, bank holding companies (12 U.S.C. 1842);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The acquisition of savings associations by bank holding companies (12 U.S.C. 1843); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Formations of, acquisitions of savings associations by, conversions of, and mergers of, savings and loan holding companies (12 U.S.C. 1467a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purposes. In enacting the CRA, the Congress required each appropriate Federal financial supervisory agency to assess an institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which the institution is chartered, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution, and to take this record into account in the agency's evaluation of an application for a deposit facility by the institution. This part is intended to carry out the purposes of the CRA by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Establishing the framework and criteria by which the Board assesses a bank's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Providing that the Board takes that record into account in considering certain applications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scope--(1) General. This part applies to all banks except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. This part applies to all banks except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Foreign bank acquisitions. This part also applies to an uninsured State branch (other than a limited branch) of a foreign bank that results from an acquisition described in section 5(a)(8) of the International Banking Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3103(a)(8)). The terms ``State branch'' and ``foreign bank'' have the same meanings as in section 1(b) of the International Banking Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.); the term ``uninsured State branch'' means a State branch the deposits of which are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; the term ``limited branch'' means a State branch that accepts only deposits that are permissible for a corporation organized under section 25A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 611 et seq.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Certain special purpose banks. This part does not apply to special purpose banks that do not perform commercial or retail banking services by granting credit to the public in the ordinary course of business, other than as incident to their specialized operations. These banks include banker's banks, as defined in 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh), and banks that engage only in one or more of the following activities: providing cash management controlled disbursement services or serving as correspondent banks, trust companies, or clearing agents.
