If a designated beneficiary dies before the date on which the RLS becomes payable, his or her share of the RLS becomes payable to any other designated beneficiaries. If an entitled designated beneficiary dies before negotiating the RLS check, that share is payable to his or her estate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amount designated beneficiaries are paid. If the employee specified the share that each beneficiary is to receive, payment is made in the proportion specified. Otherwise, if there is more than one designated beneficiary, each is paid an equal share of the RLS.</p>
