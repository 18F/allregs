                            <p class="depth0">All gas, required to be measured, shall be measured by meter  (preferably of the orifice meter type) unless otherwise agreed to by the  Superintendent. All gas meters must be approved by the Superintendent  and installed at the expense of Lessee or purchaser at such places as  may be agreed to by the Superintendent. For computing the volume of all  gas produced, sold or subject to royalty, the standard of pressure shall  be 14.65 pounds to the square inch, and the standard of temperature  shall be 60 degrees F. All measurements of gas shall be adjusted by  computation to these standards, regardless of the pressure and  temperature at which the gas was acutally measured, unless otherwise  authorized in writing by the Superintendent.</p>
