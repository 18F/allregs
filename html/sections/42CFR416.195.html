whether an IOL qualifies for a payment adjustment as a member of a new class of new technology IOLs when inserted at an ASC:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The IOL is approved by the FDA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The IOL shall have a new lens characteristic in comparison to currently available IOLs. The labeling, which must be approved by FDA, shall contain a claim of a specific clinical benefit imparted by the new lens characteristic.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The IOL is not described by an active or expired class of new technology IOLs; that is, it does not share a predominant, class-defining characteristic associated with improved clinical outcomes with members of an active or expired class.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any specific clinical benefit referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must be supported by evidence that demonstrates that the IOL results in a measurable, clinically meaningful, improved outcome. Improved outcomes include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reduced risk of intraoperative or postoperative complication or trauma;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Accelerated postoperative recovery;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reduced induced astigmatism;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Improved postoperative visual acuity;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> More stable postoperative vision;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Other comparable clinical advantages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> CMS determination of eligibility for payment adjustment. CMS reviews the information submitted with a completed request for review, public comments submitted timely, and other pertinent information and makes a determination as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The IOL is eligible for a payment adjustment as a member of a new class of new technology IOLs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The IOL is a member of an active class of new technology IOLs and is eligible for a payment adjustment for the remainder of the period established for that class.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The IOL does not meet the criteria for designation as a new technology IOL and a payment adjustment is not appropriate.
