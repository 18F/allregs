                            <p class="depth0">Authority to impose and collect these charges is contained in title III, section 3001 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101-239), revising 47 U.S.C. 158, which directs the Commission to prescribe charges for certain of the regulatory services it provides to many of the communications entities within its jurisdiction. This law revises section 8 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, which contains a Schedule of Charges as well as procedures for modifying and collecting these charges.
