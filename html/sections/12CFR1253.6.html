FHFA may review and verify any information filed in connection with a Notice. If FHFA discovers a material misrepresentation or omission after the Director has rendered a decision on the filing, FHFA may nullify any approval or modify the terms, conditions, and limitations to such approval. For purposes of this paragraph, an Enterprise's authority to offer a new product or engage in a new activity by reason of the Director's not having made an explicit determination within the statutory time period constitutes an approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any person responsible for any material misrepresentation or omission in a submission or supporting materials may be subject to enforcement action and other penalties, including criminal penalties provided in 18 U.S.C. 1001.</p>
