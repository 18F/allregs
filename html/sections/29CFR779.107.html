                            <p class="depth0">The term goods is defined in section 3(i) of the Act and has a well established meaning under the Act since it has been contained in the statute from the date of its enactment in 1938. A comprehensive statement of the meaning of the term ``goods'' is contained in part 776 of this chapter, which also cites the court cases in which the term was construed. The statutory definition of ``goods'' is set forth in Sec. 779.14. It will be observed that the term ``goods'' includes any part or ingredient of the goods. Also that ``goods'' as defined in the Act are not limited to commercial goods, or articles of trade, or, indeed, to tangible property, but include ``articles or subjects of commerce of any character.'' Thus telegraphic messages have been held to be ``goods'' within the meaning of the Act (Western Union Tel. Co. v. Lenroot, 323 U.S. 490). Some of the ``articles or subjects of commerce'' which fall within the definition of ``goods'' include written materials such as newspapers, magazines, brochures, pamphlets, bulletins, and announcements; written reports, fiscal and other statements and accounts, correspondence, and other documents; advertising, motion pictures, newspaper and radio copy; art work and manuscripts for publication; sample books, letterheads, envelopes, shipping tags, labels, checkbooks, blankbooks, book covers, advertising circulars, and wrappers and other packaging materials.</p>
