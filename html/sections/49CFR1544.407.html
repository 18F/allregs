                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Training required. Before performing screening functions, an  individual must have completed initial, recurrent, and appropriate  specialized training as specified in this section and the aircraft  operator's security program. No aircraft operator may use any screener,  screener in charge, or checkpoint security supervisor unless that  individual has satisfactorily completed the required training. This  paragraph does not prohibit the performance of screening functions  during on-the-job training as provided in Sec.  1544.409 (b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use of training programs. Training for screeners must be  conducted under programs provided by TSA. Training programs for  screeners-in-charge and checkpoint security supervisors must be  conducted in accordance with the aircraft operator's security program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Citizenship. A screener must be a citizen or national of the  United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Screener readiness test. Before beginning on-the-job training, a  screener trainee must pass the screener readiness test prescribed by  TSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> On-the-job training and testing. Each screener must complete at  least 60 hours of on-the-job training and must pass an on-the-job  training test prescribed by TSA. No aircraft operator may permit a  screener trainee to exercise independent judgment as a screener, until  the individual passes an on-the-job training test prescribed by TSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Knowledge requirements. Each aircraft operator must ensure that  individuals performing as screeners, screeners-in-charge, and checkpoint  security supervisors for the aircraft operator have knowledge of the  provisions of this part, the aircraft operator's security program, and  applicable Security Directives and Information Circulars to the extent  necessary to perform their duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Disclosure of sensitive security information during training.  The aircraft operator may not permit a trainee to have access to  sensitive security information during screener training unless a  criminal history records check has successfully been completed for that  individual in accordance with Sec.  1544.229, and the individual has no  disqualifying criminal offense.
