                            <p class="depth0">The Chief of Engineers has no responsibility for inspecting or clearing excess Air Force land of explosives or chemical/biological contaminants. When a target or bombing range, or other land under the control of the Department of the Air Force, which might be contaminated with explosives or other harmful or dangerous substances, becomes excess to Defense requirements, the appropriate DE will obtain a certificate as to the extent of contamination and clearance thereof from the Commander, Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC), Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio 45433. The Corps of Engineers will continue to be the agency with which the disposal agencies, purchasers, and former lessors will communicate when explosives or objects resembling explosives, are discovered on the land after dispostion has been effected. The AFLC, upon request of the DE, will neutralize or remove such objects or substances and make a report to the requesting agency or person. See Sec. 644.535 for support required of the Corps.</p>
