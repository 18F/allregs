                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Handling prepayments for FHA-insured mortgages closed on or  after January 21, 2015. With respect to FHA-insured mortgages closed on  or after January 21, 2015, notwithstanding the terms of the mortgage,  the mortgagee shall accept a prepayment at any time and in any amount.  The mortgagee shall not require 30 days' advance notice of prepayment,  even if the mortgage instrument purports to require such notice. Monthly  interest on the debt must be calculated on the actual unpaid principal  balance of the loan as of the date the prepayment is received, and not  as of the next installment due date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Handling prepayments for FHA-insured mortgages closed before  January 21, 2015. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With respect to FHA mortgages insured before  August 2, 1985, if a prepayment is offered on other than an installment  due date, the mortgagee may refuse to accept the prepayment until the  first day of the month following expiration of the 30-day notice period  as provided in the mortgage, or may require payment of interest to that  date, but only if the mortgagee so advises the mortgagor, in a form  approved by the Commissioner, in response to the mortgagor's inquiry,  request for payoff figures, or tender of prepayment. If the installment  due date (the first day of the month) falls on a nonbusiness day, the  mortgagor's notice of intention to prepay or the   prepayment shall be timely if received on the next business day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With respect to FHA mortgages insured on or after August 2,  1985, but closed before January 21, 2015, the mortgagee shall not  require 30 days' advance notice of prepayment, even if the mortgage  instrument purports to require such notice. If the prepayment is offered  on other than an installment due date, the mortgagee may refuse to  accept the prepayment until the next installment due date (the first day  of the month), or may require payment of interest to that date, but only  if the mortgagee so advises the mortgagor, in a form approved by the  Commissioner, in response to the mortgagor's inquiry, request for payoff  figures, or tender of prepayment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the mortgagee fails to meet the full disclosure requirements  of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, the mortgagee may be  subject to forfeiture of that portion of the interest collected for the  period beyond the date that prepayment in full was received and to such  other actions as are provided in part 25 of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Mortgagee annual notice to mortgagors. Each mortgagee, with  respect to a mortgage under this part, shall provide to each of its  mortgagors not less frequently than annually a written notice, in a form  approved by the Commissioner, containing a statement of the amount  outstanding for prepayment of the principal amount of the mortgage. With  respect to FHA-insured mortgages closed before January 21, 2015, the  notice shall describe any requirements the mortgagor must fulfill to  prevent the accrual of any interest on the principal amount after the  date of any prepayment. This paragraph shall apply to any outstanding  mortgage insured on or after August 22, 1991.  [79 FR 50837, Aug. 26, 2014]</p><p class="depth2">Mortgagee Action and Forbearance</p>
