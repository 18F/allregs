The disclosure must state clearly the identity of the business, individual, or other entity that will be sending the messages;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the subscriber may be charged by his/her wireless service provider in connection with receipt of such messages; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That the subscriber may revoke his/her authorization to receive MSCMs at any time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> All notices containing the required disclosures must be clearly legible, use sufficiently large type or, if audio, be of sufficiently loud volume, and be placed so as to be readily apparent to a wireless subscriber. Any such disclosures must be presented separately from any other authorizations in the document or oral presentation. If any portion of the notice is translated into another language, then all portions of the notice must be translated into the same language.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All CMRS providers must identify all electronic mail domain names used to offer subscribers messaging specifically for wireless devices in connection with commercial mobile service in the manner and time-frame described in a public notice to be issued by the Consumer & Governmental Affairs Bureau.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each CMRS provider is responsible for the continuing accuracy and completeness of information furnished for the FCC's wireless domain names list.
