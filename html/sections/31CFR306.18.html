                            <p class="depth0">Coupon securities presented for exchange for registered securities  should have all matured interest coupons detached. All unmatured coupons  should be attached, except that if presented when the transfer books are  closed (in which case the exchange will be effected on or after the date  on which the books are reopened), the next maturing coupons should be  detached and held for collection in ordinary course when due. If any  coupons which should be attached are missing, the securities must be  accompanied by a remittance in an   amount equal to the face amount of the missing coupons. The new  registered securities will bear interest from the interest payment date  next preceding the date on which the exchange is made.</p>
