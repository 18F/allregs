                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To be valid for purposes of this section, a court order must be  found to be ``qualified'' by PER/ER/RET acting for the Secretary of  State. A qualifying court order must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be consistent with the terms of the Act and applicable  regulations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Not direct payment of an amount in excess of the maximum amount  authorized to be paid by the relevant regulation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Direct that payments be made to an eligible beneficiary from a  principal's Foreign Service retirement benefit or survivor benefit. If a  court directs or implies that a principal, rather than the Secretary of  State or the Government, make the payments, the order will not be  considered qualified unless the principal does not object during the 30- day notice period provided under Sec. 19.6-6;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Define the amount to be paid to a beneficiary in way so that it  can be readily calculated from information in the normal files of the  Department;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Not make payment contingent upon events other than those on  which other payments from the Fund are based such as age, marital status  and school attendance; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Not be in conflict with any previously issued court order which  remains valid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No apportionment of annuity to a beneficiary under Sec. 19.6- 1(a) (1) or (6) shall exceed the net annuity of the principal. The net  annuity is computed by excluding from the gross annuity the amounts  which are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Owed by the individual to the United States;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Deducted for health benefits premiums pursuant to section 8906  of Title 5, United States Code;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Deducted for life insurance premiums under the Government Life  Insurance Program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Owed due to overpayment of annuity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Properly withheld for Federal income tax purposes, if amounts  withheld are not greater than they would be if the individual claimed  all dependents to which he/she was entitled.
