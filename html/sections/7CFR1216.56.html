                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A producer who operates under an approved National Organic Program (NOP) (7 CFR part 205) system plan; produces only products that are eligible to be labeled as 100 percent organic under the NOP, except as provided for in paragraph (g) of this section; and is not a split operation shall be exempt from the payment of assessments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In order to apply for this exemption, an eligible peanut producer shall submit a request for exemption to the Board--on a form provided by the Board--at any time initially and annually thereafter on or before August 1 as long as the producer continues to be eligible for the exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The request shall include the following: The producer's name and address, a copy of the organic farm or organic handling operation certificate provided by a USDA-accredited certifying agent as defined in section 2103 of the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 6502), a signed certification that the applicant meets all of the requirements specified for an assessment exemption, and such other information as may be required by the Board and with the approval of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the producer complies with the requirements of this section, the Board will approve the exemption and issue a Certificate of Exemption to the producer. For exemption requests received on or before August 15, 2005, the Board will have 60 days to approve the exemption request; after August 15, 2005, the Board will have 30 days to approve the exemption request. If the application is disapproved, the Board will notify the applicant of the reason(s) for approval within the same timeframe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The producer shall provide a copy of the Certificate of Exemption to each handler to whom the producer sells peanuts. The handler shall maintain records showing the exempt producer's name and address and the exemption number assigned by the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The exemption will apply at the first reporting period following the issuance of the Certificate of Exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Agricultural commodities produced and marketed under an organic system plan, as described in 7 CFR 205.201, but not sold, labeled, or represented as organic, shall not disqualify a producer from exemption under this section, except that producers who produce both organic and non-organic agricultural commodities as a result of split operations shall not qualify for exemption. Reasons for conventional sales include lack of demand for organic products, isolated use of antibiotics for humane purposes, chemical or pesticide use as the result of State or emergency spray programs, and crops from a buffer area as described in 7 CFR part 205, provided all other criteria are met.
