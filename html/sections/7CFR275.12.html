                                Sec. 275.12  Review of active cases.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. A sample of households which were certified prior to,  or during, the sample month and issued food stamp benefits for the  sample month shall be selected for quality control review. These active  cases shall be reviewed to determine if the household is eligible and,  if eligible, whether the household is receiving the correct allotment.  The determination of a household's eligibility shall be based on an  examination and verification of all elements of eligibility (i.e., basic  program requirements, resources, income, and deductions). The elements  of eligibility are specified in Sec. Sec. 273.1 and 273.3 through 273.9  of this chapter. The verified circumstances and the resulting benefit  level determined by the quality control review shall be compared to the  benefits authorized by the State agency as of the review date. When  changes in household circumstances occur, the reviewer shall determine  whether the changes were reported by the participant and handled by the  agency in accordance with the rules set forth in Sec. Sec. 273.12,  273.13 and 273.21 of this chapter, as appropriate. For active cases, the  review date shall always fall within the sample month, either the first  day of a calendar or fiscal month or the day of certification, whichever  is later. The review of active cases shall include: a household case  record review; a field investigation, except as provided in paragraph  (b) of this section; the identification of any variances; an error  analysis; and the reporting of review findings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Household case record review. The reviewer shall examine the  household case record to identify the specific facts relating to the  household's eligibility and basis of issuance. If the reviewer is unable  to locate the household case record, the reviewer shall identify as many  of the pertinent facts as possible from the household issuance record.  The case record review shall include all information applicable to the  case as of the review month, including the application and worksheet in  effect as of the review date. Documentation contained in the case record  can be used as verification if it is not subject to change and applies  to the sample month. If during the case record review the reviewer can  determine and verify the household's ineligibility the review can be  terminated at that point, provided that if the determination is based on  information not obtained from the household then the correctness of that  information must be confirmed as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this  section. The reviewer shall utilize information obtained through the  case record review to complete column (2) of the Form FNS-380, and to  tentatively plan the content of the field investigation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(2)</em> of this section. In Alaska an exception to  this requirement can be made in those isolated areas not reachable by  regularly scheduled commercial air service, automobile, or other public  transportation provided one fully documented attempt to contact the  household has been made. Such cases may be completed through casefile  review and collateral contact. The field investigation will include  interviews with the head of household, spouse, or authorized  representative; contact with collateral sources of information; and any  other materials and activity pertinent to the review of the case. The  scope of the review shall not extend beyond the examination of household  circumstances which directly relate to the determination of household  eligibility and basis of issuance status. The reviewer shall utilize  information obtained through the field investigation to complete column  (3) of the Form FNS-380.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Personal interviews. Personal interviews shall be conducted in a  manner that respects the rights, privacy, and dignity of the  participants. Prior to conducting the personal interview, the reviewer  shall notify the household that it has been selected, as part of an  ongoing review process, for review by quality control, and that a  personal face-to-face interview will be conducted in the future. The  method of notifying the household and the specificity of the  notification shall be determined by the State agency, in accordance with  applicable State and Federal laws. The personal interview may take place  at the participant's home, at an appropriate State agency certification  office, or at a mutually agreed upon alternative location. The State  agency shall determine the best location for the interview to take  place, but would be subject to the same provisions as those regarding  certification interviews at Sec. 273.2(e)(2) of this chapter. Those  regulations provide that an office interview must be waived under  certain hardship conditions. Under such hardship conditions the quality  control reviewer shall either conduct the personal interview with the  participant's authorized representative, if one has been appointed by  the household, or with the participant in the participant's home. Except  in Alaska, when an exception to the field investigation is made in  accordance with this section, the interview with the participant may not  be conducted by phone. During the personal interview with the  participant, the reviewer shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Explore with the head of the household, spouse, authorized  representative, or any other responsible household member, household  circumstances as they affect each factor of eligibility and basis of  issuance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Establish the composition of the household;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Review the documentary evidence in the household's possession  and secure information about collateral sources of verification; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Elicit from the participant names of collateral contacts. The  reviewer shall use, but not be limited to, these designated collateral  contacts. If required by the State, the reviewer shall obtain consent  from the head of the household to secure collateral information. If the  participant refuses to sign the release of information form, the  reviewer shall explain fully the consequences of this refusal to  cooperate (as contained in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section), and  continue the review to the fullest extent possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Collateral contacts. The reviewer shall obtain verification from  collateral contacts in all instances when adequate documentation was not  available from the participant. This second party verification shall  cover each element of eligibility as it affects the household's  eligibility and allotment. The reviewer shall make every effort to use  the most reliable second party verification available (for example,  banks, payroll listings, etc.), in accordance with FNS guidelines, and  shall thoroughly document all verification obtained. If any information  obtained by the QC reviewer differs from that given by the participant,  then the reviewer shall resolve the differences to determine which  information is correct before an error determination is made. The manner  in which the conflicting information is resolved shall include  recontacting the participant unless the participant cannot be reached.  When resolving conflicting information reviewers shall use their best  judgement based on the most reliable data available and shall document  how the differences were resolved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Variance identification. The reviewer shall identify any element  of a basic program requirement or the basis of issuance which varies  (i.e., information from review findings which indicates that policy was  applied incorrectly and/or information verified as of the review date  that differs from that used at the most recent certification action).  For each element that varies, the reviewer shall determine whether the  variance was State agency or participant caused. The results of these  determinations shall be coded and recorded in column (4) of the Form  FNS-380.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Variances included in error analysis. Except for those variances  in an element resulting from one of the situations described in  paragraph (d)(2) of this section, any variance involving an element of  eligibility or basis of issuance shall be included in the error  analysis. Such variances shall include but not be limited to those  resulting from a State agency's failure to take the disqualification  action related to SSN's specified in Sec. 273.6(c) of this chapter, and  related to work requirements, specified in Sec. 273.7(f) of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Variances excluded from error analysis. The following variances  shall be excluded from the determination of a household's eligibility  and basis of issuance for the sample month:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any variance in cases certified under expedited certification  procedures resulting from postponed verification of an element of  eligibility as allowed under Sec. 273.2(i)(4)(i) of this chapter.  Verification of gross income, deductions, resources, household  composition, alien status, or tax dependency may be postponed for cases  eligible for expedited certification. However, if a case certified under  expedited   procedures contains a variance as a result of a residency deficiency, a  mistake in the basis of issuance computation, a mistake in participant  identification, or incorrect expedited income accounting, the variance  shall be included in the error determination. This exclusion shall only  apply to those cases which are selected for QC review in the first month  of participation under expedited certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any variance subsequent to certification in an element of  eligibility or basis of issuance which was not reported and was not  required to have been reported as of the review date. The elements  participants are required to report and the time requirements for  reporting are specified in Sec. Sec. 273.12(a) and 273.21(h) and (i) of  this chapter, as appropriate. If, however, a change in any element is  reported, and the State agency fails to act in accordance with  Sec. Sec. 273.12(c) and 273.21(j) of this chapter, as appropriate, any  resulting variance shall be included in the error determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any variance in deductible expenses which was not provided for  in determining a household's benefit level in accordance with  Sec. 273.2(f)(3)(i)(B) of this chapter. This provision allows households  to have their benefit level determined without providing for a claimed  expense when the expense is questionable and obtaining verification may  delay certification. If such a household subsequently provides the  needed verification for the claimed expense and the State agency does  not redetermine the household's benefits in accordance with  Sec. 273.12(c) of this chapter, any resulting variance shall be included  in the error determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Any variance resulting from use by the State agency of  information concerning households or individuals from an appropriate  Federal source, provided that such information is correctly processed by  the State agency. An appropriate Federal source is one which verifies:  Income that it provides directly to the household; deductible expenses  for which it directly bills the household; or other household  circumstances which it is responsible for defining or establishing. To  meet the provisions for correct processing, the eligibility worker must  have appropriately acted on timely information. In order to be timely,  information must be the most current that was available to the State  agency at the time of the eligibility worker's action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Two variances relating to the Immigration and Naturalization  Service's (INS) Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE)  Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A variance based on a verification of alien documentation by  INS. The reviewer shall exclude such variance only if the State agency  properly used SAVE and the State agency provides the reviewer with:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The alien's name;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The alien's status; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Either the Alien Status Verification Index (ASVI) Query  Verification Number or the INS Form G-845, as annotated by INS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A variance based on the State agency's wait for the response of  INS to the State agency's request for official verification of the  alien's documentation. The reviewer shall exclude such variance only if  the State agency properly used SAVE and the State agency provides the  reviewer with either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The date of request, if the State agency was waiting for an  automated response; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A copy of the completed Form G-845, if the State agency was  waiting for secondary verification from INS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)(F)</em> of this section, any variance  resulting from application of a new Program regulation or implementing  memorandum of a mandatory or optional change in Federal law that occurs  during the first 120 days from the required implementation date. The  variance exclusion shall apply to any action taken on a case directly  related to implementation of a covered provision during the 120-day  exclusionary period until the case is required to be recertified or  acted upon for some other reason.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> When a regulation allows a State agency an option to implement  prior to the required implementation date, the date on which the State  agency chooses to implement may, at the option of   the State, be considered to be the required implementation date for  purposes of this provision. The exclusion period would be adjusted to  begin with this date and end on the 120th day that follows. States  choosing to implement prior to the required implementation date must  notify the appropriate FNS Regional Office, in writing, prior to  implementation that they wish the 120 day variance exclusion to commence  with actual implementation. Absent such notification, the exclusionary  period will commence with the required implementation date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A State agency shall not exclude variances which occur prior to  the States implementation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A State agency which did not implement until after the exclusion  period shall not exclude variances under this provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Regardless of when the State agency actually implemented the  regulation, the variance exclusion period shall end on the 120th day  following the required implementation date, including the required  implementation date defined in paragraph (d)(2)(vii)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> For purposes of this provision, implementation occurs on the  effective date of State agency's written statewide notification to its  eligibility workers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> This variance exclusion applies to changes occasioned by final  regulations or interim regulations. In the case of a final regulation  issued following an interim regulation, the exclusion applies only to  significant changes made to the earlier interim regulation. A  significant change is one which the final regulation requires the State  agency to implement on or after publication of a final rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Any variance resulting from incorrect written policy that a  State agency acts on that is provided by a Departmental employee  authorized to issue Food Stamp Program policy and that the State agency  correctly applies. For purposes of this provision, written Federal  policy is that which is issued in regulations, notices, handbooks,  category three and four Policy Memoranda under the Policy Interpretation  Response System, and regional policy memoranda issued pursuant to these.  Written Federal policy is also a letter from the Food and Nutrition  Service to a State agency which contains comments on the State agency's  food stamp manual or instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Any variance in a child support deduction which was the result  of an unreported change subsequent to the most recent certification  action shall be excluded from the error determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other findings. Findings other than variances made during the  review which are pertinent to the food stamp household or the case  record may be acted on at the discretion of the State agency. Examples  of such findings are: an incorrect age of a household member which is  unrelated to an element of eligibility; an overdue subsequent  certification; no current application on file; insufficient  documentation; incorrect application of the verification requirements  specified in part 273 of this chapter; and deficiencies in work  registration procedural requirements. Such deficiencies include:  inadequate documentation of each household member's exempt status; work  registration form for each nonexempt household member not completed at  the time of application and every six months thereafter; and the  household not advised of its responsibility to report any changes in the  exempt status of any household member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Error analysis. The reviewer shall analyze all appropriate  variances in completed cases, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this  section, which are based upon verified information and determine whether  such cases are either eligible, eligible with a basis of issuance error,  or ineligible. The review of an active case determined ineligible shall  be considered completed at the point of the ineligibility determination.  For households determined eligible, the review shall be completed to the  point where the correctness of the basis of issuance is determined,  except in the situations outlined in paragraph (g) of this section. In  the event that a review is conducted of a household which is receiving  restored or retroactive benefits for the sample month, the portion of  the allotment which is the restored or retroactive benefit   shall be excluded from the determination of the household's eligibility  and/or basis of issuance. A food stamp case in which a household  member(s) receives public assistance shall be reviewed in the same  manner as all other food stamp cases, using income as received. The  determination of a household's eligibility and the correctness of the  basis of issuance shall be determined based on data entered on the  computation sheet as well as other information documented on other  portions of the Form FNS-380, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Reporting of review findings. All information verified to be  incorrect during the review of an active case shall be reported to the  State agency for appropriate action on an individual case basis. This  includes information on all variances in elements of eligibility and  basis of issuance in both error and nonerror cases. In addition, the  reviewer shall report the review findings on the Form FNS-380-1, in  accordance with the following procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Eligibility errors. If the reviewer determines that a case is  ineligible, the occurrence and the total allotment issued in the sample  month shall be coded and reported. Whenever a case contains a variance  in an element which results in an ineligibility determination and there  are also variances in elements which would cause a basis of issuance  error, the case shall be treated as an eligibility error. The reviewer  shall also code and report any variances that directly contributed to  the error determination. In addition, if the State agency has chosen to  report information on all variances in elements of eligibility and basis  of issuance, the reviewer shall code and report any other such variances  which were discovered and verified during the course of the review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Basis of issuance of errors. If the reviewer determines that  SNAP allotments were either overissued or underissued to eligible  households in the sample month, the State agency shall code and report  any variances that directly contributed to the error determination that  were discovered and verified during the course of the review. Only  variances that exceed $50.00 (the threshold) shall be included in the  calculation of the underissuance error rate, overissuance error rate,  and payment error. If the State agency has chosen to report information  on all variances in elements of eligibility and basis of issuance, the  reviewer shall code and report any other such variances that were  discovered and verified during the course of the review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Disposition of case reviews. Each case selected in the sample of  active cases must be accounted for by classifying it as completed, not  completed, or not subject to review. These case dispositions shall be  coded and recorded on the Form FNS-380-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Cases reported as not complete. Active cases shall be reported  as not completed if the household case record cannot be located and the  household itself is not subsequently located; if the household case  record is located but the household cannot be located unless the  reviewer attempts to locate the household as specified in this  paragraph; or if the household refuses to cooperate, as discussed in  this paragraph. All cases reported as not complete shall be reported to  the State agency for appropriate action on an individual case basis.  Without FNS approval, no active case shall be reported as not completed  solely because the State agency was unable to process the case review in  time for it to be reported in accordance with the timeframes specified  in Sec. 275.21(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the reviewer is unable to locate the participant either at  the address indicated in the case record or in the issuance record and  the State agency is not otherwise aware of the participant's current  address, the reviewer shall attempt to locate the household by  contacting at least two sources which the State agency determines are  most likely to be able to inform the reviewer of the household's current  address. Such sources include but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The local office of the U.S. Postal Service;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The State Motor Vehicle Department;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The owner or property manager of the residence at the address in  the case record; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Any other appropriate sources based on information contained in  the case record, such as public utility companies, telephone company,  employers, or relatives. Once the reviewer has attempted to locate the  household and has documented the response of each source contacted, if  the household still cannot be located and the State agency has  documented evidence that the household did actually exist, the State  agency shall report the active case as not subject to review. In these  situations documented evidence shall be considered adequate if it either  documents two different elements of eligibility or basis of issuance,  such as a copy of a birth certificate for age and pay status for income;  or documents the statement of a collateral contact indicating that the  household did exist. FNS Regional Offices will monitor the results of  the contacts which State agencies make in attempting to locate  households.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a household refuses to cooperate with the quality control  reviewer and the State agency has taken other administrative steps to  obtain that cooperation without obtaining it, the household shall be  notified of the penalities for refusing to cooperate with respect to  termination and reapplication, and of the possibility that its case will  be referred for investigation for willful misrepresentation. If a  household refuses to cooperate after such notice, the reviewer must-  attempt to complete the case and shall report the household's refusal to  the State agency for termination of its participation without regard for  the outcome of that attempt. For a determination of refusal to be made,  the household must be able to cooperate, but clearly demonstrate that it  will not take actions that it can take and that are required to complete  the quality control review process. In certain circumstances, the  household may demonstrate that it is unwilling to cooperate by not  taking actions after having been given every reasonable opportunity to  do so, even though the household or its members do not state that the  household refuses to cooperate. Instances where the household's  unwillingness to cooperate in completing a quality control review has  the effect of a refusal to cooperate shall include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The household does not respond to a letter from the reviewer  sent Certified Mail-Return Receipt Requested within 30 days of the date  of receipt;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The household does not attend an agreed upon interview with the  reviewer and then does not contact the reviewer within 10 days of the  date of the scheduled interview to reschedule the interview; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The household does not return a signed release of information  statement to the reviewer within 10 days of either agreeing to do so or  receiving a request from the reviewer sent Certified Mail-Return Receipt  Requested. However, in these and other situations, if there is any  question as to whether the household has merely failed to cooperate, as  opposed to refused to cooperate, the household shall not be reported to  the State agency for termination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cases not subject to review. Active cases which are not subject  to review, if they have not been eliminated in the sampling process,  shall be eliminated in the review process. In addition to cases listed  in Sec. 275.11(f)(1), these shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Death of all members of a household if they died before the  review could be undertaken or completed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The household moved out of State before the review could be  undertaken or completed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The household, at the time of the review, is under active  investigation for intentional Food Stamp Program violation, including a  household with a pending administrative disqualification hearing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A household receiving restored benefits in accordance with  Sec. 273.17 of this chapter but not participating based upon an approved  application for the sample month;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A household dropped as a result of correction for oversampling;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A household participating under disaster certification  authorized by FNS for a natural disaster;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> A case incorrectly listed in the active frame;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> A household appealing an adverse action when the review date  falls   within the time period covered by continued participation pending the  hearing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> A household that did not receive benefits for the sample month;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> A household that still cannot be located after the reviewer has  attempted to locate it in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Demonstration projects/SSA processing. Households correctly  classified for participation under the rules of a demonstration project  which establishes new FNS-authorized eligibility criteria or modifies  the rules for determining households' eligibility or allotment level  shall be reviewed following standard procedures provided that FNS does  not modify these procedures to reflect modifications in the treatment of  elements of eligibility or basis of issuance in the case of a  demonstration project. If FNS determines that information obtained from  these cases would not be useful, then they may be excluded from review.  A household whose most recent application for participation was  processed by Social Security Administration personnel shall be reviewed  following standard procedures. This includes applications for  recertification, provided such an application is processed by the SSA as  allowed in Sec. 273.2(k)(2)(ii) of this chapter.
