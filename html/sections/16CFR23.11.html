Its hardness is 10; its specific gravity is approximately 3.52; and it  has a refractive index of 2.42.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is unfair or deceptive to use the unqualified word  ``diamond'' to describe or identify any object or product not meeting  the requirements specified in the definition of diamond provided above,  or which, though meeting such requirements, has not been symmetrically  fashioned with at least seventeen (17) polished facets.</p><p class="depth2">Note 1 to paragraph (b): It is unfair or deceptive to represent,  directly or by implication, that industrial grade diamonds or other non- jewelry quality diamonds are of jewelry quality.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following are examples of descriptions that are not  considered unfair or deceptive:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The use of the words ``rough diamond'' to describe or designate  uncut or unfaceted objects or products satisfying the definition of  diamond provided above; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The use of the word ``diamond'' to describe or designate objects  or products satisfying the definition of diamond but which have not been  symmetrically fashioned with at least seventeen (17) polished facets  when in immediate conjunction with the word ``diamond'' there is either  a disclosure of the number of facets and shape of the diamond or the  name of a type of diamond that denotes shape and that usually has less  than seventeen (17) facets (e.g., ``rose diamond'').</p><p class="depth3">Note 2 to paragraph (c): Additional guidance about imitation and  laboratory-created diamond representations and misuse of words ``gem,''  ``real,'' ``genuine,'' ``natural,'' etc., are set forth in Sec.
