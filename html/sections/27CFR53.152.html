                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Any person who is required to make a return on TTB  Form 5300.26 pursuant to Sec. 53.151 and who in any return period  ceases operations in respect of which the person is required to make a  return on the form, shall make the return for that return period as a  final return. A return made as a final return shall be marked ``Final  Return'' by the person filing the return. A taxpayer who has only  temporarily ceased to incur liability for tax required to be reported on  TTB Form 5300.26 because of temporary or seasonal suspension of business  or for other reasons, shall not make a final return until such  operations are permanently ceased.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Statement to accompany final return. Each final return shall  have attached a statement showing the address at which the records  required by the regulations in this part will be kept, the name of the  person keeping the records, and, if the business of the taxpayer has  been sold or otherwise transferred to another person, the name and  address of that person and the date on which the sale or transfer took  place. If no sale or transfer occurred or if the taxpayer does not know  the name of the person to whom the business was sold or transferred,  that fact should be included in the statement.  [T.D.
