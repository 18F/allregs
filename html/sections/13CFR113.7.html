                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. (1) If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by suspending, terminating, or refusing any financial assistance approved but not yet disbursed to an applicant. In the case of loans partially or fully disbursed, compliance with this part may be effected by calling, canceling, terminating, accelerating repayment, or suspending in whole or in part the financial assistance provided. In addition compliance may be effected by any other means authorized by law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by suspending, terminating, or refusing any financial assistance approved but not yet disbursed to an applicant. In the case of loans partially or fully disbursed, compliance with this part may be effected by calling, canceling, terminating, accelerating repayment, or suspending in whole or in part the financial assistance provided. In addition compliance may be effected by any other means authorized by law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such other means may include but are not limited to (i) legal action by SBA to enforce its rights, embodied in the assurances described in Sec. 113.4; (ii) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States; and (iii) any applicable proceedings under State or local law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Noncompliance with Sec. 113.4. If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under Sec. 113.4 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. SBA shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph except that SBA shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the effective date of this part. Such proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of part 134 of this chapter by an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, who shall issue an initial decision in the case. The Admininstrator shall be the reviewing official for purposes of Sec. 134.228. The applicant's failure to file a timely motion in accordance with Secs. 134.222 and 134.211, requesting that the matter be scheduled for an oral hearing, shall constitute waiver of the right to an oral hearing but shall not prevent the submission of written information and argument for the record in accordance with the provisions of part 134.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Condition precedent. Under this part 113, no order suspending, terminating, refusing, calling, canceling, or accelerating repayment of financial assistance in whole or in part shall become effective until (1) SBA has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means; (2) there has been an express finding on the record after an opportunity for an oral hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to

comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part; and (3) the initial decision has become final pursuant to Sec. 134.227(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> SBA has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The action has been approved by the Administrator or the Administrator's designee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The applicant or recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the applicant or recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days, additional efforts shall be made to persuade the applicant or recipient or other person to comply with this part and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.
