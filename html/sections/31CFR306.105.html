If prior to the time a registered security  bearing an apparently valid assignment has been functioned, a claim is  received from the owner or his authorized representative showing that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The security was lost, stolen, or destroyed and that it was  unassigned, or not so assigned as to have become in effect payable to  bearer, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The assignment was affected by fraud, the transaction for which  the security was received will be suspended.  The interested parties will be given a reasonable period of time in  which to effect settlement of their interests by agreement, or to  institute judicial proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Late notice. If, after a registered security has been  transferred, exchanged, or redeemed in reliance on an apparently valid  assignment, an owner notifies the Bureau that the assignment was  affected by fraud or that the security had been lost or stolen, the  Department will undertake only to furnish available information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Forged assignments. A claim that an assignment of a registered  security is a forgery will be investigated. If it is established that  the assignment was in fact forged and that the owner did not authorize  or ratify it, or receive any benefit therefrom, the Department will  recognize his ownership and grant appropriate relief.</p>
