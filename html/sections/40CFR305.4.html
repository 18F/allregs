                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Review Officer. The Review Officer is authorized to receive  Requests for a Hearing; attempt to promote settlement; make the decision  of the Agency on the claim if the claimant does not request referral of  the Request for a Hearing to the Chief Administrative Law Judge; and  refer a Request for a Hearing to the Chief Administrative Law Judge when  necessary. The Review Officer shall make the decision of the Agency on  the claim in writing and shall serve the Requestor and the Claims  Official with a copy of his decision. The Review Officer may, sua  sponte, without ruling on the merits of the Request for a Hearing, refer  it to the Chief Adminstrative Law Judge for decision. If the Requestor  is not satisfied with the decision of the Review Officer, he may, within  10 days of service of such decision, request that the Review Officer  refer the Request for a Hearing to the Chief Administrative Law Judge.  The Requestor shall also serve such notice on the Claims Official.  Otherwise the decision of the Review Officer is a final order. When  referring a matter to the Chief Administrative Law Judge, the Review  Officer shall include the Request for a Hearing, a copy of his decision,  and any other pertinent documents. The Review Officer also shall notify  the Requestor, the Hearing Clerk, and the Claims Official when he refers  a Request for a Hearing to the Chief Administrative Law Judge. The  Hearing Clerk, shall, upon receipt of the relevant documents, establish  a file for the hearing. Thereafter, a copy of all pleadings must be  filed with the Hearing Clerk. This requirement is in addition to the  applicable service of documentation requirements contained in Sec.  305.5(b)(2). The Review Officer shall exercise all other powers and  duties prescribed or delegated to him under the Act or this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Presiding Officer. Upon receipt from the Review Officer of the  Request for a Hearing, the Chief Administrative Law Judge shall  designate himself or another Administrative Law Judge as Presiding  Officer and shall transmit all documents related to the Request for a  Hearing to the Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer shall then  notify the parties of his assignment pursuant to Sec. 305.4(c). The  Presiding Officer shall conduct a fair and impartial proceeding, assure  that the facts are fully elicited, adjudicate all issues, and avoid  delay. The Presiding Officer shall have authority to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conduct administrative hearings under this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rule upon motions, requests, and offers of proof, dispose of  procedural requests, and issue all necessary orders;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Administer oaths and affirmations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Examine witnesses and receive documentary or other evidence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Order a party, or an officer or agent thereof, for good cause,  upon motion, or sua sponte, to produce testimony, documents, or other  nonprivileged evidence, and failing the production thereof without good  cause being shown, draw adverse inferences against that party;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Admit or exclude evidence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Hear and decide questions of law and fact;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Require parties to attend conferences for the settlement or  simplification of the issues, or the expedition of the proceedings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Extend the time limit for a final order in the hearing for a  period not to exceed 60 days;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Render findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a final order;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Assess costs of the proceeding pursuant to Sec. 305.36(b);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Do all other acts and take all measures necessary for the  maintenance of order and for the efficient and impartial adjudication of  issues arising in proceedings governed by this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Resolve all disputes based on the evidence and applicable law;  see Sec. 305.31 concerning evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Presiding Officer shall notify the parties that the Request  for a Hearing has been assigned to him, and that he has received the  case file from the Chief Administrative Law Judge. After ruling on any  objections to jurisdiction, or final disposition of any objections to  disqualification, the Presiding Officer shall render a final order  within 90 days after he affirmatively accepts such jurisdiction. The  Presiding Officer shall render a final order within the allotted time,  unless all parties agree in writing to an extension, or unless, in his  discretion, either upon motion of a party or sua sponte, he allows an  extension of time not to exceed 60 days. If all parties agree in writing  to an extension of the time period within which the Presiding Officer  must issue a final order, the extension shall be for the period agreed  to in writing by all parties. There are no limits to such periods other  than that to which the parties have agreed in writing. An agreement by  the parties to extend the time limit does not preclude the Presiding  Officer from extending the time limit to issue a final order sua sponte  or upon motion of a party, nor does an extension by the Presiding  Officer preclude the parties from agreeing to an extension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disqualification; withdrawal. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Neither the Review Officer nor  the Presiding Officer may perform functions provided for in this part  regarding any matter in which he: has a financial interest; or has any  relationship with a party or with the subject matter that would make it  inappropriate for him to act. A party shall, by motion presented within  5 days after receiving notice of the assignment of the Presiding  Officer, make any objection to his assignment. Otherwise, any objections  to the qualifications of the Presiding Officer are waived, unless such  objections arise after the time for presenting objections allowed by  this paragraph. In such case, any objection must be made within 5 days  of the time within which it arose. Either party may appeal the Presiding  Officer's ruling on a motion to disqualify him to the Chief  Administrative Law Judge. The Chief Administrative Law Judge shall rule  on such motion in a timely fashion. When the Chief Administrative Law  Judge is the Presiding Officer, he shall refer any challenge to his  qualification to hear the case to another Administrative Law Judge for  decision. The Review Officer or the Presiding Officer may at any time  withdraw from any proceeding in which he deems himself disqualified or  unable to act for any reason.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Review Officer or the Presiding Officer is disqualified  or withdraws from the proceeding, a qualified individual who has none of  the infirmities listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be  assigned to replace him. The Administrator shall appoint a new Review  Officer. The Chief Administrative Law Judge shall assign a new Presiding  Officer from among the available Administrative Law Judges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Chief Administrative Law Judge shall have the power to rule  on motions for disqualification as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this  section and may, at any stage in the hearing, reassign the case to an  Administrative Law Judge other than the one originally assigned in the  event of the unavailability of the Administrative Law Judge or where  reassignment will result in efficiency in the scheduling of hearings and  will not prejudice the parties.</p>
