                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Any investigation of an accident conducted by the Safety Board shall  have priority over all other investigations of such accident conducted  by other Federal agencies. The Safety Board shall provide for the  appropriate participation by other Federal agencies in any such  investigation, except that such agencies may not participate in the  Safety Board's determination of the probable cause of the accident.  Nothing in this section impairs the authority of other Federal agencies  to conduct investigations of an accident under applicable provisions of  law or to obtain information directly from parties involved in, and  witnesses to, the transportation accident. The Safety Board and other  Federal agencies shall assure that appropriate information obtained or  developed in the course of their investigations is exchanged in a timely  manner.
