                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Auditor procurement. In procuring audit services, the auditee must follow the procurement standards prescribed by the Procurement Standards in Sec. Sec.  200.317 Procurement by states through 20.326 Contract provisions of Subpart D- Post Federal Award Requirements of this part or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable. When procuring audit services, the objective is to obtain high-quality audits. In requesting proposals for audit services, the objectives and scope of the audit must be made clear and the non-Federal entity must request a copy of the audit organization's peer review report which the auditor is required to provide under GAGAS. Factors to be considered in evaluating each proposal for audit services include the responsiveness to the request for proposal, relevant experience, availability of staff with professional qualifications and technical abilities, the results of peer and external quality control reviews, and price. Whenever possible, the auditee must make positive efforts to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, in procuring audit services as stated in Sec.  200.321 Contracting with small and minority businesses, women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms, or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Restriction on auditor preparing indirect cost proposals. An auditor who prepares the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan may not also be selected to perform the audit required by this part when the indirect costs recovered by the auditee during the prior year exceeded $1 million. This restriction applies to the base year used in the preparation of the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan and any subsequent years in which the resulting indirect cost agreement or cost allocation plan is used to recover costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use of Federal auditors. Federal auditors may perform all or part of the work required under this part if they comply fully with the requirements of this part.</p>
