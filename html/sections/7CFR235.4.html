                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Nondiscretionary SAE Funds. For each fiscal year, FNS shall  allocate the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  percent of the funds expended by such State during the second preceding  fiscal year under sections 4 and 11 of the National School Lunch Act, as  amended, and sections 3, 4 and 17A of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966,  as amended. However, the total amount allocated to any State under this  paragraph shall not be less than $200,000 or the amount allocated to the  State in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1981, whichever is  greater. On October 1, 2008 and each October 1 thereafter, the minimum  dollar amount for a fiscal year for administrative costs shall be  adjusted to reflect the percentage change between the value of the index  for State and local government purchases, as published by the Bureau of  Economic Analysis of the Department of Commerce, for the 12-month period  ending June 30 of the second preceding fiscal year, and the value of  that index for the 12-month period ending June 30 of the preceding  fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To each State which administers the Child and Adult Care Food  Program an amount equal to the sum of: Twenty percent of the first  $50,000; ten percent of the next $100,000; five percent of the next  $250,000; and two and one-half percent of any remaining funds expended  within the State under section 17 of the National School Lunch Act, as  amended, during the second preceding fiscal year. FNS may adjust the  amount of any such allocation in accordance with changes in the size of  the Child and Adult Care Food Program in a State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each of fiscal years 2005 through 2007 no State shall  receive less than its fiscal year 2004 allocation for administrative  costs for all child nutrition programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Discretionary SAE Funds. For each fiscal year, FNS shall provide  the following additional allocations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Allocate $30,000 to each State which administers the Child and  Adult Care Food Program (7 CFR part 226).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> $30,000 to each State which administers the Food Distribution  Program (part 250 of this chapter) in schools and/or institutions which  participate in programs under parts 210, 220, 226 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amounts derived by application of the following four-part  formula to each State agency which is allocated funds under paragraph  (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> One equal share of forty (40) percent of the funds designated by  FNS for the reviews conducted under Sec. 210.18 of this title.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The ratio of the number of School Food Authorities  participating in the National School Lunch or Commodity School Programs  under the jurisdiction of the State agency to such School Food  Authorities in all States times twenty (20) percent of the funds  designated by FNS for reviews conducted under Sec. 210.18 or of this  title.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The ratio of the number of free and reduced price meals served  in School Food Authorities under the jurisdiction of the State agency  during the second preceding fiscal year to the number of free and  reduced price meals served in all States in the second preceding fiscal  year times twenty (20) percent of the funds designated by FNS for  reviews conducted under Sec. 210.18 of this title.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Equal shares of twenty (20) percent of the funds designated by  FNS for reviews conducted under Sec. 210.18 of this title for each  School Food Authority under the jurisdiction of the State agency  participating in the National School Lunch or Commodity School Programs  which has an enrollment of 40,000 or more; Provided, however, That for  State agencies with fewer than two School Food Authorities with  enrollments of 40,000 or more, an equal share shall be provided to the  State agency, for either, or both, of the two largest School Food  Authorities which have enrollments of more than 2,000; and Provided,  further, That State agencies with only one School Food Authority,  regardless of size, shall be provided with one equal share. For each  fiscal year, the amount of State Administrative Expense Funds designated  by FNS for reviews conducted under Sec. 210.18 of this title and subject  to allocation under this paragraph shall be equal to or greater than the  amount designated by FNS for program management improvements for the  fiscal year ending September 30, 1980.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Funds which remain after the allocations required in paragraphs  (a)(1), (a)(2), (b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, and after any  payments provided for under paragraph (c) of this section, as determined  by the Secretary, to those States which administer the Food Distribution  Program (part 250 of this chapter) in schools and/or institutions which  participate in programs under parts 210, 220, or 226 of this chapter and  to those States which administer part 226 of this chapter. The amount of  funds to be allocated to each State for the Food Distribution Program  for any fiscal year shall bear the same ratio to the total amount of  funds made available for allocation to the State for the Food  Distribution Program under this paragraph as the value of USDA donated  foods delivered to the State for schools and institutions participating  in programs under parts 210, 220 and 226 of this chapter during the  second preceding fiscal year bears to the value of USDA donated foods  delivered to all the States for such schools and institutions during the  second preceding fiscal year. The amount of funds to be allocated to  each State which administers the Child and Adult Care Food Program for  any fiscal year shall bear the same ratio to the total amount of funds  made available for allocation to all such States under this paragraph as  the amount of funds allocated to each State under paragraph (a)(2) of  this section bears to the amount allocated to all States under that  paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> SAE Funds for the Child and Adult Care Food Program. If a State  elects to have a separate State agency administer the adult care  component of the Child and Adult Care Food Program, such separate State  agency shall receive a pro rata share of the SAE funds allocated to the  State under paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(1), and (b)(4) of this section which  is equal to the ratio of funds expended by the State for the adult care  component of the Child and Adult Care Food Program during the second  preceding fiscal year to the funds expended by the State for the entire  Child and Adult Care Food Program during the second preceding fiscal  year. The remaining funds shall be allocated to the State agency  administering the child care component of the Child and Adult Care Food  Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> SAE Start-up Cost Assistance for State Administration of Former  ROAPs. For any State agency which agrees to   assume responsibility for the administration of food service programs in  nonprofit private schools or child and adult care institutions that were  previously administered by FNS, an appropriate adjustment in the  administrative funds paid under this part to the State shall be made by  FNS not later than the succeeding fiscal year. Such an adjustment shall  consist of an amount of start-up cost assistance, negotiated with the  State agency, of no less than $10,000 and not exceeding $100,000, per  State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> SAE Funding Reduction Upon State Agency Termination of a Food  Service Program. For any State agency which terminates its  administration of any food service program for which State  administrative expense funds are provided under this part, a reduction  in the amount of such funds, negotiated with the State agency, shall be  made by FNS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> SAE Funds for ROAPs. FNS shall have available to it the  applicable amounts provided for in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(1)  of this section, and part 225 of this title, when it is responsible for  the administration of a program or programs within a State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reallocation. Funds allotted to State agencies under this  section shall be subject to the reallocation provisions of  Sec. 235.5(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Withholding SAE funds. The Secretary may withhold some or all of  the funds allocated to the State agency under this section if the  Secretary determines that the State agency is seriously deficient in the  administration of any program for which State administrative expense  funds are provided under this part or in the compliance of any  regulation issued pursuant to those programs. On a subsequent  determination by the Secretary that State agency administration of the  programs or compliance with regulations is no longer seriously deficient  and is operated in an acceptable manner, the Secretary may allocate some  or all of the funds withheld.
