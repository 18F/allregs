                            <p class="depth0">Medicinal preparations and flavoring extracts, approved for drawback under the provisions of this part, may be exported subject to 19 U.S.C. 1313(d), which authorizes export drawback equal to the entire amount of internal revenue tax found to have been paid on the domestic alcohol used in the manufacture of such products. (Note: Export drawback is not allowed for imported alcohol under this provision of customs law.) Claims for such export drawback shall be filed in accordance with the applicable regulations of the U.S. Customs Service. Such claims may cover either the full rate of tax which has been paid on the alcohol, if no nonbeverage drawback has been claimed thereon, or else the remainder of the tax if nonbeverage drawback under 26 U.S.C. 5114 has been or will be claimed.
