                            <p class="depth0">Appropriate adjustments will be made in rental assistance payments  to reflect changes in income or other circumstances which are reported  by a tenant and verified or are shown by the annual tenant income  recertification, as required by Sec. 236.80. Rental assistance payments  will be discontinued when it is determined by the Secretary that the  amount the tenant is required to pay for rent, in accordance with  Sec. 236.735, is sufficient to pay the approved basic monthly rental  (plus, where applicable, the established utility allowance) for the unit  occupied by the tenant. Where a tenant is no longer entitled to rental  assistance payments, he/she may continue to occupy the unit. The rents  charged for the unit shall not exceed those specified in subpart A.
