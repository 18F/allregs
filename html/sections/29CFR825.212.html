                                Sec. 825.212  Employee failure to pay health plan premium payments.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the absence of an established employer policy providing a  longer grace period, an employer's obligations to maintain health  insurance coverage cease under FMLA if an employee's premium payment is  more than 30 days late. In order to drop the coverage for an employee  whose premium payment is late, the employer must provide written notice  to the employee that the payment has not been received. Such notice must  be mailed to the employee at least 15 days before coverage is to cease,  advising that coverage will be dropped on a specified date at least 15  days after the date of the letter unless the payment has been received  by that date. If the employer has established policies regarding other  forms of unpaid leave that provide for the employer to cease coverage  retroactively to the date the unpaid premium payment was due, the  employer may drop the employee from coverage retroactively in accordance  with that policy, provided the 15-day notice was given. In the absence  of such a policy, coverage for the employee may be terminated at the end  of the 30-day grace period, where the required 15-day notice has been  provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An employer has no obligation regarding the maintenance of a  health insurance policy which is not a group health plan. See Sec.  825.209(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All other obligations of an employer under FMLA would continue;  for example, the employer continues to have an obligation to reinstate  an employee upon return from leave.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The employer may recover the employee's share of any premium  payments missed by the employee for any FMLA leave period during which  the employer maintains health coverage by paying the employee's share  after the premium payment is missed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If coverage lapses because an employee has not made required  premium payments, upon the employee's return from FMLA leave the  employer must still restore the employee to coverage/benefits equivalent  to those the employee would have had if leave had not been taken and the  premium payment(s) had not been missed, including family or dependent  coverage. See Sec. 825.215(d)(1)-(5). In such case, an employee may not  be required to meet any qualification requirements imposed by the plan,  including any new   preexisting condition waiting period, to wait for an open season, or to  pass a medical examination to obtain reinstatement of coverage. If an  employer terminates an employee's insurance in accordance with this  section and fails to restore the employee's health insurance as required  by this section upon the employee's return, the employer may be liable  for benefits lost by reason of the violation, for other actual monetary  losses sustained as a direct result of the violation, and for  appropriate equitable relief tailored to the harm suffered.</p>
