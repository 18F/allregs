                                Sec.  1.53-2  Carryback and carryover of unused credit.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Allowance of unused credit as a carryback or carryover--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In  general. Section 53(b) (formerly designated as section 53(c) for taxable  years beginning before 1979) provides for carrybacks and carryovers of  unused targeted jobs credit (new jobs credit in the case of wages paid  before 1979). An   unused credit is the excess of the credit determined under section 51  for the taxable year over the limitation provided by Sec.  1.53-1 for  such taxable year. Subject to the limitations contained in paragraph (b)  of this section and paragraph (f) of Sec.  1.53-3, an unused credit  shall be added to the amount allowable as a credit under section 44B for  the years to which an unused credit can be carried. The year with  respect to which an unused credit arises shall be referred to in this  section as the ``unused credit year.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Taxable years to which unused credit may be carried. An unused  targeted jobs credit (new jobs credit in the case of wages paid before  1979) shall be a new employee credit carryback to each of the 3 taxable  years preceding the unused credit year and a new employee credit  carryover to each of the 15 taxable years succeeding the unused credit  year. An unused credit must be carried first to the earliest of the  taxable years to which it may be carried, and then to each of the other  taxable years (in order of time) to the extent that the unused credit  may not be added (because of the limitation contained in paragraph (b)  of this section) to the amount allowable as a credit under section 44B  for a prior taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> (section 53(c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> in the case of a  new jobs credit) to the amount allowable as a credit under section 44B  for any of the preceding or succeeding taxable years to which such  credit may be carried shall not exceed the amount by which the  limitation in Sec.  1.53-1 for such preceding or succeeding taxable year  exceeds the sum of (i) the credit allowable under section 44B for such  preceding or succeeding taxable year, and (ii) other unused credits  carried to such preceding or succeeding taxable year which are  attributable to unused credit years prior to the particular unused  credit year. Thus, in determining the amount, if any, of an unused  credit from a particular unused credit year which shall be added to the  amount allowable as a credit for any preceding or succeeding taxable  year, the credit earned for such preceding or succeeding taxable year,  plus any unused credits originating in taxable years prior to the  particular unused credit year, shall first be applied against the  limitation based on amount of tax for such preceding or succeeding  taxable year. To the extent the limitation based on amount of tax for  the preceding or succeeding year exceeds the sum of the credit earned  for such year and other unused credits attributable to years prior to  the particular unused credit year, the unused credit from the particular  unused credit year shall be added to the amount allowable as a credit  under section 44B for such preceding or succeeding year. If any portion  of the unused credit is a carryback to a taxable year beginning before  January 1, 1977, section 44B shall be deemed to have been in effect for  such taxable year for purposes of allowing such carryback as a credit  under section 44B. To the extent that an unused credit cannot be added  for a particular preceding or succeeding taxable year because of the  limitation contained in this paragraph, such unused credit shall be  available as a carryback or carryover to the next succeeding taxable  year to which it may be carried.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special rules for an electing small business corporation. An  unused targeted jobs credit (new jobs credit in the case of wages paid  before 1979) under section 44B of a corporation which arises in an  unused credit year for which the corporation is not an electing small  business corporation (as defined in section 1371(b)) and which is a  carryback or carryover to a taxable year for which the corporation is an  electing small business corporation shall not be added to the amount  allowable as a credit under section 44B to the shareholders of such  corporation for any taxable year. However, a taxable year for which the  corporation is an electing small business corporation shall be counted  as a taxable year for purposes of determining the taxable years to which  such unused credit may be carried.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Corporate acquisitions. For the carryover of unused credits  under section   44B in the case of certain corporate acquisitions, see section  381(c)(26) and Sec.  1.381(c)(26)-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Examples. This paragraph may be illustrated by the following  examples.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. In 1978, A, a calendar year taxpayer, had an unused new  jobs credit of $2,000. In 1979, A has a targeted jobs credit of $2,000  and a tax liability imposed by chapter 1 of the Code of $4,000 after all  credits listed in section 53(a) have been taken into account. The amount  of A's targeted jobs credit allowable under section 44B for 1979 is 90  percent of A's tax liability. The amount of the new jobs credit that may  be carried to 1979 is limited to $1,600 ($3,600 [90% of $4,000]-$2,000).</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. In 1979, B, a calendar year taxpayer, has a tax liability  imposed by chapter 1 of the Code of $10,000 after all credits listed in  section 53(a) have been taken. B's targeted jobs credit for that taxable  year is limited to 90 percent of his income tax liability or $9,000. B  had a $15,000 targeted jobs credit in 1979 resulting in an unused  targeted jobs credit of $5,000 for that year. In 1976 and 1977 B had tax  liabilities imposed by chapter 1 of the Code of $3,000 and $4,000  respectively after all credits listed in section 53(a) had been taken.  For purposes of carrying back an unused targeted jobs credit to a  taxable year beginning before January 1, 1977, section 44B as amended by  the Revenue Act of 1978 is deemed to have been in effect for such  taxable year. Accordingly, the applicable tax liability limitation for  1976 would be governed by section 53(a) (as amended by the Revenue Act  of 1978) which limits the amount of targeted jobs credit allowed to 90  percent of the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code after all credits  listed in section 53(a) have been taken. B may carry back $2,700 (90% of  $3,000) of the 1979 unused targeted jobs credit to 1976. B may carry  back $4,000 of the unused targeted jobs credit to 1977 because section  53(a) as it applied to the 1977 taxable year limited the amount of the  credit to 100 percent of the taxpayer's tax liability imposed by chapter  1 of the Code after all credits listed in section 53(a) had been taken.  (Secs. 44B, 381, and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (92 Stat.  2834, 26 U.S.C. 44B); 91 Stat. 148, 26 U.S.C. 381(c)(26); 68A Stat. 917,  26 U.S.C. 7805)  [T.D. 7921, 48 FR 52906, Nov. 23, 1983]</p>
