If the Commission determines to commence a trade regulation rule proceeding pursuant to the petition, the petitioner shall be mailed a copy of the public notices issued under Sec. Sec. 1.10, 1.11 and 1.12. Any person whose petition is not deemed by the Commission sufficient to warrant commencement of a rulemaking proceeding shall be notified of that determination and may be given an opportunity to submit additional data.
