                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. This section applies to direct and indirect  discharging pulp, paper, and paperboard mills with pulp production in  subparts B (Bleached Papergrade Kraft and Soda) and E (Papergrade  Sulfite).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specialized definitions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Action Level: A daily pollutant  loading that when exceeded triggers investigative or corrective action.  Mills determine action levels by a statistical analysis of six months of  daily measurements collected at the mill. For example, the lower action  level may be the 75th percentile of the running seven-day averages (that  value exceeded by 25 percent of the running seven-day averages) and the  upper action level may be the 90th percentile of the running seven-day  averages (that value exceeded by 10 percent of the running seven-day  averages).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Equipment Items in Spent Pulping Liquor, Soap, and Turpentine  Service: Any process vessel, storage tank, pumping system, evaporator,  heat exchanger, recovery furnace or boiler, pipeline, valve, fitting, or  other device that contains, processes, transports, or comes into contact  with spent pulping liquor, soap, or turpentine. Sometimes referred to as  ``equipment items.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Immediate Process Area: The location at the mill where pulping,  screening, knotting, pulp washing, pulping liquor concentration, pulping  liquor processing, and chemical recovery facilities are located,  generally the battery limits of the aforementioned processes.  ``Immediate process area'' includes spent pulping liquor storage and  spill control tanks located at the mill, whether or not they are located  in the immediate process area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Intentional Diversion: The planned removal of spent pulping  liquor, soap, or turpentine from equipment items in spent pulping  liquor, soap, or turpentine service by the mill for any purpose  including, but not limited to, maintenance, grade changes, or process  shutdowns.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Mill: The owner or operator of a direct or indirect discharging  pulp, paper, or paperboard manufacturing facility subject to this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Senior Technical Manager: The person designated by the mill  manager to review the BMP Plan. The senior technical manager shall be  the chief engineer at the mill, the manager of pulping and chemical  recovery operations, or other such responsible person designated by the  mill manager who has knowledge of and responsibility for pulping and  chemical recovery operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Soap: The product of reaction between the alkali in kraft  pulping liquor and fatty acid portions of the wood, which precipitate  out when water is evaporated from the spent pulping liquor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Spent Pulping Liquor: For kraft and soda mills ``spent pulping  liquor'' means black liquor that is used, generated, stored, or  processed at any point in the pulping and chemical recovery processes.  For sulfite mills ``spent pulping liquor'' means any intermediate,  final, or used chemical solution that is used, generated, stored, or  processed at any point in the sulfite pulping and chemical recovery  processes (e.g., ammonium-, calcium-, magnesium-, or sodium-based  sulfite liquors).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Turpentine: A mixture of terpenes, principally pinene, obtained  by the steam distillation of pine gum recovered from the condensation of  digester relief gases from the cooking of softwoods by the kraft pulping  process. Sometimes referred to as sulfate turpentine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (10) of this section. The  primary objective of the BMPs is to prevent leaks and spills of spent  pulping liquors, soap, and turpentine. The secondary objective is to  contain, collect, and recover at the immediate process area, or  otherwise control, those leaks, spills, and intentional diversions of  spent pulping liquor,   soap, and turpentine that do occur. BMPs must be developed according to  best engineering practices and must be implemented in a manner that  takes into account the specific circumstances at each mill. The BMPs are  as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The mill must return spilled or diverted spent pulping liquors,  soap, and turpentine to the process to the maximum extent practicable as  determined by the mill, recover such materials outside the process, or  discharge spilled or diverted material at a rate that does not disrupt  the receiving wastewater treatment system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The mill must establish a program to identify and repair leaking  equipment items. This program must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Regular visual inspections (e.g., once per day) of process areas  with equipment items in spent pulping liquor, soap, and turpentine  service;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Immediate repairs of leaking equipment items, when possible.  Leaking equipment items that cannot be repaired during normal operations  must be identified, temporary means for mitigating the leaks must be  provided, and the leaking equipment items repaired during the next  maintenance outage;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Identification of conditions under which production will be  curtailed or halted to repair leaking equipment items or to prevent  pulping liquor, soap, and turpentine leaks and spills; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A means for tracking repairs over time to identify those  equipment items where upgrade or replacement may be warranted based on  frequency and severity of leaks, spills, or failures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The mill must operate continuous, automatic monitoring systems  that the mill determines are necessary to detect and control leaks,  spills, and intentional diversions of spent pulping liquor, soap, and  turpentine. These monitoring systems should be integrated with the mill  process control system and may include, e.g., high level monitors and  alarms on storage tanks; process area conductivity (or pH) monitors and  alarms; and process area sewer, process wastewater, and wastewater  treatment plant conductivity (or pH) monitors and alarms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The mill must establish a program of initial and refresher  training of operators, maintenance personnel, and other technical and  supervisory personnel who have responsibility for operating,  maintaining, or supervising the operation and maintenance of equipment  items in spent pulping liquor, soap, and turpentine service. The  refresher training must be conducted at least annually and the training  program must be documented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The mill must prepare a brief report that evaluates each spill  of spent pulping liquor, soap, or turpentine that is not contained at  the immediate process area and any intentional diversion of spent  pulping liquor, soap, or turpentine that is not contained at the  immediate process area. The report must describe the equipment items  involved, the circumstances leading to the incident, the effectiveness  of the corrective actions taken to contain and recover the spill or  intentional diversion, and plans to develop changes to equipment and  operating and maintenance practices as necessary to prevent recurrence.  Discussion of the reports must be included as part of the annual  refresher training.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The mill must establish a program to review any planned  modifications to the pulping and chemical recovery facilities and any  construction activities in the pulping and chemical recovery areas  before these activities commence. The purpose of such review is to  prevent leaks and spills of spent pulping liquor, soap, and turpentine  during the planned modifications, and to ensure that construction and  supervisory personnel are aware of possible liquor diversions and of the  requirement to prevent leaks and spills of spent pulping liquors, soap,  and turpentine during construction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The mill must install and maintain secondary containment (i.e.,  containment constructed of materials impervious to pulping liquors) for  spent pulping liquor bulk storage tanks equivalent to the volume of the  largest tank plus sufficient freeboard for precipitation. An annual tank  integrity testing program, if coupled with other containment or  diversion structures,   may be substituted for secondary containment for spent pulping liquor  bulk storage tanks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The mill must install and maintain secondary containment for  turpentine bulk storage tanks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The mill must install and maintain curbing, diking or other  means of isolating soap and turpentine processing and loading areas from  the wastewater treatment facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The mill must conduct wastewater monitoring to detect leaks and  spills, to track the effectiveness of the BMPs, and to detect trends in  spent pulping liquor losses. Such monitoring must be performed in  accordance with paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Requirement to develop a BMP Plan. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each mill subject to this  section must prepare and implement a BMP Plan. The BMP Plan must be  based on a detailed engineering review as described in paragraphs (d)(2)  and (3) of this section. The BMP Plan must specify the procedures and  the practices required for each mill to meet the requirements of  paragraph (c) of this section, the construction the mill determines is  necessary to meet those requirements including a schedule for such  construction, and the monitoring program (including the statistically  derived action levels) that will be used to meet the requirements of  paragraph (i) of this section. The BMP Plan also must specify the period  of time that the mill determines the action levels established under  paragraph (h) of this section may be exceeded without triggering the  responses specified in paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each mill subject to this section must conduct a detailed  engineering review of the pulping and chemical recovery operations-- including but not limited to process equipment, storage tanks, pipelines  and pumping systems, loading and unloading facilities, and other  appurtenant pulping and chemical recovery equipment items in spent  pulping liquor, soap, and turpentine service--for the purpose of  determining the magnitude and routing of potential leaks, spills, and  intentional diversions of spent pulping liquors, soap, and turpentine  during the following periods of operation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Process start-ups and shut downs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Maintenance;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Production grade changes;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Storm or other weather events;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Power failures; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Normal operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As part of the engineering review, the mill must determine  whether existing spent pulping liquor containment facilities are of  adequate capacity for collection and storage of anticipated intentional  liquor diversions with sufficient contingency for collection and  containment of spills. The engineering review must also consider:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The need for continuous, automatic monitoring systems to detect  and control leaks and spills of spent pulping liquor, soap, and  turpentine;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The need for process wastewater diversion facilities to protect  end-of-pipe wastewater treatment facilities from adverse effects of  spills and diversions of spent pulping liquors, soap, and turpentine;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The potential for contamination of storm water from the  immediate process areas; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The extent to which segregation and/or collection and treatment  of contaminated storm water from the immediate process areas is  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Amendment of BMP Plan. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each mill subject to this section  must amend its BMP Plan whenever there is a change in mill design,  construction, operation, or maintenance that materially affects the  potential for leaks or spills of spent pulping liquor, turpentine, or  soap from the immediate process areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each mill subject to this section must complete a review and  evaluation of the BMP Plan five years after the first BMP Plan is  prepared and, except as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section,  once every five years thereafter. As a result of this review and  evaluation, the mill must amend the BMP Plan within three months of the  review if the mill determines that any new or modified management  practices and engineered controls are necessary to reduce significantly  the likelihood of spent pulping liquor, soap, and turpentine leaks,  spills, or intentional diversions from the immediate process areas,  including a schedule for implementation of such practices and controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Review and certification of BMP Plan. The BMP Plan, and any  amendments thereto, must be reviewed by the senior technical manager at  the mill and approved and signed by the mill manager. Any person signing  the BMP Plan or its amendments must certify to the permitting or  pretreatment control authority under penalty of law that the BMP Plan  (or its amendments) has been prepared in accordance with good  engineering practices and in accordance with this regulation. The mill  is not required to obtain approval from the permitting or pretreatment  control authority of the BMP Plan or any amendments thereto.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Record keeping requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each mill subject to this  section must maintain on its premises a complete copy of the current BMP  Plan and the records specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section and  must make such BMP Plan and records available to the permitting or  pretreatment control authority and the Regional Administrator or his or  her designee for review upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The mill must maintain the following records for 3 years from  the date they are created:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Records tracking the repairs performed in accordance with the  repair program described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Records of initial and refresher training conducted in  accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reports prepared in accordance with paragraph (c)(5) of this  section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Records of monitoring required by paragraphs (c)(10) and (i) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Establishment of wastewater treatment system influent action  levels. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each mill subject to this section must conduct a monitoring  program, described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, for the purpose  of defining wastewater treatment system influent characteristics (or  action levels), described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, that will  trigger requirements to initiate investigations on BMP effectiveness and  to take corrective action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each mill subject to this section must employ the following  procedures in order to develop the action levels required by paragraph  (h) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Monitoring parameters. The mill must collect 24-hour composite  samples and analyze the samples for a measure of organic content (e.g.,  Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) or Total Organic Carbon (TOC)).  Alternatively, the mill may use a measure related to spent pulping  liquor losses measured continuously and averaged over 24 hours (e.g.,  specific conductivity or color).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Monitoring locations. For direct dischargers, monitoring must  be conducted at the point influent enters the wastewater treatment  system. For indirect dischargers monitoring must be conducted at the  point of discharge to the POTW. For the purposes of this requirement,  the mill may select alternate monitoring point(s) in order to isolate  possible sources of spent pulping liquor, soap, or turpentine from other  possible sources of organic wastewaters that are tributary to the  wastewater treatment facilities (e.g., bleach plants, paper machines and  secondary fiber operations).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> By the date prescribed in paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section,  each existing discharger subject to this section must complete an  initial six-month monitoring program using the procedures specified in  paragraph (h)(2) of this section and must establish initial action  levels based on the results of that program. A wastewater treatment  influent action level is a statistically determined pollutant loading  determined by a statistical analysis of six months of daily  measurements. The action levels must consist of a lower action level,  which if exceeded will trigger the investigation requirements described  in paragraph (i) of this section, and an upper action level, which if  exceeded will trigger the corrective action requirements described in  paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> By the date prescribed in paragraph (j)(1)(vi) of this section,  each existing discharger must complete a second six-month monitoring  program using the procedures specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this  section and must establish revised action levels based on the results of  that program. The initial   action levels shall remain in effect until replaced by revised action  levels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> By the date prescribed in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, each  new source subject to this section must complete a six-month monitoring  program using the procedures specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this  section and must develop a lower action level and an upper action level  based on the results of that program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Action levels developed under this paragraph must be revised  using six months of monitoring data after any change in mill design,  construction, operation, or maintenance that materially affects the  potential for leaks or spills of spent pulping liquor, soap, or  turpentine from the immediate process areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Monitoring, corrective action, and reporting requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Each mill subject to this section must conduct daily monitoring of the  influent to the wastewater treatment system in accordance with the  procedures described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section for the purpose  of detecting leaks and spills, tracking the effectiveness of the BMPs,  and detecting trends in spent pulping liquor losses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whenever monitoring results exceed the lower action level for  the period of time specified in the BMP Plan, the mill must conduct an  investigation to determine the cause of such exceedance. Whenever  monitoring results exceed the upper action level for the period of time  specified in the BMP Plan, the mill must complete corrective action to  bring the wastewater treatment system influent mass loading below the  lower action level as soon as practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Although exceedances of the action levels will not constitute  violations of an NPDES permit or pretreatment standard, failure to take  the actions required by paragraph (i)(2) of this section as soon as  practicable will be a permit or pretreatment standard violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each mill subject to this section must report to the NPDES  permitting or pretreatment control authority the results of the daily  monitoring conducted pursuant to paragraph (i)(1) of this section. Such  reports must include a summary of the monitoring results, the number and  dates of exceedances of the applicable action levels, and brief  descriptions of any corrective actions taken to respond to such  exceedances. Submission of such reports shall be at the frequency  established by the NPDES permitting or pretreatment control authority,  but in no case less than once per year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Compliance deadlines--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Existing direct and indirect  dischargers. Except as provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section for  new sources, indirect discharging mills subject to this section must  meet the deadlines set forth below. Except as provided in paragraph  (j)(2) of this section for new sources, NPDES permits must require  direct discharging mills subject to this section to meet the deadlines  set forth below. If a deadline set forth below has passed at the time  the NPDES permit containing the BMP requirement is issued, the NPDES  permit must require immediate compliance with such BMP requirement(s).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prepare BMP Plans and certify to the permitting or pretreatment  authority that the BMP Plan has been prepared in accordance with this  regulation not later than April 15, 1999;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Implement all BMPs specified in paragraph (c) of this section  that do not require the construction of containment or diversion  structures or the installation of monitoring and alarm systems not later  than April 15, 1999.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Establish initial action levels required by paragraph (h)(3)  of this section not later than April 15, 1999.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Commence operation of any new or upgraded continuous, automatic  monitoring systems that the mill determines to be necessary under  paragraph (c)(3) of this section (other than those associated with  construction of containment or diversion structures) not later than  April 17, 2000.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Complete construction and commence operation of any spent  pulping liquor, collection, containment, diversion, or other facilities,  including any associated continuous monitoring systems, necessary to  fully implement BMPs specified in paragraph (c) of this section not  later than April 16, 2001.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Establish revised action levels required by paragraph (h)(4) of  this section as soon as possible after fully implementing the BMPs  specified in paragraph (c) of this section, but not later than January  15, 2002.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (c) through (j) of this section do  not apply to the bleached papergrade kraft mill, commonly known as the  Androscoggin Mill, that is owned by International Paper and located in  Jay, Maine. In lieu of imposing the requirements specified in those  paragraphs, the permitting authority shall establish conditions for the  discharge of COD and color for this mill on the basis of best  professional judgment.
