                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Asset allocation. Upon the termination of a single-employer  plan, the plan administrator shall allocate the plan assets available to  pay for benefits under the plan in the manner prescribed by this  subpart. Plan assets available to pay for benefits include all plan  assets (valued according to Sec. 4044.41(b)) remaining after the  subtraction of all liabilities, other than liabilities for future  benefit payments, paid or payable from plan assets under the provisions  of the plan. Liabilities include expenses, fees and other administrative  costs, and benefit payments due before the allocation date. Except as  provided in Sec. 4044.4(b), an irrevocable commitment by an insurer to  pay a benefit, which commitment is in effect on the date of the asset  allocation, is not considered a plan asset, and a benefit payable under  such a commitment is excluded from the allocation process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Allocation date. For plans that close out under Sec. 4041.28 or  Sec. 4041.50, assets shall be allocated as of the date plan assets are  to be distributed. For other plans, assets shall be allocated as of the  termination date.  [61 FR 34059, July 1, 1996, as amended at 76 FR 34605, June 14, 2011]</p>
