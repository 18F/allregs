                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon receipt of a request for a hearing which complies with  Sec. 747.306, the NCUA Board will order an informal hearing to commence  within the following 30 days in the Washington, DC metropolitan area or  at such other place as the NCUA Board designates before a Presiding  Officer designated by the NCUA Board to conduct the hearing. At the  request of the concerned party, the NCUA Board may order the hearing to  commence at a time more than 30 days after the receipt of the request  for such hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The notice of hearing shall be served by the NCUA Board upon the  party or parties afforded the hearing and shall set forth the time and  place of the hearing and the name and address of the Presiding Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The subject individual may appear at the hearing personally,  through counsel, or personally with counsel. The individual shall have  the right to introduce relevant and material written materials (or, at  the discretion of the NCUA Board, oral testimony), and to present an  oral argument before the Presiding Officer. A member of the enforcement  staff of the Office of General Counsel of the NCUA may attend the  hearing and may participate as a party. Neither the formal rules of  evidence nor the adjudicative procedures of the Administrative Procedure  Act (5 U.S.C. 554-557), nor subpart A of this part shall apply to the  hearing. The proceedings shall be recorded and a transcript furnished to  the individual upon request and after the payment of the cost thereof.  The NCUA Board shall have the discretion to permit the presentation of  witnesses, within specified time limits, so long as a list of such  witnesses is furnished to the Presiding Officer at least ten days prior  to the hearing. Witnesses shall not be sworn, unless specifically  requested by either party or directed by the Presiding Officer. The  Presiding Officer may examine any witnesses and each party shall have  the opportunity to cross-examine any witness presented by an opposing  party. Upon the request of either the subject individual or the  representative of the Office of General Counsel, the record shall remain  open for a period of five business days following the hearing, during  which time the parties may make any additional submissions to the  record. Thereafter, the record shall be closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the course of or in connection with any proceeding under this  subpart, the NCUA Board and the Presiding Officer will have the power to  administer oaths and affirmations, to take or cause depositions to be  taken, and to issue, revoke, quash, or modify subpoenas and subpoenas  duces tecum. If the NCUA Board permits the presentation of witnesses,  the NCUA Board or the Presiding Officer may require the attendance of  witnesses from any place in any state or in any territory or other place  subject to the jurisdiction of the United States at any designated place  where such proceeding is being conducted. Witnesses subpoenaed shall be  paid the same fees and mileage as are paid witnesses in the District  Courts of the United States. The NCUA Board or the Presiding Officer may  require the production of documents from any place in any such state,  territory, or other place.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Presiding Officer will make his or her recommendations to  the Board, where possible, within ten business days following the close  of the record.
