                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general--(1) Scope of definition. Section 4958(f)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> defines  disqualified person, with respect to any transaction, as any person who  was in a position to exercise substantial influence over the affairs of  an applicable tax-exempt organization at any time during the five-year  period ending on the date of the transaction (the lookback period).  Paragraph (b) of this section describes persons who are defined to be  disqualified persons under the statute, including certain family members  of an individual in a position to exercise substantial influence, and  certain 35-percent controlled entities. Paragraph (c) of this section  describes persons in a position to exercise substantial influence over  the affairs of an applicable tax-exempt organization by virtue of their  powers and responsibilities or certain interests they hold. Paragraph  (d) of this section describes persons deemed not to be in a position to  exercise substantial influence. Whether any person who is not described  in paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of this section is a disqualified person  with respect to a transaction for purposes of section 4958 is based on  all relevant facts and circumstances, as described in paragraph (e) of  this section. Paragraph (f) of this section describes special rules for  affiliated organizations. Examples in paragraph (g) of this section  illustrate these categories of persons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transition rule for lookback period. In the case of any excess  benefit transaction occurring before September 14, 2000, the lookback  period described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section begins on September  14, 1995, and ends on the date of the transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Statutory categories of disqualified persons--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Family  members. A person is a disqualified person with respect to any  transaction with an applicable tax-exempt organization if the person is  a member of the family of a person who is a disqualified person  described in paragraph (a) of this section (other than as a result of  this paragraph) with respect to any transaction with the same  organization. For purposes of the following sentence, a legally adopted  child of an individual is treated as a child of such individual by  blood. A person's family is limited to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Spouse;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Brothers or sisters (by whole or half blood);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Spouses of brothers or sisters (by whole or half blood);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Ancestors;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Children;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Grandchildren;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Great grandchildren; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Spouses of children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Thirty-five percent controlled entities--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. A  person is a disqualified person with respect to any transaction with an  applicable tax-exempt organization if the person is a 35-percent  controlled entity. A 35-percent controlled entity is--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A corporation in which persons described in this section (except  in paragraphs (b)(2) and (d) of this section) own more than 35 percent  of the combined voting power;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A partnership in which persons described in this section (except  in paragraphs (b)(2) and (d) of this section) own more than 35 percent  of the profits interest; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A trust or estate in which persons described in this section  (except in paragraphs (b)(2) and (d) of this section) own more than 35  percent of the beneficial interest.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Combined voting power. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2),  combined voting power includes voting power represented by holdings of  voting stock, direct or indirect, but does not include voting rights  held only as a director, trustee, or other fiduciary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Constructive ownership rules--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Stockholdings. For purposes  of section   4958(f)(3) and this paragraph (b)(2), indirect stockholdings are taken  into account as under section 267(c), except that in applying section  267(c)(4), the family of an individual shall include the members of the  family specified in section 4958(f)(4) and paragraph (b)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Profits or beneficial interest. For purposes of section  4958(f)(3) and this paragraph (b)(2), the ownership of profits or  beneficial interests shall be determined in accordance with the rules  for constructive ownership of stock provided in section 267(c) (other  than section 267(c)(3)), except that in applying section 267(c)(4), the  family of an individual shall include the members of the family  specified in section 4958(f)(4) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Persons having substantial influence. A person who holds any of  the following powers, responsibilities, or interests is in a position to  exercise substantial influence over the affairs of an applicable tax- exempt organization:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Voting members of the governing body. This category includes any  individual serving on the governing body of the organization who is  entitled to vote on any matter over which the governing body has  authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Presidents, chief executive officers, or chief operating  officers. This category includes any person who, regardless of title,  has ultimate responsibility for implementing the decisions of the  governing body or for supervising the management, administration, or  operation of the organization. A person who serves as president, chief  executive officer, or chief operating officer has this ultimate  responsibility unless the person demonstrates otherwise. If this  ultimate responsibility resides with two or more individuals (e.g., co- presidents), who may exercise such responsibility in concert or  individually, then each individual is in a position to exercise  substantial influence over the affairs of the organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Treasurers and chief financial officers. This category includes  any person who, regardless of title, has ultimate responsibility for  managing the finances of the organization. A person who serves as  treasurer or chief financial officer has this ultimate responsibility  unless the person demonstrates otherwise. If this ultimate  responsibility resides with two or more individuals who may exercise the  responsibility in concert or individually, then each individual is in a  position to exercise substantial influence over the affairs of the  organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Persons with a material financial interest in a provider- sponsored organization. For purposes of section 4958, if a hospital that  participates in a provider-sponsored organization (as defined in section  1855(e) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1395w-25) is an applicable  tax-exempt organization, then any person with a material financial  interest (within the meaning of section 501(o)) in the provider- sponsored organization has substantial influence with respect to the  hospital.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Persons deemed not to have substantial influence. A person is  deemed not to be in a position to exercise substantial influence over  the affairs of an applicable tax-exempt organization if that person is  described in one of the following categories:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c)(3). This  category includes any organization described in section 501(c)(3) and  exempt from tax under section 501(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certain section 501(c)(4) organizations. Only with respect to an  applicable tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(4) and  Sec. 53.4958-2(a)(4), this category includes any other organization so  described.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Employees receiving economic benefits of less than a specified  amount in a taxable year. This category includes, for the taxable year  in which benefits are provided, any full- or part-time employee of the  applicable tax-exempt organization who--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is not described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section with  respect to the organization; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is not a substantial contributor to the organization within  the meaning of section 507(d)(2)(A), taking into account only  contributions received by the organization during its current   taxable year and the four preceding taxable years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Facts and circumstances govern in all other cases--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In  general. Whether a person who is not described in paragraph (b), (c) or  (d) of this section is a disqualified person depends upon all relevant  facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Facts and circumstances tending to show substantial influence.  Facts and circumstances tending to show that a person has substantial  influence over the affairs of an organization include, but are not  limited to, the following--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The person founded the organization;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The person is a substantial contributor to the organization  (within the meaning of section 507(d)(2)(A)), taking into account only  contributions received by the organization during its current taxable  year and the four preceding taxable years;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The person's compensation is primarily based on revenues  derived from activities of the organization, or of a particular  department or function of the organization, that the person controls;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The person has or shares authority to control or determine a  substantial portion of the organization's capital expenditures,  operating budget, or compensation for employees;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The person manages a discrete segment or activity of the  organization that represents a substantial portion of the activities,  assets, income, or expenses of the organization, as compared to the  organization as a whole;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The person owns a controlling interest (measured by either vote  or value) in a corporation, partnership, or trust that is a disqualified  person; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The person is a non-stock organization controlled, directly or  indirectly, by one or more disqualified persons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Facts and circumstances tending to show no substantial  influence. Facts and circumstances tending to show that a person does  not have substantial influence over the affairs of an organization  include, but are not limited to, the following--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The person has taken a bona fide vow of poverty as an employee,  agent, or on behalf, of a religious organization;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The person is a contractor (such as an attorney, accountant, or  investment manager or advisor) whose sole relationship to the  organization is providing professional advice (without having decision- making authority) with respect to transactions from which the contractor  will not economically benefit either directly or indirectly (aside from  customary fees received for the professional advice rendered);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The direct supervisor of the individual is not a disqualified  person;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The person does not participate in any management decisions  affecting the organization as a whole or a discrete segment or activity  of the organization that represents a substantial portion of the  activities, assets, income, or expenses of the organization, as compared  to the organization as a whole; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any preferential treatment a person receives based on the size  of that person's contribution is also offered to all other donors making  a comparable contribution as part of a solicitation intended to attract  a substantial number of contributions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Affiliated organizations. In the case of multiple organizations  affiliated by common control or governing documents, the determination  of whether a person does or does not have substantial influence shall be  made separately for each applicable tax-exempt organization. A person  may be a disqualified person with respect to transactions with more than  one applicable tax-exempt organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this section. A finding that a person is a disqualified person in the  following examples does not indicate that an excess benefit transaction  has occurred. If a person is a disqualified person, the rules of section  4958(c) and Sec. 53.4958-4 apply to determine whether an excess benefit  transaction has occurred. The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. N, an artist by profession, works part-time at R, a local  museum. In the first taxable year in which R employs N, R pays N a  salary and provides no additional benefits to N except for free  admission to the museum, a benefit R provides to all of its employees  and volunteers. The total economic   benefits N receives from R during the taxable year are less than the  amount referenced for a highly compensated employee in section  414(q)(1)(B)(i). The part-time job constitutes N's only relationship  with R. N is not related to any other disqualified person with respect  to R. N is deemed not to be in a position to exercise substantial  influence over the affairs of R. Therefore, N is not a disqualified  person with respect to R in that year.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that in  addition to the salary that R pays N for N's services during the taxable  year, R also purchases one of N's paintings for $x. The total of N's  salary plus $x exceeds the amount referenced for highly compensated  employees in section 414(q)(1)(B)(i). Consequently, whether N is in a  position to exercise substantial influence over the affairs of R for  that taxable year depends upon all of the relevant facts and  circumstances.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Q is a member of K, a section 501(c)(3) organization with  a broad-based public membership. Members of K are entitled to vote only  with respect to the annual election of directors and the approval of  major organizational transactions such as a merger or dissolution. Q is  not related to any other disqualified person of K. Q has no other  relationship to K besides being a member of K and occasionally making  modest donations to K. Whether Q is a disqualified person is determined  by all relevant facts and circumstances. Q's voting rights, which are  the same as granted to all members of K, do not place Q in a position to  exercise substantial influence over K. Under these facts and  circumstances, Q is not a disqualified person with respect to K.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. E is the headmaster of Z, a school that is an applicable  tax-exempt organization for purposes of section 4958. E reports to Z's  board of trustees and has ultimate responsibility for supervising Z's  day-to-day operations. For example, E can hire faculty members and  staff, make changes to the school's curriculum and discipline students  without specific board approval. Because E has ultimate responsibility  for supervising the operation of Z, E is in a position to exercise  substantial influence over the affairs of Z. Therefore, E is a  disqualified person with respect to Z.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. Y is an applicable tax-exempt organization for purposes  of section 4958 that decides to use bingo games as a method of  generating revenue. Y enters into a contract with B, a company that  operates bingo games. Under the contract, B manages the promotion and  operation of the bingo activity, provides all necessary staff,  equipment, and services, and pays Y q percent of the revenue from this  activity. B retains the balance of the proceeds. Y provides no goods or  services in connection with the bingo operation other than the use of  its hall for the bingo games. The annual gross revenue earned from the  bingo games represents more than half of Y's total annual revenue. B's  compensation is primarily based on revenues from an activity B controls.  B also manages a discrete activity of Y that represents a substantial  portion of Y's income compared to the organization as a whole. Under  these facts and circumstances, B is in a position to exercise  substantial influence over the affairs of Y. Therefore, B is a  disqualified person with respect to Y.</p><p class="depth2">Example 6. The facts are the same as in Example 5, with the  additional fact that P owns a majority of the stock of B and is actively  involved in managing B. Because P owns a controlling interest (measured  by either vote or value) in and actively manages B, P is also in a  position to exercise substantial influence over the affairs of Y.  Therefore, under these facts and circumstances, P is a disqualified  person with respect to Y.</p><p class="depth2">Example 7. A, an applicable tax-exempt organization for purposes of  section 4958, owns and operates one acute care hospital. B, a for-profit  corporation, owns and operates a number of hospitals. A and B form C, a  limited liability company. In exchange for proportional ownership  interests, A contributes its hospital, and B contributes other assets,  to C. All of A's assets then consist of its membership interest in C. A  continues to be operated for exempt purposes based almost exclusively on  the activities it conducts through C. C enters into a management  agreement with a management company, M, to provide day to day management  services to C. Subject to supervision by C's board, M is given broad  discretion to manage C's day to day operation and has ultimate  responsibility for supervising the management of the hospital. Because M  has ultimate responsibility for supervising the management of the  hospital operated by C, A's ownership interest in C is its primary  asset, and C's activities form the basis for A's continued exemption as  an organization described in section 501(c)(3), M is in a position to  exercise substantial influence over the affairs of A. Therefore, M is a  disqualified person with respect to A.</p><p class="depth2">Example 8. T is a large university and an applicable tax-exempt  organization for purposes of section 4958. L is the dean of the College  of Law of T, a substantial source of revenue for T, including  contributions from alumni and foundations. L is not related to any other  disqualified person of T. L does not serve on T's governing body or have  ultimate responsibility for managing the university as whole. However,  as dean of the College of Law, L plays a key role in faculty hiring and  determines a substantial portion of the capital expenditures and  operating budget of the College of Law. L's compensation is greater than  the amount referenced   for a highly compensated employee in section 414(q)(1)(B)(i) in the year  benefits are provided. L's management of a discrete segment of T that  represents a substantial portion of the income of T (as compared to T as  a whole) places L in a position to exercise substantial influence over  the affairs of T. Under these facts and circumstances L is a  disqualified person with respect to T.</p><p class="depth2">Example 9. S chairs a small academic department in the College of  Arts and Sciences of the same university T described in Example 8. S is  not related to any other disqualified person of T. S does not serve on  T's governing body or as an officer of T. As department chair, S  supervises faculty in the department, approves the course curriculum,  and oversees the operating budget for the department. S's compensation  is greater than the amount referenced for a highly compensated employee  in section 414(q)(1)(B)(i) in the year benefits are provided. Even  though S manages the department, that department does not represent a  substantial portion of T's activities, assets, income, expenses, or  operating budget. Therefore, S does not participate in any management  decisions affecting either T as a whole, or a discrete segment or  activity of T that represents a substantial portion of its activities,  assets, income, or expenses. Under these facts and circumstances, S does  not have substantial influence over the affairs of T, and therefore S is  not a disqualified person with respect to T.</p><p class="depth2">Example 10. U is a large acute-care hospital that is an applicable  tax-exempt organization for purposes of section 4958. U employs X as a  radiologist. X gives instructions to staff with respect to the radiology  work X conducts, but X does not supervise other U employees or manage  any substantial part of U's operations. X's compensation is primarily in  the form of a fixed salary. In addition, X is eligible to receive an  incentive award based on revenues of the radiology department. X's  compensation is greater than the amount referenced for a highly  compensated employee in section 414(q)(1)(B)(i) in the year benefits are  provided. X is not related to any other disqualified person of U. X does  not serve on U's governing body or as an officer of U. Although U  participates in a provider-sponsored organization (as defined in section  1855(e) of the Social Security Act), X does not have a material  financial interest in that organization. X does not receive compensation  primarily based on revenues derived from activities of U that X  controls. X does not participate in any management decisions affecting  either U as a whole or a discrete segment of U that represents a  substantial portion of its activities, assets, income, or expenses.  Under these facts and circumstances, X does not have substantial  influence over the affairs of U, and therefore X is not a disqualified  person with respect to U.</p><p class="depth2">Example 11. W is a cardiologist and head of the cardiology  department of the same hospital U described in Example 10. The  cardiology department is a major source of patients admitted to U and  consequently represents a substantial portion of U's income, as compared  to U as a whole. W does not serve on U's governing board or as an  officer of U. W does not have a material financial interest in the  provider-sponsored organization (as defined in section 1855(e) of the  Social Security Act) in which U participates. W receives a salary and  retirement and welfare benefits fixed by a three-year renewable  employment contract with U. W's compensation is greater than the amount  referenced for a highly compensated employee in section 414(q)(1)(B)(i)  in the year benefits are provided. As department head, W manages the  cardiology department and has authority to allocate the budget for that  department, which includes authority to distribute incentive bonuses  among cardiologists according to criteria that W has authority to set.  W's management of a discrete segment of U that represents a substantial  portion of its income and activities (as compared to U as a whole)  places W in a position to exercise substantial influence over the  affairs of U. Under these facts and circumstances, W is a disqualified  person with respect to U.</p><p class="depth2">Example 12. M is a museum that is an applicable tax-exempt  organization for purposes of section 4958. D provides accounting  services and tax advice to M as a contractor in return for a fee. D has  no other relationship with M and is not related to any disqualified  person of M. D does not provide professional advice with respect to any  transaction from which D might economically benefit either directly or  indirectly (aside from fees received for the professional advice  rendered). Because D's sole relationship to M is providing professional  advice (without having decision-making authority) with respect to  transactions from which D will not economically benefit either directly  or indirectly (aside from customary fees received for the professional  advice rendered), under these facts and circumstances, D is not a  disqualified person with respect to M.</p><p class="depth2">Example 13. F is a repertory theater company that is an applicable  tax-exempt organization for purposes of section 4958. F holds a fund- raising campaign to pay for the construction of a new theater. J is a  regular subscriber to F's productions who has made modest gifts to F in  the past. J has no relationship to F other than as a subscriber and  contributor. F solicits contributions as part of a broad public campaign  intended to attract a large number of donors, including a substantial  number of donors making large gifts. In its solicitations for  contributions, F promises to invite all contributors giving $z   or more to a special opening production and party held at the new  theater. These contributors are also given a special number to call in  F's office to reserve tickets for performances, make ticket exchanges,  and make other special arrangements for their convenience. J makes a  contribution of $z to F, which makes J a substantial contributor within  the meaning of section 507(d)(2)(A), taking into account only  contributions received by F during its current and the four preceding  taxable years. J receives the benefits described in F's solicitation.  Because F offers the same benefit to all donors of $z or more, the  preferential treatment that J receives does not indicate that J is in a  position to exercise substantial influence over the affairs of the  organization. Therefore, under these facts and circumstances, J is not a  disqualified person with respect to F.  [T.D. 8978, 67 FR 3083, Jan. 23, 2002]</p>
