Sec.  266.105, 266.106, and 266.107. The facility may burn hazardous waste only under the operating conditions that the owner or operator establishes under paragraph (b)(3) of this section until the owner or operator submits a revised certification of precompliance under paragraph (b)(8) of this section or a certification of compliance under paragraph (c) of this section, or until a permit is issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General.

For purposes of compliance with the closure provisions of paragraph (l) of this section and Sec. Sec.  265.112(d)(2) and 265.113 of this chapter the boiler or industrial furnace has received ``the known final volume of hazardous waste'' on the date that the deadline is missed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Start-up and shut-down. Hazardous waste (except waste fed solely as an ingredient under the Tier I (or adjusted Tier I) feed rate screening limits for metals and chloride/chlorine) must not be fed into the device during start-up and shut-down of the boiler or industrial furnace, unless the device is operating within the conditions of operation specified in the certification of compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Automatic waste feed cutoff. During the compliance test required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and upon certification of compliance under paragraph (c) of this section, a boiler or industrial furnace must be operated with a functioning system that automatically cuts off the hazardous waste feed when the applicable operating conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (v through xiii) of this section deviate from those established in the certification of compliance. In addition:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To minimize emissions of organic compounds, the minimum combustion chamber temperature (or the indicator of combustion chamber temperature) that occurred during the compliance test must be maintained while hazardous waste or hazardous waste residues remain in the combustion chamber, with the minimum temperature during the compliance test defined as either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If compliance with the combustion chamber temperature limit is based on an hourly rolling average, the minimum temperature during the compliance test is considered to be the average over all runs of the lowest hourly rolling average for each run; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If compliance with the combustion chamber temperature limit is based on an instantaneous temperature measurement, the minimum temperature during the compliance test is considered to be the time-weighted average temperature during all runs of the test; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Operating parameters limited by the certification of compliance must continue to be monitored during the cutoff, and the hazardous waste feed shall not be restarted until the levels of those parameters comply with the limits established in the certification of compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Fugitive emissions. Fugitive emissions must be controlled by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Keeping the combustion zone totally sealed against fugitive emissions; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Maintaining the combustion zone pressure lower than atmospheric pressure; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An alternate means of control that the owner or operator can demonstrate provide fugitive emissions control equivalent to maintenance of combustion zone pressure lower than atmospheric pressure. Support for such

demonstration shall be included in the operating record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Changes. A boiler or industrial furnace must cease burning hazardous waste when changes in combustion properties, or feed rates of the hazardous waste, other fuels, or industrial furnace feedstocks, or changes in the boiler or industrial furnace design or operating conditions deviate from the limits specified in the certification of compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Monitoring and Inspections. (1) The owner or operator must monitor and record the following, at a minimum, while burning hazardous waste:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator must monitor and record the following, at a minimum, while burning hazardous waste:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Feed rates and composition of hazardous waste, other fuels, and industrial furnace feed stocks, and feed rates of ash, metals, and total chloride and chlorine as necessary to ensure conformance with the certification of precompliance or certification of compliance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Carbon monoxide (CO), oxygen, and if applicable, hydrocarbons (HC), on a continuous basis at a common point in the boiler or industrial furnace downstream of the combustion zone and prior to release of stack gases to the atmosphere in accordance with the operating limits specified in the certification of compliance. CO, HC, and oxygen monitors must be installed, operated, and maintained in accordance with methods specified in appendix IX of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Upon the request of the Director, sampling and analysis of the hazardous waste (and other fuels and industrial furnace feed stocks as appropriate) and the stack gas emissions must be conducted to verify that the operating conditions established in the certification of precompliance or certification of compliance achieve the applicable standards of Sec. Sec.  266.104, 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The boiler or industrial furnace and associated equipment (pumps, valves, pipes, fuel storage tanks, etc.) must be subjected to thorough visual inspection when they contain hazardous waste, at least daily for leaks, spills, fugitive emissions, and signs of tampering.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The automatic hazardous waste feed cutoff system and associated alarms must be tested at least once every 7 days when hazardous waste is burned to verify operability, unless the owner or operator can demonstrate that weekly inspections will unduly restrict or upset operations and that less frequent inspections will be adequate. Support for such demonstration shall be included in the operating record. At a minimum, operational testing must be conducted at least once every 30 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> These monitoring and inspection data must be recorded and the records must be placed in the operating log.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Recordkeeping. The owner or operator must keep in the operating record of the facility all information and data required by this section for five years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Closure. At closure, the owner or operator must remove all hazardous waste and hazardous waste residues (including, but not limited to, ash, scrubber waters, and scrubber sludges) from the boiler or industrial furnace and must comply with Sec. Sec.  265.111-265.115 of this chapter.
