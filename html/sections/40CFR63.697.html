Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (as defined in Sec.  63.2) required by this subpart, the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance test according to the manner specified by either paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For data collected using test methods supported by the EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) as listed

on the EPA's ERT Web site (http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ert/index.html), the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance test to the EPA via the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI) accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (http://cdx.epa.gov/epa--home.asp). Performance test data must be submitted in a file format generated through the use of the EPA's ERT. Owners or operators who claim that some of the performance test information being submitted is confidential business information (CBI) must submit a complete file generated through the use of the EPA's ERT, including information claimed to be CBI, on a compact disc, flash drive, or other commonly used electronic storage media to the EPA. The electronic media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAPQS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group, MD C404-02, 4930 Old Page Road, Durham, NC 27703.

If a source fails to meet an applicable standard, report such events in the Periodic Report. Report the number of failures to meet an applicable standard. For each instance, report the date, time and duration of each failure. For each failure the report must include a list of the affected sources or equipment, an estimate of the volume of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission limit, and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A summary report specified in Sec.  63.10(e)(3) shall be submitted on a semiannual basis (i.e., once every 6-month period). The summary report must include a description of all deviations as defined in Sec. Sec.  63.683(f) and 63.695(e) that have occurred during the 6-month reporting period. For each deviation caused when the daily average value of a monitored operating parameter is less than the minimum operating parameter limit (or, if applicable, greater than the maximum operating parameter limit), the report must include the daily average values of the monitored parameter, the applicable operating parameter limit, and the date and duration of the period that the deviation occurred. For each deviation caused by lack of monitoring data, the report must include the date and duration of period when the monitoring data were not collected and the reason why the data were not collected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For pressure relief devices in off-site material service subject to Sec.  63.691(c), Periodic Reports must include the information specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For pressure relief devices in off-site material service subject to Sec.  63.691(c), report the results of all monitoring conducted within the reporting period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For pressure relief devices in gas/vapor service subject to Sec.  63.691(c)(2)(i), report any instrument reading of 500 ppm above background or greater, if detected more than 5 days after the pressure release.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For pressure relief devices in off-site material service subject to Sec.  63.691(c)(3), report each pressure release to the atmosphere, including the following information:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The source, nature, and cause of the pressure release.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The date, time, and duration of the pressure release.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> An estimate of the quantity of HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart emitted during the pressure release and the method used for determining this quantity.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The actions taken to prevent this pressure release.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The measures adopted to prevent future such pressure releases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Pressure tank closure device or bypass deviation report.
