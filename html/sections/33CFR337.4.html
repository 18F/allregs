                            <p class="depth0">The establishment of joint notification procedures for Corps  projects involving disposal of dredged or fill material should be  actively pursued through the development of MOAs with the state. The  MOAs may be used to define responsibilities between the state and the  Corps district involved. The primary purpose of MOAs will be to avoid or  eliminate administrative duplication, when such duplication does not  contribute to the overall decision-making process. MOAs for purposes of  this regulation will not be used to implement provisions not related to  the maintenance or enforcement of Federally-approved state water quality  standards or coastal zone management programs. District engineers are  authorized and encouraged to develop MOAs with states and other Federal  agencies for Corps projects involving the discharge of dredged or fill  material. Copies of all MOAs will be forwarded to CECW-D, Office of the  Chief of Engineers, Washington, DC 20314-1000 for approval.</p>
