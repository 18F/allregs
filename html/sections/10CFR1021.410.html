                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The actions listed in appendices A and B to this subpart D are classes of actions that DOE has determined do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment (categorical exclusions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> To find that a proposal is categorically excluded, DOE shall determine the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The proposal fits within a class of actions that is listed in appendix A or B to this subpart D;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> There are no extraordinary circumstances related to the proposal that may affect the significance of the environmental effects of the proposal. Extraordinary circumstances are unique situations presented by specific proposals, including, but not limited to, scientific controversy about the environmental effects of the proposal; uncertain effects or effects involving unique or unknown risks; and unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The proposal has not been segmented to meet the definition of a categorical exclusion. Segmentation can occur when a proposal is broken down into small parts in order to avoid the appearance of significance of the total action. The scope of a proposal must include the consideration of connected and cumulative actions, that is, the proposal is not connected to other actions with potentially significant impacts (40 CFR 1508.25(a)(1)), is not related to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively significant impacts (40 CFR 1508.27(b)(7)), and is not precluded by 40 CFR 1506.1 or Sec. 1021.211 of this part concerning limitations on actions during EIS preparation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> All categorical exclusions may be applied by any organizational element of DOE. The sectional divisions in appendix B to this subpart D are solely for purposes of organization of that appendix and are not intended to be limiting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A class of actions includes activities foreseeably necessary to proposals encompassed within the class of actions (such as award of implementing grants and contracts, site preparation, purchase and installation of equipment, and associated transportation activities).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Categorical exclusion determinations for actions listed in appendix B shall be documented and made available to the public by posting online, generally within two weeks of the determination, unless additional time is needed in order to review and protect classified information, ``confidential business information,'' or other information that DOE would not disclose pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552). Posted categorical exclusion determinations shall not disclose classified information, ``confidential business information,'' or other information that DOE would not disclose pursuant to FOIA. (See also 10 CFR 1021.340.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Proposed recurring activities to be undertaken during a specified time period, such as routine maintenance activities for a year, may be addressed in a single categorical exclusion determination after considering the potential aggregated impacts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The following clarifications are provided to assist in the appropriate application of categorical exclusions that employ the terms or phrases:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> ``Previously disturbed or developed'' refers to land that has been changed such that its functioning ecological processes have been and remain altered by human activity. The phrase encompasses areas that have been transformed from natural cover to non-native species or a managed state, including, but not limited to, utility and electric power transmission corridors and rights-of-way, and other areas where active utilities and currently used roads are readily available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> DOE considers terms such as ``small'' and ``small-scale'' in the context of the particular proposal, including its proposed location. In assessing whether a proposed action is small, in addition to the actual magnitude of the

proposal, DOE considers factors such as industry norms, the relationship of the proposed action to similar types of development in the vicinity of the proposed action, and expected outputs of emissions or waste. When considering the physical size of a proposed facility, for example, DOE would review the surrounding land uses, the scale of the proposed facility relative to existing development, and the capacity of existing roads and other infrastructure to support the proposed action.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

Conditions That Are Integral Elements of the Classes of Actions in</p><p class="depth0">Appendix B</p><p class="depth0">The classes of actions listed below include the following conditions as integral elements of the classes of actions. To fit within the classes of actions listed below, a proposal must be one that would not:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Threaten a violation of applicable statutory, regulatory, or permit requirements for environment, safety, and health, or similar requirements of DOE or Executive Orders;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Require siting and construction or major expansion of waste storage, disposal, recovery, or treatment facilities (including incinerators), but the proposal may include categorically excluded waste storage, disposal, recovery, or treatment actions or facilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Disturb hazardous substances, pollutants, contaminants, or CERCLA-excluded petroleum and natural gas products that preexist in the environment such that there would be uncontrolled or unpermitted releases;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Have the potential to cause significant impacts on environmentally sensitive resources. An environmentally sensitive resource is typically a resource that has been identified as needing protection through Executive Order, statute, or regulation by Federal, state, or local government, or a Federally recognized Indian tribe. An action may be categorically excluded if, although sensitive resources are present, the action would not have the potential to cause significant impacts on those resources (such as

construction of a building with its foundation well above a sole-source aquifer or upland surface soil removal on a site that has wetlands). Environmentally sensitive resources include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Property (such as sites, buildings, structures, and objects) of historic, archeological, or architectural significance designated by a Federal, state, or local government, Federally recognized Indian tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization, or property determined to be eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Federally-listed threatened or endangered species or their habitat (including critical habitat) or Federally-proposed or candidate species or their habitat (Endangered Species Act); state-listed or state-proposed endangered or threatened species or their habitat; Federally-protected marine mammals and Essential Fish Habitat (Marine Mammal Protection Act; Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act); and otherwise Federally-protected species (such as the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act or the Migratory Bird Treaty Act);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Floodplains and wetlands (as defined in 10 CFR 1022.4, ``Compliance with Floodplain and Wetland Environmental Review Requirements: Definitions,'' or its successor);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Areas having a special designation such as Federally- and state-designated wilderness areas, national parks, national monuments, national natural landmarks, wild and scenic rivers, state and Federal wildlife refuges, scenic areas (such as National Scenic and Historic Trails or National Scenic Areas), and marine sanctuaries;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Prime or unique farmland, or other farmland of statewide or local importance, as defined at 7 CFR 658.2(a), ``Farmland Protection Policy Act: Definitions,'' or its successor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Special sources of water (such as sole-source aquifers, wellhead protection areas, and other water sources that are vital in a region); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Tundra, coral reefs, or rain forests; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Involve genetically engineered organisms, synthetic biology, governmentally designated noxious weeds, or invasive species, unless the proposed activity would be contained or confined in a manner designed and operated to prevent unauthorized release into the environment and conducted in accordance with applicable requirements, such as those of the Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Institutes of Health.</p><p class="depth0">B1.

Custodial services are activities to preserve facility appearance, working conditions, and sanitation (such as cleaning, window washing, lawn mowing, trash collection, painting, and snow removal). Routine maintenance activities, corrective (that is, repair), preventive, and predictive, are required to maintain and preserve buildings, structures, infrastructures, and equipment in a condition suitable for a facility to be used for its designated purpose. Such maintenance may occur as a result of severe weather (such as hurricanes, floods, and tornados), wildfires, and other such events. Routine maintenance may result in replacement to the extent that replacement is in-kind and is not a substantial upgrade or improvement. In-kind replacement includes installation of new components to replace outmoded components, provided that the replacement does not result in a significant change in the expected useful life, design capacity, or function of the facility. Routine maintenance does not include replacement of a major component that significantly extends the originally intended useful life of a facility (for example, it does not include the replacement of a reactor vessel near the end of its useful life). Routine maintenance activities include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Repair or replacement of facility equipment, such as lathes, mills, pumps, and presses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Door and window repair or replacement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Wall, ceiling, or floor repair or replacement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Reroofing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Plumbing, electrical utility, lighting, and telephone service repair or replacement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Routine replacement of high-efficiency particulate air filters;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Inspection and/or treatment of currently installed utility poles;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Repair of road embankments;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Repair or replacement of fire protection sprinkler systems;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Road and parking area resurfacing, including construction of temporary access to facilitate resurfacing, and scraping and grading of unpaved surfaces;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Erosion control and soil stabilization measures (such as reseeding, gabions, grading, and revegetation);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Surveillance and maintenance of surplus facilities in accordance with DOE Order 435.1, ``Radioactive Waste Management,'' or its successor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Repair and maintenance of transmission facilities, such as replacement of conductors of the same nominal voltage, poles, circuit breakers, transformers, capacitors, crossarms, insulators, and downed powerlines, in accordance, where appropriate, with 40 CFR part 761 (Polychlorinated Biphenyls Manufacturing, Processing, Distribution in Commerce, and Use Prohibitions) or its successor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Routine testing and calibration of facility components, subsystems, or portable equipment (such as control valves, in-core monitoring devices, transformers, capacitors, monitoring wells, lysimeters, weather stations, and flumes);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Routine decontamination of the surfaces of equipment, rooms, hot cells, or other interior surfaces of buildings (by such activities as wiping with rags, using strippable latex, and minor vacuuming), and removal of contaminated intact equipment and other material (not including spent nuclear fuel or special nuclear material in nuclear reactors); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> Removal of debris.</p><p class="depth0">B1.4 Air conditioning systems for existing equipment</p><p class="depth0">Installation or modification of air conditioning systems required for temperature control for operation of existing equipment.</p><p class="depth0">B1.5 Existing steam plants and cooling water systems</p><p class="depth0">Minor improvements to existing steam plants and cooling water systems (including, but not limited to, modifications of existing cooling towers and ponds), provided that the improvements would not: (1) Create new sources of water or involve new receiving waters; (2) have the potential to significantly alter water withdrawal rates; (3) exceed the permitted temperature of discharged water; or (4) increase introductions of, or involve new introductions of, hazardous substances, pollutants, contaminants, or CERCLA-excluded petroleum and natural gas products.</p><p class="depth0">B1.6 Tanks and equipment to control runoff and spills</p><p class="depth0">Installation or modification of retention tanks or small (normally under one acre) basins and associated piping and pumps for existing operations to control runoff or spills (such as under 40 CFR part 112).
