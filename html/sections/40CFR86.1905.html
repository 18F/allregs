                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must test in-use engines from the families we select. We may select the following number of engine families for testing, except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We may select up to 25 percent of your engine families in any calendar year, calculated by dividing the number of engine families you certified in the model year corresponding to the calendar year by four and rounding to the nearest whole number. We will consider only engine families with annual U.S.-directed production volumes above 1,500 units in calculating the number of engine families subject to testing each calendar year under the annual 25 percent engine family limit. In addition, for model year 2007 through 2009, identical engine families that are split into two subfamilies under Sec. 86.007-15(m)(9) will count as only one engine family. If you have only three or fewer families that each exceed an annual U.S.-directed production volume of 1,500 units, or if you

have no engine families above this limit, we may select one engine family per calendar year for testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Over any four-year period, we will not select more than the average number of engine families that you have certified over that four-year period (the model year when the selection is made and the preceding three model years), based on rounding the average value to the nearest whole number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If there is clear evidence of a nonconformity with regard to an engine family, we may select that engine family without counting it as a selected engine family under paragraph (a) of this section. We will consult with you in reaching a conclusion whether clear evidence of a nonconformity exists for any engine family. In general, there is clear evidence of a nonconformity regarding an engine family under this subpart in any of the following cases:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The engine family was not remedied but is a carry-over from an engine family you tested under this subpart and was subsequently remedied based at least in part on the Phase 1 or Phase 2 testing outcomes described in Sec. 86.1915.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The engine family was not remedied but is a carry-over from an engine family that was remedied based on an EPA in-use testing program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We may select any individual engine family for testing, regardless of its production volume, as long as we do not select more than the number of engine families described in paragraph (a) of this section. We may select an engine family from the current model year or any previous model year, except that we will not select any engine families from model years before 2007 beginning in the following calendar years:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 2007 for all emissions testing other than PM testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 2011 for PM testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must complete all the required testing and reporting under this subpart within 18 months after we direct you to test a particular engine family. We will typically select engine families for testing and notify you in writing by June 30 of the applicable calendar year. You may ask for up to six months longer to complete Phase 2 testing if there is a reasonable basis for needing more time. In very unusual circumstances you may request an additional six months to complete Phase 2 testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If you make a good-faith effort to access enough test vehicles to complete Phase 1 or Phase 2 testing requirements under this subpart for an engine family, but are unable to do so, you must ask us either to modify the testing requirements for the selected engine family or, in the case of Phase 1 testing, to select a different engine family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> After you complete the in-use testing requirements for an engine family that we selected for testing in a given calendar year, we may select that same family in a later year to evaluate the engine family's compliance closer to the end of its useful life. This would count as an additional engine-family selection under paragraph (a) of this section, except as described in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For any communication related to this subpart, contact the Engine Programs Group Manager (6405-J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.
