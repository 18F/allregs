                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A State may draw cash for the authorized types of assistance from the Fund described in Sec. 35.3525 according to the following rules:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Loans--(1) Eligible project costs. A State may draw cash based on the proportionate Federal share of incurred project costs. In the case of incurred planning and design and associated pre-project costs, cash may be drawn immediately upon execution of the loan agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Eligible project reimbursement costs. A State may draw cash to reimburse assistance recipients for eligible project costs at a rate no greater than equal amounts over the maximum number of quarters that capitalization grant payments are made. A State may immediately draw cash for up to 5 percent of each fiscal year's capitalization grant or 2 million dollars, whichever is greater, to reimburse project costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Refinance or purchase of local debt obligations--(1) Completed projects. A State may draw cash up to the portion of the capitalization grant committed to the refinancing or purchase of local debt obligations of municipal, intermunicipal, or interstate agencies at a rate no greater than equal amounts over the maximum number of quarters that capitalization grant payments are made. A State may immediately draw cash for up to 5 percent of each fiscal

year's capitalization grant or 2 million dollars, whichever is greater, to refinance or purchase local debt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Portions of projects not completed. A State may draw cash based on the proportionate Federal share of incurred project costs according to the rule for loans in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Purchase of incremental disbursement bonds from local governments. A State may draw cash based on a schedule that coincides with the rate at which costs are expected to be incurred for the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Purchase insurance for local debt obligations. A State may draw cash for the proportionate Federal share of insurance premiums as they are due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Guarantee for local debt obligations--(1) In the event of default. In the event of imminent default in debt service payments on a guaranteed local debt, a State may draw cash immediately up to the total amount of the capitalization grant that is dedicated for the guarantee. If a balance remains after the default is satisfied, the State must negotiate a revised cash draw schedule for the remaining amount dedicated for the guarantee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the absence of default. A State may draw cash up to the amount of the capitalization grant dedicated for the guarantee based on actual incurred project costs. The amount of the cash draw would be based on the proportionate Federal share of incurred project costs multiplied by the ratio of the guarantee reserve to the amount guaranteed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Revenue or security for Fund debt obligations (leveraging)--(1) In the event of default. In the event of imminent default in debt service payments on a secured debt, a State may draw cash immediately up to the total amount of the capitalization grant that is dedicated for the security. If a balance remains after the default is satisfied, the State must negotiate a revised schedule for the remaining amount dedicated for the security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the absence of default. A State may draw cash up to the amount of the capitalization grant dedicated for the security using either of the following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All projects method. A State may draw cash based on the incurred project costs multiplied by the ratio of the Federal portion of the reserve to the total reserve multiplied by the ratio of the total reserve to the net bond proceeds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Group of projects method. A State may identify a group of projects whose cost is approximately equal to the total of that portion of the capitalization grant and the State match dedicated as a security. The State may then draw cash based on the incurred costs of the selected projects only, multiplied by the ratio of the Federal portion of the security to the entire security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Aggressive leveraging. Where the cash draw rules in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section would significantly frustrate a State's leveraged program, EPA may permit an exception to these cash draw rules and provide for a more accelerated cash draw. A State must demonstrate that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> There are eligible projects ready to proceed in the immediate future with enough costs to justify the amount of the secured bond issue;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The absence of cash on an accelerated basis will substantially delay these projects;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Fund will provide substantially more assistance if accelerated cash draws are allowed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The long-term viability of the State program to meet drinking water needs will be protected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Loans to privately-owned systems. In cases where State monies cannot be used to provide loans to privately-owned systems, a State may draw 100 percent Federal monies for costs incurred by privately-owned systems. When Federal monies are drawn for incurred costs, the State must deposit or have previously deposited into the Fund the required match associated with the amount of cash drawn. Every 18 months, the State must submit documentation showing that it has met its proportionate Federal share within the last 6 months. If a State is unable to document that it has met its proportionate Federal share, State match deposited into the Fund must be expended before Federal monies are drawn for costs incurred by publicly-

owned systems until the State meets its proportionate Federal share.</p>
