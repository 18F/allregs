                                Sec. 19.9-3  Computation and payment of pension to former spouse.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A pension to a former spouse is paid monthly on the same date  that annuity is paid to the principal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A pension to a former spouse not fixed by a spousal agreement or  court order shall equal the former spouse's pro rata share of 50 percent  of the annuity to which the principal is entitled on the date the  divorce becomes final, or, if not then entitled to an annuity, 50  percent of the annuity to which the principal first becomes entitled  following that date. A pension to a former spouse of a disability  annuitant shall be calculated on the basis of an annuity for which the  participant would qualify if not disabled. A pension to a former spouse  will be increased by the same percentage of each cost-of-living  adjustment received by the principal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Department will initiate payment of a pension to a former  spouse after complying with the notification and other procedures  described in Sec. 19.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a pension can not be paid because a former spouse is missing,  the principal may file an affidavit with PER/ER/RET that he/she does not  know the whereabouts of the former spouse. In such an event, the  principal and the Department will follow the procedures in Sec. 19.11-4  in an effort to locate the former spouse. The annuity of the principal  will be reduced by the amount of the pension to the former spouse even  though the latter is not being paid. If the former spouse has not been  located during the 12-month period following the date the principal  files an affidavit under this section, the annuity of the principal will  be recomputed effective from its commencing date (or on the date  following the last month a pension payment was made to the former  spouse) and paid without reduction of the amount of pension to the  former spouse. If the former spouse subsequently is located, pension  payments to him/her will be initiated at that time at the rate that  would have been payable had they been paid continuously from the  original effective date. The Department shall not be liable to make any  pension payments to the former spouse for the missing period if the  procedures under this section were faithfully complied with nor will the  Department be responsible for recovering any payments made to the  principal for the benefit of the former spouse.</p>
