The applicable cost principles (see  Sec. 33.22) contain requirements for prior approval of certain types of  costs. Except where waived, those requirements apply to all grants and  subgrants even if paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section do not.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Budget changes--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Nonconstruction projects. Except as stated  in other regulations or an award document, grantees or subgrantees shall  obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the  following changes is anticipated under a nonconstruction award:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any revision which would result in the need for additional  funding.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unless waived by the awarding agency, cumulative transfers  among direct cost categories, or, if applicable, among separately  budgeted programs, projects, functions, or activities which exceed or  are expected to exceed ten percent of the current total approved budget,  whenever the awarding agency's share exceeds $100,000.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (i.e., from  direct payments to trainees to other expense categories).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Construction projects. Grantees and subgrantees shall obtain  prior written approval for any budget revision which would result in the  need for additional funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Combined construction and nonconstruction projects. When a grant  or subgrant provides funding for both construction and nonconstruction  activities, the grantee or subgrantee must obtain prior written approval  from the awarding agency before making any   fund or budget transfer from nonconstruction to construction or vice  versa.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Programmatic changes. Grantees or subgrantees must obtain the  prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following  actions is anticipated:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any revision of the scope or objectives of the project  (regardless of whether there is an associated budget revision requiring  prior approval).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Need to extend the period of availability of funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Changes in key persons in cases where specified in an  application or a grant award.

The grantee will promptly review such request  and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing. A grantee will  not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with  the purpose or terms and conditions of the Federal grant to the grantee.
