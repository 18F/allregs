                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Space station operators must measure the co-polarized and cross- polarized performance of space station antennas through in-orbit testing  and submit the measurement data to the Commission upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Within 15 days after completing in-orbit testing of a space  station licensed under this part, the operator must notify the  Commission that such testing has been completed and certify that the  space station's measured performance is consistent with the station  authorization and that the space station is capable of using its  assigned frequencies or inform the Commission of any discrepancy. The  licensee must also indicate in the filing whether the space station has  been placed in the assigned geostationary orbital location or non- geostationary orbit. If the licensee files a certification pursuant to  this paragraph before the space station has been placed in its assigned  orbit or orbital location, the licensee must separately notify the  Commission that the space station has been placed in such orbit or  orbital location within 3 days after such placement and that the  station's measured performance is consistent with the station  authorization.
