                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Fair housing and equal opportunity in home financing is  a policy of the United States established by Federal statutes and  Presidential orders and proclamations. In furtherance of the Federal  civil rights laws and the economical home financing purposes of the  statutes administered by the Office, the Office has adopted, in part 528  of this chapter, nondiscrimination regulations that, among other things,  prohibit arbitrary refusals to consider loan applications on the basis  of the age or location of a dwelling, and prohibit discrimination based  on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status (having one or  more children under the age of 18), marital status, age (provided the  person has the capacity to contract), or national origin in fixing the  amount, interest rate, duration, application procedures, collection or  enforcement procedures, or other terms or conditions of housing related  loans. Such discrimination is also prohibited in the purchase of loans  and securities. This section provides supplementary guidelines to aid  savings associations in developing and implementing nondiscriminatory  lending policies. Each savings association should reexamine its  underwriting standards at least annually in order to ensure equal  opportunity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Loan underwriting standards. The basic purpose of the Office's  nondiscrimination regulations is to require that every applicant be  given an equal opportunity to obtain a loan. Each loan applicant's  creditworthiness should be evaluated on an individual basis without  reference to presumed characteristics of a group. The use of lending  standards which have no economic basis and which are discriminatory in  effect is a violation of law even in the absence of an actual intent to  discriminate. However, a standard which has a discriminatory effect is  not necessarily improper if its use achieves a genuine business need  which cannot be achieved by means which are not discriminatory in effect  or less discriminatory in effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Discriminatory practices--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Discrimination on the basis of sex  or marital status. The Civil Rights Act of 1968 and the National Housing  Act prohibit discrimination in lending on the basis of sex. The Equal  Credit Opportunity Act, in addition to this prohibition, forbids  discrimination on the basis of marital status. Refusing to lend to,  requiring higher standards of creditworthiness of, or imposing different  requirements on, members of one sex or individuals of one marital  status, is discrimination based on sex or marital status. Loan  underwriting decisions must be based on an applicant's credit history  and present and reasonably foreseeable economic prospects, rather than  on the basis of assumptions regarding comparative differences in  creditworthiness between married and unmarried individuals, or between  men and women.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Discrimination on the basis of language. Requiring fluency in  the English language as a prerequisite for obtaining a loan may be a  discriminatory practice based on national origin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Income of husbands and wives. A practice of discounting all or  part of either spouse's income where spouses apply jointly is a  violation of section 527 of the National Housing Act. As with other  income, when spouses apply jointly for a loan, the determination as to  whether a spouse's income qualifies for credit purposes should depend  upon a reasonable evaluation of his or her past, present, and reasonably  foreseeable economic circumstances. Information relating to child- bearing intentions of a couple or an individual may not be requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Supplementary income. Lending standards which consider as  effective only the non-overtime income of the primary wage-earner may  result in discrimination because they do not take account of variations  in employment patterns among individuals and families. The Office favors  loan underwriting which reasonably evaluates the credit worthiness of  each applicant based on a realistic appraisal of his or her own past,  present, and foreseeable economic circumstances. The determination as to  whether primary income or additional income qualifies as   effective for credit purposes should depend upon whether such income may  reasonably be expected to continue through the early period of the  mortgage risk. Automatically discounting other income from bonuses,  overtime, or part-time employment, will cause some applicants to be  denied financing without a realistic analysis of their credit  worthiness. Since statistics show that minority group members and low-  and moderate-income families rely more often on such supplemental  income, the practice may be racially discriminatory in effect, as well  as artificially restrictive of opportunities for home financing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Applicant's prior history. Loan decisions should be based upon a  realistic evaluation of all pertinent factors respecting an individual's  creditworthiness, without giving undue weight to any one factor. The  savings association should, among other things, take into consideration  that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In some instances, past credit difficulties may have resulted  from discriminatory practices;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A policy favoring applicants who previously owned homes may  perpetuate prior discrimination;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A current, stable earnings record may be the most reliable  indicator of credit-worthiness, and entitled to more weight than factors  such as educational level attained;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Job or residential changes may indicate upward mobility; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Preferring applicants who have done business with the lender can  perpetuate previous discriminatory policies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Income level or racial composition of area. Refusing to lend or  lending on less favorable terms in particular areas because of their  racial composition is unlawful. Refusing to lend, or offering less  favorable terms (such as interest rate, downpayment, or maturity) to  applicants because of the income level in an area can discriminate  against minority group persons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Age and location factors. Sections 528.2, 528.2a, and 528.3 of  this chapter prohibit loan denials based upon the age or location of a  dwelling. These restrictions are intended to prohibit use of unfounded  or unsubstantiated assumptions regarding the effect upon loan risk of  the age of a dwelling or the physical or economic characteristics of an  area. Loan decisions should be based on the present market value of the  property offered as security (including consideration of specific  improvements to be made by the borrower) and the likelihood that the  property will retain an adequate value over the term of the loan.  Specific factors which may negatively affect its short-range future  value (up to 3-5 years) should be clearly documented. Factors which in  some cases may cause the market value of a property to decline are  recent zoning changes or a significant number of abandoned homes in the  immediate vicinity of the property. However, not all zoning changes will  cause a decline in property values, and proximity to abandoned buildings  may not affect the market value of a property because of rehabilitation  programs or affirmative lending programs, or because the cause of  abandonment is unrelated to high risk. Proper underwriting  considerations include the condition and utility of the improvements,  and various physical factors such as street conditions, amenities such  as parks and recreation areas, availability of public utilities and  municipal services, and exposure to flooding and land faults. However,  arbitrary decisions based on age or location are prohibited, since many  older, soundly constructed homes provide housing opportunities which may  be precluded by an arbitrary lending policy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Fair Housing Act (title VIII, Civil Rights Act of 1968, as  amended). Savings associations, must comply with all regulations  promulgated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to  implement the Fair Housing Act, found at 24 CFR part 100 et seq., except  that they shall use the Equal Housing Lender logo and poster prescribed  by Office regulations at 12 CFR 528.4 and 528.5 rather than the Equal  Housing Opportunity logo and poster required by 24 CFR parts 109 and  110.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Marketing practices. Savings associations should review their  advertising and marketing practices to ensure that their services are  available without discrimination to the community they serve.  Discrimination in lending is not limited to loan decisions   and underwriting standards; a savings association does not meet its  obligations to the community or implement its equal lending  responsibility if its marketing practices and business relationships  with developers and real estate brokers improperly restrict its  clientele to segments of the community. A review of marketing practices  could begin with an examination of an association's loan portfolio and  applications to ascertain whether, in view of the demographic  characteristics and credit demands of the community in which the  institution is located, it is adequately serving the community on a  nondiscriminatory basis. The Office will systematically review marketing  practices where evidence of discrimination in lending is discovered.  [54 FR 49666, Nov. 30, 1989, as amended at 60 FR 66870, Dec. 27, 1995.
