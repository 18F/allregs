The alternates will serve, in the order of the number of votes received, as acting members of the county committee, in case of the temporary absence of a member, or to become a member of the county committee in that same order elected in case of the resignation, disqualification, removal, or death of a member. In other words, the candidate receiving the most votes will be elected as the committee member, and the candidates receiving the second and third most votes, if there are multiple candidates, will be elected as first and second alternates, respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An alternate serving as an acting member of the county committee will have the same duties, responsibilities, and authority as a regular member of such committee. In the event an alternate fills a permanent vacancy on the county committee, such person will assume the remainder of the unexpired term of the county committee member who was replaced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The election must be conducted in all counties by mail or other distribution of ballots in accordance with the Uniform Guidelines, except that the Deputy Administrator may authorize use of the meeting or polling place method in any county where such exception is deemed justified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Elections will be by secret ballot with each eligible voter allowed to cast one vote and having the option of writing in the name of a candidate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Failure to elect alternates at the regular election will not invalidate such election or require a special election to elect alternates.</p>
