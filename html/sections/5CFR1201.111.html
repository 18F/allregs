The agency may  decline to return the appellant to his or her place of employment if it  determines that the return or presence of the appellant will be unduly  disruptive to the work environment. However, pay and benefits must be  provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An initial decision that orders interim relief shall include a  section which will provide the appellant specific notice that the relief  ordered in the decision must be provided by the agency effective as of  the date of the decision if a party files a petition for review. If the  relief ordered in the initial decision requires the agency to effect an  appointment, the notice required by this section will so state, will  specify the title and grade of the appointment, and will specifically  advise the appellant of his right to receive pay and benefits while any  petition for review is pending, even if the agency   determines that the appellant's return to or presence in the workplace  would be unduly disruptive.
