                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Principal. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in these  regulations or applicable statutes, the amount of any loan may not  exceed 80 percent of actual cost, as such term is described in Sec.  253.16; provided that the Program may approve an amount that is less, in  accordance with its credit determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interest rate. Each loan's annual interest rate will be 2  percent greater than the U.S. Department of Treasury's cost of borrowing  public funds of an equivalent maturity at the time the loan closes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ability and experience requirements. An obligor and the majority  of its principals must demonstrate the ability, experience, resources,  character, reputation, and other qualifications the Program deems  necessary for successfully operating the project property and protecting  the Program's interest in the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Lending restrictions. Unless it can document that unique or  extraordinary circumstances exist, the Program will not provide  financing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For venture capital purposes; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To an applicant who cannot document successful fishing industry  ability and experience of a duration, degree, and nature that the  Program deems necessary to successfully repay the requested loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Income and expense projections. The Program, using conservative  income and expense projections for the project property's operation,  must determine that projected net earnings can service all debt,  properly maintain the project property, and protect the Program's  interest against risks of loss, including the industry's cyclical  economics.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Working capital. The Program must determine that a project has  sufficient initial working capital to achieve net earnings projections,  fund all foreseeable contingencies, and protect the Program's interest  in the project. In making its determination, the Program will use a  conservative assessment of an applicant's financial condition, and at  the Program's discretion, some portion of projected working capital  needs may be met by something other than current assets minus  liabilities (i.e., by a line or letter of credit, non-current assets  readily capable of generating working capital, a guarantor with  sufficient financial resources, etc.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Audited financial statements. Audited financial statements will  ordinarily be required for any obligor with large or financially complex  operations, as determined by the program, whose financial condition the  Program believes cannot be otherwise assessed with reasonable certainty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Consultant services. Expert consulting services may be necessary  to help the Program assess a project's economic, technical, or financial  feasibility. The Program will notify the applicant if an expert is  required. The Program will select and employ the necessary consultant,  but require the applicant to reimburse the Program for any fees charged  by the consultant. In the event that an application requires expert  consulting services, the loan will not be closed until the applicant  fully reimburses the Program for the consulting fees. This cost may, at  the Program's discretion, be included in the amount of the note. For a  declined application, the Program may reimburse itself from the  application fee as described in Sec. 253.12, including any portion  known as the commitment fee that could otherwise be refunded to the  applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Property inspections. The Program may require adequate condition  and valuation inspection of all property used as collateral as the basis  for assessing the property's worth and suitability for lending. The  Program may also require these at specified periods during the life of  the loan. These must be conducted by competent and impartial inspectors  acceptable to the Program. Inspection cost(s) will be at an applicant's  expense. Those occurring before application approval may be included in  actual cost, as actual cost is described in Sec. 253.16.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Collateral. The Program shall have first lien(s) on all primary  project property pledged as collateral. The Program, at its discretion,  may request additional collateral and will consider any additional  collateral in its credit determinations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> No additional liens. All primary project property pledged as  collateral,   including any additional collateral, shall be free of additional liens,  unless the Program, at the request of the applicant, expressly waives  this requirement in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> General FFP credit standards apply. Unless explicitly stated  otherwise in these rules, all FFP direct lending is subject to the above  general credit standards and requirements found in Sec. Sec. 253.12  through 253.30. The Program may adjust collateral, guarantee and other  requirements to reflect individual credit risks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Adverse legal proceedings. The Program, at its own discretion,  may decline or hold in abeyance any loan approval or disbursement(s) to  any applicant found to have outstanding lawsuits, citations, hearings,  liabilities, appeals, sanctions or other pending actions whose negative  outcome could significantly impact, in the opinion of the Program, the  financial circumstances of the applicant.</p>
