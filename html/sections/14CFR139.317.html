                            <p class="depth0">Unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator, the following rescue and firefighting equipment and agents are the minimum required for the Indexes referred to in Sec. 139.315:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Index A. One vehicle carrying at least--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 500 pounds of sodium-based dry chemical, halon 1211, or clean agent; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 450 pounds of potassium-based dry chemical and water with a commensurate quantity of AFFF to total 100 gallons for simultaneous dry chemical and AFFF application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Index B. Either of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One vehicle carrying at least 500 pounds of sodium-based dry chemical, halon 1211, or clean agent and 1,500 gallons of water and the commensurate quantity of AFFF for foam production.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Two vehicles--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> One vehicle carrying the extinguishing agents as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> One vehicle carrying an amount of water and the commensurate quantity of AFFF so the total quantity of water for foam production carried by both vehicles is at least 1,500 gallons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Index C. Either of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Three vehicles--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> One vehicle carrying the extinguishing agents as specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Two vehicles carrying an amount of water and the commensurate quantity of AFFF so the total quantity of water for foam production carried by all three vehicles is at least 3,000 gallons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Two vehicles--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> One vehicle carrying the extinguishing agents as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> One vehicle carrying water and the commensurate quantity of AFFF so the total quantity of water for foam production carried by both vehicles is at least 3,000 gallons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Index D. Three vehicles--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One vehicle carrying the extinguishing agents as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Two vehicles carrying an amount of water and the commensurate quantity of AFFF so the total quantity of water for foam production carried by all three vehicles is at least 4,000 gallons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Index E. Three vehicles--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One vehicle carrying the extinguishing agents as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Two vehicles carrying an amount of water and the commensurate quantity of AFFF so the total quantity of water for foam production carried by all three vehicles is at least 6,000 gallons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Foam discharge capacity. Each aircraft rescue and firefighting vehicle used to comply with Index B, C, D, or E requirements with a capacity of at least 500 gallons of water for foam production must be equipped with a turret. Vehicle turret discharge capacity must be as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each vehicle with a minimum-rated vehicle water tank capacity of at least 500 gallons, but less than 2,000 gallons, must have a turret discharge rate of at least 500 gallons per minute, but not more than 1,000 gallons per minute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each vehicle with a minimum-rated vehicle water tank capacity of at least 2,000 gallons must have a turret discharge rate of at least 600 gallons per minute, but not more than 1,200 gallons per minute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Agent discharge capacity. Each aircraft rescue and firefighting vehicle that is required to carry dry chemical, halon 1211, or clean agent for compliance with the Index requirements of this section must meet one of the following minimum discharge rates for the equipment installed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Dry chemical, halon 1211, or clean agent through a hand line--5 pounds per second.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Dry chemical, halon 1211, or clean agent through a turret--16 pounds per second.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Extinguishing agent substitutions. Other extinguishing agent substitutions authorized by the Administrator may be made in amounts that provide equivalent firefighting capability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> AFFF quantity requirements. In addition to the quantity of water required, each vehicle required to carry AFFF must carry AFFF in an appropriate amount to mix with twice the water required to be carried by the vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Methods and procedures. FAA Advisory Circulars contain methods and procedures for ARFF equipment and extinguishing agents that are acceptable to the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Implementation. Each holder of a Class II, III, or IV Airport Operating Certificate must implement the requirements of this section no later than 36 consecutive calendar months after June 9, 2004.
