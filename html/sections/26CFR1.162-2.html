                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Traveling expenses include travel fares, meals and lodging, and  expenses incident to travel such as expenses for sample rooms, telephone  and telegraph, public stenographers, etc. Only such traveling expenses  as are reasonable and necessary in the conduct of the taxpayer's  business and directly attributable to it may be deducted. If the trip is  undertaken for other than business purposes, the travel fares and  expenses incident to travel are personal expenses and the meals and  lodging are living expenses. If the trip is solely on business, the  reasonable and necessary traveling expenses, including travel fares,  meals and lodging, and expenses incident to travel, are business  expenses. For the allowance of traveling expenses as deductions in  determining adjusted gross income, see section 62(2)(B) and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a taxpayer travels to a destination and while at such  destination engages in both business and personal activities, traveling  expenses to and from such destination are deductible only if the trip is  related primarily to the taxpayer's trade or business. If the trip is  primarily personal in nature, the traveling expenses to and from the  destination are not deductible even though the taxpayer engages in  business activities while at such destination. However, expenses while  at the destination which are properly allocable to the taxpayer's trade  or business are deductible even though the traveling expenses to and  from the destination are not deductible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether a trip is related primarily to the taxpayer's trade or  business or is primarily personal in nature depends on the facts and  circumstances in each case. The amount of time during the period of the  trip which is spent on personal activity compared to the   amount of time spent on activities directly relating to the taxpayer's  trade or business is an important factor in determining whether the trip  is primarily personal. If, for example, a taxpayer spends one week while  at a destination on activities which are directly related to his trade  or business and subsequently spends an additional five weeks for  vacation or other personal activities, the trip will be considered  primarily personal in nature in the absence of a clear showing to the  contrary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where a taxpayer's wife accompanies him on a business trip,  expenses attributable to her travel are not deductible unless it can be  adequately shown that the wife's presence on the trip has a bona fide  business purpose. The wife's performance of some incidental service does  not cause her expenses to qualify as deductible business expenses. The  same rules apply to any other members of the taxpayer's family who  accompany him on such a trip.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Expenses paid or incurred by a taxpayer in attending a  convention or other meeting may constitute an ordinary and necessary  business expense under section 162 depending upon the facts and  circumstances of each case. No distinction will be made between self- employed persons and employees. The fact that an employee uses vacation  or leave time or that his attendance at the convention is voluntary will  not necessarily prohibit the allowance of the deduction. The allowance  of deductions for such expenses will depend upon whether there is a  sufficient relationship between the taxpayer's trade of business and his  attendance at the convention or other meeting so that he is benefiting  or advancing the interests of his trade or business by such attendance.  If the convention is for political, social or other purposes unrelated  to the taxpayer's trade or business, the expenses are not deductible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Commuters' fares are not considered as business expenses and are  not deductible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For rules with respect to the reporting and substantiation of  traveling and other business expenses of employees for taxable years  beginning after December 31, 1957, see Sec. 1.162-17.</p>
