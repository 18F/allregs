                            <p class="depth0">For the purposes of this regulation, the following definitions shall apply:</p><p class="depth0">Authorization--for Federal-aid projects authorization to the STD by the FHWA, or for direct Federal projects authorization to the utility by the FHWA, to proceed with any phase of a project. The date of authorization establishes the date of eligibility for Federal funds to participate in the costs incurred on that phase of work.</p><p class="depth0">Betterment--any upgrading of the facility being relocated that is not attributable to the highway construction and is made solely for the benefit of and at the election of the utility.</p><p class="depth0">Cost of relocation--the entire amount paid by or on behalf of the utility properly attributable to the relocation after deducting from that amount any increase in value of the new facility, and any salvage derived from the old facility.</p><p class="depth0">Cost of Removal--the amount expended to remove utility property including the cost of demolishing, dismantling, removing, transporting, or otherwise disposing of utility property and of cleaning up to leave the site in a neat and presentable condition.</p><p class="depth0">Cost of salvage--the amount expended to restore salvaged utility property to usable condition after its removal.</p><p class="depth0">Direct Federal projects--highway projects such as projects under the Federal Lands Highways Program which are under the direct administration of the FHWA.</p><p class="depth0">Indirect or overhead costs--those costs which are not readily identifiable with one specific task, job, or work order. Such costs may include indirect labor, social security taxes, insurance, stores expense, and general office expenses. Costs of this nature generally are distributed or allocated to the applicable job or work orders, other accounts and other functions to which they relate. Distribution and allocation is made on a uniform basis which is reasonable, equitable, and in accordance with generally accepted cost accounting practices.</p><p class="depth0">Relocation--the adjustment of utility facilities required by the highway project. It includes removing and reinstalling the facility, including necessary temporary facilities, acquiring necessary right-of-way on the new location, moving, rearranging or changing the type of existing facilities and taking any necessary safety and protective measures. It shall also mean constructing a replacement facility that is both functionally equivalent to the existing facility and necessary for continuous operation of the utility service, the project economy, or sequence of highway construction.</p><p class="depth0">Salvage value--the amount received from the sale of utility property that has been removed or the amount at which the recovered material is charged to the utility's accounts, if retained for reuse.</p><p class="depth0">State transportation department--the transportation department of one of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico.</p><p class="depth0">Transportation department(TD)--that department, commission, board, or official of any State or political subdivison thereof, charged by its law with the responsibility for highway administration.</p><p class="depth0">Use and occupancy agreement--the document (written agreement or permit) by which the TD approves the use and occupancy of highway right-of-way by utility facilities or private lines.</p><p class="depth0">Utility--a privately, publicly, or cooperatively owned line, facility or system for producing, transmitting, or distributing communications, cable television, power, electricity, light, heat,

gas, oil, crude products, water, steam, waste, storm water not connected with highway drainage, or any other similar commodity, including any fire or police signal system or street lighting system, which directly or indirectly serves the public. The term utility shall also mean the utility company inclusive of any wholly owned or controlled subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0">Work order system--a procedure for accumulating and recording into separate accounts of a utility all costs to the utility in connection with any change in its system or plant.
