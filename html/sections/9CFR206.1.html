                            <p class="depth0">The definitions in this section apply to the regulations in this  part. The definitions in this section do not apply to other regulations  issued under the Packers and Stockyards Act (P&S; Act) or to the P&S; Act  as a whole.</p><p class="depth0">Accrual account. (Synonymous with the term ``ledger,'' as defined in  this section.) An account held by a packer on behalf of a producer that  accrues a running positive or negative balance as a result of a pricing  determination included in a contract that establishes a minimum and/or  maximum level of base price paid. Credits and/or debits for amounts  beyond these minimum and/or maximum levels are entered into the account.  Further, the contract   specifies how the balance in the account affects producer and packer  rights and obligations under the contract.</p><p class="depth0">Base price. The price paid for swine before the application of any  premiums or discounts, expressed in dollars per unit.</p><p class="depth0">Boar. A sexually-intact male swine.</p><p class="depth0">Ceiling price. The maximum market price that will be paid for swine.  Adjustments may be made to the base price if the market price rises  above this price.</p><p class="depth0">Contract. Any agreement, whether written or verbal, between a packer  and a producer for the purchase of swine for slaughter, except a  negotiated purchase (as defined in this section).</p><p class="depth0">Contract type. The classification of contracts or risk management  agreements for the purchase of swine committed to a packer, by the  determination of the base price and the presence or absence of an  accrual account or ledger (as defined in this section). The contract  type categories are:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Swine or pork market formula purchases with a ledger,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Swine or pork market formula purchases without a ledger,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Other market formula purchases with a ledger,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Other market formula purchases without a ledger,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> Other purchase arrangements with a ledger, and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(6)</em> Other purchase arrangements without a ledger.</p><p class="depth0">Floor price. The minimum market price that will be paid for swine.  Adjustments may be made to the base price if the market price falls  below this price.</p><p class="depth0">Formula price. A price determined by a mathematical formula under  which the price established for a specified market serves as the basis  for the formula.</p><p class="depth0">Ledger. (Synonymous with ``accrual account,'' as defined in this  section.) An account held by a packer on behalf of a producer that  accrues a running positive or negative balance as a result of a pricing  determination included in a contract that establishes a minimum and/or  maximum level of base price paid. Credits and/or debits for amounts  beyond these minimum and/or maximum levels are entered into the account.  Further, the contract specifies how the balance in the account affects  producer and packer rights and obligations under the contract.</p><p class="depth0">Negotiated purchase. A purchase, commonly known as a ``cash'' or  ``spot market'' purchase, of swine by a packer from a producer under  which:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The buyer-seller interaction that results in the transaction and  the agreement on actual base price occur on the same day; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The swine are scheduled for delivery to the packer not later  than 14 days after the date on which the swine are committed to the  packer.</p><p class="depth0">Noncarcass merit premium or discount. An increase or decrease in the  price for the purchase of swine made available by an individual packer  or packing plant, based on any factor other than the characteristics of  the carcass, if the actual amount of the premium or discount is known  before the purchase and delivery of the swine.</p><p class="depth0">Other market formula purchase. A purchase of swine by a packer in  which the pricing determination is a formula price based on any market  other than the markets for swine, pork, or a pork product. This includes  a formula purchase where the price formula is based on one or more  futures or options contracts.</p><p class="depth0">Other purchase arrangement. A purchase of swine by a packer that is  not a negotiated purchase, swine or pork market formula purchase, or  other market formula purchase, and does not involve packer-owned swine.  This contract type includes long term contract agreements, fixed price  contracts, cost of production formulas, and formula purchases with a  floor, window or ceiling price.</p><p class="depth0">Packer. Any person engaged in the business of buying swine in  commerce for purposes of slaughter, of manufacturing or preparing meats  or meat food products from swine for sale or shipment in commerce, or of  marketing meats or meat food products from swine in an unmanufactured  form, acting as a wholesale broker, dealer, or   distributor in commerce. The regulations in this part apply only to a  packer that meets the conditions in either paragraph (1) or (2) of this  definition:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> A packer purchasing at least 100,000 swine per year and  slaughtering swine at one or more federally inspected processing plants  that meet either of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> A swine processing plant that slaughtered an average of at least  100,000 head of swine per year during the immediately preceding 5  calendar years, with the average based on those periods in which the  plant slaughtered swine; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> A swine processing plant that did not slaughter swine during  the immediately preceding 5 calendar years that has the capacity to  slaughter at least 100,000 swine per year, based on plant capacity  information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Any packer purchasing an average of at least 200,000 sows,  boars, or any combination thereof, per year and slaughtering at least  200,000 sows, boars, or any combination thereof at one or more federally  inspected processing plants during the immediately preceding 5 calendar  years, with the average based on those periods in which the plant  slaughtered swine.</p><p class="depth2">Producer. Any person engaged, either directly or through an  intermediary, in the business of selling swine to a packer for slaughter  (including the sale of swine from a packer to another packer).</p><p class="depth2">Sow.

A porcine animal raised to be a feeder pig, raised for  seedstock, or raised for slaughter.</p><p class="depth2">Swine or pork market formula purchase. A purchase of swine by a  packer in which the pricing mechanism is a formula price based on a  market for swine, pork, or pork product, other than any formula purchase  with a floor, window or ceiling price, or a futures or option contract  for swine, pork, or a pork product.</p><p class="depth2">Window price. The range of market prices that will be paid for  swine. Adjustments may be made to the base price if the market prices  fall outside this range. The window price contains both the floor and  ceiling prices.</p>
