We make Federally administered State recognition payments on a monthly basis and we include them in the same check as your SVB payment. The State recognition payment is for the same month as your SVB payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Maximum amount. Except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, there is no restriction on the amount of a State recognition payment that SSA will administer on behalf of a State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Minimum amount. SSA will not administer State recognition payments in amounts less than $1 per month. Hence, recognition payment amounts of less than $1 will be raised to a dollar.</p>
