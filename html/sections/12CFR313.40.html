                            <p class="depth0">These salary offset regulations are issued in compliance with 5  U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, and apply to the collection  of debts owed by employees of the FDIC or other federal agencies. These  salary offset procedures do not apply where an employee consents to the  recovery of a debt from his current pay account. These procedures do not  apply to debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code, the tariff laws  of the United States or to any case where collection of a debt by salary  offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute  (e.g., travel advances under 5 U.S.C. 5705 and employee training  expenses under 5 U.S.C. 4108). These procedures do not preclude an  employee from requesting waiver of an erroneous payment under 5 U.S.C.  5584, or in any way questioning the amount or validity of a debt, in the  manner specified by law or these agency regulations. This section also  does not preclude an employee from requesting waiver of the collection  of a debt under any other applicable statutory authority. When possible,  salary offset through centralized administrative offset procedures  should be attempted before seeking salary offset from a paying agency  different than the creditor agency.</p>
