                            <p class="depth0">These salary offset regulations are issued in compliance with 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, and apply to the collection of debts owed by employees of the FDIC or other federal agencies. These salary offset procedures do not apply where an employee consents to the recovery of a debt from his current pay account. These procedures do not apply to debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code, the tariff laws of the United States or to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute (e.g., travel advances under 5 U.S.C. 5705 and employee training expenses under 5 U.S.C. 4108). These procedures do not preclude an employee from requesting waiver of an erroneous payment under 5 U.S.C. 5584, or in any way questioning the amount or validity of a debt, in the manner specified by law or these agency regulations. This section also does not preclude an employee from requesting waiver of the collection of a debt under any other applicable statutory authority. When possible, salary offset through centralized administrative offset procedures should be attempted before seeking salary offset from a paying agency different than the creditor agency.</p>
