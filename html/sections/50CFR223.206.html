                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Permits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Scientific research, education, zoological  exhibition, or species enhancement permits. The Assistant Administrator  may issue permits authorizing activities which would otherwise be  prohibited under Sec.  223.205(a) for scientific or educational  purposes, for zoological exhibition, or to enhance the propagation or  survival of threatened species of sea turtles, in accordance with and  subject to the conditions of part 222, subpart C--General Permit  Procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Incidental-take permits. The Assistant Administrator may issue  permits authorizing activities that would otherwise be prohibited under  Sec.  223.205(a) in accordance with section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act (16  U.S.C. 1539(a)(1)(B)), and in accordance with, and subject to, the  implementing regulations in part 222 of this chapter. Such permits may  be issued for the incidental taking of threatened and endangered species  of sea turtles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exception for injured, dead, or stranded specimens. If any  member of any threatened species of sea turtle is found injured, dead,  or stranded, any agent or employee of the National Marine Fisheries  Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, or any  other Federal land or water management agency, or any agent or employee  of a state agency responsible for fish and wildlife who is designated by  his or her agency for such purposes, may, when acting in the course of  his or her official duties, take such specimens without a permit if such  taking is necessary to aid a sick, injured, or stranded specimen or  dispose of a dead specimen or salvage a dead specimen which may be  useful for scientific study. Whenever possible, live specimens shall be  returned to their aquatic environment as soon as possible. Every action  shall be reported in writing to the Assistant Administrator within 30  days, and reports of further occurrence shall be made as deemed  appropriate by the Assistant Administrator until the specimen is either  returned to its environment or disposed of. Reports shall be mailed by  registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Assistant  Administrator and shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Name and position of the official or employee involved;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Description of the specimen(s) involved;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Date and location of disposal;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Circumstances requiring the action;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Method of disposal;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Disposition of the specimen(s), including, where the specimen(s)  has been retained in captivity, a description of the place and means of  confinement, and the measures taken for its maintenance and care; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Such other information as the Assistant Administrator may  require.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> of the Act, designated by his or her agency for such  purposes, may, when acting in the course of his or her official duties,  take any threatened species to carry out scientific research or  conservation programs. All such takings shall be reported within 30 days  of the taking to the Assistant Administrator who may request additional  reports of the taking and research at the Assistant Administrator's  discretion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(11)</em> of this section, or in  compliance with the terms and conditions of an incidental take permit  issued pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Handling and resuscitation requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any specimen taken  incidentally during the course of fishing or scientific research  activities must be handled with due care to prevent injury to live  specimens, observed for activity, and returned to the water according to  the following procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Sea turtles that are actively moving or determined to be dead as  described in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section must be released  over the stern of the boat. In addition, they must be released only when  fishing or scientific collection gear is not in use, when the engine  gears are in neutral position, and in areas where they are unlikely to  be recaptured or injured by vessels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Resuscitation must be attempted on sea turtles that are  comatose, or inactive, as determined in paragraph (d)(1) of this  section, by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Placing the turtle on its bottom shell (plastron) so that the  turtle is right side up and elevating its hindquarters at least 6 inches  (15.2 cm) for a period of 4 up to 24 hours. The amount of the elevation  depends on the size of the turtle; greater elevations are needed for  larger turtles. Periodically, rock the turtle gently left to right and  right to left by holding the outer edge of the shell (carapace) and  lifting one side about 3 inches (7.6 cm) then alternate to the other  side. Gently touch the eye and pinch the tail (reflex test) periodically  to see if there is a response.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sea turtles being resuscitated must be shaded and kept damp or  moist but under no circumstance be placed into a container holding  water. A water-soaked towel placed over the head, carapace, and flippers  is the most effective method in keeping a turtle moist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Sea turtles that revive and become active must be released over  the stern of the boat only when fishing or scientific collection gear is  not in use, when the engine gears are in neutral position, and in areas  where they are unlikely to be recaptured or injured by vessels. Sea  turtles that fail to respond to the reflex test or fail to move within 4  hours (up to 24, if possible) must be returned to the water in the same  manner as that for actively moving turtles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A turtle is determined to be dead if the muscles are stiff  (rigor mortis) and/or the flesh has begun to rot; otherwise the turtle  is determined to be comatose or inactive and resuscitation attempts are  necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In addition to the provisions of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this  section, a person aboard a vessel in the Atlantic, including the  Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, that has pelagic or bottom  longline gear on board and that has been issued, or is required to have,  a limited access permit for highly migratory species under Sec.  635.4  of this title, must comply with the handling and release requirements  specified in Sec.  635.21 of this title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any specimen taken incidentally during the course of fishing  or scientific research activities must not be consumed, sold, landed,  offloaded, transshipped, or kept below deck.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Gear requirements for trawlers--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> TED requirement for shrimp  trawlers. Any shrimp trawler that is in the Atlantic Area or Gulf Area  must have an approved TED installed in each net that is rigged for  fishing. A net is rigged for fishing if it is in the water, or if it is  shackled, tied, or otherwise connected to any trawl door or board, or to  any tow rope, cable, pole or extension, either on board or attached in  any manner to the shrimp trawler. Exceptions to the TED requirement for  shrimp trawlers are provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exemptions from the TED requirement--(A) Alternative tow-time  restrictions. A shrimp trawler is exempt from the TED requirements of  paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section if it complies with the alternative  tow-time restrictions in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section and if it:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Has on board no power or mechanical-advantage trawl retrieval  system (i.e., any device used to haul any part of the net aboard);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is a bait shrimper that retains all live shrimp on board with a  circulating seawater system, if it does not possess more than 32 lb.  (14.5 kg) of dead shrimp on board, if it has a valid original state  bait-shrimp license, and if the state license allows the licensed vessel  to participate in the bait shrimp fishery exclusively;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Has only a pusher-head trawl, skimmer trawl, or wing net rigged  for fishing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Is in an area during a period for which tow-time restrictions  apply under paragraphs (d)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section, if it  complies with all applicable provisions imposed under those paragraphs;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Is using a single test net (try net) with a headrope length of  12 ft (3.6 m) or less and with a footrope length of 15 ft (4.6 m) or  less, if it is pulled immediately in front of another net or is not  connected to another net in any way, if no more than one test net is  used at a time, and if it is not towed as a primary net, in which case  the exemption   under this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) applies to the test net.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exempted gear or activities. The following fishing gear or  activities are exempted from the TED requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(i)  of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A beam or roller trawl, if the frame is outfitted with rigid  vertical bars, and if none of the spaces between the bars, or between  the bars and the frame, exceeds 4 inches (10.2 cm); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A shrimp trawler fishing for, or possessing, royal red shrimp,  if royal red shrimp constitutes at least 90 percent (by weight) of all  shrimp either found on board, or offloaded from that shrimp trawler.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(B)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any approved hard TED or special hard TED installed in a summer  flounder trawl must be installed in a TED extension. The TED extension  is a cylindrical piece of webbing distinct from the main trawl's body,  wings, codend, and any other net extension(s). The TED extension must be  constructed of webbing no larger than 3.5 inch (8.9 cm) stretched mesh.  The TED extension must extend at least 24 inches (61.0 cm) but not more  than 36 inches (91.4 cm) forward of the leading edge of the TED and aft  of the trailing edge of the grid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exemptions from the TED requirement. Any summer flounder trawler  north of 35[deg]46.1[min] N. lat. (Oregon Inlet, NC) from January 15  through March 15 annually is exempt from the TED requirement of  paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, unless the Assistant  Administrator determines that TED use is necessary to protect sea  turtles or ensure compliance, pursuant to the procedures of paragraph  (d)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Monitoring. Summer flounder trawlers must carry onboard a NMFS- approved observer if requested by the Southeast Regional Administrator  or the Northeast Regional Administrator. A written notification will be  sent to the address specified for the vessel in either the NMFS or state  fishing permit application, or to the address specified for registration  or documentation purposes, or upon written notification otherwise served  on the owner or operator of the vessel. Owners and operators must comply  with the terms and conditions specified in such written notification.  All NMFS-approved observers will report any violations of this section,  or other applicable regulations and laws. Information collected by  observers may be used for enforcement purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Additional sea turtle conservation measures. The Assistant  Administrator may impose other such restrictions upon summer flounder  trawlers as the Assistant Administrator deems necessary or appropriate  to protect sea turtles and ensure compliance, pursuant to the procedures  of paragraph (d)(4) of this section. Such measures may include, but are  not limited to, a requirement to use TEDs in areas other than summer  flounder fishery-sea turtle protection area, a requirement to use  limited tow-times, and closure of the fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Tow-time restrictions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Duration of tows. If tow-time  restrictions are utilized pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii), (d)(3)(ii),  or (d)(3)(iii) of this section, a shrimp trawler must limit tow times.  The tow time is measured from the time that the trawl door enters the  water until it is removed from the water. For a trawl that is not  attached to a door, the tow time is measured from the time the codend  enters the water until it is removed from the water. Tow times may not  exceed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> 55 minutes from April 1 through October 31; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> 75 minutes from November 1 through March 31.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Alternative--special environmental conditions. The Assistant  Administrator may allow compliance with tow-time restrictions, as an  alternative to   the TED requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, if the  Assistant Administrator determines that the presence of algae, seaweed,  debris or other special environmental conditions in a particular area  makes trawling with TED-equipped nets impracticable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Substitute--ineffectiveness of TEDs. The Assistant  Administrator may require compliance with tow-time restrictions, as a  substitute for the TED requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this  section, if the Assistant Administrator determines that TEDs are  ineffective in protecting sea turtles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Notice; applicability; conditions. The Assistant Administrator  will publish notification concerning any tow-time restriction imposed  under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section in the Federal  Register and will announce it in summary form on channel 16 of the  marine VHF radio. A notification of tow-time restrictions will include  findings in support of these restrictions as an alternative to, or as  substitute for, the TED requirements. The notification will specify the  effective dates, the geographic area where tow-time restrictions apply,  and any applicable conditions or restrictions that the Assistant  Administrator determines are necessary or appropriate to protect sea  turtles and ensure compliance, including, but not limited to, a  requirement to carry observers, to register vessels in accordance with  procedures at paragraph (d)(5) of this section, or for all shrimp  trawlers in the area to synchronize their tow times so that all trawl  gear remains out of the water during certain times. A notification  withdrawing tow-time restrictions will include findings in support of  that action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Procedures. The Assistant Administrator will consult with the  appropriate fishery officials (state or Federal) where the affected  shrimp fishery is located in issuing a notification concerning tow-time  restrictions. An emergency notification can be effective for a period of  up to 30 days and may be renewed for additional periods of up to 30 days  each if the Assistant Administrator finds that the conditions  necessitating the imposition of tow-time restrictions continue to exist.  The Assistant Administrator may invite comments on such an action, and  may withdraw or modify the action by following procedures similar to  those for implementation. The Assistant Administrator will implement any  permanent tow-time restriction through rulemaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Limitations on incidental takings during fishing activities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Limitations. The exemption for incidental takings of sea turtles in  paragraph (d) of this section does not authorize incidental takings  during fishing activities if the takings:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Would violate the restrictions, terms, or conditions of an  incidental take statement or biological opinion;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Would violate the restrictions, terms, or conditions of an  incidental take permit; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> May be likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a species  listed under the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determination; restrictions on fishing activities. The  Assistant Administrator may issue a determination that incidental  takings during fishing activities are unauthorized. Pursuant thereto,  the Assistant Administrator may restrict fishing activities in order to  conserve a species listed under the Act, including, but not limited to,  restrictions on the fishing activities of vessels subject to paragraph  (d)(2) of this section. The Assistant Administrator will take such  action if the Assistant Administrator determines that restrictions are  necessary to avoid unauthorized takings that may be likely to jeopardize  the continued existence of a listed species. The Assistant Administrator  may withdraw or modify a determination concerning unauthorized takings  or any restriction on fishing activities if the Assistant Administrator  determines that such action is warranted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Notice; applicability; conditions. The Assistant Administrator  will publish a notification of a determination concerning unauthorized  takings or a notification concerning the restriction of fishing  activities in the Federal Register. The Assistant Administrator will  provide as much advance notice as possible, consistent with the  requirements of the Act, and will announce the notification in summary  form on channel 16 of the marine VHF radio.   Notification of a determination concerning unauthorized takings will  include findings in support of that determination; specify the fishery,  including the target species and gear used by the fishery, the area, and  the times, for which incidental takings are not authorized; and include  such other conditions and restrictions as the Assistant Administrator  determines are necessary or appropriate to protect sea turtles and  ensure compliance. Notification of restriction of fishing activities  will include findings in support of the restriction, will specify the  time and area where the restriction is applicable, and will specify any  applicable conditions or restrictions that the Assistant Administrator  determines are necessary or appropriate to protect sea turtles and  ensure compliance. Such conditions and restrictions may include, but are  not limited to, limitations on the types of fishing gear that may be  used, tow-time restrictions, alteration or extension of the periods of  time during which particular tow-time requirements apply, requirements  to use TEDs, registration of vessels in accordance with procedures at  paragraph (d)(5) of this section, and requirements to provide observers.  Notification of withdrawal or modification will include findings in  support of that action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Procedures. The Assistant Administrator will consult with the  appropriate fisheries officials (state or Federal) where the fishing  activities are located in issuing notification of a determination  concerning unauthorized takings or notification concerning the  restriction of fishing activities. An emergency notification will be  effective for a period of up to 30 days and may be renewed for  additional periods of up to 30 days each, except that emergency  placement of observers will be effective for a period of up to 180 days  and may be renewed for an additional period of 60 days. The Assistant  Administrator may invite comments on such action, and may withdraw or  modify the action by following procedures similar to those for  implementation. The Assistant Administrator will implement any permanent  determination or restriction through rulemaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)-(6)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Restrictions applicable to gillnet fisheries in North Carolina.  No person may fish with gillnet fishing gear which has a stretched mesh  size larger than 4 \1/4\ inches (10.8 cm), annually from September 1  through December 15, in the inshore waters of Pamlico Sound, North  Carolina, and all contiguous tidal waters, bounded on the north by  35[deg]46.3[min] N. lat., on the south by 35[deg]00[min] N. lat., and on  the west by 76[deg]30[min] W. long.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Restrictions applicable to large mesh gillnet fisheries in the  mid-Atlantic region. No person may fish with or possess on board a boat,  any gillnet with a stretched mesh size 7-inches (17.8 cm) or larger,  unless such gillnets are covered with canvas or other similar material  and lashed or otherwise securely fastened to the deck or the rail, and  all buoys larger than 6-inches (15.2 cm) in diameter, high flyers, and  anchors are disconnected. This restriction applies in the Atlantic  Exclusive Economic Zone (as defined in 50 CFR 600.10) during the  following time periods and in the following area:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Waters north of 33[deg]51.0[min] N.
