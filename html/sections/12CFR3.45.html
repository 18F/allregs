A national bank or Federal savings association must make

any applicable adjustment to the protection amount of an eligible guarantee or credit derivative as required in Sec. 3.36(d), (e), and (f) for any hedged securitization exposure. In the context of a synthetic securitization, when an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative covers multiple hedged exposures that have different residual maturities, the national bank or Federal savings association must use the longest residual maturity of any of the hedged exposures as the residual maturity of all hedged exposures.
