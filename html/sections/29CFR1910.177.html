Truck and Bus Tires,'' and ``Multi-piece Rim Matching Chart.'' Interested parties can download and print both the manuals and posters from OSHA's Web site at http://www.osha.gov/publications (and type ``tire chart'' in the search field). However, when used by the employer at a worksite to provide information to employees, the printed posters must be, at a minimum, 2 feet wide and 3 feet long. Copies of the manual also are available from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA Office of Publications, Room N-3101, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210; telephone: (202) 693-1888; or fax: (202) 693-2498).
