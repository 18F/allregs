                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> RFP for nonattainment areas classified pursuant to Sec.  51.1103. The RFP requirements specified in CAA section 182 for that  area's classification shall apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submission deadline. For each area classified as Moderate or  higher pursuant to Sec. 51.1103, the state shall submit a SIP revision  no later than 36 months after the effective date of designation as  nonattainment for the 2008 ozone NAAQS that provides for RFP as  described in paragraphs (a)(2) through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> RFP requirements for areas with an approved 1-hour or 1997 ozone  NAAQS 15 percent VOC ROP plan. An area classified as Moderate or higher  that has the same boundaries as an area, or is entirely composed of  several areas or portions of areas, for which EPA fully approved a 15  percent plan for the 1-hour or 1997 ozone NAAQS is considered to have  met the requirements of CAA section 182(b)(1) for the 2008 ozone NAAQS  and instead:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If classified as Moderate or higher, the area is subject to the  RFP requirements under CAA section 172(c)(2) and shall submit a SIP  revision that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Provides for a 15 percent emission reduction from the baseline  year within 6 years after the baseline year;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Provides for an additional emissions reduction of 3 percent per  year from the end of the first 6 years up to the beginning of the  attainment year if a baseline year earlier than 2011 is used; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em>.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If classified as Serious or higher, the area is also subject to  RFP under CAA section 182(c)(2)(B) and shall submit a SIP revision no  later than 48 months after the effective date of designation providing  for an average emissions reduction of 3 percent per year:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For all remaining 3-year periods after the first 6-year period  until the year of the area's attainment date; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> of this section. Use of NOX emissions reductions must  meet the criteria in CAA section 182(c)(2)(C).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> or (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The state shall not distinguish between the portion of the area  with a previously approved 15 percent ROP plan and the portion of the  area without such a plan, and shall meet the requirements of (a)(4) of  this section for the entire nonattainment area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The state shall treat the area as two parts, each with a  separate RFP target as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For the portion of the area without an approved 15 percent VOC  ROP plan for the 1-hour or 1997 ozone NAAQS, the state shall submit a  SIP revision as required under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For the portion of the area with an approved 15 percent VOC ROP  plan for the 1-hour or 1997 ozone NAAQS, the state shall submit a SIP as  required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> ROP Requirements for areas without an approved 1-hour or 1997  ozone NAAQS 15 percent VOC ROP plan. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For each area, the state shall  submit a SIP revision consistent with CAA section 182(b)(1). The 6-year  period referenced in CAA section 182(b)(1) shall begin January 1 of the  year following the year used for the baseline emissions inventory.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For Moderate areas, the plan must provide for an additional 3  percent per year reduction from the end of the first 6 years up to the  beginning of the attainment year if a baseline year from 2008 to 2010 is  used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For each area classified as Serious or higher, the state shall  submit a SIP revision consistent with CAA section 182(c)(2)(B). The  final increment of progress must be achieved no later than the  attainment date for the area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Creditability of emission control measures for RFP plans. Except  as specifically provided in CAA section 182(b)(1)(C) and (D), CAA  section 182(c)(2)(B), and 40 CFR 51.1110(a)(6), all emission reductions  from SIP-approved or federally promulgated measures that occur after the  baseline emissions inventory year are creditable for purposes of the RFP  requirements in this section, provided the reductions meet the  requirements for creditability, including the need to be enforceable,  permanent, quantifiable, and surplus.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Creditability of out-of-area emissions reductions. For each area  classified as Moderate or higher pursuant to Sec. 51.1103, in addition  to the restrictions on the creditability of emission control measures  listed in Sec. 51.1110(a)(5), creditable emission reductions for fixed  percentage reduction RFP must be obtained from sources within the  nonattainment area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Calculation of non-creditable emissions reductions. The  following four categories of control measures listed in CAA section  182(b)(1)(D) are no longer required to be calculated for exclusion in  RFP analyses because the Administrator has determined that due to the  passage of time the effect of these exclusions would be de minimis:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Measures related to motor vehicle exhaust or evaporative  emissions promulgated by January 1, 1990;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Regulations concerning Reid vapor pressure promulgated by  November 15, 1990;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Measures to correct previous RACT requirements; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Measures required to correct previous I/M programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Baseline emissions inventory for RFP plans. For the RFP plans  required under this section, at the time of designation for the 2008  ozone NAAQS the baseline emissions inventory shall be the emissions  inventory for the most recent calendar year for which a complete  triennial inventory is required to be submitted to EPA under the  provisions of subpart A of this part. States may use an alternative  baseline emissions inventory provided the state demonstrates why it is  appropriate to use the alternative baseline year, and provided that the  year selected is between the years 2008 to 2012. All states associated  with a multi-state nonattainment area must consult and agree on a single  alternative baseline year. The emissions values included in the  inventory required by this section shall be actual ozone season day  emissions as defined by Sec. 51.1100(cc).
