                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Emissions limits and work practice standards. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each  copper concentrate dryer, you must not discharge to the atmosphere from  the dryer vent any gases that contain total particulate matter (PM) in  excess of 0.022 grains per dry standard cubic foot (gr/dscf).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> During periods when copper ore concentrate feed is charged to  and smelted to form molten copper matte and slag layers in the smelting  vessel, you must exhaust the process off gas from the smelting vessel to  a gas cleaning system controlling PM and to a sulfuric acid plant prior  to discharge to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> During periods when no copper ore concentrate feed is charged  to the smelting vessel but the smelting vessel remains in operation to  temporarily hold molten material in the vessel before resuming copper  production, you must exhaust the process off gas from the smelting  vessel to an electrostatic precipitator, wet scrubber, or baghouse prior  to discharge to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must operate a capture system that collects the gases and  fumes released when copper matte or slag is   tapped from the smelting vessel. The design and placement of this  capture system must be such that the tapping port opening, launder, and  receiving vessel (e.g., ladle, slag pot) are positioned within the  confines or influence of the capture system's ventilation draft during  those times when the copper matte or slag is flowing from the tapping  port opening.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere from the  capture system used to comply with paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section  any gases that contain total PM in excess of 0.022 gr/dscf.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em> through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must operate a primary capture system that collects the  process off gas vented when one or more batch copper converters are  blowing. If you operate a batch copper converter that does not use a  ``U''-shaped side flue located at one end of the converter, then the  capture system design must include use of a primary hood that covers the  entire mouth of each batch copper converter vessel when the copper  converter is positioned for blowing. The capture system may use multiple  intake and duct segments through which the ventilation rates are  controlled independently of each other.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you operate a batch copper converter that does not use a  ``U''-shaped side flue located at one end of the converter, then you  must operate a secondary capture system that collects gases and fumes  released from the batch copper converter when the converter mouth is  rotated out partially or totally from within the confines or influence  of the primary capture system's ventilation draft during charging,  skimming, pouring, or holding. The capture system design must use  additional hoods (e.g., sliding secondary hoods, air curtain hoods) or  other capture devices (e.g., building evacuation systems). The capture  system may use multiple intake and duct segments through which the  ventilation rates are controlled independently of each other, and  individual duct segments may be connected to separate PM control  devices.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You must exhaust the process off gas captured by the primary  capture system that is used to comply with paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this  section to a gas cleaning system controlling PM and to a sulfuric acid  plant prior to discharge to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For each secondary capture system that is used to comply with  paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section and is not vented to a gas cleaning  system controlling PM and a sulfuric acid plant, you must not cause to  be discharged to the atmosphere any gases that contain total particulate  matter in excess of 0.02 grains/dscf.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Monitoring requirements for electrostatic precipitators. To  monitor the performance of each electrostatic precipitator used to  comply with the PM emissions limits in paragraph (a) of this section,  you must use a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) that is  installed at the outlet of each electrostatic precipitator or a common  duct at the outlet of multiple electrostatic precipitators.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each COMS must meet Performance Specification 1 in 40 CFR part  60, appendix B.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> through (v) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must automatically (intrinsic to the opacity monitor) check  the zero and upscale (span) calibration drifts at least once daily. For  a particular COMS, the acceptable range of zero and upscale calibration  materials is as defined in the applicable version of Performance  Specification 1 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix B.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must adjust the zero and span whenever the 24-hour zero  drift or 24-hour span drift exceeds 4 percent opacity. The COMS must  allow for the amount of excess zero and span drift measured at the 24- hour interval checks to be recorded and quantified. The optical surfaces  exposed to the effluent gases must be cleaned prior to performing the  zero and span drift adjustments, except for systems using automatic zero  adjustments. For systems using automatic zero adjustments, the optical  surfaces must be cleaned when the cumulative automatic zero compensation  exceeds 4 percent opacity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You must apply a method for producing a simulated zero opacity  condition and an upscale (span) opacity condition using a certified  neutral density filter or other related technique to produce a known  obscuration of the light beam. All procedures applied must provide a  system check of the analyzer internal optical surfaces and all  electronic circuitry including the lamp and photodetector assembly.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Except during periods of system breakdowns, repairs,  calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments, the COMS must be in  continuous operation and must complete a minimum of one cycle of  sampling and analyzing for each successive 10 second period and one  cycle of data recording for each successive 6-minute period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> You must reduce all data from the COMS to 6-minute averages.  Six-minute opacity averages must be calculated from 36 or more data  points equally spaced over each 6-minute period. Data recorded during  periods of system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and  span adjustments must not be included in the data averages. An  arithmetic or integrated average of all data may be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must evaluate opacity measurements from the COMS on a 24- hour rolling average excluding periods of startup, shutdown, and  malfunction. If the 24-hour rolling average opacity exceeds 15 percent,  you must initiate investigation of the relevant controls or equipment  within 24 hours of the first discovery of the high opacity incident and,  if necessary, take corrective action as soon as practicable to adjust or  repair the controls or equipment to reduce the opacity average to below  the 15 percent level.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must log in ink or electronic format and maintain a record  of 24-hour opacity measurements performed in accordance with paragraph  (b)(3) of this section and any corrective actions taken, if any. A  record of corrective actions taken must include the date and time during  which the 24-hour rolling average opacity exceeded 15 percent and the  date, time and type of the corrective action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (4) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must install, calibrate, maintain, and continuously operate  a bag leak detection system for the baghouse to monitor the baghouse  performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> through (v) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The bag leak detection system must be certified by the  manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at  concentrations that can effectively discern any dysfunctional leaks of  the baghouse.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of  relative or absolute particulate matter loadings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm  system that will sound automatically when an increase in relative  particulate emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be  located where it is easily heard by plant operating personnel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The bag leak detection system must be installed downstream of  the baghouse.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The bag leak detection system must be installed, operated,  calibrated, and maintained in a manner consistent with the  manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations. The  calibration of the system must, at a minimum, consist of establishing  the relative baseline output level by adjusting the sensitivity and the  averaging period of the device and establishing the alarm set points and  the alarm delay time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the bag leak detection system alarm sounds, you must initiate  investigation of the baghouse within 24 hours of the first discovery of  the alarm and, if necessary, take corrective action as soon as  practicable to adjust or repair the baghouse to minimize possible  exceedances of the applicable PM emissions limits in paragraph (a) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must log in ink or electronic format and maintain a record  of installation, calibration, maintenance, and   operation of the bag leak detection system. If the bag leak detection  system alarm sounds, the records must include an identification of the  date and time of all bag leak detection alarms, their cause, and an  explanation of the corrective actions taken, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Alternative monitoring requirements for baghouses. As an  alternative to the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section for bag  leak detection systems, you must monitor the performance of each  baghouse used to comply with a PM emissions limit in paragraph (a) of  this section using a COMS that is installed at the outlet on the  baghouse or a common duct at the outlet of multiple baghouses. Each COMS  must meet the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Performance testing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must demonstrate initial compliance  with the applicable PM emissions limits in paragraph (a) of this section  based on the results of a performance test for each affected source.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You may certify initial compliance for an affected source based  on the results of a previous performance test conducted within the past  12 months before your compliance date.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you have not conducted a performance test to demonstrate  compliance with the applicable emissions limits within the past 12  months before your compliance date, you must conduct a performance test  within 180 days of your compliance date and report the results in your  notification of compliance status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must demonstrate subsequent compliance with the applicable  PM emissions limits in paragraph (a) of this section based on the  results of repeat performance tests conducted at least every 2.5 years  for each affected source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> through (v) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Method 1 or 1A (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to select sampling  port locations and the number of traverse points in each stack or duct.  Sampling sites must be located at the outlet of the control device (or  at the outlet of the emissions source if no control device is present)  prior to any releases to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to  determine the volumetric flow rate of the stack gas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Method 3, 3A, or 3B (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to determine  the dry molecular weight of the stack gas. You may use ANSI/ASME PTC  19.10-1981, ``Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses'' (incorporated by  reference--see Sec. 63.14) as an alternative to EPA Method 3B.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Method 4 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to determine the moisture  content of the stack gas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Method 5 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to determine the PM  concentration for negative pressure baghouses or Method 5D (40 CFR part  60, appendix A) for positive pressure baghouses. A minimum of three  valid test runs are needed to comprise a PM performance test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Operation and maintenance requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At all times,  including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, you must to the  extent practicable, maintain and operate any affected source, including  associated air pollution control equipment, in a manner consistent with  good air pollution control practice for minimizing emissions.  Determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures  are being used will be based on information available to the permitting  authority which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results,  opacity observations, review of operating and maintenance procedures,  and inspection of the source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All pollution control equipment must be installed, maintained,  and operated properly. Instructions from the vendor or established  maintenance practices that maximize pollution control must be followed.  All necessary equipment control and operating devices, such as pressure  gauges, amp meters, volt meters, flow rate indicators, temperature  gauges, continuous emissions monitor, etc., must be installed, operated  properly and easily accessible to compliance inspectors. A copy of all  manufacturers' operating instructions for pollution control equipment  and pollution emitting equipment must be maintained at your facility  site. These instructions must be available to all   employees who operate the equipment and must be made available to the  permitting authority upon request. Maintenance records must be made  available to the permitting authority upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must document the activities performed to assure proper  operation and maintenance of the air pollution control equipment and  monitoring systems or devices. Records of these activities must be  maintained as required by the permitting authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em> through (iii) of this section. For the  purpose of complying with this paragraph, an emergency situation is any  situation arising from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events beyond  the control of the facility owner or operator that requires immediate  corrective action to restore normal operation and that causes the  affected source to exceed applicable emission limitation under this  subpart due to unavoidable increases in emissions attributable to the  emergency. An emergency must not include noncompliance to the extent it  is caused by improperly designed equipment, lack of preventive  maintenance, careless or improper operation, or operator error.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> During the period of the emergency you must implement all  reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that exceeded the  emission standards or other applicable requirements in this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must document through signed contemporaneous logs or other  relevant evidence that an emergency occurred and you can identify the  probable cause, your facility was being operated properly at the time  the emergency occurred, and the corrective actions taken to minimize  emissions as required by paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You must submit a notice of the emergency to the permitting  authority within two working days of the time when emission limitations  were exceeded due to the emergency (or an alternate timeframe acceptable  to the permitting authority). This notice must contain a description of  the emergency, any steps taken to mitigate emissions, and corrective  actions taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> As an alternative to the requirements in paragraph (f)(4) of  this section, you must comply with the startup, shutdown, and  malfunction requirements in 40 CFR 63.6(e)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Recordkeeping requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must maintain records of the  occurrence and duration of any startup, shutdown, or malfunction in the  operation of an affected source subject to this subpart; any malfunction  of the air pollution control equipment; or any periods during which a  continuous monitoring system or monitoring device is inoperative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must maintain a file of all measurements, including  continuous monitoring system, monitoring device, and performance testing  measurements; all continuous monitoring system performance evaluations;  all continuous monitoring system or monitoring device calibration  checks; adjustments and maintenance performed on these systems or  devices; and all other information required by this section recorded in  a permanent form suitable for inspection. The file must be retained for  at least 5 years following the date of such measurements, maintenance,  reports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Reporting requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must prepare and submit to the  permitting authority an excess emissions and monitoring systems  performance report and summary report every calendar quarter. A less  frequent reporting interval may used for either report as approved by  the permitting authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The magnitude of excess emissions computed, any conversion  factor(s) used, and the date and time of commencement and completion of  each time period of excess emissions. The process operating time during  the reporting period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Specific identification of each period of excess emissions that  occurs during startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions of the affected  facility.
