                            <p class="depth0">NS/EP planning in government and industry with respect to effective  conservation and use of surviving telecommunications resources in a  disaster, emergency or postattack period must provide for orderly and  uninhibited restoration of services by the carriers and authoritative  control of services allocation which will assure that priority will be  afforded the most critical needs of government and the private sector  with respect to these objectives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The preservation of the integrity of characteristics and  capabilities of the Nation's telecommunications systems and networks  during wartime or non-wartime emergencies is of the utmost importance.  This can best be accomplished by centralized policy development,  planning, and broad direction. Detailed operations management will  remain decentralized in order to retain flexibility in the use of  individual systems in responding to the needs of national security,  survival and recovery. Each Federal agency responsible for  telecommunications systems operations, and the carriers, are responsible  for planning with respect to emergency operations. Guidance in this  matter has been issued from a number of sources and contained in:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Annex C-XI (Telecommunications), Federal Emergency Plan D  (Classified).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> National Plan for Telecommunications Support in Non-wartime  Emergencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The National Communications System Management Plan for Annex  C-XI (Telecommunications) Federal Emergency Plan D (Classified).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The continuity of essential communications services will be  maintained through the use of controls and operational procedures to  assure that priority is given to vital services. NS/EP  telecommunications services entail policies, procedures and  responsibilities as described in parts 211 and 213 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Nation's telecommunications systems facilities are  vulnerable to physical and radiological damage. Planning factors with  respect to the resumption of services in a disaster or postattack period  must consider the probable loss of facilities which formerly provided  direct and/or alternate intercity services among surviving population  centers. Since surviving areas and population centers would serve as the  sources of support to crippled areas of the Nation, the resumption of  services between and among surviving metropolitan areas will be a high  priority with the carriers.</p>
