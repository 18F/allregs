                            <p class="depth0">A proprietor may produce spirits from any suitable material in accordance with the proprietor's statements of production procedure in the notice of registration. Materials from which alcohol will not be produced may be used in production only if the use of the materials is described in the approved statements of production procedure. The distillation of nonpotable chemical mixtures as described in Sec. 19.36 will be deemed to be the original and continuous distillation of the spirits in such mixtures and to constitute the production of spirits.
