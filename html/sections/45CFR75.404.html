                            <p class="depth0">A cost is reasonable if, in its nature and amount, it does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person under the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision was

made to incur the cost. The question of reasonableness is particularly important when the non-Federal entity is predominantly federally-funded. In determining reasonableness of a given cost, consideration must be given to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whether the cost is of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the operation of the non-Federal entity or the proper and efficient performance of the Federal award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The restraints or requirements imposed by such factors as: Sound business practices; arm's-length bargaining; Federal, state, local, tribal, and other laws and regulations; and terms and conditions of the Federal award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Market prices for comparable goods or services for the geographic area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whether the individuals concerned acted with prudence in the circumstances considering their responsibilities to the non-Federal entity, its employees, where applicable its students or membership, the public at large, and the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Whether the non-Federal entity significantly deviates from its established practices and policies regarding the incurrence of costs, which may unjustifiably increase the Federal award's cost.</p>
