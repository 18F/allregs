Excessive compensation.</p><p class="depth0">B. Compensation leading to material financial loss.</p><p class="depth0">I. Introduction</p><p class="depth0">i. Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act \1\ (FDI Act)  requires each Federal banking agency (collectively, the agencies) to  establish certain safety and soundness standards by regulation or by  guideline for all insured depository institutions. Under section 39, the  agencies must establish three types of standards: (1) Operational and  managerial standards; (2) compensation standards; and (3) such standards  relating to asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation as they  determine to be appropriate. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C.  1831p-1) was added by section 132 of the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), Pub. L. 102-242, 105 Stat.  2236 (1991), and amended by section 956 of the Housing and Community  Development Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102-550, 106 Stat. 3895 (1992) and  section 318 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory  Improvement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-325, 108 Stat. 2160 (1994). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">ii. Section 39(a) requires the agencies to establish operational and  managerial standards relating to: (1) Internal controls, information  systems and internal audit systems, in accordance with section 36 of the  FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1831m); (2) loan documentation; (3) credit  underwriting; (4) interest rate exposure; (5) asset growth; and (6)  compensation, fees, and benefits, in accordance with subsection (c) of  section 39. Section 39(b) requires the agencies to establish standards  relating to asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation that the  agencies determine to be appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Section 39(c) requires the agencies to establish standards  prohibiting as an unsafe and unsound practice any compensatory  arrangement that would provide any executive officer, employee,  director, or principal shareholder of the institution with excessive  compensation, fees or benefits and any compensatory arrangement that  could lead to material financial loss to an institution. Section 39(c)  also requires that the agencies establish standards that specify when  compensation is excessive.</p><p class="depth0">iv. If an agency determines that an institution fails to meet any  standard established by guideline under subsection (a) or (b) of section  39, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an  acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. In the event  that an institution fails to submit an acceptable plan within the time  allowed by the agency or fails in any material respect to implement an  accepted plan, the agency must, by order, require the institution to  correct the deficiency. The agency may, and in some cases must, take  other supervisory actions until the deficiency has been corrected.</p><p class="depth0">v. The agencies have adopted amendments to their rules and  regulations to establish deadlines for submission and review of  compliance plans. \2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ For the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, these  regulations appear at 12 CFR part 30; for the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System, these regulations appear at 12 CFR part 263; and  for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, these regulations appear  at 12 CFR part 308, subpart R and 12 CFR part 391, subpart B. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">vi. The following Guidelines set out the safety and soundness  standards that the agencies use to identify and address problems at  insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The  agencies believe that the standards adopted in these Guidelines serve  this end without dictating how institutions must be managed and  operated. These standards are designed to identify potential safety and  soundness concerns and ensure that action is taken to address those  concerns before they pose a risk to the deposit insurance funds.</p><p class="depth0">A. Preservation of Existing Authority</p><p class="depth0">Neither section 39 nor these Guidelines in any way limits the  authority of the agencies to address unsafe or unsound practices,  violations of law, unsafe or unsound conditions, or other practices.  Action under section 39 and these Guidelines may be taken independently  of, in conjunction with, or in addition to any other enforcement action  available to the agencies. Nothing in these Guidelines limits the  authority of the FDIC pursuant to section 38(i)(2)(F) of the FDI Act (12  U.S.C. 1831(o)) and part 325 of title 12 of the Code of Federal  Regulations.</p><p class="depth0">B. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">1. In general. For purposes of these Guidelines, except as modified  in the Guidelines or unless the context otherwise requires, the terms  used have the same meanings as set forth in sections 3 and 39 of the FDI  Act (12 U.S.C. 1813 and 1831p-1).</p><p class="depth0">2. Board of directors, in the case of a state-licensed insured  branch of a foreign bank and in the case of a Federal branch of a  foreign bank, means the managing official in charge of the insured  foreign branch.</p><p class="depth0">3. Compensation means all direct and indirect payments or benefits,  both cash and non-cash, granted to or for the benefit of any executive  officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder, including but not  limited to payments or benefits derived from an employment contract,  compensation or benefit agreement, fee arrangement, perquisite,   stock option plan, postemployment benefit, or other compensatory  arrangement.</p><p class="depth0">4.

Operational and Managerial Standards</p><p class="depth0">A. Internal controls and information systems. An institution should  have internal controls and information systems that are appropriate to  the size of the institution and the nature, scope and risk of its  activities and that provide for:</p><p class="depth0">1. An organizational structure that establishes clear lines of  authority and responsibility for monitoring adherence to established  policies;</p><p class="depth0">2. Effective risk assessment;</p><p class="depth0">3. Timely and accurate financial, operational and regulatory  reports;</p><p class="depth0">4. Adequate procedures to safeguard and manage assets; and</p><p class="depth0">5. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</p><p class="depth0">B. Internal audit system. An institution should have an internal  audit system that is appropriate to the size of the institution and the  nature and scope of its activities and that provides for:</p><p class="depth0">1. Adequate monitoring of the system of internal controls through an  internal audit function. For an institution whose size, complexity or  scope of operations does not warrant a full scale internal audit  function, a system of independent reviews of key internal controls may  be used;</p><p class="depth0">2. Independence and objectivity;</p><p class="depth0">3. Qualified persons;</p><p class="depth0">4. Adequate testing and review of information systems;</p><p class="depth0">5. Adequate documentation of tests and findings and any corrective  actions;</p><p class="depth0">6. Verification and review of management actions to address material  weaknesses; and</p><p class="depth0">7. Review by the institution's audit committee or board of directors  of the effectiveness of the internal audit systems.</p><p class="depth0">C. Loan documentation. An institution should establish and maintain  loan documentation practices that:</p><p class="depth0">1. Enable the institution to make an informed lending decision and  to assess risk, as necessary, on an ongoing basis;</p><p class="depth0">2. Identify the purpose of a loan and the source of repayment, and  assess the ability of the borrower to repay the indebtedness in a timely  manner;</p><p class="depth0">3. Ensure that any claim against a borrower is legally enforceable;</p><p class="depth0">4. Demonstrate appropriate administration and monitoring of a loan;  and</p><p class="depth0">5. Take account of the size and complexity of a loan.</p><p class="depth0">D. Credit underwriting. An institution should establish and maintain  prudent credit underwriting practices that:</p><p class="depth0">1. Are commensurate with the types of loans the institution will  make and consider the terms and conditions under which they will be  made;</p><p class="depth0">2. Consider the nature of the markets in which loans will be made;</p><p class="depth0">3. Provide for consideration, prior to credit commitment, of the  borrower's overall financial condition and resources, the financial  responsibility of any guarantor, the nature and value of any underlying  collateral, and the borrower's character and willingness to repay as  agreed;</p><p class="depth0">4. Establish a system of independent, ongoing credit review and  appropriate communication to management and to the board of directors;</p><p class="depth0">5. Take adequate account of concentration of credit risk; and</p><p class="depth0">6. Are appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature and  scope of its activities.</p><p class="depth0">E. Interest rate exposure. An institution should:</p><p class="depth0">1. Manage interest rate risk in a manner that is appropriate to the  size of the institution and the complexity of its assets and  liabilities; and</p><p class="depth0">2. Provide for periodic reporting to management and the board of  directors regarding interest rate risk with adequate information for  management and the board of directors to assess the level of risk.</p><p class="depth0">F. Asset growth. An institution's asset growth should be prudent and  consider:</p><p class="depth0">1. The source, volatility and use of the funds that support asset  growth;</p><p class="depth0">2. Any increase in credit risk or interest rate risk as a result of  growth; and</p><p class="depth0">3. The effect of growth on the institution's capital.</p><p class="depth0">G. Asset quality. An insured depository institution should establish  and maintain a system that is commensurate with the institution's size  and the nature and scope of its operations to identify problem assets  and prevent deterioration in those assets. The institution should:</p><p class="depth0">1. Conduct periodic assetquality reviews to identify problem assets;</p><p class="depth0">2. Estimate the inherent losses in those assets and establish  reserves that are sufficient to absorb estimated losses;</p><p class="depth0">3. Compare problem asset totals to capital;</p><p class="depth0">4. Take appropriate corrective action to resolve problem assets;</p><p class="depth0">5. Consider the size and potential risks of material asset  concentrations; and</p><p class="depth0">6. Provide periodic asset reports with adequate information for  management and the board of directors to assess the level of asset risk.</p><p class="depth0">H. Earnings. An insured depository institution should establish and  maintain a system that is commensurate with the institution's size and  the nature and scope of its operations to evaluate and monitor earnings  and ensure that earnings are sufficient to maintain adequate capital and  reserves. The institution should:</p><p class="depth0">1. Compare recent earnings trends relative to equity, assets, or  other commonly used benchmarks to the institution's historical results  and those of its peers;</p><p class="depth0">2. Evaluate the adequacy of earnings given the size, complexity, and  risk profile of the institution's assets and operations;</p><p class="depth0">3. Assess the source, volatility, and sustainability of earnings,  including the effect of nonrecurring or extraordinary income or expense;</p><p class="depth0">4. Take steps to ensure that earnings are sufficient to maintain  adequate capital and reserves after considering the institution's asset  quality and growth rate; and</p><p class="depth0">5. Provide periodic earnings reports with adequate information for  management and the board of directors to assess earnings performance.</p><p class="depth0">I. Compensation, fees and benefits. An institution should maintain  safeguards to prevent the payment of compensation, fees, and benefits  that are excessive or that could lead to material financial loss to the  institution.  III. Prohibition on Compensation That Constitutes an Unsafe and Unsound</p><p class="depth0">Practice</p><p class="depth0">A. Excessive Compensation</p><p class="depth0">Excessive compensation is prohibited as an unsafe and unsound  practice. Compensation shall be considered excessive when amounts paid  are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an  executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder,  considering the following:</p><p class="depth0">1. The combined value of all cash and non-cash benefits provided to  the individual;</p><p class="depth0">2. The compensation history of the individual and other individuals  with comparable expertise at the institution;</p><p class="depth0">3. The financial condition of the institution;</p><p class="depth0">4. Comparable compensation practices at comparable institutions,  based upon such factors as asset size, geographic location, and the  complexity of the loan portfolio or other assets;</p><p class="depth0">5. For postemployment benefits, the projected total cost and benefit  to the institution;</p><p class="depth0">6. Any connection between the individual and any fraudulent act or  omission, breach of trust or fiduciary duty, or insider abuse with  regard to the institution; and</p><p class="depth0">7.

Introduction</p><p class="depth0">The Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security  Standards (Guidelines) set forth standards pursuant to section 39 of the  Federal Deposit Insurance Act (section 39, codified at 12 U.S.C. 1831p- 1), and sections 501 and 505(b), codified at 15 U.S.C. 6801 and 6805(b)  of the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act. These Guidelines address standards for  developing and implementing administrative, technical, and physical  safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of  customer information. These Guidelines also address standards with  respect to the proper disposal of consumer information, pursuant to  sections 621 and 628 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681s  and 1681w).</p><p class="depth0">A. Scope. The Guidelines apply to customer information maintained by  or on behalf of entities over which the OCC has authority. Such  entities, referred to as ``the national   bank or Federal savings association,'' are national banks, Federal  savings associations, Federal branches and Federal agencies of foreign  banks, and any subsidiaries of such entities (except brokers, dealers,  persons providing insurance, investment companies, and investment  advisers). The Guidelines also apply to the proper disposal of consumer  information by or on behalf of such entities.</p><p class="depth0">B. Preservation of Existing Authority. Neither section 39 nor these  Guidelines in any way limit the authority of the OCC to address unsafe  or unsound practices, violations of law, unsafe or unsound conditions,  or other practices. The OCC may take action under section 39 and these  Guidelines independently of, in conjunction with, or in addition to, any  other enforcement action available to the OCC.</p><p class="depth0">C. Definitions. 1. Except as modified in the Guidelines, or unless  the context otherwise requires, the terms used in these Guidelines have  the same meanings as set forth in sections 3 and 39 of the Federal  Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813 and 1831p-1).</p><p class="depth0">2. For purposes of the Guidelines, the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0">a. Board of directors, in the case of a branch or agency of a  foreign bank, means the managing official in charge of the branch or  agency.</p><p class="depth0">b. Consumer information means any record about an individual,  whether in paper, electronic, or other form, that is a consumer report  or is derived from a consumer report and that is maintained or otherwise  possessed by or on behalf of the national bank or Federal savings  association for a business purpose. Consumer information also means a  compilation of such records. The term does not include any record that  does not identify an individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Consumer information includes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A consumer report that a national bank or Federal savings  association obtains;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Information from a consumer report that the national bank or  Federal savings association obtains from its affiliate after the  consumer has been given a notice and has elected not to opt out of that  sharing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Information from a consumer report that the national bank or  Federal savings association obtains about an individual who applies for  but does not receive a loan, including any loan sought by an individual  for a business purpose;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Information from a consumer report that the national bank or  Federal savings association obtains about an individual who guarantees a  loan (including a loan to a business entity); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Information from a consumer report that the national bank or  Federal savings association obtains about an employee or prospective  employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Consumer information does not include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Aggregate information, such as the mean credit score, derived  from a group of consumer reports; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Blind data, such as payment history on accounts that are not  personally identifiable, that may be used for developing credit scoring  models or for other purposes.</p><p class="depth0">c. Consumer report has the same meaning as set forth in the Fair  Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681a(d).</p><p class="depth0">d. Customer means any customer of the national bank or Federal  savings association as defined in 12 CFR 1016.3(i).</p><p class="depth0">e. Customer information means any record containing nonpublic  personal information, as defined in 12 CFR 1016.3(p), about a customer,  whether in paper, electronic, or other form, that is maintained by or on  behalf of the national bank or Federal savings association.</p><p class="depth0">f. Customer information systems means any methods used to access,  collect, store, use, transmit, protect, or dispose of customer  information.</p><p class="depth0">g. Service provider means any person or entity that maintains,  processes, or otherwise is permitted access to customer information or  consumer information through its provision of services directly to the  national bank or Federal savings association.</p><p class="depth0">II. Standards for Information Security</p><p class="depth0">A. Information Security Program. Each national bank or Federal  savings association shall implement a comprehensive written information  security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical  safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the national bank  or Federal savings association and the nature and scope of its  activities. While all parts of the national bank or Federal savings  association are not required to implement a uniform set of policies, all  elements of the information security program must be coordinated.</p><p class="depth0">B. Objectives. A national bank's or Federal savings association's  information security program shall be designed to:</p><p class="depth0">1. Ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information;</p><p class="depth0">2. Protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the  security or integrity of such information;</p><p class="depth0">3. Protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information  that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer;  and</p><p class="depth0">4. Ensure the proper disposal of customer information and consumer  information.</p><p class="depth0">III. Development and Implementation of Information Security Program</p><p class="depth0">A. Involve the Board of Directors. The board of directors or an  appropriate committee of the board of each national bank or Federal  savings association shall:</p><p class="depth0">1. Approve the national bank's or Federal savings association's  written information security program; and</p><p class="depth0">2. Oversee the development, implementation, and maintenance of the  national bank's or Federal savings association's information security  program, including assigning specific responsibility for its  implementation and reviewing reports from management.</p><p class="depth0">B. Assess Risk. Each national bank or Federal savings association  shall:</p><p class="depth0">1. Identify reasonably foreseeable internal and external threats  that could result in unauthorized disclosure, misuse, alteration, or  destruction of customer information or customer information systems.</p><p class="depth0">2. Assess the likelihood and potential damage of these threats,  taking into consideration the sensitivity of customer information.</p><p class="depth0">3. Assess the sufficiency of policies, procedures, customer  information systems, and other arrangements in place to control risks.</p><p class="depth0">C. Manage and Control Risk. Each national bank or Federal savings  association shall:</p><p class="depth0">1. Design its information security program to control the identified  risks, commensurate with the sensitivity of the information as well as  the complexity and scope of the national bank's or Federal savings  association's activities. Each national bank or Federal savings  association must consider whether the following security measures are  appropriate for the national bank or Federal savings association and, if  so, adopt those measures the national bank or Federal savings  association concludes are appropriate:</p><p class="depth0">a. Access controls on customer information systems, including  controls to authenticate and permit access only to authorized  individuals and controls to prevent employees from providing customer  information to unauthorized individuals who may seek to obtain this  information through fraudulent means.</p><p class="depth0">b. Access restrictions at physical locations containing customer  information, such as buildings, computer facilities, and records storage  facilities to permit access only to authorized individuals;</p><p class="depth0">c. Encryption of electronic customer information, including while in  transit or in storage on networks or systems to which unauthorized  individuals may have access;</p><p class="depth0">d. Procedures designed to ensure that customer information system  modifications are consistent with the national bank's or Federal savings  association's information security program;</p><p class="depth0">e. Dual control procedures, segregation of duties, and employee  background checks for employees with responsibilities for or access to  customer information;</p><p class="depth0">f. Monitoring systems and procedures to detect actual and attempted  attacks on or intrusions into customer information systems;</p><p class="depth0">g. Response programs that specify actions to be taken when the  national bank or Federal savings association suspects or detects that  unauthorized individuals have gained access to customer information  systems, including appropriate reports to regulatory and law enforcement  agencies; and</p><p class="depth0">h. Measures to protect against destruction, loss, or damage of  customer information due to potential environmental hazards, such as  fire and water damage or technological failures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Train staff to implement the national bank's or Federal savings  association's information security program.</p><p class="depth0">3. Regularly test the key controls, systems and procedures of the  information security program. The frequency and nature of such tests  should be determined by the national bank's or Federal savings  association's risk assessment. Tests should be conducted or reviewed by  independent third parties or staff independent of those that develop or  maintain the security programs.</p><p class="depth0">4. Develop, implement, and maintain, as part of its information  security program, appropriate measures to properly dispose of customer  information and consumer information in accordance with each of the  requirements of this paragraph III.</p><p class="depth0">D. Oversee Service Provider Arrangements. Each national bank or  Federal savings association shall:</p><p class="depth0">1. Exercise appropriate due diligence in selecting its service  providers;</p><p class="depth0">2. Require its service providers by contract to implement  appropriate measures designed to meet the objectives of these  Guidelines; and</p><p class="depth0">3. Where indicated by the national bank's or Federal savings  association's risk assessment, monitor its service providers to confirm  that they have satisfied their obligations as required by section D.2.  As part of this monitoring, a national bank or Federal savings  association should review audits, summaries of test results, or other  equivalent evaluations of its service providers.</p><p class="depth0">E. Adjust the Program. Each national bank or Federal savings  association shall monitor, evaluate, and adjust, as appropriate, the  information security program in light of any relevant changes in  technology, the sensitivity of its customer information, internal or  external threats to information, and the national bank's or Federal  savings association's own changing business arrangements, such as  mergers and acquisitions, alliances and joint ventures, outsourcing  arrangements, and changes to customer information systems.</p><p class="depth0">F. Report to the Board. Each national bank or Federal savings  association shall report to its board or an appropriate committee of the  board at least annually. This report should describe the overall status  of the information security program and the national   bank's or Federal savings association's compliance with these  Guidelines. The reports should discuss material matters related to its  program, addressing issues such as: risk assessment; risk management and  control decisions; service provider arrangements; results of testing;  security breaches or violations and management's responses; and  recommendations for changes in the information security program.</p><p class="depth0">G. Implement the Standards. 1. Effective date. Each national bank or  Federal savings association must implement an information security  program pursuant to these Guidelines by July 1, 2001.</p><p class="depth0">2. Two-year grandfathering of agreements with service providers.  Until July 1, 2003, a contract that a national bank or Federal savings  association has entered into with a service provider to perform services  for it or functions on its behalf satisfies the provisions of section  III.D., even if the contract does not include a requirement that the  servicer maintain the security and confidentiality of customer  information, as long as the national bank or Federal savings association  entered into the contract on or before March 5, 2001.</p><p class="depth0">3. Effective date for measures relating to the disposal of consumer  information. Each national bank or Federal savings association must  satisfy these Guidelines with respect to the proper disposal of consumer  information by July 1, 2005.</p><p class="depth0">4. Exception for existing agreements with service providers relating  to the disposal of consumer information. Notwithstanding the requirement  in paragraph III.G.3., a national bank's or Federal savings  association's contracts with its service providers that have access to  consumer information and that may dispose of consumer information,  entered into before July 1, 2005, must comply with the provisions of the  Guidelines relating to the proper disposal of consumer information by  July 1, 2006.  Supplement A to appendix B to Part 30--Interagency Guidance on Response</p><p class="depth0">Programs for Unauthorized Access to Customer Information and Customer</p><p class="depth0">Notice</p><p class="depth0">I. Background</p><p class="depth0">This Guidance \1\ interprets section 501(b) of the Gramm-Leach- Bliley Act (``GLBA'') and the Interagency Guidelines Establishing  Information Security Standards (the ``Security Guidelines'') \2\ and  describes response programs, including customer notification procedures,  that a financial institution should develop and implement to address  unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result  in substantial harm or inconvenience to a customer. The scope of, and  definitions of terms used in, this Guidance are identical to those of  the Security Guidelines. For example, the term ``customer information''  is the same term used in the Security Guidelines, and means any record  containing nonpublic personal information about a customer, whether in  paper, electronic, or other form, maintained by or on behalf of the  institution. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ This Guidance was jointly issued by the Board of Governors of  the Federal Reserve System (Board), the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC),  and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 5412,  the OTS is no longer a party to this Guidance.</p><p class="depth0">\2\ 12 CFR part 30, app. B (OCC); 12 CFR part 208, app. D-2 and part  225, app. F (Board); and 12 CFR part 364, app. B and 12 CFR 391.5  (FDIC). The ``Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security  Standards'' were formerly known as ``The Interagency Guidelines  Establishing Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information.'' ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">A. Interagency Security Guidelines</p><p class="depth0">Section 501(b) of the GLBA required the Agencies to establish  appropriate standards for financial institutions subject to their  jurisdiction that include administrative, technical, and physical  safeguards, to protect the security and confidentiality of customer  information. Accordingly, the Agencies issued Security Guidelines  requiring every financial institution to have an information security  program designed to:</p><p class="depth0">1. Ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information;</p><p class="depth0">2. Protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the  security or integrity of such information; and</p><p class="depth0">3. Protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information  that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.</p><p class="depth0">B. Risk Assessment and Controls</p><p class="depth0">1. The Security Guidelines direct every financial institution to  assess the following risks, among others, when developing its  information security program:</p><p class="depth0">a. Reasonably foreseeable internal and external threats that could  result in unauthorized disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction of  customer information or customer information systems;</p><p class="depth0">b. The likelihood and potential damage of threats, taking into  consideration the sensitivity of customer information; and</p><p class="depth0">c. The sufficiency of policies, procedures, customer information  systems, and other arrangements in place to control risks. \3\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ See Security Guidelines, III.B.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">2. Following the assessment of these risks, the Security Guidelines  require a financial institution to design a program to address the  identified risks. The particular security measures an institution should  adopt will depend upon the risks presented by the complexity and scope  of its business. At a minimum, the financial institution is required to  consider the specific security measures enumerated in the Security  Guidelines, \4\ and adopt those that are appropriate for the  institution, including: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ See Security Guidelines, III.C. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">a. Access controls on customer information systems, including  controls to authenticate and permit access only to authorized  individuals and controls to prevent employees from providing customer  information to unauthorized individuals who may seek to obtain this  information through fraudulent means;</p><p class="depth0">b. Background checks for employees with responsibilities for access  to customer information; and</p><p class="depth0">c. Response programs that specify actions to be taken when the  financial institution suspects or detects that unauthorized individuals  have gained access to customer information systems, including  appropriate reports to regulatory and law enforcement agencies. \5\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\5\ See Security Guidelines, III.C. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">C. Service Providers</p><p class="depth0">The Security Guidelines direct every financial institution to  require its service providers by contract to implement appropriate  measures designed to protect against unauthorized access to or use of  customer information that could result in substantial harm or  inconvenience to any customer. \6\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\6\ See Security Guidelines, II.B. and III.D. Further, the Agencies  note that, in addition to contractual obligations to a financial  institution, a service provider may be required to implement its own  comprehensive information security program in accordance with the  Safeguards Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (``FTC''),  16 CFR part 314. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">II. Response Program</p><p class="depth0">Millions of Americans, throughout the country, have been victims of  identity theft. \7\ Identity thieves misuse personal information they  obtain from a number of sources, including financial institutions, to  perpetrate identity theft. Therefore, financial institutions should take  preventative measures to safeguard customer information against attempts  to gain unauthorized access to the information. For example, financial  institutions should place access controls on customer information  systems and conduct background checks for employees who are authorized  to access customer information. \8\ However, every financial institution  should also develop and implement a risk-based response program to  address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in  customer information systems \9\ that occur nonetheless. A response  program should be a key part of an institution's information security  program. \10\ The program should be appropriate to the size and  complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its  activities. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\7\ The FTC estimates that nearly 10 million Americans discovered  they were victims of some form of identity theft in 2002. See The  Federal Trade Commission, Identity Theft Survey Report, (September  2003), available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/09/synovatereport.pdf.</p><p class="depth0">\8\ Institutions should also conduct background checks of employees  to ensure that the institution does not violate 12 U.S.C. 1829, which  prohibits an institution from hiring an individual convicted of certain  criminal offenses or who is subject to a prohibition order under 12  U.S.C. 1818(e)(6).</p><p class="depth0">\9\ Under the Guidelines, an institution's customer information  systems consist of all of the methods used to access, collect, store,  use, transmit, protect, or dispose of customer information, including  the systems maintained by its service providers. See Security  Guidelines, I.C.2.d.</p><p class="depth0">\10\ See FFIEC Information Technology Examination Handbook,  Information Security Booklet, Dec. 2002 available at http:// www.ffiec.gov/ffiecinfobase/html_pages/infosec_book_frame.htm.

Therefore, consistent with the obligations in the Guidelines that relate  to these arrangements, and with existing guidance on this topic issued  by the Agencies, \11\ an institution's contract with its service  provider should require the service provider to take appropriate actions  to address incidents of unauthorized access   to the financial institution's customer information, including  notification to the institution as soon as possible of any such  incident, to enable the institution to expeditiously implement its  response program. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\11\ See Federal Reserve SR Ltr. 13-19, Guidance on Managing  Outsourcing Risk, Dec. 5, 2013; OCC Bulletin 2013-29, ``Third-Party  Relationships--Risk Management Guidance,'' Oct. 30, 2013; and FDIC FIL  68-99, Risk Assessment Tools and Practices for Information System  Security, July 7, 1999. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">A. Components of a Response Program</p><p class="depth0">1. At a minimum, an institution's response program should contain  procedures for the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. Assessing the nature and scope of an incident, and identifying  what customer information systems and types of customer information have  been accessed or misused;</p><p class="depth0">b. Notifying its primary Federal regulator as soon as possible when  the institution becomes aware of an incident involving unauthorized  access to or use of sensitive customer information, as defined below;</p><p class="depth0">c. Consistent with the Agencies' Suspicious Activity Report  (``SAR'') regulations, \12\ notifying appropriate law enforcement  authorities, in addition to filing a timely SAR in situations involving  Federal criminal violations requiring immediate attention, such as when  a reportable violation is ongoing; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\12\ An institution's obligation to file a SAR is set out in the  Agencies' SAR regulations and Agency guidance. See 12 CFR 21.11  (national banks, Federal branches and agencies); 12 CFR 163.180 (Federal  savings associations); 12 CFR 208.62 (State member banks); 12 CFR  211.5(k) (Edge and agreement corporations); 12 CFR 211.24(f) (uninsured  State branches and agencies of foreign banks); 12 CFR 225.4(f) (bank  holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries); 12 CFR part 353  (State non-member banks); and 12 CFR 390.355 (state savings  associations). National banks and Federal savings associations must file  SARs in connection with computer intrusions and other computer crimes.  See OCC Bulletin 2000-14, ``Infrastructure Threats--Intrusion Risks''  (May 15, 2000); see also Federal Reserve SR 01-11, Identity Theft and  Pretext Calling, Apr. 26, 2001. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">d.

Notifying customers when warranted.</p><p class="depth0">2. Where an incident of unauthorized access to customer information  involves customer information systems maintained by an institution's  service providers, it is the responsibility of the financial institution  to notify the institution's customers and regulator. However, an  institution may authorize or contract with its service provider to  notify the institution's customers or regulator on its behalf.</p><p class="depth0">III. Customer Notice</p><p class="depth0">Financial institutions have an affirmative duty to protect their  customers' information against unauthorized access or use. Notifying  customers of a security incident involving the unauthorized access or  use of the customer's information in accordance with the standard set  forth below is a key part of that duty. Timely notification of customers  is important to manage an institution's reputation risk. Effective  notice also may reduce an institution's legal risk, assist in  maintaining good customer relations, and enable the institution's  customers to take steps to protect themselves against the consequences  of identity theft. When customer notification is warranted, an  institution may not forgo notifying its customers of an incident because  the institution believes that it may be potentially embarrassed or  inconvenienced by doing so.</p><p class="depth0">A. Standard for Providing Notice</p><p class="depth0">When a financial institution becomes aware of an incident of  unauthorized access to sensitive customer information, the institution  should conduct a reasonable investigation to promptly determine the  likelihood that the information has been or will be misused. If the  institution determines that misuse of its information about a customer  has occurred or is reasonably possible, it should notify the affected  customer as soon as possible. Customer notice may be delayed if an  appropriate law enforcement agency determines that notification will  interfere with a criminal investigation and provides the institution  with a written request for the delay. However, the institution should  notify its customers as soon as notification will no longer interfere  with the investigation.</p><p class="depth0">1. Sensitive Customer Information</p><p class="depth0">Under the Guidelines, an institution must protect against  unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result  in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. Substantial harm  or inconvenience is most likely to result from improper access to  sensitive customer information because this type of information is most  likely to be misused, as in the commission of identity theft. For  purposes of this Guidance, sensitive customer information means a  customer's name, address, or telephone number, in conjunction with the  customer's social security number, driver's license number, account  number, credit or debit card number,   or a personal identification number or password that would permit access  to the customer's account. Sensitive customer information also includes  any combination of components of customer information that would allow  someone to log onto or access the customer's account, such as user name  and password or password and account number.</p><p class="depth0">2. Affected Customers</p><p class="depth0">If a financial institution, based upon its investigation, can  determine from its logs or other data precisely which customers'  information has been improperly accessed, it may limit notification to  those customers with regard to whom the institution determines that  misuse of their information has occurred or is reasonably possible.  However, there may be situations where the institution determines that a  group of files has been accessed improperly, but is unable to identify  which specific customers' information has been accessed. If the  circumstances of the unauthorized access lead the institution to  determine that misuse of the information is reasonably possible, it  should notify all customers in the group.</p><p class="depth0">B. Content of Customer Notice</p><p class="depth0">1. Customer notice should be given in a clear and conspicuous  manner. The notice should describe the incident in general terms and the  type of customer information that was the subject of unauthorized access  or use. It also should generally describe what the institution has done  to protect the customers' information from further unauthorized access.  In addition, it should include a telephone number that customers can  call for further information and assistance. \14\ The notice also should  remind customers of the need to remain vigilant over the next twelve to  twenty-four months, and to promptly report incidents of suspected  identity theft to the institution. The notice should include the  following additional items, when appropriate: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\14\ The institution should, therefore, ensure that it has  reasonable policies and procedures in place, including trained  personnel, to respond appropriately to customer inquiries and requests  for assistance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">a. A recommendation that the customer review account statements and  immediately report any suspicious activity to the institution;</p><p class="depth0">b. A description of fraud alerts and an explanation of how the  customer may place a fraud alert in the customer's consumer reports to  put the customer's creditors on notice that the customer may be a victim  of fraud;</p><p class="depth0">c. A recommendation that the customer periodically obtain credit  reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency and have  information relating to fraudulent transactions deleted;</p><p class="depth0">d. An explanation of how the customer may obtain a credit report  free of charge; and</p><p class="depth0">e. Information about the availability of the FTC's online guidance  regarding steps a consumer can take to protect against identity theft.  The notice should encourage the customer to report any incidents of  identity theft to the FTC, and should provide the FTC's Web site address  and toll-free telephone number that customers may use to obtain the  identity theft guidance and report suspected incidents of identity  theft. \15\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\15\ Currently, the FTC Web site for the ID Theft brochure and the  FTC Hotline phone number are http://www.consumer.gov/idtheft and 1-877- IDTHEFT. The institution may also refer customers to any materials  developed pursuant to section 151(b) of the FACT Act (educational  materials developed by the FTC to teach the public how to prevent  identity theft). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">2. The Agencies encourage financial institutions to notify the  nationwide consumer reporting agencies prior to sending notices to a  large number of customers that include contact information for the  reporting agencies.</p><p class="depth0">C. Delivery of Customer Notice</p><p class="depth0">Customer notice should be delivered in any manner designed to ensure  that a customer can reasonably be expected to receive it. For example,  the institution may choose to contact all customers affected by  telephone or by mail, or by electronic mail for those customers for whom  it has a valid e-mail address and who have agreed to receive  communications electronically.

Monitoring and Corrective Action</p><p class="depth0">I. Introduction</p><p class="depth0">i. These OCC Guidelines for Residential Mortgage Lending Practices  (Guidelines) set forth standards pursuant to Section 39 of the Federal  Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1 (Section 39). The Guidelines  are designed to protect against involvement by national banks, Federal  savings associations, Federal branches and Federal agencies of foreign  banks, and their respective operating subsidiaries (together, ``national  banks and Federal savings associations''), either directly or through  loans that they purchase or make through intermediaries, in predatory or  abusive residential mortgage lending practices that are injurious to  their respective customers and that expose the national bank or Federal  savings association to credit, legal, compliance, reputation, and other  risks. The Guidelines focus on the substance of activities and  practices, not the creation of policies. The Guidelines are enforceable  under Section 39 in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the  regulations in 12 CFR part 30.</p><p class="depth0">ii. As the OCC has previously indicated in guidance to national  banks and in rulemaking proceedings (OCC Advisory Letters 2003-2 and  2003-3 (Feb. 21, 2003)), many of the abusive practices commonly  associated with predatory mortgage lending, such as loan flipping and  equity stripping, will involve conduct that likely violates the Federal  Trade Commission Act's (FTC Act) prohibition against unfair or deceptive  acts or practices. 15 U.S.C. 45. In addition, loans that involve  violations of the FTC Act, or mortgage loans based predominantly on the  foreclosure or liquidation value of the borrower's collateral without  regard to the borrower's ability to repay the loan according to its  terms, will involve violations of OCC regulations governing real estate  lending activities, 12 CFR 34.3 (Lending Rules).</p><p class="depth0">iii. In addition, national banks, Federal savings associations, and  their respective operating subsidiaries must comply with the  requirements and Guidelines affecting appraisals of residential mortgage  loans and appraiser independence. 12 CFR part 34, subpart C, and the  Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines (OCC Bulletin 2010-42  (December 10, 2010). For example, engaging in a practice of influencing  the independent judgment of an appraiser with respect to a valuation of  real estate that is to be security for a residential mortgage loan would  violate applicable standards.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Targeting inappropriate credit products and unfair loan terms to  certain borrowers also may entail conduct that violates the FTC Act, as  well as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and the Fair Housing Act  (FHA). 15 U.S.C. 1691 et seq. 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq. For example,  ``steering'' a consumer to a loan with higher costs rather than to a  comparable loan offered by the national bank or Federal savings  association with lower costs for which the consumer could qualify, on a  prohibited basis such as the borrower's race, national origin, age,  gender, or marital status, would be unlawful.</p><p class="depth0">v. OCC regulations also prohibit national banks and their operating  subsidiaries from providing lump sum, single premium fees for debt  cancellation contracts and debt suspension agreements in connection with  residential mortgage loans. 12 CFR 37.3(c)(2). Some lending practices  and loan terms, including financing single premium credit insurance and  the use of mandatory arbitration clauses, also may significantly impair  the eligibility of a residential mortgage loan for purchase in the  secondary market.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Finally, OCC regulations and supervisory guidance on fiduciary  activities and asset management address the need for national banks and  Federal savings associations to perform due diligence and exercise  appropriate control with regard to trustee activities. See 12 CFR 9.6  (a), in the case of national banks, and 12 CFR 150.200, in the case of  Federal savings associations, and the Comptroller's Handbook on Asset  Management. For example, national banks and Federal savings associations  should exercise appropriate diligence to minimize potential reputation  risks when they undertake to act as trustees in mortgage  securitizations.</p><p class="depth0">A. Scope. These Guidelines apply to the residential mortgage lending  activities of national banks, Federal savings associations, Federal  branches and Federal agencies of foreign banks, and operating  subsidiaries of such entities (except brokers, dealers, persons  providing insurance, investment companies, and investment advisers).</p><p class="depth0">B. Preservation of Existing Authority. Neither Section 39 nor these  Guidelines in any way limits the authority of the OCC to address unsafe  or unsound practices or conditions, unfair or deceptive practices, or  other violations of law. The OCC may take action under Section 39 and  these Guidelines independently of, in conjunction with, or in addition  to any other enforcement action available to the OCC.</p><p class="depth0">C. Relationship to Other Legal Requirements. Actions by a national  bank or Federal savings association in connection with residential  mortgage lending that are inconsistent with these Guidelines or Appendix  A to this   part 30 may also constitute unsafe or unsound practices for purposes of  section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1818, unfair  or deceptive practices for purposes of section 5 of the FTC Act, 15  U.S.C. 45, and the OCC's Lending Rules, 12 CFR 34.3 (Lending Rules) and  Real Estate Lending Standards, 12 CFR part 34, subpart D, in the case of  national banks, and 12 CFR 160.100 and 160.101, in the case of Federal  savings associations, or violations of the ECOA and FHA.</p><p class="depth0">D. Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Except as modified in these Guidelines, or unless the context  otherwise requires, the terms used in these Guidelines have the same  meanings as set forth in sections 3 and 39 of the Federal Deposit  Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1813 and 1831p-1.</p><p class="depth0">2. For purposes of these Guidelines, the following definitions  apply:</p><p class="depth0">a. Residential mortgage loan means any loan or other extension of  credit made to one or more individuals for personal, family, or  household purposes secured by an owner-occupied 1-4 family residential  dwelling, including a cooperative unit or mobile home.</p><p class="depth0">b. National bank or Federal savings association means any national  bank, Federal savings association, Federal branch or Federal agency of a  foreign bank, and any operating subsidiary thereof that is subject to  these Guidelines.</p><p class="depth0">II. Standards for Residential Mortgage Lending Practices</p><p class="depth0">A. General. A national bank's or Federal savings association's  residential mortgage lending activities should reflect standards and  practices consistent with and appropriate to the size and complexity of  the bank or savings association and the nature and scope of its lending  activities.</p><p class="depth0">B. Objectives. A national bank's or Federal savings association's  residential mortgage lending activities should reflect standards and  practices that:</p><p class="depth0">1. Enable the national bank or Federal savings association to  effectively manage the credit, legal, compliance, reputation, and other  risks associated with the bank's or savings association's consumer  residential mortgage lending activities.</p><p class="depth0">2. Effectively prevent the national bank or Federal savings  association from becoming engaged in abusive, predatory, unfair, or  deceptive practices, directly, indirectly through mortgage brokers or  other intermediaries, or through purchased loans.</p><p class="depth0">III. Implementation of Residential Mortgage Lending Standards</p><p class="depth0">A. Avoidance of Particular Loan Terms, Conditions, and Features. A  national bank or Federal savings association should not become involved,  directly or indirectly in residential mortgage lending activities  involving abusive, predatory, unfair or deceptive lending practices,  including, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth0">1. Equity Stripping and Fee Packing. Repeat refinancings where a  borrower's equity is depleted as a result of financing excessive fees  for the loan or ancillary products.</p><p class="depth0">2. Loan Flipping. Repeat refinancings under circumstances where the  relative terms of the new and refinanced loan and the cost of the new  loan do not provide a tangible economic benefit to the borrower.</p><p class="depth0">3. Refinancing of Special Mortgages. Refinancing of a special  subsidized mortgage that contains terms favorable to the borrower with a  loan that does not provide a tangible economic benefit to the borrower  relative to the refinanced loan.</p><p class="depth0">4. Encouragement of Default. Encouraging a borrower to breach a  contract and default on an existing loan prior to and in connection with  the consummation of a loan that refinances all or part of the existing  loan.</p><p class="depth0">B. Prudent Consideration of Certain Loan Terms, Conditions and  Features. Certain loan terms, conditions and features, may, under  particular circumstances, be susceptible to abusive, predatory, unfair  or deceptive practices, yet may be appropriate and acceptable risk  mitigation measures, consistent with safe and sound lending, and benefit  customers under other circumstances. A national bank or Federal savings  association should prudently consider the circumstances, including the  characteristics of a targeted market and applicable consumer and safety  and soundness safeguards, under which the national bank or Federal  savings association will engage directly or indirectly in making  residential mortgage loans with the following loan terms, conditions and  features:</p><p class="depth0">1. Financing single premium credit life, disability or unemployment  insurance.</p><p class="depth0">2. Negative amortization, involving a payment schedule in which  regular periodic payments cause the principal balance to increase.</p><p class="depth0">3. Balloon payments in short-term transactions.</p><p class="depth0">4. Prepayment penalties that are not limited to the early years of  the loan, particularly in subprime loans.</p><p class="depth0">5. Interest rate increases upon default at a level not commensurate  with risk mitigation.</p><p class="depth0">6. Call provisions permitting the national bank or Federal savings  association to accelerate payment of the loan under circumstances other  than the borrower's default under the credit agreement or to mitigate  the bank's or savings association's exposure to loss.</p><p class="depth0">7. Absence of an appropriate assessment and documentation of the  consumer's ability to repay the loan in accordance with its   terms, commensurate with the type of loan, as required by appendix A of  this part.</p><p class="depth0">8. Mandatory arbitration clauses or agreements, particularly if the  eligibility of the loan for purchase in the secondary market is thereby  impaired.</p><p class="depth0">9. Pricing terms that result in the loan's being subject to the  provisions of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act. 15 U.S.C.  1639 et seq.</p><p class="depth0">10. Original principal balance of the loan in excess of appraised  value.</p><p class="depth0">11. Payment schedules that consolidate more than two periodic  payments and pay them in advance from the loan proceeds.</p><p class="depth0">12. Payments to home improvement contractors under a home  improvement contract from the proceeds of a residential mortgage loan  other than by an instrument payable to the consumer, jointly to the  consumer and the contractor, or through an independent third party  escrow agent.</p><p class="depth0">C. Enhanced Care to Avoid Abusive Loan Terms, Conditions, and  Features in Certain Mortgages. A national bank or Federal savings  association may face heightened risks when it solicits or offers loans  to consumers who are not financially sophisticated, have language  barriers, or are elderly, or have limited or poor credit histories, are  substantially indebted, or have other characteristics that limit their  credit choices. In connection with such consumers, a national bank or  Federal savings association should exercise enhanced care if it employs  the residential mortgage loan terms, conditions, and features described  in paragraph B of this section III, and should also apply appropriate  heightened internal controls and monitoring to any line of business that  does so.</p><p class="depth0">D. Avoidance of Consumer Misunderstanding. A national bank's or  Federal savings association's residential mortgage lending activities  should include provision of timely, sufficient, and accurate information  to a consumer concerning the terms and costs, risks, and benefits of the  loan. Consumers should be provided with information sufficient to draw  their attention to these key terms.</p><p class="depth0">E. Purchased and Brokered Loans. With respect to consumer  residential mortgage loans that the national bank or Federal savings  association purchases, or makes through a mortgage broker or other  intermediary, the national bank or Federal savings association's  residential mortgage lending activities should reflect standards and  practices consistent with those applied by the bank or savings  association in its direct lending activities and include appropriate  measures to mitigate risks, such as the following:</p><p class="depth0">1.

The OCC expects a covered bank, as that term is defined in  paragraph I.E. to establish and implement a risk governance framework to  manage and control the covered bank's risk-taking activities.</p><p class="depth0">2. This appendix establishes minimum standards for the design and  implementation of a covered bank's risk governance framework and minimum  standards for the covered bank's board of directors in providing  oversight to the framework's design and implementation (Guidelines).  These standards are in addition to any other applicable requirements in  law or regulation.</p><p class="depth0">3. A covered bank may use its parent company's risk governance  framework in its entirety, without modification, if the framework meets  these minimum standards, the risk profiles of the parent company and the  covered bank are substantially the same as set forth in paragraph I.4.  of these Guidelines, and the covered bank has demonstrated through a  documented assessment that its risk profile and its parent company's  risk profile are substantially the same. The assessment should be  conducted at least annually, in conjunction with the review and update  of the risk governance framework performed by independent risk  management, as set forth in paragraph II.A. of these Guidelines.</p><p class="depth0">4. A parent company's and covered bank's risk profiles are  substantially the same if, as reported on the covered bank's Federal  Financial Institutions Examination Council Consolidated Reports of  Condition and Income (Call Reports) for the four most recent consecutive  quarters, the covered bank's average total consolidated assets, as  calculated according to paragraph I.A. of these Guidelines, represent 95  percent or more of the parent company's average total consolidated  assets.\1\ A covered bank that does not satisfy this test may submit a  written analysis to the OCC for consideration and approval that  demonstrates that the risk profile of the parent company and the covered  bank are substantially the same based upon other factors not specified  in this paragraph. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ For a parent company, average total consolidated assets means  the average of the parent company's total consolidated assets, as  reported on the parent company's Form FR Y-9C to the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System, or equivalent regulatory report, for the  four most recent consecutive quarters. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">5. Subject to paragraph I.6. of these Guidelines, a covered bank  should establish its own risk governance framework when the parent  company's and covered bank's risk profiles are not substantially the  same. The covered bank's framework should ensure that the covered bank's  risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from that of its  parent for risk management and supervisory reporting purposes and that  the safety and soundness of the covered bank is not jeopardized by  decisions made by the parent company's board of directors and  management.</p><p class="depth0">6. When the parent company's and covered bank's risk profiles are  not substantially the same, a covered bank may, in consultation with the  OCC, incorporate or rely on components of its parent company's risk  governance framework when developing its own risk governance framework  to the extent   those components are consistent with the objectives of these Guidelines.</p><p class="depth0">A. Scope</p><p class="depth0">These Guidelines apply to any bank, as that term is defined in  paragraph I.E. of these Guidelines, with average total consolidated  assets equal to or greater than $50 billion. In addition, these  Guidelines apply to any bank with average total consolidated assets less  than $50 billion if that institution's parent company controls at least  one covered bank. For a covered bank, average total consolidated assets  means the average of the covered bank's total consolidated assets, as  reported on the covered bank's Call Reports, for the four most recent  consecutive quarters.</p><p class="depth0">B. Compliance Date</p><p class="depth0">1. Initial compliance. The date on which a covered bank should  comply with the Guidelines is set forth below:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A covered bank with average total consolidated assets, as  calculated according to paragraph I.A. of these Guidelines, equal to or  greater than $750 billion as of November 10, 2014 should comply with  these Guidelines on November 10, 2014;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A covered bank with average total consolidated assets, as  calculated according to paragraph I.A. of these Guidelines, equal to or  greater than $100 billion but less than $750 billion as of November 10,  2014 should comply with these Guidelines within six months from November  10, 2014;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A covered bank with average total consolidated assets, as  calculated according to paragraph I.A. of these Guidelines, equal to or  greater than $50 billion but less than $100 billion as of November 10,  2014 should comply with these Guidelines within 18 months from November  10, 2014;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A covered bank with average total consolidated assets, as  calculated according to paragraph I.A. of these Guidelines, less than  $50 billion that is a covered bank because that bank's parent company  controls at least one other covered bank as of November 10, 2014 should  comply with these Guidelines on the date that such other covered bank  should comply; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> A covered bank that does not come within the scope of these  Guidelines on November 10, 2014, but subsequently becomes subject to the  Guidelines because average total consolidated assets, as calculated  according to paragraph I.A. of these Guidelines, are equal to or greater  than $50 billion after November 10, 2014, should comply with these  Guidelines within 18 months from the as-of date of the most recent Call  Report used in the calculation of the average.</p><p class="depth0">C. Reservation of Authority</p><p class="depth0">1. The OCC reserves the authority to apply these Guidelines, in  whole or in part, to a bank that has average total consolidated assets  less than $50 billion, if the OCC determines such bank's operations are  highly complex or otherwise present a heightened risk as to warrant the  application of these Guidelines;</p><p class="depth0">2. The OCC reserves the authority, for each covered bank, to extend  the time for compliance with these Guidelines or modify these  Guidelines; or</p><p class="depth0">3. The OCC reserves the authority to determine that compliance with  these Guidelines should no longer be required for a covered bank. The  OCC would generally make the determination under this paragraph I.C.3.  if a covered bank's operations are no longer highly complex or no longer  present a heightened risk. In determining whether a covered bank's  operations are highly complex or present a heightened risk, the OCC will  consider the following factors: Complexity of products and services,  risk profile, and scope of operations.</p><p class="depth0">4. When exercising the authority in this paragraph I.C., the OCC  will apply notice and response procedures, when appropriate, in the same  manner and to the same extent as the notice and response procedures in  12 CFR 3.404.</p><p class="depth0">D. Preservation of Existing Authority</p><p class="depth0">Neither section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C.  1831p-1) nor these Guidelines in any way limits the authority of the OCC  to address unsafe or unsound practices or conditions or other violations  of law. The OCC may take action under section 39 and these Guidelines  independently of, in conjunction with, or in addition to any other  enforcement action available to the OCC.</p><p class="depth0">E.

Chief Audit Executive means an individual who leads internal  audit and is one level below the Chief Executive Officer in a covered  bank's organizational structure.</p><p class="depth0">3. Chief Risk Executive means an individual who leads an independent  risk management unit and is one level below the Chief Executive Officer  in a covered bank's organizational structure. A covered bank may have  more than one Chief Risk Executive.</p><p class="depth0">4. Control. A parent company controls a covered bank if it:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Owns, controls, or holds with power to vote 25 percent or more  of a class of voting securities of the covered bank; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Consolidates the covered bank for financial reporting purposes.</p><p class="depth0">5. Covered bank means any bank:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> With average total consolidated assets, as calculated according  to paragraph I.A. of these Guidelines, equal to or greater than $50  billion;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> With average total consolidated assets less than $50 billion if  that bank's parent company controls at least one covered bank; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> With average total consolidated assets less than $50 billion, if  the OCC determines such bank's operations are highly complex or  otherwise present a heightened risk as to warrant the application of  these Guidelines pursuant to paragraph I.C. of these Guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this  definition, front line unit means any organizational unit or function  thereof in a covered bank that is accountable for a risk in paragraph  II.B. of these Guidelines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Engages in activities designed to generate revenue or reduce  expenses for the parent company or covered bank;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Provides operational support or servicing to any organizational  unit or function within the covered bank for the delivery of products or  services to customers; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Provides technology services to any organizational unit or  function covered by these Guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Front line unit does not ordinarily include an organizational  unit or function thereof within a covered bank that provides legal  services to the covered bank.</p><p class="depth0">7. Independent risk management means any organizational unit within  a covered bank that has responsibility for identifying, measuring,  monitoring, or controlling aggregate risks. Such units maintain  independence from front line units through the following reporting  structure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The board of directors or the board's risk committee reviews and  approves the risk governance framework;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Each Chief Risk Executive has unrestricted access to the board  of directors and its committees to address risks and issues identified  through independent risk management's activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The board of directors or its risk committee approves all  decisions regarding the appointment or removal of the Chief Risk  Executive(s) and approves the annual compensation and salary adjustment  of the Chief Risk Executive(s); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> No front line unit executive oversees any independent risk  management unit.</p><p class="depth0">8. Internal audit means the organizational unit within a covered  bank that is designated to fulfill the role and responsibilities  outlined in 12 CFR part 30, Appendix A, II.B. Internal audit maintains  independence from front line units and independent risk management  through the following reporting structure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Chief Audit Executive has unrestricted access to the board's  audit committee to address risks and issues identified through internal  audit's activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The audit committee reviews and approves internal audit's  overall charter and audit plans;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The audit committee approves all decisions regarding the  appointment or removal and annual compensation and salary adjustment of  the Chief Audit Executive;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The audit committee or the Chief Executive Officer oversees the  Chief Audit Executive's administrative activities; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> No front line unit executive oversees internal audit.</p><p class="depth0">9. Parent company means the top-tier legal entity in a covered  bank's ownership structure.</p><p class="depth0">10. Risk appetite means the aggregate level and types of risk the  board of directors and management are willing to assume to achieve a  covered bank's strategic objectives and business plan, consistent with  applicable capital, liquidity, and other regulatory requirements.</p><p class="depth0">11. Risk profile means a point-in-time assessment of a covered  bank's risks, aggregated within and across each relevant risk category,  using methodologies consistent with the risk appetite statement  described in paragraph II.E. of these Guidelines.</p><p class="depth0">II. Standards for Risk Governance Framework</p><p class="depth0">A. Risk Governance Framework. A covered bank should establish and  adhere to a formal, written risk governance framework that is designed  by independent risk management and approved by the board of directors or  the board's risk committee. The risk governance framework should include  delegations of authority from the board of directors to management  committees and executive officers as well as the risk limits established  for material activities. Independent risk management should review and  update the risk governance framework at least annually, and as often as  needed to address improvements in industry risk management practices and  changes in the covered bank's risk profile caused by emerging risks, its  strategic plans, or other internal and external factors.</p><p class="depth0">B. Scope of Risk Governance Framework. The risk governance framework  should cover the following risk categories that apply to the covered  bank: Credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, price risk,  operational risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, and reputation risk.</p><p class="depth0">C. Roles and Responsibilities. The risk governance framework should  include well-defined risk management roles and responsibilities for  front line units, independent risk   management, and internal audit.\2\ The roles and responsibilities for  each of these organizational units should be: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ These roles and responsibilities are in addition to any roles  and responsibilities set forth in Appendices A, B, and C to Part 30.  Many of the risk management practices established and maintained by a  covered bank to meet these standards, including loan review and credit  underwriting and administration practices, should be components of its  risk governance framework, within the construct of the three distinct  units identified herein. In addition, existing OCC guidance sets forth  standards for establishing risk management programs for certain risks,  e.g., compliance risk management. These risk-specific programs should  also be considered components of the risk governance framework, within  the context of the three units described in paragraph II.C. of these  Guidelines. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">1. Role and Responsibilities of Front Line Units. Front line units  should take responsibility and be held accountable by the Chief  Executive Officer and the board of directors for appropriately assessing  and effectively managing all of the risks associated with their  activities. In fulfilling this responsibility, each front line unit  should, either alone or in conjunction with another organizational unit  that has the purpose of assisting a front line unit:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Assess, on an ongoing basis, the material risks associated with  its activities and use such risk assessments as the basis for fulfilling  its responsibilities under paragraphs II.C.1.(b) and (c) of these  Guidelines and for determining if actions need to be taken to strengthen  risk management or reduce risk given changes in the unit's risk profile  or other conditions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Establish and adhere to a set of written policies that include  front line unit risk limits as discussed in paragraph II.F. of these  Guidelines. Such policies should ensure risks associated with the front  line unit's activities are effectively identified, measured, monitored,  and controlled, consistent with the covered bank's risk appetite  statement, concentration risk limits, and all policies established  within the risk governance framework under paragraphs II.C.2.(c) and  II.G. through K. of these Guidelines;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Establish and adhere to procedures and processes, as necessary,  to maintain compliance with the policies described in paragraph  II.C.1.(b) of these Guidelines;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Adhere to all applicable policies, procedures, and processes  established by independent risk management;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Develop, attract, and retain talent and maintain staffing levels  required to carry out the unit's role and responsibilities effectively,  as set forth in paragraphs II.C.1.(a) through (d) of these Guidelines;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Establish and adhere to talent management processes that comply  with paragraph II.L. of these Guidelines; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Establish and adhere to compensation and performance management  programs that comply with paragraph II.M. of these Guidelines.</p><p class="depth0">2. Role and Responsibilities of Independent Risk Management.  Independent risk management should oversee the covered bank's risk- taking activities and assess risks and issues independent of front line  units. In fulfilling these responsibilities, independent risk management  should:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Take primary responsibility and be held accountable by the Chief  Executive Officer and the board of directors for designing a  comprehensive written risk governance framework that meets these  Guidelines and is commensurate with the size, complexity, and risk  profile of the covered bank;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Identify and assess, on an ongoing basis, the covered bank's  material aggregate risks and use such risk assessments as the basis for  fulfilling its responsibilities under paragraphs II.C.2.(c) and (d) of  these Guidelines and for determining if actions need to be taken to  strengthen risk management or reduce risk given changes in the covered  bank's risk profile or other conditions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Establish and adhere to enterprise policies that include  concentration risk limits. Such policies should state how aggregate  risks within the covered bank are effectively identified, measured,  monitored, and controlled, consistent with the covered bank's risk  appetite statement and all policies and processes established within the  risk governance framework under paragraphs II.G. through K. of these  Guidelines;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Establish and adhere to procedures and processes, as necessary,  to ensure compliance with the policies described in paragraph II.C.2.(c)  of these Guidelines;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Identify and communicate to the Chief Executive Officer and the  board of directors or the board's risk committee:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Material risks and significant instances where independent risk  management's assessment of risk differs from that of a front line unit;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Significant instances where a front line unit is not adhering  to the risk governance framework, including instances when front line  units do not meet the standards set forth in paragraph II.C.1. of these  Guidelines;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Identify and communicate to the board of directors or the  board's risk committee:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Material risks and significant instances where independent risk  management's assessment of risk differs from the Chief Executive  Officer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Significant instances where the Chief Executive Officer is not  adhering to, or holding front line units accountable for adhering to,  the risk governance framework;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Develop, attract, and retain talent and maintain staffing levels  required to carry out its role and responsibilities effectively, as set  forth in paragraphs II.C.2.(a) through (f) of these Guidelines;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Establish and adhere to talent management processes that comply  with paragraph II.L. of these Guidelines; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Establish and adhere to compensation and performance management  programs that comply with paragraph II.M. of these Guidelines.</p><p class="depth0">3. Role and Responsibilities of Internal Audit. In addition to  meeting the standards set forth in appendix A of part 30, internal audit  should ensure that the covered bank's risk governance framework complies  with these Guidelines and is appropriate for the size, complexity, and  risk profile of the covered bank. In carrying out its responsibilities,  internal audit should:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Maintain a complete and current inventory of all of the covered  bank's material processes, product lines, services, and functions, and  assess the risks, including emerging risks, associated with each, which  collectively provide a basis for the audit plan described in paragraph  II.C.3.(b) of these Guidelines;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Establish and adhere to an audit plan that is periodically  reviewed and updated that takes into account the covered bank's risk  profile, emerging risks, and issues, and establishes the frequency with  which activities should be audited. The audit plan should require  internal audit to evaluate the adequacy of and compliance with policies,  procedures, and processes established by front line units and  independent risk management under the risk governance framework.  Significant changes to the audit plan should be communicated to the  board's audit committee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Report in writing, conclusions and material issues and  recommendations from audit work carried out under the audit plan  described in paragraph II.C.3.(b) of these Guidelines to the board's  audit committee. Internal audit's reports to the audit committee should  also identify the root cause of any material issues and include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A determination of whether the root cause creates an issue that  has an impact on one organizational unit or multiple organizational  units within the covered bank; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A determination of the effectiveness of front line units and  independent risk management in identifying and resolving issues in a  timely manner;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Establish and adhere to processes for independently assessing  the design and ongoing effectiveness of the risk governance framework on  at least an annual basis. The independent assessment should include a  conclusion on the covered bank's compliance with the standards set forth  in these Guidelines; \3\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ The annual independent assessment of the risk governance  framework may be conducted by internal audit, an external party, or  internal audit in conjunction with an external party. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Identify and communicate to the board's audit committee  significant instances where front line units or independent risk  management are not adhering to the risk governance framework;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Establish a quality assurance program that ensures internal  audit's policies, procedures, and processes comply with applicable  regulatory and industry guidance, are appropriate for the size,  complexity, and risk profile of the covered bank, are updated to reflect  changes to internal and external risk factors, emerging risks, and  improvements in industry internal audit practices, and are consistently  followed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Develop, attract, and retain talent and maintain staffing levels  required to effectively carry out its role and responsibilities, as set  forth in paragraphs II.C.3.(a) through (f) of these Guidelines;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Establish and adhere to talent management processes that comply  with paragraph II.L. of these Guidelines; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Establish and adhere to compensation and performance management  programs that comply with paragraph II.M. of these Guidelines.</p><p class="depth0">D. Strategic Plan. The Chief Executive Officer should be responsible  for the development of a written strategic plan with input from front  line units, independent risk management, and internal audit. The board  of directors should evaluate and approve the strategic plan and monitor  management's efforts to implement the strategic plan at least annually.  The strategic plan should cover, at a minimum, a three-year period and:</p><p class="depth0">1. Contain a comprehensive assessment of risks that currently have  an impact on the covered bank or that could have an impact on the  covered bank during the period covered by the strategic plan;</p><p class="depth0">2. Articulate an overall mission statement and strategic objectives  for the covered bank, and include an explanation of how the covered bank  will achieve those objectives;</p><p class="depth0">3. Include an explanation of how the covered bank will update, as  necessary, the risk governance framework to account for changes in the  covered bank's risk profile projected under the strategic plan; and</p><p class="depth0">4. Be reviewed, updated, and approved, as necessary, due to changes  in the covered bank's risk profile or operating environment that were  not contemplated when the strategic plan was developed.</p><p class="depth0">E. Risk Appetite Statement. A covered bank should have a  comprehensive written statement that articulates the covered bank's risk  appetite and serves as the basis for the risk governance framework. The  risk appetite statement should include both qualitative components and  quantitative limits. The qualitative components should describe a safe  and sound risk culture and how the covered bank will assess and accept  risks, including those that are difficult to quantify. Quantitative  limits should incorporate sound stress testing processes, as  appropriate, and address the covered bank's earnings, capital, and  liquidity. The covered bank should set limits at levels that take into  account appropriate capital and liquidity buffers and prompt management  and the board of directors to reduce risk before the covered bank's risk  profile jeopardizes the adequacy of its earnings, liquidity, and  capital.\4\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ Where possible, covered banks should establish aggregate risk  appetite limits that can be disaggregated and applied at the front line  unit level. However, where this is not possible, covered banks should  establish limits that reasonably reflect the aggregate level of risk  that the board of directors and executive management are willing to  accept. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">F. Concentration and Front Line Unit Risk Limits. The risk  governance framework should include concentration risk limits and, as  applicable, front line unit risk limits, for the relevant risks.  Concentration and front line unit risk limits should limit excessive  risk taking and, when aggregated across such units, provide that these  risks do not exceed the limits established in the covered bank's risk  appetite statement.</p><p class="depth0">G. Risk Appetite Review, Monitoring, and Communication Processes.  The risk governance framework should require: \5\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\5\ With regard to paragraphs 3., 4., and 5. in this paragraph  II.G., the frequency of monitoring and reporting should be performed  more often, as necessary, based on the size and volatility of risks and  any material change in the covered bank's business model, strategy, risk  profile, or market conditions. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">1. Review and approval of the risk appetite statement by the board  of directors or the board's risk committee at least annually or more  frequently, as necessary, based on the size and volatility of risks and  any material changes in the covered bank's business model, strategy,  risk profile, or market conditions;</p><p class="depth0">2. Initial communication and ongoing reinforcement of the covered  bank's risk appetite statement throughout the covered bank in a manner  that causes all employees to align their risk-taking decisions with  applicable aspects of the risk appetite statement;</p><p class="depth0">3. Monitoring by independent risk management of the covered bank's  risk profile relative to its risk appetite and compliance with  concentration risk limits and reporting on such monitoring to the board  of directors or the board's risk committee at least quarterly;</p><p class="depth0">4. Monitoring by front line units of compliance with their  respective risk limits and reporting to independent risk management at  least quarterly; and</p><p class="depth0">5. When necessary due to the level and type of risk, monitoring by  independent risk management of front line units' compliance with front  line unit risk limits, ongoing communication with front line units  regarding adherence to these limits, and reporting of any concerns to  the Chief Executive Officer and the board of directors or the board's  risk committee, as set forth in paragraphs II.C.2.(e) and (f) of these  Guidelines, all at least quarterly.</p><p class="depth0">H. Processes Governing Risk Limit Breaches. A covered bank should  establish and adhere to processes that require front line units and  independent risk management, in conjunction with their respective  responsibilities, to:</p><p class="depth0">1. Identify breaches of the risk appetite statement, concentration  risk limits, and front line unit risk limits;</p><p class="depth0">2. Distinguish breaches based on the severity of their impact on the  covered bank;</p><p class="depth0">3. Establish protocols for when and how to inform the board of  directors, front line unit management, independent risk management,  internal audit, and the OCC of a risk limit breach that takes into  account the severity of the breach and its impact on the covered bank;</p><p class="depth0">4. Include in the protocols established in paragraph II.H.3. of  these Guidelines the requirement to provide a written description of how  a breach will be, or has been, resolved; and</p><p class="depth0">5.

A covered bank's board of  directors should actively oversee the covered bank's risk-taking  activities and hold management accountable for adhering to the risk  governance framework.
