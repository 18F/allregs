                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart establishes the procedures for applying for an  exception or exemption, as provided for in section 504 (42 U.S.C. 7194)  of the Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.),  from a rule, regulation or DOE action having the effect of a rule as  defined by 5 U.S.C. 551(4), based on an assertion of serious hardship,  gross inequity or unfair distribution of burdens, and for consideration  of such application by the OHA. The procedures contained in this subpart  may be incorporated by reference in another DOE rule or regulation which  invokes the adjudicatory authority of the Office of Hearings and  Appeals. The procedures may also be made applicable to proceedings  undertaken at the direction of an appropriate DOE official if  incorporated by reference in the delegation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The filing of an application for an exception shall not  constitute grounds for noncompliance with the requirements from which an  exception is sought, unless a stay has been issued in accordance with  subpart D of this part.
