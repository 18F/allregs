For additional copies of records not covered by section 708 the fee will be a minimum of $15.00 for up to 15 pages and $.50 per page over 15. The Office will require prepayment of fees estimated to exceed $25.00 and will remit any excess paid or bill an additional amount according to the differences between the final fee charged and the amount prepaid. When prepayment is required, a request is not deemed ``received'' until prepayment has been made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Copyright Office may waive the fee requirement whenever it determines that such waiver would be in the public interest.
