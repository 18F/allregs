The rule set out in Schedule I for heading 7402 specifies a change in tariff classification from any other chapter. There is no applicable regional value-content requirement for this heading. Therefore, in order for the copper anode to qualify as an originating good under the rule set out in Schedule I, Producer A may not use in the production of the copper anode any non-originating material provided for in Chapter 74.</p><p class="depth0">All of the materials used in the production of the copper anode are originating materials, with the exception of a small amount of copper scrap provided for in heading 7404, that is in the same chapter as the copper anode. Under section 5(1), if the value of the non-originating copper scrap does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of the copper anode or the total cost of the copper anode, whichever is applicable, the copper anode would be considered an originating good.Example 2: section 5(2)</p><p class="depth0">Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, uses originating materials and non-originating materials in the production of ceiling fans provided for in subheading 8414.51. There are two alternative rules set out in Schedule I for subheading 8414.51, one of which specifies a change in tariff classification from any other heading. The other rule specifies both a change in tariff classification from the subheading under which parts of the ceiling fans are classified and a regional value-content requirement. Therefore, in order for the ceiling fan to qualify as an originating good under the first of the alternative rules, all of the materials that are classified under the subheading for parts of ceiling fans and used in the production of the completed ceiling fan must be originating materials.</p><p class="depth0">In this case, all of the non-originating materials used in the production of the ceiling fan satisfy the change in tariff classification set out in the rule that specifies a change in tariff classification from any other heading, with the exception of one non-originating material that is classified under the subheading for parts of ceiling fans. Under section 5(1), if the value of the non-originating material that does not satisfy the change in tariff classification specified in the first rule does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of the ceiling fan or the total

cost of the ceiling fan, whichever is applicable, the ceiling fan would be considered an originating good. Therefore, under section 5(2), the ceiling fan would not be required to satisfy the alternative rule that specifies both a change in tariff classification and a regional value-content requirement.Example 3: section 5(2)</p><p class="depth0">Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, uses originating materials and non-originating materials in the production of plastic bags provided for in subheading 3923.29. The rule set out in Schedule I for subheading 3923.29 specifies both a change in tariff classification from any other heading, except from subheadings 3920.20 or 3920.71, under which certain plastic materials are classified, and a regional value-content requirement. Therefore, with respect to that part of the rule that specifies a change in tariff classification, in order for the plastic bag to qualify as an originating good, any plastic materials that are classified under subheading 3920.20 or 3920.71 and that are used in the production of the plastic bag must be originating materials.</p><p class="depth0">In this case, all of the non-originating materials used in the production of the plastic bag satisfy the specified change in tariff classification, with the exception of a small amount of plastic materials classified under subheading 3920.71. Section 5(1) provides that the plastic bag can be considered an originating good if the value of the non-originating plastic materials that do not satisfy the specified change in tariff classification does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of the plastic bag or the total cost of the plastic bag, whichever is applicable. In this case, the value of those non-originating materials that do not satisfy the specified change in tariff classification does not exceed the seven percent limit.</p><p class="depth0">However, the rule set out in Schedule I for subheading 3923.29 specifies both a change in tariff classification and a regional value-content requirement. Therefore, under section 5(1)(c), in order to be considered an originating good, the plastic bag must also, except as otherwise provided in section 5(5), satisfy the regional value-content requirement specified in that rule. As provided in section 5(1)(c), the value of the non-originating materials that do not satisfy the specified change in tariff classification, together with the value of all other non-originating materials used in the production of the plastic bag, will be taken into account in calculating the regional value content of the plastic bag.Example 4: section 5(5)</p><p class="depth0">Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, primarily uses originating materials in the production of shoes provided for in heading 6405. The rule set out in Schedule I for heading 6405 specifies both a change in tariff classification from any subheading other than subheadings 6401.10 through 6406.10 and a regional value-content requirement.</p><p class="depth0">With the exception of a small amount of materials provided for in Chapter 39, all of the materials used in the production of the shoes are originating materials.</p><p class="depth0">Under section 5(5), if the value of all of the non-originating materials used in the production of the shoes does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of the shoes or the total cost of the shoes, whichever is applicable, the shoes are not required to satisfy the regional value-content requirement specified in the rule set out in Schedule I in order to be considered originating goods.Example 5: section 5(5)</p><p class="depth0">Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces barbers' chairs provided for in subheading 9402.10. The rule set out in Schedule I for goods provided for in heading 9402 specifies a change in tariff classification from any other chapter. All of the materials used in the production of these chairs are originating materials, with the exception of a small quantity of non-originating materials that are classified as parts of barbers' chairs. These parts undergo no change in tariff classification because subheading 9402.10 provides for both barbers' chairs and their parts.</p><p class="depth0">Although Producer A's barbers' chairs do not qualify as originating goods under the rule set out in Schedule I, section 4(4)(b) provides, among other things, that, where there is no change in tariff classification from the non-originating materials to the goods because the subheading under which the goods are classified provides for both the goods and their parts, the goods shall qualify as originating goods if they satisfy a specified regional value-content requirement.</p><p class="depth0">However, under section 5(5), if the value of the non-originating materials does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of the barbers' chairs or the total cost of the barbers' chairs, whichever is applicable, the barbers' chairs will be considered originating goods and are not required to satisfy the regional value-content requirement set out in section 4(4)(b)(v).Example 6: sections 5 (6) and (7)</p><p class="depth0">Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces women's dresses provided for in subheading 6204.41 from fine wool fabric of heading 5112. This fine wool fabric, also produced by Producer A, is the component of the dress that determines its tariff classification under subheading 6204.41.</p><p class="depth0">The rule set out in Schedule I for subheading 6204.41, under which the dress is classified, specifies both a change in tariff classification from any other chapter, except from those headings and chapters under which certain yarns and fabrics, including combed wool yarn and wool fabric, are classified, and a requirement that the good be cut

and sewn or otherwise assembled in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries.</p><p class="depth0">Therefore, with respect to that part of the rule that specifies a change in tariff classification, in order for the dress to qualify as an originating good, the combed wool yarn and the fine wool fabric made therefrom that are used by Producer A in the production of the dress must be originating materials.</p><p class="depth0">At one point Producer A uses a small quantity of non-originating combed wool yarn in the production of the fine wool fabric. Under section 5(6), if the total weight of the non-originating combed wool yarn does not exceed seven percent of the total weight of all the yarn used in the production of the component of the dress that determines its tariff classification, that is, the wool fabric, the dress would be considered an originating good.</p><p class="depth0">PART III</p><p class="depth0">SECTION 6.

Example 9: section 6(12)</p><p class="depth0">Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces Good A that is subject to a regional value-content requirement. The producer chooses that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the net cost method. Producer A buys Material X from Producer B, located in a NAFTA country.

Material X is a non-originating material and is used in the production of Good A. Producer A provides Producer B, at no charge, with tools to be used in the production of Material X. The cost of the tools that is recorded on the books of Producer A has been expensed in the current year. Pursuant to section 5(1)(b)(ii) of Schedule VIII, the value of the tools is included in the value of Material X. Therefore, the cost of the tools that is recorded on the books of Producer A and that has been expensed in the current year cannot be included as a separate cost in the net cost of Good A because it has already been included in the value of Material X.Example 10: section 6(12)</p><p class="depth0">Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces Good A that is subject to a regional value-content requirement. The producer chooses that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the net cost method and averages the calculation over the producer's fiscal year under section 6(15). Producer A determines that during that fiscal year Producer A incurred a gain on foreign currency conversion of $10,000 and a loss on foreign currency conversion of $8,000, resulting in a net gain of $2,000. Producer A also determines that $7,000 of the gain on foreign currency conversion and $6,000 of the loss on foreign currency conversion is related to the purchase of non-originating materials used in the production of Good A, and $3,000 of the gain on foreign currency conversion and $2,000 of the loss on foreign currency conversion is not related to the production of Good A. The producer determines that the total cost of Good A is $45,000 before deducting the $1,000 net gain on foreign currency conversion related to the production of Good A. The total cost of Good A is therefore $44,000.

(20) Each of the following examples is an ``Example'' as referred to in section 2(4).Example 1: section 7(2), Customs Value not Determined in a Manner Consistent with Schedule VIII</p><p class="depth0">Producer A, located in NAFTA country A, imports material A into NAFTA country A. Producer A purchased material A from a middleman located in country B. The middleman purchased the material from a manufacturer located in country B. Under the laws in NAFTA country A that implement the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the customs value of material A was based on the price actually paid or payable by the middleman to the manufacturer. Producer A uses material A to produce Good C, and exports Good C to NAFTA country D. Good C is subject to a regional value-content requirement.</p><p class="depth0">Under section 4(1) of Schedule VIII, the price actually paid or payable is the total payment made or to be made by the producer to or for the benefit of the seller of the material. Section 1 of that Schedule defines producer and seller for purposes of the Schedule. A producer is the person who uses the material in the production of a good that is subject to a regional value-content requirement. A seller is the person who sells the material being valued to the producer.</p><p class="depth0">The customs value of material A was not determined in a manner consistent with Schedule VIII because it was based on the price actually paid or payable by the middleman to the manufacturer, rather than on the price actually paid or payable by Producer A to the middleman. Thus, section 7(2) applies and material A is valued in accordance with Schedule VIII.Example 2: section 7(5), Value of Intermediate Materials</p><p class="depth0">A producer located in a NAFTA country produces Good B, which is subject to a regional value-content requirement under section 4(2)(b). The producer also produces Material A, which is used in the production of Good B. Both originating materials and non-originating materials are used in the production of Material A. Material A is subject to a change in tariff classification requirement under section 4(2)(a). The costs to produce Material A are the following:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Product costs:</p><p class="depth0">Value of originating materials.........................        $1.00</p><p class="depth0">Value of non-originating materials.....................         7.50</p><p class="depth0">Other product costs....................................         1.50Period costs (including $0.30 in royalties)................         0.50Other costs................................................         0.10</p><p class="depth0">------------Total cost of Material A...................................       $10.60------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">The producer designates Material A as an intermediate material and determines that, because all of the non-originating materials that are used in the production of Material A undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set out in Schedule I, Material A would, under paragraph 4(2)(a) qualify as an originating material. The cost of the non-originating materials used in the production of Material A is therefore not included in the value of non-originating materials that are used in the production of Good B for the purpose of determining the regional value content of Good B. Because Material A has been

designated as an intermediate material, the total cost of Material A, which is $10.60, is treated as the cost of originating materials for the purpose of calculating the regional value content of Good B. The total cost of Good B is determined in accordance with the following figures:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Product costs:</p><p class="depth0">Value of originating materials</p><p class="depth0">--intermediate materials...........................       $10.60</p><p class="depth0">--other materials..................................         3.00</p><p class="depth0">Value of non-originating materials.....................         5.50</p><p class="depth0">Other product costs....................................         6.50Period costs...............................................         2.50Other costs................................................         0.10</p><p class="depth0">------------Total cost of Good B.......................................       $28.20------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 3: section 7(5), Effects of the Designation of Self-produced Materials on Net Cost</p><p class="depth0">The ability to designate intermediate materials helps to put the vertically integrated producer who is self-producing materials that are used in the production of a good on par with a producer who is purchasing materials and valuing those materials in accordance with subsection 7(1).

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06SE95.005</p><p class="depth0">The regional value content of Good B is 76.1 percent, and Good B, therefore, qualifies as an originating good.Example 4: Originating Materials Acquired from a Producer Who Produced Them Using Intermediate Materials</p><p class="depth0">Producer A, located in NAFTA country A, produces switches. In order for the switches to qualify as originating goods, Producer A designates subassemblies of the switches as intermediate materials. The subassemblies are subject to a regional value-content requirement. They satisfy that requirement, and qualify as originating materials. The switches are also subject to a regional value-content requirement, and, with the subassemblies designated as intermediate materials, are determined to have a regional value content of 65 percent.</p><p class="depth0">Producer A sells the switches to Producer B, located in NAFTA country B, who uses them to produce switch assemblies that are used in the production of Good B. The switch assemblies are subject to a regional value-content requirement. Producers A and B are not accumulating their production within the meaning of section 14. Producer B is therefore able, under section 7(4), to designate the switch assemblies as intermediate materials.</p><p class="depth0">If Producers A and B were accumulating their production within the meaning of section 14, Producer B would be unable to designate the switch assemblies as intermediate materials, because the production of both producers would be considered to be the production of one producer.Example 5: Single Producer and Successive Designations of Materials Subject to a Regional Value-Content Requirement as Intermediate Materials</p><p class="depth0">Producer A, located in NAFTA country, produces Material X and uses Material X in the production of Good B. Material X qualifies as an originating material because it satisfies the applicable regional value-content requirement. Producer A designates Material A as an intermediate material.</p><p class="depth0">Producer A uses Material X in the production of Material Y, which is also used in the production of Good B. Material Y is also subject to a regional value-content requirement. Under the proviso set out in section 7(4), Producer A cannot designate Material Y as an intermediate material, even if Material Y satisfies the applicable regional value-content requirement, because Material X was already designated by Producer A as an intermediate material.Example 6: Single Producer and Multiple Designations of Materials as Intermediate Materials</p><p class="depth0">Producer X, who is located in NAFTA country X, uses non-originating materials in the production of self-produced materials A, B, and C. None of the self-produced materials are used in the production of any of the other self-produced materials.</p><p class="depth0">Producer X uses the self-produced materials in the production of Good O, which is exported to NAFTA country Y. Materials A, B and C qualify as originating materials because they satisfy the applicable regional value-content requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Because none of the self-produced materials are used in the production of any of the other self-produced materials, then even though each self-produced material is subject to a regional value-content requirement, Producer X may, under section 7(4), designate all of the self-produced materials as intermediate materials. The proviso set out in section 7(4) only applies where self-produced materials are used in the production of other self-produced materials and both are subject to a regional value-content requirement.Example 7: section 7(17)</p><p class="depth0">The following are examples of accessories, spare parts or tools that are delivered with a good and form part of the good's standard accessories, spare parts or tools:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> consumables that must be replaced at regular intervals, such as dust collectors for an air-conditioning system,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> a carrying case for equipment,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> a dust cover for a machine,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> an operational manual for a vehicle,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> brackets to attach equipment to a wall,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> a bicycle tool kit or a car jack,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> a set of wrenches to change the bit on a chuck,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> a brush or other tool to clean out a machine, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> electrical cords and power bars for use with electronic goods.Example 8: Value of Indirect Materials that are Assists</p><p class="depth0">Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces Good A that is subject to a regional value-content requirement. The producer chooses that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the net cost method. Producer A buys Material X from Producer B, located in a NAFTA country, and uses it in the production of Good A. Producer A provides to Producer B, at no charge, tools to be used in the production of Material X. The tools have a value of $100 which is expensed in the current year by Producer A.</p><p class="depth0">Material X is subject to a regional value-content requirement which Producer B chooses to calculate using the net cost method. For purposes of determining the value of non-originating materials in order to calculate the regional value content of Material X, the tools are considered to be an originating material because they are an indirect material. However, pursuant to section 7(11) they have a value of nil because the cost of the tools with respect to Material X is not recorded on the books of Producer B.</p><p class="depth0">It is determined that Material X is a non-originating material. The cost of the tools that is recorded on the books of producer A is expensed in the current year. Pursuant to section 5 of Schedule VIII, the value of the tools (see section 5(1)(b)(ii) of Schedule VIII) must be included in the value of Material X by Producer A when calculating the regional value content of Good A. The cost of the tools, although recorded on the books of producer A, cannot be included as a separate cost in the net cost of Good A because it is already included in the value of Material X. The entire cost of Material X, which includes the cost of the tools, is included in the value of non-originating materials for purposes of the regional value content of Good A.</p><p class="depth0">PART V</p><p class="depth0">AUTOMOTIVE GOODS</p><p class="depth0">SECTION 8.

(10) Each of the following examples is an ``Example'' as referred to in section 2(4).Example 1:</p><p class="depth0">Nuts and bolts provided for in heading 7318 are imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and are used in the territory of a NAFTA country in the production of a light-duty automotive good referred to in section 9(1). Heading 7318 is not listed in Schedule IV so the nuts and bolts are not traced materials.</p><p class="depth0">Because the nuts and bolts are not traced materials the value, under section 9(1), of the nuts and bolts is not included in the value of non-originating materials used in the light-duty automotive good even though the nuts and bolts are imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries.</p><p class="depth0">The value, under section 9(9)(b), of the nuts and bolts is included in the net cost of the light-duty automotive good for the purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), regional value content of the motor vehicle.Example 2:</p><p class="depth0">A rear view mirror provided for in subheading 7009.10 is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and is used in the territory of a NAFTA country as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle.</p><p class="depth0">Subheading 7009.10 is listed in Schedule IV. The rear view mirror is a traced material. For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), regional value content of the light-duty vehicle, the value of the mirror is included in the value of non-originating materials in accordance with sections 9(2) through (9).Example 3:</p><p class="depth0">Glass provided for in heading 7005 is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and is used in the territory of NAFTA country A in the production of a rear view mirror. The rear view mirror is a non-originating good because it fails to satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification.</p><p class="depth0">That rear view mirror is exported to NAFTA country B where it is used as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle. Even though the rear view mirror is a non-originating material and is provided for in a tariff item listed in Schedule IV, it is not a traced material because it was

not imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries.</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of a light-duty vehicle in which the rear view mirror is incorporated, the value of the rear view mirror, under section 9(1), is not included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-duty vehicle.</p><p class="depth0">Even though the glass provided for in heading 7005 that was used in the production of the rear view mirror and incorporated into the light-duty vehicle was imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, the glass is not a traced material because heading 7005 is not listed in Schedule IV. For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle that incorporates the glass, the value of the glass is not included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-duty vehicle. The value of the rear view mirror would be included in the net cost of the light-duty vehicle, but the value of the imported glass would not be separately included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle.Example 4:</p><p class="depth0">An electric motor provided for in subheading 8501.10 is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and is used in the territory of a NAFTA country in the production of a seat frame provided for in subheading 9401.90. The seat frame, with the electric motor attached, is sold to a producer of seats provided for in subheading 9401.20. The seat producer sells the seat to a producer of light-duty vehicles. The seat is to be used as original equipment in the production of that light-duty vehicle.</p><p class="depth0">Subheadings 8501.10 and 9401.20 are listed in Schedule IV; subheading 9401.90 is not. The electric motor is a traced material; the seat is not a traced material because it was not imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries.</p><p class="depth0">The seat is a light-duty automotive good referred to in section 9(1). For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the seat, the value of traced materials incorporated into it is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the seat. The value of the electric motor is included in that value. (However, the value of the motor would not be included separately in the net cost of the seat because the value of the motor is included as part of the cost of the seat frame.)</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle, the value of the electric motor is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-duty vehicle, even if the seat is an originating material.Example 5:</p><p class="depth0">Cast blocks, cast heads and connecting rod assemblies provided for in heading 8409 are imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries by an engine producer, who has title to them at the time of importation, and are used by the producer in the territory of NAFTA country A in the production of an engine provided for in heading 8407. After the regional value content of the engine is calculated, the engine is an originating good. It is not a traced material because it was not imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries. The engine is exported to NAFTA country B, to be used as original equipment by a producer of light-duty vehicles.</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle that incorporates the engine, because heading 8409 is listed in Schedule IV and because the cast blocks, cast heads and connecting rod assemblies were imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and are incorporated into the light-duty vehicle, the value of those materials, which are traced materials, is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-duty vehicle, even though the engine is an originating material.</p><p class="depth0">The producer of the light-duty vehicle did not import the traced materials. However, because that producer has a statement referred to in section 9(2)(c) and that statement states the value of non-originating materials of the traced materials in accordance with section 12(2), the producer of the light-duty vehicle may, in accordance with section 9(8), use that value as the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle with respect to that engine.Example 6:</p><p class="depth0">Aluminum ingots provided for in subheading 7601.10 and piston assemblies provided for in heading 8409 are imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries by an engine producer and are used by that producer in the territory of NAFTA country A in the production of an engine provided for in heading 8407. The aluminum ingots are used by the producer to produce an engine block; the piston assembly is then incorporated into the engine block and the producer designates, in accordance with section 7(4), a short block provided for in heading 8409 as an intermediate material. The intermediate material qualifies as an originating material. The engine that incorporates the short block is exported to NAFTA country B and used as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle. The piston assemblies provided for in heading 8409 are traced materials; neither the engine nor the short block are traced materials because they were not imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries.</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the engine, the value of the piston assemblies is included, under section 9(9)(a)(ii), in the value of non-originating materials, even if the intermediate material is an originating material. However, the value of the aluminum ingots is not included in the value of non-originating materials because subheading 7601.10 is not listed in Schedule IV. The value of the aluminum ingots does not need to be included separately in the net cost of the engine because that value is included in the value of the intermediate material, and the total cost of the intermediate material is included in the net cost of the engine.</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle that incorporates the engine (and the piston assemblies), the value of the piston assemblies incorporated into that light-duty vehicle is included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle.Example 7:</p><p class="depth0">An engine provided for in heading 8407 is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries. The producer of the engine, located in the country from which the engine is imported, used in the production of the engine a piston assembly provided for in heading 8409 that was produced in a NAFTA country and is an originating good. The engine is used in the territory of a NAFTA country as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle. The engine is a traced material.</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of a light-duty vehicle that incorporates that engine, the value of the engine is included in the value of non-originating materials of that light-duty vehicle. The value of the piston assembly, which was, before its exportation to outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, an originating good, shall not be deducted from the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-duty vehicle. Under section 18 (transshipment), the piston assembly is no longer considered to be an originating good because it was used in the production of a good outside the territories of the NAFTA countries.Example 8:</p><p class="depth0">A wholesaler, located in City A in the territory of a NAFTA country, imports from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries rubber hoses provided for in heading 4009, which is listed in Schedule IV.

The wholesaler sells the good to a producer located in the territory of the NAFTA country who uses the hose to produce a power steering hose assembly, also provided for in heading 4009. The power steering hose assembly is then sold to a producer of light-duty vehicles who uses that good in the production of a

light-duty vehicle. The rubber hose is a traced material; the power steering hose assembly is not a traced material because it was not imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries.</p><p class="depth0">The wholesaler who imported the rubber hose from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries has title to it at the time of importation. The customs value of the good is $3, including freight and insurance and all other costs incurred in transporting the good to the first place at which it was received in the territory of the NAFTA country. Duties and fees and all other costs referred to in section 9(4), paid by the wholesaler with respect to the good, total an additional $1. The wholesaler sells the good to the producer of the power steering hose assemblies for $5, not including freight to the location of that producer. The power steering hose producer pays $2 to have the good delivered to the location of production. The value of the power steering hose assembly sold to the light-duty vehicle producer is $10, including freight for delivery of the goods to the location of the light-duty vehicle producer.</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> if the motor vehicle producer has a statement referred to in section 9(2)(c) from the producer of the power steering hose assembly that states the customs value of the imported rubber hose incorporated in the power steering hose assembly, and the value of the duties, fees and other costs referred to in section 9(4), the producer may use those values as the value of non-originating materials with respect to that traced good: in this situation, that value would be the customs value of $3 and the cost of duties and fees of $1, provided that the wholesaler has provided the producer of the power steering hose assembly with the information regarding the customs value of the imported good and the other costs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> if the light-duty vehicle producer has a statement from the producer of the power steering hose assembly that states the value of the imported hose, with respect to the transaction in which the power steering hose assembly producer acquires the imported hose from the wholesaler, the light-duty vehicle producer may include that value as the value of non-originating materials, in accordance with section 9(2)(e): in this situation, that value is $5; and the $2 cost of transporting the good from the location of the wholesaler to the location of the producer, because that cost is separately identified, would not be included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> if the light-duty vehicle producer has a statement referred to in section 9(2)(f) signed by the producer of the power steering hose assembly, the light-duty vehicle producer may use the formula set out in section 9(2)(f) to calculate the value of non-originating materials with respect to that acquired material: in this situation, assuming the regional value content is 55 per cent, the value of non-originating materials would be $4.50; and because the cost of transportation from the location of the producer of the power steering hose assembly to the location of the light-duty vehicle producer is included in the purchase price and not separately identified, it may not be deducted from the purchase price, because the formula referred to in section 9(2)(f) does not allow for the deduction of transportation costs that would otherwise not be non-originating;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> if the light-duty vehicle producer has a statement referred to in section 9(2)(g) signed by the producer of the power steering hose assembly, the light-duty vehicle producer may use the formula set out in section 9(2)(g) to calculate the value of non-originating materials with respect to that acquired material: in this situation, assuming the regional value-content requirement is 50 per cent, the value of non-originating materials would be $5; and because the cost of transportation from the location of the producer of the power steering hose assembly to the location of the light-duty vehicle producer is included in the purchase price and not separately identified, it may not be deducted from the purchase price, because the formula referred to in section 9(2)(g) does not allow for the deduction of transportation costs that would otherwise not be non-originating; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> if the light-duty vehicle producer does not have a statement referred to in any of sections 9(2)(c) through (h) from the producer of the power steering hose assembly, the light-duty vehicle producer includes in the value of non-originating materials of the vehicles the value, determined in accordance with section 9(2)(i), of the power steering hose assembly: in this situation, that amount would be $10, the cost to the producer of acquiring that material.Example 10:</p><p class="depth0">A producer of light-duty vehicles located in City C in the territory of a NAFTA country imports from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries rubber hose provided for in heading 4009, which is listed in Schedule IV, and uses that good as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle.</p><p class="depth0">The rubber hose arrives at City A in the NAFTA country, but the producer of the light-duty vehicle does not have title to the good; it is transported under bond to City B, and on its arrival in City B, the producer of the light-duty vehicle takes title to it and

In this situation, the value of non-originating materials would be the customs value of the traced material, $4, the cost of duties taxes and other fees, $1, the cost of transporting the material to City A, $3, and the cost of transporting that material from City A to City B, $2, for a total of $10. The $1 cost of transporting the good from City B to the location of the producer in City C would not be included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle because a person of a NAFTA country has taken title to the traced material.Example 11:</p><p class="depth0">A radiator provided for in subheading 8708.91 is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries by a producer of light-duty vehicles and is used in the territory of a NAFTA country as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle.</p><p class="depth0">The radiator is transported by ship from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and arrives in the territory of the NAFTA country at City A.

The radiator is a traced material.</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle, the value of the radiator is included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle. The costs of any freight, insurance, packing and other costs incurred in transporting the radiator to City B are included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle, including the cost of transporting the radiator from City A to City B. The costs of any freight, insurance, packing and other costs that were incurred in transporting the radiator from City B to the location of the producer are not included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle.Example 12:</p><p class="depth0">Producer X, located in NAFTA country A, produces a car seat of subheading No. 9401.20 that is used in the production of a light-duty vehicle.

For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates that engine (and incorporates the rocker arm assembly), the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle is determined under section 10(1)(e) with respect to that engine.

For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle, the value, under section 10(1)(f), of the rocker arm assembly is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.Example 3: An automotive component is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries</p><p class="depth0">A transmission, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used in that country as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle.

If the automotive component assembly that incorporates the imported transmission is an originating material, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the automotive component assembly is determined, at the choice of the producer, under any of section 10(1)(d) (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). (See example 1 for more detailed explanations of these provisions.) If the automotive component assembly that incorporates the imported transmission is a non-originating material, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the automotive component assembly is determined, at the choice of the producer, under section 10(1)(e) (i) or (ii). (See example 1 for more detailed explanations of these provisions.)</p><p class="depth0">Regardless of whether the automotive component assembly is an originating material or a non-originating material, the value of the automotive component that was imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries is included in the value of

non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle. The transmission is a non-originating material, and, for purposes of calculating the regional value content of an automotive component assembly or heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates that transmission, the value of the transmission is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the automotive component assembly or heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates it.Example 5: A material is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries</p><p class="depth0">An aluminum ingot, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used in that country in the production of cast block that will be used in an engine that will be used as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. The aluminum ingot is not a listed material; the cast block is a listed material; the engine is an automotive component.</p><p class="depth0">Situation 1: Use of the material in an intermediate material that is a listed material</p><p class="depth0">The engine producer designates the cast block as an intermediate material under section 7(4). For purposes of determining the origin of that cast block, because the aluminum ingot is classified under a different heading than the cast block, the cast block satisfies the applicable change in tariff classification and is an originating material.</p><p class="depth0">Situation 2: Use of the listed material incorporating the material</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the engine that incorporates that cast block (and thus incorporates the aluminum ingot), the value of non-originating materials is determined under section 10(1). Because none of sections 10(1) (a) through (f) require that a listed material that is an originating material be included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of a good, the value of the cast block is not included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the engine or in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of an automotive component assembly or heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates the engine.</p><p class="depth0">Because section 10(1)(d) does not refer to a listed material that is an originating material, the value of the non-originating aluminum ingot used in the production of the originating cast block is not included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of any good or material that incorporates the originating cast block.Example 6: A non-originating listed material is used to produce a sub-component that is used to produce another sub-component</p><p class="depth0">A crankshaft, produced in the territory of NAFTA country A from a forging imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is a non-originating material. The crankshaft is sold to another producer, located in the same country, who uses it to produce an originating block assembly. That block assembly is sold to another producer, also located in the same country, who uses it to produce a finished block. The finished block is sold to a producer of engines, who is located in NAFTA country B, for use in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. The crankshaft is a listed material; the block assembly is a sub-component, as is the finished block.</p><p class="depth0">Situation 1: Calculating the regional value content of the finished block</p><p class="depth0">A sub-component is not a heavy-duty automotive good. As referred to in section 10(9)(c), for purposes of calculating the regional value content of the sub-component before it is incorporated into a heavy-duty automotive good, such as when the sub-component is exported from the territory of one NAFTA country to the territory of another NAFTA country, the value of non-originating materials of the sub-component includes only the value of non-originating materials used in the production of that sub-component. Because the block assembly is an originating material, its value is not included in the value of non-originating materials of the finished block, nor is the value of the non-originating crankshaft included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the finished block because the crankshaft was used in the production of the block assembly and was not used in the production of the finished block.</p><p class="depth0">Situation 2: Calculating the regional value content of the component that incorporates the finished block</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates a sub-component, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the sub-component is determined under section 10(1) (d) or (e) with respect to that sub-component. In this situation, the value, under section 10(1)(b), of the non-originating crankshaft is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the engine.

Neither a bumper part nor a bumper is a listed material, sub-component, automotive component or automotive component assembly.</p><p class="depth0">Situation 1: The non-listed material is an originating material</p><p class="depth0">The bumper is an originating material. For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle, neither the value of the imported bumper part nor the value of the bumper is included in the value of the non-originating materials.</p><p class="depth0">Situation 2: The non-listed material is a non-originating material</p><p class="depth0">The bumper is a non-originating material. For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle is determined under section 10(1)(f) with respect to the bumper. In this situation, the value of the bumper is included in the value of non-originating materials of the heavy-duty vehicle. Because a bumper is not a listed material, the producer of the heavy-duty vehicle does not have the option, under section 10(1)(b)(ii), to include only the value of the imported bumper part in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.Example 8:</p><p class="depth0">Situation: Transhipment of a listed material</p><p class="depth0">A producer, located in the territory of a NAFTA country, produces, in that country, a cast head that is an originating good. The producer exports the cast head to outside the territories of the NAFTA territories, where valves, springs, valve lifters, a camshaft and gears are added to it to create a cast head assembly. An engine producer, located in the territory of a NAFTA country, imports the cast head assembly into that country and uses it in the production of an engine that will be used as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. A cast head is a listed material; a cast head assembly is a sub-component.</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the engine, the value of the imported cast head assembly is included in the value of non-originating materials under section 10(1)(c). The value of the cast head cannot be deducted from the value determined under section 10(1)(c). Although the cast head was once an originating good, under section 18 when further production was performed with respect to the cast head outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, it was no longer an originating good.Example 9: A material is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and a heavy-duty vehicle producer self-produces a non-originating listed material</p><p class="depth0">A material, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used in that country in the production of a water pump that will be used as original equipment by the same producer in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle.

in the production of cotton yarn provided for in heading 5205. Because the change from cotton, carded or combed, to cotton yarn is a change within the same chapter, the cotton does not satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification for heading 5205, which is a change from any other chapter, with certain exceptions. Therefore, the cotton yarn that Producer A produces from non-originating cotton is a non-originating good.</p><p class="depth0">Producer A then sells the non-originating cotton yarn to Producer B, also located in NAFTA country A, who uses the cotton yarn in the production of woven fabric of cotton provided for in heading 5208.

Therefore, under section 15(1), the change from carded or combed cotton provided for in heading 5203 to the woven fabric of cotton provided for in heading 5208 would satisfy the applicable change of tariff classification for heading 5208.

reasonably allocated to the good in a manner appropriate to the circumstances. The methods the producer may choose to allocate the value include allocating the value over the number of units produced up to the time of the first shipment or allocating the value over the entire anticipated production where contracts or firm commitments exist for that production. For an illustration of this, a buyer provides the producer with a mold to be used in the production of the good and contracts with the producer to buy 10,000 units of that good. By the time the first shipment of 1,000 units arrives, the producer has already produced 4,000 units. In these circumstances, the producer may choose to allocate the value of the mold over 4,000 units or 10,000 units but shall not choose to allocate the value of the elements to the first shipment of 1,000 units. The producer may choose to allocate the entire value of the elements to a single shipment of a good only where that single shipment comprises all of the units of the good acquired by the buyer under the contract or commitment for that number of units of the good between the producer and the buyer.(13) The addition for the royalties referred to in subsection (1)(c) shall be the payment for the royalties that is recorded on the books of the buyer, or where the payment for the royalties is recorded on the books of another person, the payment for the royalties that is recorded on the books of that other person.(14) The value of the proceeds referred to in subsection (1)(d) shall be the amount that is recorded for such proceeds on the books of the buyer or the producer.</p><p class="depth0">SCHEDULE III</p><p class="depth0">UNACCEPTABLE TRANSACTION VALUE</p><p class="depth0">SECTION 1. Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of this Schedule, unless otherwise stated``buyer'' refers to a person who purchases a good from the producer;``customs administration'' refers to the customs administration of the NAFTA country into whose territory the good being valued is imported;``producer'' refers to the producer of the good being valued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There is no transaction value for a good where the good is not the subject of a sale.(2) The transaction value of a good is unacceptable where</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> there are restrictions on the disposition or use of the good by the buyer, other than restrictions that</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> are imposed or required by law or by the public authorities in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the buyer is located,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> limit the geographical area in which the good may be resold, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> do not substantially affect the value of the good;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> the sale or price actually paid or payable is subject to a condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined with respect to the good;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal or use of the good by the buyer will accrue directly or indirectly to the producer, and an appropriate addition to the price actually paid or payable cannot be made in accordance with section 4(1)(d) of Schedule II; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> except as provided in section 3, the producer and the buyer are related persons and the relationship between them influenced the price actually paid or payable for the good.(3) The conditions or considerations referred to in subsection (2)(b) include the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> the producer establishes the price actually paid or payable for the good on condition that the buyer will also buy other goods in specified quantities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> the price actually paid or payable for the good is dependent on the price or prices at which the buyer sells other goods to the producer of the good; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> the price actually paid or payable is established on the basis of a form of payment extraneous to the good, such as where the good is a semi-finished good that has been provided by the producer to the buyer on condition that the producer will receive a specified quantity of the finished good from the buyer.(4) For purposes of subsection (2)(b), conditions or considerations relating to the production or marketing of the good shall not render the transaction value unacceptable, such as where the buyer undertakes on the buyer's own account, even though by agreement with the producer, activities relating to the marketing of the good.(5) Where objective and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to the additions required to be made to the price actually paid or payable under section 4(1) of Schedule II, the transaction value cannot be determined under the provisions of section 2 of that Schedule. For an illustration of this, a royalty is paid on the basis of the price actually paid or payable in a sale of a liter of a particular good that was purchased by the kilogram and made up into a solution. If the royalty is based partially on the purchased good and partially on other factors that have nothing to do with that good, such as when the purchased good is mixed with other ingredients and is no longer separately identifiable, or when the royalty cannot be distinguished from special financial arrangements between the producer and the buyer, it would be inappropriate to add the royalty and the transaction value of the good could not be determined. However, if the amount of the royalty is based only on the purchased good and can be readily quantified, an addition to the price actually paid or payable can be made and the transaction value can be determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In determining whether the transaction value is unacceptable under section 2(2)(d), the fact that the producer and the buyer are related persons shall not in itself be grounds for the customs administration to render the transaction value unacceptable. In such cases, the circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the transaction value shall be accepted provided that the relationship between the producer and the buyer did not influence the price actually paid or payable. Where the customs administration has reasonable grounds for considering that the relationship between the producer and the buyer influenced the price, the customs administration shall communicate the grounds to the producer, and that producer shall be given a reasonable opportunity to respond to the grounds communicated by the customs administration. If that producer so requests, the customs administration shall communicate in writing the grounds on which it considers that the relationship between the producer and the buyer influenced the price actually paid or payable.(2) Subsection (1) provides that, where the producer and the buyer are related persons, the circumstances surrounding the sale shall

be examined and the transaction value shall be accepted as the value provided that the relationship between the producer and the buyer did not influence the price actually paid or payable. It is not intended under subsection (1) that there should be an examination of the circumstances in all cases where the producer and the buyer are related persons. Such an examination will only be required where the customs administration has doubts that the price actually paid or payable is acceptable because of the relationship between the producer and the buyer. Where the customs administration does not have doubts that the price actually paid or payable is acceptable, it shall accept that price without requesting further information. For an illustration of this, the customs administration may have previously examined the relationship between the producer and the buyer, or it may already have detailed information concerning the relationship between the producer and the buyer, and may already be satisfied from that examination or information that the relationship between them did not influence the price actually paid or payable.(3) In applying subsection (1), where the producer and the buyer are related persons and the customs administration has doubts that the transaction value is acceptable without further inquiry, the customs administration shall give the producer an opportunity to supply such further information as may be necessary to enable it to examine the circumstances surrounding the sale. In such a case, the customs administration shall examine the relevant aspects of the sale, including the way in which the producer and the buyer organize their commercial relations and the way in which the price actually paid or payable for the good being valued was arrived at, in order to determine whether the relationship between the producer and the buyer influenced that price actually paid or payable. Where it can be shown that the producer and the buyer buy from and sell to each other as if they were not related persons, the price actually paid or payable shall be considered as not having been influenced by the relationship between them. For an illustration of this, if the price actually paid or payable for the good had been settled in a manner consistent with the normal pricing practices of the industry in question or with the way in which the producer settles prices for sales to unrelated buyers, the price actually paid or payable shall be considered as not having been influenced by the relationship between the buyer and the producer. As another illustration, where it is shown that the price actually paid or payable for the good is adequate to ensure recovery of the total cost of producing the good plus a profit that is representative of the producer's overall profit realized over a representative period of time, such as on an annual basis, in sales of goods of the same class or kind, the price actually paid or payable shall be considered as not having been influenced by the relationship between the producer and the buyer.(4) In a sale between a producer and a buyer who are related persons, the transaction value shall be accepted and determined in accordance with section 2 of Schedule II wherever the producer demonstrates that the transaction value of the good in that sale closely approximates a test value referred to in subsection (5).(5) The value to be used as a test value shall be the transaction value of identical goods or similar goods sold at or about the same time as the good being valued is sold to an unrelated buyer who is located in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the buyer is located.(6) In applying a test value referred to in subsection (4), due account shall be taken of demonstrated differences in commercial levels, quantity levels, the value of the elements specified in section 4(1)(b) of Schedule II and the costs incurred by the producer in sales to unrelated buyers that are not incurred by the producer in sales to a related person.(7) The application of the test value referred to in subsection (4) shall be used at the initiative of the producer and shall be used only for comparison purposes to determine whether the transaction value of the good is acceptable. The test value shall not be used as the transaction value of that good.(8) Subsection (4) provides an opportunity for the producer to demonstrate that the transaction value closely approximates a test value previously accepted by the customs administration, and is therefore acceptable under subsections (1) and (4). Where the application of a test value under subsection (4) demonstrates that the transaction value of the good being valued is acceptable, the customs administration shall not examine the question of influence in regard to the relationship between the producer and the buyer under subsection (1). Where the customs administration already has sufficient information available, without further inquiries, that the transaction value closely approximates a test value referred to in subsection (4), the producer is not required to apply a test value to demonstrate that the transaction value is acceptable under that subsection.(9) A number of factors must be taken into consideration for the purpose of determining whether the transaction value of the identical goods or similar goods closely approximates the transaction value of the good being valued. These factors include the nature of the good, the nature of the industry itself, the season in which the good is sold, and whether the difference in values is commercially significant. Since these factors

may vary from case to case, it would be impossible to apply an acceptable standardized difference such as a fixed amount or fixed percentage difference in each case. For an illustration of this, a small difference in value in a case involving one type of good could be unacceptable, while a large difference in a case involving another type of good might be acceptable for the purposes of determining whether the transaction value closely approximates a test value set out in subsection (4).</p><p class="depth0">SCHEDULE IV</p><p class="depth0">LIST OF TARIFF PROVISIONS FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTION 9 OF THE APPENDIX

For an illustration of this, a royalty is paid on the basis of the price actually paid or payable in a sale of a liter of a particular good that is produced by using a material that was purchased by the kilogram and made up into a solution. If the royalty is based partially on the purchased material and partially on other factors that have nothing to do with that material, such as when the purchased material is mixed with other ingredients and is no longer separately identifiable, or when the royalty cannot be distinguished from special financial arrangements between the seller and the producer, it would be inappropriate to add the royalty and the transaction value of the material could not be determined. However, if the amount of the royalty is based only on the purchased material and can be readily quantified, an addition to the price actually paid or payable can be made and the transaction value can be determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In determining whether the transaction value is unacceptable under section 2(3)(d), the fact that the seller and the producer are related persons shall not in itself be grounds for the customs administration to render the transaction value unacceptable. In such cases, the circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the transaction value shall be accepted provided that the relationship between the seller and the producer did not influence the price actually paid or payable. Where the customs administration has reasonable grounds for considering that the relationship between the seller and the producer influenced the price, the customs administration shall communicate

the grounds to the producer, and that producer shall be given a reasonable opportunity to respond to the grounds communicated by the customs administration. If that producer so requests, the customs administration shall communicate in writing the grounds on which it considers that the relationship between the seller and the producer influenced the price actually paid or payable.(2) Subsection (1) provides that, where the seller and the producer are related persons, the circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the transaction value shall be accepted as the value provided that the relationship between the seller and the producer did not influence the price actually paid or payable. It is not intended under subsection (1) that there should be an examination of the circumstances in all cases where the seller and the producer are related persons. Such an examination will only be required where the customs administration has doubts that the price actually paid or payable is acceptable because of the relationship between the seller and the producer. Where the customs administration does not have doubts that the price actually paid or payable is acceptable, it shall accept that price without requesting further information. For an illustration of this, the customs administration may have previously examined the relationship between the seller and the producer, or it may already have detailed information concerning the relationship between the seller and the producer, and may already be satisfied from that examination or information that the relationship between them did not influence the price actually paid or payable.(3) In applying subsection (1), where the seller and the producer are related persons and the customs administration has doubts that the transaction value is acceptable without further inquiry, the customs administration shall give the producer an opportunity to supply such further information as may be necessary to enable it to examine the circumstances surrounding the sale. In such a case, the customs administration shall examine the relevant aspects of the sale, including the way in which the seller and the producer organize their commercial relations and the way in which the price actually paid or payable by that producer for the material being valued was arrived at, in order to determine whether the relationship between the seller and the producer influenced that price actually paid or payable. Where it can be shown that the seller and the producer buy from and sell to each other as if they were not related persons, the price actually paid or payable shall be considered as not having been influenced by the relationship between them. For an illustration of this, if the price actually paid or payable for the material had been settled in a manner consistent with the normal pricing practices of the industry in question or with the way in which the seller settles prices for sales to unrelated buyers, the price actually paid or payable shall be considered as not having been influenced by the relationship between the producer and the seller. For another illustration of this, where it is shown that the price actually paid or payable for the material is adequate to ensure recovery of the total cost of producing the material plus a profit that is representative of the seller's overall profit realized over a representative period of time, such as on an annual basis, in sales of materials of the same class or kind, the price actually paid or payable shall be considered as not having been influenced by the relationship between the seller and the producer.(4) In a sale between a seller and a producer who are related persons, the transaction value shall be accepted and determined in accordance with section 2(1), wherever the seller or the producer demonstrates that the transaction value of the material in that sale closely approximates one of the following test values that occurs at or about the same time as the sale and is chosen by the seller or the producer:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> the transaction value in sales to unrelated buyers of identical materials or similar materials, as determined in accordance with section 2(1);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> the value of identical materials or similar materials, as determined in accordance with section 9; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> the value of identical materials or similar materials, as determined in accordance with section 10.(5) In applying a test value referred to in subsection (4), due account shall be taken of demonstrated differences in commercial levels, quantity levels, the value of the elements specified in section 5(1)(b) and the costs incurred by the seller in sales to unrelated buyers that are not incurred by the seller in sales by the seller to a related person.(6) The application of a test value referred to in subsection (4) shall be used at the initiative of the seller, or at the initiative of the producer with the consent of the seller, and shall be used only for comparison purposes to determine whether the transaction value of the material is acceptable. The test value shall not be used as the transaction value of that material.(7) Subsection (4) provides an opportunity for the seller or the producer to demonstrate that the transaction value closely approximates a test value previously accepted by the customs administration of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located, and is therefore acceptable under subsection (1). Where the application of a test value under subsection (4) demonstrates that the

transaction value of the material being valued is acceptable, the customs administration shall not examine the question of influence in regard to the relationship between the seller and the producer under subsection (1). Where the customs administration already has sufficient information available, without further inquiries, that the transaction value closely approximates one of the test values determined under subsection (4), the seller or the producer is not required to apply a test value to demonstrate that the transaction value is acceptable under that subsection.(8) A number of factors must be taken into consideration for the purpose of determining whether the transaction value of the identical materials or similar materials closely approximates the transaction value of the material being valued. These factors include the nature of the material, the nature of the industry itself, the season in which the material is sold, and whether the difference in values is commercially significant. Since these factors may vary from case to case, it would be impossible to apply an acceptable standardized difference such as a fixed amount or fixed percentage difference in each case. For an illustration of this, a small difference in value in a case involving one type of material could be unacceptable, while a large difference in a case involving another type of material might be acceptable for the purposes of determining whether the transaction value closely approximates a test value set out in subsection (4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The price actually paid or payable is the total payment made or to be made by the producer to or for the benefit of the seller of the material. The payment need not necessarily take the form of a transfer of money: it may be made by letters of credit or negotiable instruments. Payment may be made directly or indirectly to the seller. For an illustration of this, the settlement by the producer, whether in whole or in part, of a debt owed by the seller, is an indirect payment.(2) Activities undertaken by the producer on the producer's own account, other than those for which an adjustment is provided in section 5, shall not be considered to be an indirect payment, even though the activities might be regarded as being for the benefit of the seller.(3) The transaction value shall not include charges for construction, erection, assembly, maintenance or technical assistance related to the use of the material by the producer, provided that they are distinguished from the price actually paid or payable.(4) The flow of dividends or other payments from the producer to the seller that do not relate to the purchase of the material are not part of the transaction value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In determining the transaction value of the material, the following shall be added to the price actually paid or payable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> to the extent that they are incurred by the producer with respect to the material being valued and are not included in the price actually paid or payable,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> commissions and brokerage fees, except buying commissions, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> the costs of containers which, for customs purposes, are classified with the material under the Harmonized System;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> the value, reasonably allocated in accordance with subsection (12), of the following elements where they are supplied directly or indirectly to the seller by the producer free of charge or at reduced cost for use in connection with the production and sale of the material, to the extent that the value is not included in the price actually paid or payable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> a material, other than an indirect material, used in the production of the material being valued,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> tools, dies, molds and similar indirect materials used in the production of the material being valued,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> an indirect material, other than those referred to in subparagraph (ii) or in paragraphs (c), (e) or (f) of the definition ``indirect material'' set out in Article 415 of the Agreement, as implemented by section 2(1) of this appendix, used in the production of the material being valued, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> engineering, development, artwork, design work, and plans and sketches performed outside the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located that are necessary for the production of the material being valued;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> the royalties related to the material, other than charges with respect to the right to reproduce the material in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located that the producer must pay directly or indirectly as a condition of sale of the material, to the extent that such royalties are not included in the price actually paid or payable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> the value of any part of the proceeds of any subsequent disposal or use of the material that accrues directly or indirectly to the seller.(2) The additions referred to in subsection (1) shall be made to the price actually paid or payable under this section only on the basis of objective and quantifiable data.(3) Where objective and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to the additions required to be made to the price actually paid or payable under subsection (1), the transaction value cannot be determined under section 2(1).

The methods the producer may choose to allocate the value include allocating the value over the number of units produced up to the time of the first shipment or allocating the value

over the entire anticipated production where contracts or firm commitments exist for that production. For an illustration of this, a producer provides the seller with a mold to be used in the production of the material and contracts with the seller to buy 10,000 units of that material. By the time the first shipment of 1,000 units arrives, the seller has already produced 4,000 units. In these circumstances, the producer may choose to allocate the value of the mold over 4,000 units or 10,000 units but shall not choose to allocate the value of the elements to the first shipment of 1,000 units. The producer may choose to allocate the entire value of the elements to a single shipment of material only where that single shipment comprises all of the units of the material acquired by the producer under the contract or commitment for that number of units of the material between the seller and the producer.(13) The addition for the royalties referred to in subsection (1)(c) shall be the payment for the royalties that is recorded on the books of the producer, or where the payment for the royalties is recorded on the books of another person, the payment for the royalties that is recorded on the books of that other person.(14) The value of the proceeds referred to in subsection (1)(d) shall be the amount that is recorded for such proceeds on the books of the producer or the seller.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If there is no transaction value under section 2(2) or the transaction value is unacceptable under section 2(3), the value of the material, referred to in Article 402(9)(b) of the Agreement, as implemented by section 7(1)(b)(ii) of part IV of this appendix, shall be the transaction value of identical materials sold, at or about the same time as the material being valued was shipped to the producer, to a buyer located in the same country as the producer.(2) In applying this section, the transaction value of identical materials in a sale at the same commercial level and in substantially the same quantity of materials as the material being valued shall be used to determine the value of the material. Where no such sale is found, the transaction value of identical materials sold at a different commercial level or in different quantities, adjusted to take into account the differences attributable to the commercial level or quantity, shall be used, provided that such adjustments can be made on the basis of evidence that clearly establishes that the adjustment is reasonable and accurate, whether the adjustment leads to an increase or a decrease in the value.(3) A condition for adjustment under subsection (2) because of different commercial levels or different quantities is that such adjustment be made only on the basis of evidence that clearly establishes that an adjustment is reasonable and accurate. For an illustration of this, a bona fide price list contains prices for different quantities. If the material being valued consists of a shipment of 10 units and the only identical materials for which a transaction value exists involved a sale of 500 units, and it is recognized that the seller grants quantity discounts, the required adjustment may be accomplished by resorting to the seller's bona fide price list and using the price applicable to a sale of 10 units. This does not require that sales had to have been made in quantities of 10 as long as the price list has been established as being bona fide through sales at other quantities. In the absence of such an objective measure, however, the determination of a value under this section is not appropriate.(4) If more than one transaction value of identical materials is found, the lowest such value shall be used to determine the value of the material under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If there is no transaction value under section 2(2) or the transaction value is unacceptable under section 2(3), and the value of the material cannot be determined under section 6, the value of the material, referred to in Article 402(9)(b) of the Agreement, as implemented by section 7(1)(b)(ii) of part IV of this appendix, shall be the transaction value of similar materials sold, at or about the same time as the material being valued was shipped to the producer, to a buyer located in the same country as the producer.(2) In applying this section, the transaction value of similar materials in a sale at the same commercial level and in substantially the same quantity of materials as the material being valued shall be used to determine the value of the material. Where no such sale is found, the transaction value of similar materials sold at a different commercial level or in different quantities, adjusted to take into account the differences attributable to the commercial level or quantity, shall be used, provided that such adjustments can be made on the basis of evidence that clearly establishes that the adjustment is reasonable and accurate, whether the adjustment leads to an increase or a decrease in the value.(3) A condition for adjustment under subsection (2) because of different commercial levels or different quantities is that such adjustment be made only on the basis of evidence that clearly establishes that an adjustment is reasonable and accurate.

Where the figures provided by the producer are inconsistent with those figures, the amount for profit and general expenses shall be based on relevant information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer.(6) For the purposes of this section, general expenses are the direct and indirect costs of marketing the material in question.(7) In determining either the commissions usually earned or the amount generally reflected for profit and general expenses under this section, the question as to whether certain materials are materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued shall be determined on a case-by-case basis with reference to the circumstances involved.

The information supplied shall be prepared in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting principles of the country in which the material being valued is produced. Where the material is produced in the territory of a NAFTA country, the information shall be prepared in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles set out in the authorities listed for that NAFTA country in Schedule XII.(4) For purposes of subsection (1)(c) and subsection (3), general expenses means the direct and indirect costs of producing and selling the material that are not included under subsections (1)(a) and (b).(5) For purposes of subsection (3), the amount for profit and general expenses shall be taken as a whole. Where, in the information supplied by or on behalf of the producer of a material, the profit figure is low and the

general expenses figure is high, the profit and general expense figures taken together may nevertheless be consistent with those usually reflected in sales of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued. Where the producer of a material can demonstrate that it is taking a nil or low profit on its sales of the material because of particular commercial circumstances, its actual profit and general expense figures shall be taken into account, provided that the producer of the material has valid commercial reasons to justify them and its pricing policy reflects usual pricing policies in the branch of industry concerned. For an illustration of this, such a situation might occur where producers have been forced to lower prices temporarily because of an unforeseeable drop in demand, or where the producers sell the material to complement a range of materials and goods being produced in the country in which the material is sold and accept a low profit to maintain competitiveness. A further illustration is where a material was being launched and the producer accepted a nil or low profit to offset high general expenses associated with the launch.(6) Where the figures for the profit and general expenses supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the material are not consistent with those usually reflected in sales of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued that are made by other producers in the country in which that material is sold, the amount for profit and general expenses may be based on relevant information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the material.(7) Where a customs administration uses information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the material for the purposes of determining the value of a material under this section, the customs administration shall communicate to the producer, if that producer so requests, the source of such information, the data used and the calculations based upon such data, subject to the provisions on confidentiality under Article 507 of the Agreement, as implemented in each NAFTA country.(8) Whether certain materials are of the same class or kind as the material being valued shall be determined on a case-by-case basis with reference to the circumstances involved. For purposes of determining the amount for profit and general expenses usually reflected under the provisions of this section, sales of the narrowest group or range of materials of the same class or kind, which includes the material being valued, for which the necessary information can be provided, shall be examined. For the purposes of this section, the materials of the same class or kind must be from the same country as the material being valued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where there is no transaction value under section 2(2) or the transaction value is unacceptable under section 2(3), and the value of the materials cannot be determined under sections 6 through 10, the value of the material, referred to in Article 402(9)(b) of the Agreement, as implemented by section 7(1)(b)(ii) of part IV of this appendix, shall be determined under this section using reasonable means consistent with the principles and general provisions of this Schedule and on the basis of data available in the country in which the producer is located.(2) The value of the material determined under this section shall not be determined on the basis of</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> a valuation system which provides for the acceptance of the higher of two alternative values;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> a cost of production other than the value determined in accordance with section 10;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> minimum values;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> arbitrary or fictitious values;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> where the material is produced in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located, the price of the material for export from that territory; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> where the material is imported, the price of the material for export to a country other than to the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located.(3) To the greatest extent possible, the value of the material determined under this section shall be based on the methods of valuation set out in sections 2 through 10, but a reasonable flexibility in the application of such methods would be in conformity with the aims and provisions of this section. For an illustration of this, under section 6, the requirement that the identical materials should be sold at or about the same time as the time the material being valued is shipped to the producer could be flexibly interpreted. Similarly, identical materials produced in a country other than the country in which the material is produced could be the basis for determining the value of the material, or the value of identical materials already determined under section 9 could be used. For another illustration, under section 7, the requirement that the similar materials should be sold at or about the same time as the material being valued are shipped to the producer could be flexibly interpreted. Likewise, similar materials produced in a country other than the country in which the material is produced could be the basis for determining the value of the material, or the value of similar materials already determined under the provisions of section 9 could be used.
