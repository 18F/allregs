These compounds must be supplied from  external sources.</p><p class="depth2">FDA means the Food and Drug Administration.</p><p class="depth2">Limit of detection (LOD) means the lowest concentration of analyte  that can be confirmed by the approved regulatory method.</p><p class="depth2">Marker residue means the residue selected for assay whose  concentration is in a known relationship to the concentration of the  residue of carcinogenic concern in the last tissue to deplete to its  Sm.</p><p class="depth2">Preslaughter withdrawal period or milk discard time means the time  after cessation of administration of the sponsored compound at which no  residue is detectable in the edible product using the approved  regulatory method (i.e., the marker residue is below the LOD).</p><p class="depth2">Regulatory method means the aggregate of all experimental procedures  for measuring and confirming the presence of the marker residue of the  sponsored compound in the target tissue of the target animal.</p><p class="depth2">Rm means the concentration of the marker residue in the  target tissue when the residue of carcinogenic concern is equal to  Sm.</p><p class="depth2">Residue means any compound present in edible tissues of the target  animal which results from the use of the sponsored compound, including  the sponsored compound, its metabolites, and any other substances formed  in or on food because of the sponsored compound's use.</p><p class="depth2">Residue of carcinogenic concern means all compounds in the total  residue of a demonstrated carcinogen excluding any compounds judged by  FDA not to present a carcinogenic risk.</p><p class="depth2">Sm means the concentration of a residue of carcinogenic concern in a  specific edible tissue corresponding to no significant increase in the  risk of cancer to the human consumer. For the purpose of Sec.  500.84(c)(1), FDA will assume that this Sm will correspond to  the concentration of residue in a specific edible tissue that  corresponds to a   maximum lifetime risk of cancer in the test animals of 1 in 1 million.</p><p class="depth2">So means the concentration of a residue of carcinogenic concern in  the total human diet that represents no significant increase in the risk  of cancer to the human consumer. For the purpose of Sec. 500.84(c)(1),  FDA will assume that this So will correspond to the  concentration of test compound in the total diet of test animals that  corresponds to a maximum lifetime risk of cancer in the test animals of  1 in 1 million.</p><p class="depth2">Sponsor means the person or organization proposing or holding an  approval by FDA for the use of a sponsored compound.</p><p class="depth2">Sponsored compound means any drug or food additive or color additive  proposed for use, or used, in food-producing animals or in their feed.</p><p class="depth2">Target animals means the production class of animals in which a  sponsored compound is proposed or intended for use.</p><p class="depth2">Target tissue means the edible tissue selected to monitor for  residues in the target animals, including, where appropriate, milk or  eggs.</p><p class="depth2">Test animals means the species selected for use in the toxicity  tests.</p><p class="depth2">Threshold assessment means FDA's review of data and information  about a sponsored compound to determine whether chronic bioassays in  test animals are necessary to resolve questions concerning the  carcinogenicity of the compound.
