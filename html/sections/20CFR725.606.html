                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Following the issuance of an effective order by a district  director (see Sec. 725.418), administrative law judge (see Sec.  725.479), Benefits Review Board, or court that requires the payment of  benefits by an operator that has failed to secure the payment of  benefits in accordance with section 423 of the Act and Sec. 726.4 of  this subchapter, or by a coal mine construction or transportation  employer, the Director may request that the operator secure the payment  of all benefits ultimately payable on the claim. Such operator or other  employer shall thereafter immediately secure the payment of benefits in  accordance with the provisions of this section, and provide proof of  such security to the Director. Such security may take the form of an  indemnity bond, a deposit of cash or negotiable securities in compliance  with Sec. Sec. 726.106(c) and 726.107 of this subchapter, or any other  form acceptable to the Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The amount of security initially required by this section shall  be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In a case involving an operator subject to section 423 of the  Act and Sec. 726.4 of this subchapter, the amount of the security shall  not be less than $175,000, and may be a higher amount as determined by  the Director, taking into account the life expectancies of the claimant  and any dependents using the most recent life expectancy tables  published by the Social Security Administration; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In a case involving a coal mine construction or transportation  employer, the amount of the security shall be determined by the  Director, taking into account the life expectancies of the claimant and  any dependents using the most recent life expectancy tables published by  the Social Security Administration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> and 726.107 of this subchapter. In a case in which  the effective order was issued by a district director, the district  director shall be considered the appropriate adjudication officer. In  any other case, the administrative law judge who issued the most recent  decision in the case, or such other administrative law judge as the  Chief Administrative Law Judge shall designate, shall be considered the  appropriate adjudication officer, and shall issue an order under this  paragraph on motion of the Director. The administrative law judge shall  have jurisdiction to issue an order under this paragraph notwithstanding  the pendency of an appeal of the award of benefits with the Benefits  Review Board or court.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An order issued under this section shall be considered effective  when issued. Disputes regarding such orders shall be resolved in  accordance with subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notwithstanding any further review of the order in accordance  with subpart F of this part, if an operator or other employer subject to  an order issued under this section fails to comply with such order, the  appropriate adjudication officer shall certify such non-compliance to  the appropriate United States district court in accordance with Sec.  725.351(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Security posted in accordance with this section may be used to  make payment of benefits that become due with respect to the claim in  accordance with Sec. 725.502. In the event that either the order  awarding compensation or the order issued under this section is vacated  or reversed, the operator or other employer may apply to the appropriate  adjudication officer for an order authorizing the return of any amounts  deposited with a Federal Reserve Bank and not yet disbursed, and such  application shall be granted. If at any time the Director determines  that additional security is required beyond that initially required by  paragraph (b) of this section, he may request the operator or other  employer to increase the amount. Such request shall be treated as if it  were issued under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If a coal mine construction or transportation employer fails to  comply with an order issued under paragraph (c), and such employer is a  corporation, the provisions of Sec. 725.609 shall be applicable to the  president, secretary, and treasurer of such employer.</p>
