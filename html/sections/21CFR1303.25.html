In  passing upon such application the Administrator may also take into  consideration the amount, if any, by which his determination of the  total quantity for the basic class of controlled substance to be  manufactured under Sec. 1303.11 exceeds the aggregate of all the  individual manufacturing quotas for the basic class of controlled  substance, and the equitable distribution of such excess among other  registrants.
