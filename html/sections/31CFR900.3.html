Upon identification of a claim based in whole or in part on conduct in violation of the antitrust laws or any claim involving fraud, the presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any party having an interest in the claim, agencies shall promptly refer the case to the Department of Justice for action. At its discretion, the Department of Justice may return the claim to the forwarding agency for further handling in accordance with the standards in parts 900-904 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Parts 900-904 of this chapter do not apply to tax debts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Parts 900-904 of this chapter do not apply to claims between Federal agencies.
