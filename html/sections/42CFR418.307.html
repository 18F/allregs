                            <p class="depth0">Subject to the provisions of Sec. 413.64(h) of this chapter, a hospice may elect to receive periodic interim payments (PIP) effective with claims received on

or after July 1, 1987. Payment is made biweekly under the PIP method unless the hospice requests a longer fixed interval (not to exceed one month) between payments. The biweekly interim payment amount is based on the total estimated Medicare payments for the reporting period (as described in Secs. 418.302-418.306). Each payment is made 2 weeks after the end of a biweekly period of service as described in Sec. 413.64(h)(5) of this chapter. Under certain circumstances that are described in Sec. 413.64(g) of this chapter, a hospice that is not receiving PIP may request an accelerated payment.
