SBA  will take such action in accordance with procedures set forth in  Sec. 120.1600. If enforcement action is taken under this section and the  SBA Lender fails to implement required corrective action in any material  respect within the required timeframe in response to the enforcement  action, SBA may take further enforcement action, as authorized by law.  SBA's decision to take an enforcement action will not, by itself,  invalidate a guaranty previously provided by SBA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Enforcement actions for all SBA Lenders--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Imposition of  portfolio guaranty dollar limit. SBA may limit the maximum dollar amount  that SBA will guarantee on the SBA Lender's SBA loans or debentures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Suspension or revocation of delegated authority.

SBA may suspend or  revoke an SBA Lender's authority to participate in the SBA loan program,  including the authority to make, service, liquidate, or litigate 7(a) or  504 loans. Section 120.1400(d)(1) sets forth the grounds for SBA program  suspension or revocation of an SBA Supervised Lender (except Other  Regulated SBLCs).
