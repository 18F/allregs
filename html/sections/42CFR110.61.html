                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A requester determined by the Secretary to be eligible for  Program benefits and who seeks benefits for lost employment income must  provide, in addition to the documentation submitted under subpart F of  this part, documentation describing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The number of days (including partial days) of work missed by  the injured countermeasure recipient as a result of the covered injury  or its health complications for which employment income was lost (e.g.,  time sheet from the relevant pay period(s) showing work days missed). As  stated in Sec.  110.32(c), days for which an individual used paid leave  will be considered days of work for which employment income was received  and, therefore, would not qualify for lost employment income benefits.  However, if the injured countermeasure recipient reimburses the employer  for the paid leave taken and the employer restores the leave that was  used, the individual may be eligible for lost employment income benefits  for those days; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The injured countermeasure recipient's gross employment income  at the time the covered injury was sustained (e.g., the individual's  Federal tax return or pay stub(s) from all employers at the time of the  covered injury); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the injured countermeasure recipient had one or more  dependents at the time the covered injury was sustained (e.g., the  individual's Federal tax return at the time of the covered injury); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A list of all third-party payers that have paid, or that may be  obligated to pay, benefits to the injured countermeasure recipient for  loss of employment income or provide disability and/or retirement  benefits for which payment or reimbursement is being sought under this  Program (e.g., State workers' compensation programs, disability  insurance programs, Uniform Services Retirement Board determinations,  Department of Veterans Affairs determinations, etc.). A requester must  submit documentation, if available, concerning the amount of such  payments or benefits paid or payable to, or on behalf of, the injured  countermeasure recipient by third-party payers. If the requester knows  of no such third-party payer, he or she must so certify in writing. If,  at any time, the requester becomes aware that a third-party payer may  have such an obligation, the requester must inform   the Secretary within ten business days of becoming aware of this  information, even after benefits have been paid by the Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p>
