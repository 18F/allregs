                            <p class="depth0">This part prescribes policies and procedures which govern the  procurement of personal property and nonpersonal services by Federal  agencies from or through GSA supply sources as established by law or  other competent authority. The specific subparts or sections covering  the subject matter involved prescribe the extent to which the sources of  supply are to be used by Government agencies. Certain civilian and  military commissaries and nonappropriated fund activities are also  eligible to use GSA supply sources for their own use, not for resale,  unless otherwise authorized by the individual Federal agency and  concurred in by GSA. Policy and procedures pertaining to purchasing of  property or contracting for services from commercial sources, without  recourse to established GSA supply sources, are provided in the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR chapter 1).
