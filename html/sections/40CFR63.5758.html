                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determine the organic HAP content for each material used. To determine the organic HAP content for each material used in your open molding resin and gel coat operations, carpet and fabric adhesive operations, or aluminum recreational boat surface coating operations, you must use one of the options in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Method 311 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 63). You may use Method 311 for determining the mass fraction of organic HAP. Use the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section when determining organic HAP content by Method 311.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Include in the organic HAP total each organic HAP that is measured to be present at 0.1 percent by mass or more for Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)-defined carcinogens as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. For example, if toluene (not an OSHA carcinogen) is measured to be 0.5 percent of the material by mass, you do not need to include it in the organic HAP total. Express the mass fraction of each organic HAP you measure as a value truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.1234).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Calculate the total organic HAP content in the test material by adding up the individual organic HAP contents and truncating the result to three places after the decimal point (for example, 0.123).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Method 24 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 60). You may use Method 24 to determine the mass fraction of non-aqueous volatile matter of aluminum coatings and use that value as a substitute for mass fraction of organic HAP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ASTM D1259-85 (Standard Test Method for Nonvolatile Content of Resins). You may use ASTM D1259-85 (available for purchase from ASTM) to measure the mass fraction of volatile matter of resins and gel coats for open molding operations and use that value as a substitute for mass fraction of organic HAP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Alternative method. You may use an alternative test method for determining mass fraction of organic HAP if you obtain prior approval by the Administrator. You must follow the procedure in Sec. 63.7(f) to submit an alternative test method for approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material. You may rely on information other than that generated by the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section, such as manufacturer's formulation data, according to paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Include in the organic HAP total each organic HAP that is present at 0.1

percent by mass or more for OSHA-defined carcinogens as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. For example, if toluene (not an OSHA carcinogen) is 0.5 percent of the material by mass, you do not have to include it in the organic HAP total.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the organic HAP content is provided by the material supplier or manufacturer as a range, then you must use the upper limit of the range for determining compliance. If a separate measurement of the total organic HAP content using the methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section exceeds the upper limit of the range of the total organic HAP content provided by the material supplier or manufacturer, then you must use the measured organic HAP content to determine compliance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the organic HAP content is provided as a single value, you may assume the value is a manufacturing target value and actual organic HAP content may vary from the target value. If a separate measurement of the total organic HAP content using the methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section is less than 2 percentage points higher than the value for total organic HAP content provided by the material supplier or manufacturer, then you may use the provided value to demonstrate compliance. If the measured total organic HAP content exceeds the provided value by 2 percentage points or more, then you must use the measured organic HAP content to determine compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Solvent blends. Solvent blends may be listed as single components for some regulated materials in certifications provided by manufacturers or suppliers. Solvent blends may contain organic HAP which must be counted toward the total organic HAP content of the materials. When detailed organic HAP content data for solvent blends are not available, you may use the values for organic HAP content that are listed in Table 5 or 6 to this subpart. You may use Table 6 to this subpart only if the solvent blends in the materials you use do not match any of the solvent blends in Table 5 to this subpart and you know only whether the blend is either aliphatic or aromatic. However, if test results indicate higher values than those listed in Table 5 or 6 to this subpart, then the test results must be used for determining compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determine the volume fraction solids in aluminum recreational boat surface coatings. To determine the volume fraction of coating solids (liters of coating solids per liter of coating) for each aluminum recreational boat surface coating, you must use one of the methods specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section. If the results obtained with paragraphs (b)(2) or (3) of this section do not to agree with those obtained according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, you must use the results obtained with paragraph (b)(1) of this section to determine compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ASTM Method D2697-86(1998) or D6093-97. You may use ASTM Method D2697-86(1998) or D6093-97 (available for purchase from ASTM) to determine the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating. Divide the nonvolatile volume percent obtained with the methods by 100 to calculate volume fraction of coating solids.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material. You may obtain the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating from the supplier or manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Calculation of volume fraction of coating solids. You may determine it using equation 1 of this section:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR22AU01.019

Determine the density of all aluminum recreational boat wipedown solvents, surface coatings, thinners, and other additives from test results using ASTM Method D1475-90, information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material, or reference sources providing density or specific gravity data for pure materials. If there is disagreement between ASTM Method D1475-90 test results and other information sources, you must use the test results to demonstrate compliance.</p><p class="depth2">Notifications, Reports, and Records</p>
