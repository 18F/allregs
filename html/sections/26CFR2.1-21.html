                            <p class="depth0">A new vessel constructed otherwise than under the provisions of  title V of the Act, and not purchased from the   Administration must, within six months from the date of the construction  contract, or within the period of any extension, be completed to the  extent of not less than 5 percent as estimated by the Administration and  certified by it to the Secretary of the Treasury. In case of a contract  covering more than one vessel it will be sufficient if one of the  vessels is 5 percent completed within the six months' period from the  date of the contract or within the period of any extension, and so  certified. All construction must be completed with reasonable dispatch  as determined by the Administration. If, for causes within the control  of the taxpayer, the entire construction is not completed with  reasonable dispatch, the Administration will so certify to the Secretary  of the Treasury. For the effect of such certification, see Sec. 2.1-23.</p>
