                            <p class="depth0">A special grade serves to draw attention to a special factor or  condition present in the grain and, when applicable, is supplemental to  the grade assigned under Sec. 810.106. Except for the special grade  ``infested,'' the special grades are identified and requirements are  established in each respective grain standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Infested wheat, rye, and triticale. Tolerances for live insects  responsible for infested wheat, rye, and triticale are defined according  to sampling designations as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Representative sample. The representative sample consists of the  work portion, and the file sample if needed and when available. These  grains will be considered infested if the representative sample (other  than shiplots) contains two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and  one or more other live insects injurious to stored grain, or two or more  live insects injurious to stored grain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lot as a whole (stationary). The lot as a whole is considered  infested when two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and one or  more other live insects injurious to stored grain, or two or more other  live insects injurious to stored grain are found in, on, or about the  lot (excluding submitted samples and shiplots).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sample as a whole (continuous loading/unloading of shiplots and  bargelots). The minimum sample size for bargelots and shiplots is 500  grams per each 2,000 bushels of grain. The sample as a whole is  considered infested when a component (as defined in FGIS instructions)  contains two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and one or more  other live insects injurious to stored grain, or two or more other live  insects injurious to stored grain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Infested barley, canola, corn, oats, sorghum, soybeans,  sunflower seed, and mixed grain. Tolerances for live insects responsible  for infested barley, canola, corn, oats, sorghum, soybeans, sunflower  seed, and mixed grain are defined according to sampling designations as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Representative sample. The representative sample consists of the  work portion, and the file sample if needed and when available. These  grains will be considered infested if the representative sample (other  than shiplots) contains two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and  five or more other live insects injurious to stored grain, or ten or  more other live insects injurious to stored grain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lot as a whole (stationary). The lot as a whole is considered  infested when two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and five or  more other live insects injurious to stored grain, or ten or more other  live insects injurious to   stored grain are found in, on, or about the lot (excluding submitted  samples and shiplots).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sample as a whole (continuous loading/unloading of shiplots and  bargelots). The minimum sample for shiplots and bargelots is 500 grams  per each 2,000 bushels of grain. The sample as a whole is considered  infested when a component (as defined in FGIS instructions) contains two  or more live weevils, or one live weevil and five or more other live  insects injurious to stored grain, or ten or more other live insects  injurious to stored grain.
