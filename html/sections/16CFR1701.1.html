                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In order to assist manufacturers of prescription drugs in  discharging their responsibilities under the act concerning such drugs  that are distributed to pharmacies, the Consumer Product Safety  Commission has codified this statement of its policy concerning which  prescription drug packages supplied by manufacturers to pharmacies must  comply with the ``special'' (child-resistant) packaging requirements  contained in 16 CFR 1700.15.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of the act permits the pharmacist  to convert the package to conventional packaging or repackage the drug  in conventional packaging.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Manufacturers should also note that section 4(a) of the act  (which allows a product to be marketed in noncomplying packaging of a  single size under certain circumstances) does not apply to prescription  drugs subject to section 4(b) of the act. Thus, since the section 4(a)  single-size exemption for over-the-counter drugs and other household  substances does not apply to prescription drugs, every unit of a  prescription drug subject to a special packaging standard which is  distributed to a pharmacy in a package intended by the manufacturer to  be dispensed to a consumer shall be in special packaging.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Nothing in this statement of policy and interpretation should be  interpreted as relieving the pharmacist of the responsibility of  insuring that all prescription drugs subject to a special packaging  standard are dispensed to the consumer in special packaging unless  otherwise ordered by the prescribing practitioner or otherwise requested  by the consumer.
