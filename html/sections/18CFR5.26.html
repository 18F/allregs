                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In connection with its environmental review of an application  for license, the Commission will analyze all terms and conditions timely  recommended by fish and wildlife agencies pursuant to the Fish and  Wildlife Coordination Act for the protection, mitigation of damages to,  and enhancement of fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds  and habitat) affected by the development, operation, and management of  the proposed project. Submission of such recommendations marks the  beginning of the process under section 10(j) of the Federal Power Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The agency must specifically identify and explain the  recommendations and the relevant resource goals and objectives and their  evidentiary or legal basis. The Commission may seek clarification of any  recommendation from the appropriate fish and wildlife agency. If the  Commission's request for clarification is communicated in writing,  copies of the request will be sent by the Commission to all parties,  affected resource agencies, and Indian tribes, which may file a response  to the request for clarification within the time period specified by the  Commission. If the Commission believes any fish and wildlife  recommendation may be inconsistent with the Federal Power Act or other  applicable law, the Commission will make a preliminary determination of  inconsistency in the draft environmental document or, if none, the  environmental assessment. The preliminary determination, for any  recommendations believed to be inconsistent, shall include an  explanation why the Commission believes the recommendation is  inconsistent with the Federal Power Act or other applicable law,  including any supporting analysis and conclusions and an explanation of  how the measures recommended in the environmental document would  adequately and equitably protect, mitigate damages to, and enhance, fish  and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat) affected  by the development, operation, and management of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any party, affected resource agency, or Indian tribe may file  comments   in response to the preliminary determination of inconsistency, including  any modified recommendations, within the time frame allotted for  comments on the draft environmental document or, if none, the time frame  for comments on the environmental assessment. In this filing, the fish  and wildlife agency concerned may also request a meeting, telephone or  video conference, or other additional procedure to attempt to resolve  any preliminary determination of inconsistency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Commission shall attempt, with the agencies, to reach a  mutually acceptable resolution of any such inconsistency, giving due  weight to the recommendations, expertise, and statutory responsibilities  of the fish and wildlife agency. If the Commission decides, or an  affected resource agency requests, the Commission will conduct a  meeting, telephone or video conference, or other procedures to address  issues raised by its preliminary determination of inconsistency and  comments thereon. The Commission will give at least 15 days' advance  notice to each party, affected resource agency, or Indian tribe, which  may participate in the meeting or conference. Any meeting, conference,  or additional procedure to address these issues will be scheduled to  take place within 90 days of the date the Commission issues a  preliminary determination of inconsistency. The Commission will prepare  a written summary of any meeting held under this paragraph to discuss  section 10(j) issues, including any proposed resolutions and supporting  analysis, and a copy of the summary will be sent to all parties,  affected resource agencies, and Indian tribes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The section 10(j) process ends when the Commission issues an  order granting or denying the license application in question. If, after  attempting to resolve inconsistencies between the fish and wildlife  recommendations of a fish and wildlife agency and the purposes and  requirements of the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, the  Commission does not adopt in whole or in part a fish and wildlife  recommendation of a fish and wildlife agency, the Commission will  publish the findings and statements required by section 10(j)(2) of the  Federal Power Act.</p>
