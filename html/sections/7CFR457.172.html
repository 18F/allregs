                            <p class="depth0">The Coverage Enhancement Option for the 2009 and succeeding crop years are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">FCIC policies: United States Department of Agriculture, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Reinsured policies: (Appropriate title for insurance provider).</p><p class="depth0">Both FCIC and reinsured policies: Coverage Enhancement Option.</p><p class="depth0">Both FCIC and reinsured policies:</p><p class="depth0">Coverage Enhancement Option</p><p class="depth0">1. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">CEO coverage level. The coverage level percentage contained in the actuarial documents where the Coverage Enhancement Option (CEO) is available and selected by you. This percentage is applicable under the combined MPCI/CEO policy when losses under the MPCI policy exceed the deductible and an indemnity is owed.</p><p class="depth0">CEO dollar amount of insurance. The value of the additional insurance coverage for each unit provided by the CEO, which is determined by multiplying the CEO coverage level by the total value of the insured crop by unit and subtracting the MPCI dollar amount of insurance.</p><p class="depth0">MPCI. Multiple Peril Crop Insurance, the plan of insurance offered by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation as published at 7 CFR part 457.</p><p class="depth0">MPCI coverage level. The coverage level percentage you selected in the underlying MPCI policy to which CEO is attached.</p><p class="depth0">MPCI dollar amount of insurance. The value of the insurance coverage for each unit provided under the MPCI policy (the amount of insurance selected by you for dollar or similar plans of insurance, multiplied by the number of acres in the unit if such amount of insurance is on a per acre basis, or the amount determined by multiplying your production guarantee (per acre), times the price election, times the number of acres in the unit).</p><p class="depth0">MPCI indemnity. The indemnity determined for each unit under the MPCI policy to which CEO is attached, not including replant and prevented planting payments or any indemnity payable under CEO.</p><p class="depth0">MPCI indemnity factor. A factor determined by dividing the MPCI indemnity by the MPCI dollar amount of insurance for each unit. This factor is used to ensure that the indemnity paid under the CEO is proportional to the amount of loss and indemnity paid under the MPCI policy.</p><p class="depth0">Total value of the insured crop by unit. The value of the crop that is determined by dividing the MPCI dollar amount of insurance for each unit by the MPCI coverage level.</p><p class="depth0">2. CEO is only available for insured crops where the actuarial documents contain a CEO coverage level. If there is a conflict between the terms of CEO and any other provision of your policy, the terms of the CEO will control.</p><p class="depth0">3. To be eligible for CEO coverage on the insured crop, you must:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Have an MPCI policy in force for the insured crop (or for citrus fruit, citrus trees, and stone fruit or other crops, as applicable, the insured type) and comply with all terms and conditions of such policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Elect CEO in writing and choose a CEO coverage level (at least 5 percent higher than the MPCI coverage level), by the sales closing date for the insured crop.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Elect a level of coverage greater than the Catastrophic Risk Protection (CAT) coverage level and a 100 percent price election. CEO is not available for the CAT level of coverage.</p><p class="depth0">4. CEO is continuous and will remain in effect for as long as you continue to have a MPCI policy in effect for the insured crop, the actuarial documents contain a CEO coverage level, or until it is canceled by you or terminated by us on or before the cancellation or termination date, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">5. The premium for your policy will be determined by:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Totaling the MPCI dollar amount of insurance and the CEO dollar amount of insurance; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Multiplying the result of section 5(a) by the premium rate for the insured crop applicable to your MPCI coverage level</p><p class="depth0">6. With respect to the coverage provided under CEO:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All acreage of the insured crop insured under your MPCI policy will be covered under the CEO;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The amount of any replant or prevented planting payment that is payable under the MPCI policy will not be affected by the CEO;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An indemnity will be payable under the CEO only after the underlying MPCI deductible is met and an MPCI indemnity is paid; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The total indemnity for each unit (MPCI coverage plus CEO) cannot exceed the combination of both the MPCI and CEO dollar amounts of insurance.</p><p class="depth0">7. If you elect CEO and a MPCI indemnity is paid on any unit, CEO will pay a portion of the loss not paid under the deductible of the MPCI policy depending on the CEO coverage level you select (For example, if you

selected a 50 percent MPCI coverage level, selected an 85 percent CEO coverage level, and had 60 percent loss of the insured crop, the total amount of indemnity paid under both the MPCI policy and the CEO would be equal to approximately 51 percent of the total value of the insured crop by unit). See the example in section 8.</p><p class="depth0">8. In addition to the settlement of claim section for the applicable Crop Provisions, your indemnity will be computed for each unit as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determine the MPCI indemnity factor;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determine the total value of the insured crop by unit;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determine the CEO dollar amount of insurance; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Multiply the MPCI indemnity factor times the CEO dollar amount of insurance to determine the indemnity under the CEO.</p><p class="depth0">Example: Assume a policy with one unit; an MPCI coverage level of 50 percent and a CEO coverage level of 85 percent; 100% share; a $120,000 MPCI dollar amount of insurance; and a $72,000 payable indemnity under the MPCI portion of the policy.</p><p class="depth0">Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> $72,000 MPCI loss / by $120,000 MPCI dollar amount of insurance = .60 MPCI indemnity factor;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> $120,000 MPCI dollar amount of insurance, divided by the MPCI coverage level of .50 results in $240,000 total value of the insured crop by unit;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> $240,000 total value of the insured crop by unit multiplied by the CEO coverage level .85, equals $204,000, and subtracting $120,000 MPCI dollar amount of insurance equals $84,000 CEO dollar amount of insurance;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> .60 MPCI indemnity factor x $84,000 CEO dollar amount of insurance = $50,400 unit indemnity under the CEO.</p><p class="depth2">Note: The total unit indemnity is $122,400 ($72,000 MPCI indemnity plus $50,400 CEO indemnity).
