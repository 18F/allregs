The deduction is  for an amount equal to the benefit payable to the individual for that  month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From May 1983 on.

Where the insured  individual entitled to old-age benefits works on 7 or more days in a  month prior to September 1984 while under age 72 (age 70 after December  1982), a deduction is made for that month from any:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Wife's, husband's, or child's insurance benefit payable on the  insured individual's earnings record; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Mother's, father's, or child's insurance benefit based on  child's disability, which under Sec. 404.420 is deemed payable on the  insured individual's earnings record because of the beneficiary's  marriage to the insured individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From September 1984 on. Effective September 1984, a benefit  deduction is made for a month from the benefits described in paragraph  (b)(1) of this section only if the insured individual, while under age  70, has worked in excess of 45 hours in that month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amount of deduction. The amount of the deduction required by  this paragraph (b) is equal to the wife's, husband's or child's benefit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> From January 1985 on. Effective January 1985, no deduction will  be made from the benefits payable to a divorced wife or a divorced  husband who has been divorced from the insured individual for at least 2  years.
