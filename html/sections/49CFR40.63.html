                                Sec. 40.63  What steps does the collector take in the collection
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">As the collector, you must take the following steps before the employee provides the urine specimen:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Complete Step 1 of the CCF.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Instruct the employee to wash and dry his or her hands at this time. You must tell the employee not to wash his or her hands again until after delivering the specimen to you. You must not give the employee any further access to water or other materials that could be used to adulterate or dilute a specimen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Select, or allow the employee to select, an individually wrapped or sealed collection container from collection kit materials. Either you or the employee, with both of you present, must unwrap or break the seal of the collection container. You must not unwrap or break the seal on any specimen bottle at this time. You must not allow the employee to take anything from the collection kit into the room used for urination except the collection container.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Direct the employee to go into the room used for urination, provide a specimen of at least 45 mL, not flush the toilet, and return to you with the specimen as soon as the employee has completed the void.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except in the case of an observed or a monitored collection (see Sec. Sec. 40.67 and 40.69), neither you nor anyone else may go into the room with the employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As the collector, you may set a reasonable time limit for voiding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must pay careful attention to the employee during the entire collection process to note any conduct that clearly indicates an attempt to tamper with a specimen (e.g., substitute urine in plain view or an attempt to bring into the collection site an adulterant or urine substitute). If you detect such conduct, you must require that a collection take place immediately under direct observation (see Sec. 40.67) and complete Step 2 by noting the conduct in the ``Remarks'' line of the CCF and the fact that the collection was observed by checking the ``Observed'' box. You must also, as soon as possible, inform the DER and collection site supervisor that a collection took place under direct observation and the reason for doing so.
