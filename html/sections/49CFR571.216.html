Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">Altered roof means the replacement roof on a motor vehicle whose original roof has been removed, in part or in total, and replaced by a roof that is higher than the original roof. The replacement roof on a motor vehicle whose original roof has been replaced, in whole or in part, by a roof that consists of glazing materials, such as those in T-tops and sunroofs, and is located at the level of the original roof, is not considered to be an altered roof.</p><p class="depth0">Raised roof means, with respect to a roof which includes an area that protrudes above the surrounding exterior roof structure, that protruding area of the roof.</p><p class="depth0">Roof over the front seat area means the portion of the roof, including windshield trim, forward of a transverse vertical plane passing through a point 162 mm rearward of the SgRP of the rearmost front outboard seating position.</p><p class="depth0">Windshield trim means molding of any material between the windshield glazing and the exterior roof surface, including material that covers a part of either the windshield glazing or exterior roof surface.</p><p class="depth0">S5.

Subject to S5.1, when the test device described in S6 is used to apply a force to either side of the forward edge of a vehicle's roof in accordance with the procedures of S7, the lower surface of the test device must not move more than 127 millimeters. The applied force in Newtons is equal to 1.5 times the unloaded vehicle weight of the vehicle, measured in kilograms and multiplied by 9.8, but does not exceed 22,240 Newtons for passenger cars. Both the left and right front portions of the vehicle's roof structure must be capable of meeting the requirements. A particular vehicle need not meet further requirements after being tested at one location.</p><p class="depth0">S5.1 For multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks and buses that have a raised roof or altered roof, manufacturers have the option of using the test procedures of S8 instead of the procedures of S7 until October 25, 2000. The option of using the test procedures of S8 ceases to be available on that date.</p><p class="depth0">S6. Test device.
