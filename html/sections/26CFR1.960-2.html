Furthermore, the effective rate of  foreign income taxes paid or accrued shall be determined consistently  with the principles of paragraphs (b)(3)(iv) and (viii) and (c) of  Sec. 1.954-1. Thus, for example, the effective rate of foreign income  taxes on dividends received by such foreign corporation shall be  determined by taking into account any intercorporate dividends received  deduction allowed to such corporation for such dividends.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Illustrations. The application of this section may be  illustrated by the following examples. In all of the examples other than  examples 6, 7, 9 and 10, it is assumed that the effective rate of  foreign income taxes paid or accrued by the first- or second-tier  corporation, as the case may be, in respect to dividends received from  the immediately lower-tier corporation, is the same as the effective  rate of foreign income taxes paid or accrued by the first- or second- tier corporation with respect to its other income:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1.

Domestic corporation N owns all the one class of stock of  controlled foreign corporation A, which owns all the one class of stock  of controlled foreign corporation B, which owns all the one class of  stock of controlled foreign corporation C. A and B Corporations are  organized under the laws of foreign country X. C Corporation is  organized under the laws of foreign country Y. All of B Corporation's  assets used in a trade or business are located in country X. All such  corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. For 1978, N  Corporation is required to include in its gross income under section  951, $50 attributable to the earnings and profits of C Corporation and  $100 attributable to the earnings and profits of B Corporation. N  Corporation is not required to include any amount in its gross income  under section 951 with respect to A Corporation. Country X imposes an  income tax of 10 percent on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, 20  percent on dividends from domestic subsidiaries, and 40 percent on other  earnings and profits. For 1978, C Corporation distributes $75 to B  Corporation. For such year, B Corporation distributes $175 of its  earnings and profits to A Corporation. A Corporation has no other  earnings and profits for 1978 and distributes $130 of its earnings and  profits to N Corporation.
