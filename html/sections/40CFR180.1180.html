This  temporary exemption from the requirement of a tolerance expires and is  revoked December 31, 1999. This temporary exemption from the requirement  of a tolerance may be revoked at any time if the experimental use permit  is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on this  pesticide indicate that the tolerance is not safe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Kaolin is exempted from the requirement of a tolerance for  residues when used on or in food commodities to aid in the control of  insects, fungi, and bacteria (food/feed use).
