The non-Federal entity must use that property for the originally-authorized purpose, and must not encumber the property without approval of the HHS awarding agency. When no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property must occur in accordance with the provisions in Sec. 75.320(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The non-Federal entity may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was acquired, under a Federal award.

If the HHS awarding agency obtains the research data solely in response to a FOIA request, the HHS awarding agency may charge the requester a reasonable fee equaling the full incremental cost of obtaining the research data.
