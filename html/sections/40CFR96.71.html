                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The owner or operator of a NOX Budget unit that is  subject to an Acid Rain emissions limitation shall comply with the  initial certification and recertification procedures of part 75 of this  chapter, except that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If, prior to January 1, 1998, the Administrator approved a  petition under Sec. 75.17(a) or (b) of this chapter for apportioning  the NOX emission rate measured in a common stack or a  petition under Sec. 75.66 of this chapter for an alternative to a  requirement in Sec. 75.17 of this chapter, the NOX  authorized account representative shall resubmit the petition to the  Administrator under Sec. 96.75(a) to determine if the approval applies  under the NOX Budget Trading Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of  this chapter, the owner or operator shall meet the requirements of  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The owner or operator of a NOX Budget unit that is  not subject to an Acid Rain emissions limitation shall comply with the  following initial certification and recertification procedures, except  that the owner or operator of a unit that qualifies to use the   low mass emissions excepted monitoring methodology under Sec. 75.19  shall also meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section and  the owner or operator of a unit that qualifies to use an alternative  monitoring system under subpart E of part 75 of this chapter shall also  meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. The owner or  operator of a NOX Budget unit that is subject to an Acid Rain  emissions limitation, but requires additional CEMS under the common  stack provisions in Sec. 75.72 of this chapter, or that uses a  NOX concentration CEMS under Sec. 75.71(a)(2) of this  chapter also shall comply with the following initial certification and  recertification procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Requirements for initial certification. The owner or operator  shall ensure that each monitoring system required by subpart H of part  75 of this chapter (which includes the automated data acquisition and  handling system) successfully completes all of the initial certification  testing required under Sec. 75.20 of this chapter. The owner or  operator shall ensure that all applicable certification tests are  successfully completed by the deadlines specified in Sec. 96.70(b). In  addition, whenever the owner or operator installs a monitoring system in  order to meet the requirements of this part in a location where no such  monitoring system was previously installed, initial certification  according to Sec. 75.20 is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requirements for recertification. Whenever the owner or operator  makes a replacement, modification, or change in a certified monitoring  system that the Administrator or the permitting authority determines  significantly affects the ability of the system to accurately measure or  record NOX mass emissions or heat input or to meet the  requirements of Sec. 75.21 of this chapter or appendix B to part 75 of  this chapter, the owner or operator shall recertify the monitoring  system according to Sec. 75.20(b) of this chapter. Furthermore,  whenever the owner or operator makes a replacement, modification, or  change to the flue gas handling system or the unit's operation that the  Administrator or the permitting authority determines to significantly  change the flow or concentration profile, the owner or operator shall  recertify the continuous emissions monitoring system according to Sec.  75.20(b) of this chapter. Examples of changes which require  recertification include: replacement of the analyzer, change in location  or orientation of the sampling probe or site, or changing of flow rate  monitor polynomial coefficients.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certification approval process for initial certifications and  recertification--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notification of certification. The NOX  authorized account representative shall submit to the permitting  authority, the appropriate EPA Regional Office and the permitting  authority a written notice of the dates of certification in accordance  with Sec. 96.73.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certification application. The NOX authorized  account representative shall submit to the permitting authority a  certification application for each monitoring system required under  subpart H of part 75 of this chapter. A complete certification  application shall include the information specified in subpart H of part  75 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Except for units using the low mass emission excepted  methodology under Sec. 75.19 of this chapter, the provisional  certification date for a monitor shall be determined using the  procedures set forth in Sec. 75.20(a)(3) of this chapter. A  provisionally certified monitor may be used under the NOX  Budget Trading Program for a period not to exceed 120 days after receipt  by the permitting authority of the complete certification application  for the monitoring system or component thereof under paragraph  (b)(3)(ii) of this section. Data measured and recorded by the  provisionally certified monitoring system or component thereof, in  accordance with the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, will be  considered valid quality-assured data (retroactive to the date and time  of provisional certification), provided that the permitting authority  does not invalidate the provisional certification by issuing a notice of  disapproval within 120 days of receipt of the complete certification  application by the permitting authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Certification application formal approval process. The  permitting authority will issue a written notice of approval or  disapproval of the certification application to the owner or operator  within 120 days of receipt of the complete certification application  under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. In the event the permitting  authority does not issue such a notice within such 120-day period, each  monitoring system which meets the applicable performance requirements of  part 75 of this chapter and is included in the certification application  will be deemed certified for use under the NOX Budget Trading  Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Approval notice. If the certification application is complete  and shows that each monitoring system meets the applicable performance  requirements of part 75 of this chapter, then the permitting authority  will issue a written notice of approval of the certification application  within 120 days of receipt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Incomplete application notice. A certification application will  be considered complete when all of the applicable information required  to be submitted under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section has been  received by the permitting authority. If the certification application  is not complete, then the permitting authority will issue a written  notice of incompleteness that sets a reasonable date by which the  NOX authorized account representative must submit the  additional information required to complete the certification  application. If the NOX authorized account representative  does not comply with the notice of incompleteness by the specified date,  then the permitting authority may issue a notice of disapproval under  paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Disapproval notice. If the certification application shows that  any monitoring system or component thereof does not meet the performance  requirements of this part, or if the certification application is  incomplete and the requirement for disapproval under paragraph  (b)(3)(iv)(B) of this section has been met, the permitting authority  will issue a written notice of disapproval of the certification  application. Upon issuance of such notice of disapproval, the  provisional certification is invalidated by the permitting authority and  the data measured and recorded by each uncertified monitoring system or  component thereof shall not be considered valid quality-assured data  beginning with the date and hour of provisional certification. The owner  or operator shall follow the procedures for loss of certification in  paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section for each monitoring system or  component thereof which is disapproved for initial certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Audit decertification. The permitting authority may issue a  notice of disapproval of the certification status of a monitor in  accordance with Sec. 96.72(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Procedures for loss of certification. If the permitting  authority issues a notice of disapproval of a certification application  under paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C) of this section or a notice of disapproval  of certification status under paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(D) of this section,  then:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The owner or operator shall substitute the following values, for  each hour of unit operation during the period of invalid data beginning  with the date and hour of provisional certification and continuing until  the time, date, and hour specified under Sec. 75.20(a)(5)(i) of this  chapter:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For units using or intending to monitor for NOX  emission rate and heat input or for units using the low mass emission  excepted methodology under Sec. 75.19 of this chapter, the maximum  potential NOX emission rate and the maximum potential hourly  heat input of the unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For units intending to monitor for NOX mass emissions  using a NOX pollutant concentration monitor and a flow  monitor, the maximum potential concentration of NOX and the  maximum potential flow rate of the unit under section 2.1 of appendix A  of part 75 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The NOX authorized account representative shall  submit a notification of certification retest dates and a new  certification application in accordance with paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and  (ii) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The owner or operator shall repeat all certification tests or  other requirements that were failed by the monitoring system, as  indicated in the permitting authority's notice of disapproval, no later  than 30 unit operating days after the date of issuance of the notice of  disapproval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Initial certification and recertification procedures for low  mass emission units using the excepted methodologies under Sec. 75.19  of this chapter.
