Whenever there  is a change to any of the information provided in the approved Brewer's  Notice, the brewer must amend the notice within the time period  specified in subpart G of this part. An amendment to the Brewer's  Notice, Form 5130.10, will also serve as an amendment of the brewer's  dealer registration under this subpart. The brewer's dealer registration  will also terminate when brewery operations under the Brewer's Notice  terminate.  (26 U.S.C. 5124)</p>
