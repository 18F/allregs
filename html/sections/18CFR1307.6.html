                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. No qualified handicapped person shall, because  facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be  denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise  be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity subject to  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Existing facilities. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each program or activity subject to  this part shall be operated so that when each part is viewed in its  entirety it is readily accessible to and usable by qualified handicapped  persons. This paragraph does not necessarily require a recipient to make  each of its existing facilities or every part of an existing facility  accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. A recipient is not  required to make building alterations or structural changes if other  methods are effective in achieving accessibility. Such compliance  methods may include (subject to the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1307.4 and  1307.5), reassigning aid, benefits, or services to accessible locations  within a facility; providing assistance to handicapped   persons into or through an otherwise inaccessible facility; delivering  programs or activities at other alternative sites which are accessible  and are operated or available for use by the recipient; or other methods  which comply with the intent of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This paragraph governs the timing of development of transition  plans and the completion of necessary building alterations and  structural changes to existing facilities, including historic property  covered by paragraph (c) of this section. If building alterations or  structural changes will be necessary to comply with paragraph (b)(1) of  this section, the recipient shall develop a transition plan setting  forth the steps necessary to complete the alterations or changes in  accordance with such standards as TVA may specify in the contract or  agreement, and shall have the plan approved by TVA. If the financial  assistance from TVA is expected to last for less than three years, the  contract or agreement shall specify the date by which the transition  plan shall be developed and approved. If the financial assistance from  TVA is expected to last for at least three years, the transition plan  shall be developed and submitted to TVA within six months from the  effective date of the contract or agreement, subject to extension by TVA  for an additional six month period, for good cause shown to it. A  transition plan shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be developed with the assistance of interested persons or  organizations representing handicapped persons;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Be available for public inspection after approval by TVA (or at  any earlier time required by state or local law applicable to the  recipient);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Identify the official responsible for implementation of the  approved plan; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Specify the date by which the required alterations or changes  shall be completed, which shall be as soon as practicable and in no  event later than three years after the effective date that financial  assistance is extended by TVA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Alterations to existing facilities shall, to the maximum extent  feasible, be designed and constructed to be readily accessible to and  usable by handicapped persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Historic property. If a recipient's program or activity uses an  existing facility which is an historic property, the recipient shall  endeavor to assure compliance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section by  compliance methods which do not alter the historic character or  architectural integrity of the historic property. The recipient must  determine that accessibility cannot be accomplished by such alternative  methods before considering building alterations as a compliance method.  To the maximum extent possible any building alterations determined to be  necessary shall be undertaken so as not to alter or destroy  architecturally significant elements or features. A recipient may  determine that structural changes are necessary to accomplish  accessibility only if the recipient has determined that accessibility  cannot feasibly be accomplished by any of the other foregoing methods.  To the maximum extent possible, any structural changes determined to be  necessary shall be undertaken so as not to alter or destroy  architecturally significant elements or features.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> New construction. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> New facilities required under a program or  activity subject to this part shall be designed and constructed to be  readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effective as of November 4, 1988, design, construction, or  alteration of buildings in conformance with Sections 3-8 of the Uniform  Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) (41 CFR Subpart 101-19.6 app. A)  shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with  respect to those buildings. Departures from particular technical and  scoping requirements of UFAS by the use of other methods are permitted  where substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of the  building is provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall  be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical  rooms and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not  require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the  employment or residence therein of physically handicapped persons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> This section does not require recipients to make building  alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without  removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.
