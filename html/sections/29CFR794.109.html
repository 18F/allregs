                            <p class="depth0">The ``enterprise'' for purposes of enterprise coverage under section  3(s) and the exemption provision in section 7(b)(3), is defined in  section 3(r) (Sec. 794.106) in terms of the activities in which it is  engaged. All the ``related   activities'' which are ``performed * * * by any person or persons for a  common business purpose'' are included if they are performed ``either  through unified operation or common control.'' This is true even if they  are performed by more than one person, or in more than one establishment  or by more than one corporate or other organizational unit. The  definition specifically includes as a part of the enterprise,  departments of an establishment operated through leasing arrangements.  These statutory criteria are discussed in more detail in subsequent  sections.</p>
