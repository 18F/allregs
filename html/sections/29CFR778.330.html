                            <p class="depth0">All compensation (except statutory exclusions) paid by or on behalf  of an employer to an employee as remuneration for employment must be  included in the regular rate, whether paid in the form of cash or  otherwise. Prizes are therefore included in the regular rate if they are  paid to an employee as remuneration for employment. If therefore it is  asserted that a particular prize is not to be included in the regular  rate, it must be shown either that the prize was not paid to the  employee for employment, or that it is not a thing of value which is  part of wages.</p>
