                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. Herpes simplex virus serological assays are  devices that consist of antigens and antisera used in various  serological tests to identify antibodies to herpes simplex virus in  serum. Additionally, some of the assays consist of herpes simplex virus  antisera conjugated with a fluorescent dye (immunofluorescent assays)  used to identify herpes simplex virus directly from clinical specimens  or tissue culture isolates derived from clinical specimens. The  identification aids in the diagnosis of diseases caused by herpes  simplex viruses and provides epidemiological information on these  diseases. Herpes simplex viral infections range from common and mild  lesions of the skin and mucous membranes to a severe form of  encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). Neonatal herpes virus  infections range from a mild infection to a severe generalized disease  with a fatal outcome.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II (special controls). The device is  classified as class II (special controls). The special control for the  device is FDA's revised guidance document entitled ``Class II Special  Controls Guidance Document: Herpes Simplex Virus Types 1 and 2  Serological Assays.'' For availability of the guidance revised document,  see Sec. 866.1(e).  [72 FR 15830, Apr. 3, 2007, as amended at 74 FR 42775, Aug. 25, 2009; 76  FR 48717, Aug. 9, 2011]</p>
