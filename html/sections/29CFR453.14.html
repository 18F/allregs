                                Sec. 453.14  The meaning of ``funds.''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">While the protection of bonds required under the Act must extend to any actual loss from the acts of fraud or dishonesty in the handling of ``funds or other property'' (Sec. 453.7), the amount of the bond depends upon the ``funds'' handled by the personnel bonded and their predecessors, if any. ``Funds'' as here used is not defined in the Act. As in the case of ``funds or other property'' discussed earlier in Sec. 453.7, the term would not include property of a relatively permanent nature such as land, buildings, furniture, fixtures, or property similarly held for use in the operations of the labor organization or trust rather than as quick assets. In its normal meaning, however, ``funds'' would include, in addition to cash, items such as bills and notes, government obligations and marketable securities, and in a particular case might well include all the ``funds or other property'' handled during the year in the positions occupied by the particular personnel for whom the bonding is required. In any event, it is clear that bonds fixed in the amount of 10 percent or more of the total ``funds or other property'' handled by the occupants of such positions during the preceding fiscal year would be in amounts sufficient to meet the statutory requirement. Of course, in situations where a significant saving in bonding costs might result from computing separately the amounts of ``funds'' and of ``other property'' handled, criteria for distinguishing particular items to be included in the quoted terms would prove useful. While the criteria to be applied in a particular case would depend on all the relevant facts concerning the specific items handled, it may be assumed as a general principle that at least those items which may be handled in a manner similar to cash and which involve a like risk of loss

should be included in computing the amount of ``funds'' handled.
