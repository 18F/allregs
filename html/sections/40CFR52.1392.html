Each facility that chooses to use grab sampling shall meet the following requirements: if the flow rate of the gas stream to the flare in any consecutive 15-minute period continuously exceeds 0.5 feet per second (fps) and the water seal monitoring device, if any, indicates that flow is going to the flare, a grab sample shall be collected within 15 minutes. The grab sample shall be collected at a location that is representative of the gas combusted in the flare. Thereafter, the sampling frequency shall be one (1) grab sample every three (3) hours, which shall continue until the velocity of the gas stream going to the flare in any consecutive 15-minute period is continuously 0.5 fps or less.

The sample shall be collected at a location that is representative of the gas combusted in the flare. The sampling frequency, thereafter, shall be a minimum of one (1) aliquot for each 15-minute period until the sample container is full, or until the end of a 3-hour period is reached, whichever comes sooner. Within 30 minutes thereafter, a new sample container shall be placed in service, and sampling on this frequency, and in this manner, shall continue until the velocity of the gas stream going to the flare in any consecutive 15-minute period is continuously 0.5 fps or less. Samples shall be analyzed according to paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)(3) of this section. The requirements of this paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)(2) shall apply to each flare at a facility for which the sampling threshold is exceeded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Samples shall be analyzed using ASTM Method D4468-85 (Reapproved 2000) ``Standard Test Method for Total Sulfur in Gaseous Fuels by Hydrogenolysis and Rateometric Colorimetry,'' (incorporated by reference, see paragraph (j) of this section) ASTM Method D5504-01 (Reapproved 2006) ``Standard Test Method for Determination of Sulfur Compounds in Natural Gas and Gaseous Fuels by Gas Chromatography and Chemiluminescence,'' (incorporated by reference, see paragraph (j) of this section) or 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A-5, Method 15A ``Determination of Total Reduced Sulfur Emissions From the Sulfur Recovery Plants in Petroleum Refineries.''

For facilities using a sampling method specified in either paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)(1) (``Grab Sampling'') or (h)(3)(i)(B)(2) (``Integrated Sampling'') of this section, obtaining a sample is not required if flaring is a result of a catastrophic or other unusual event, including a major fire or an explosion at the facility, such that collecting a sample at the EPA-approved location during the relevant period is infeasible or constitutes a safety hazard, provided that the owner or operator shall collect a sample at an alternative location if feasible, safe, and

representative of the flaring event. The owner or operator shall demonstrate to EPA that it was infeasible or unsafe to collect a sample or to collect a sample at the sampling location approved by EPA in the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section. The owner or operator shall also demonstrate to EPA that any sample collected at an alternative location is representative of the flaring incident. If a facility experiences ongoing difficulties collecting grab or integrated samples in accordance with its flare monitoring plan approved by EPA pursuant to paragraph (h)(5) of this section, EPA may require the facility to revise its flare monitoring plan and use continuous total sulfur concentration monitoring as described in paragraph (h)(3)(i)(A) of this section or other reliable method to determine total sulfur concentrations of the gas stream to the flare.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Missing or Unanalyzed Samples. For facilities using a sampling method specified in either paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)(1) (``Grab Sampling'') or (h)(3)(i)(B)(2) (``Integrated Sampling'') of this section, if a required sample is not obtained or analyzed for any reason, other methods approved by EPA in the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section shall be used to determine total sulfur concentrations, which shall then be used to calculate SO2 emissions.

If integrated sampling for a flare produces more than one (1) sample container during a 3-hour period, and the gas in each container is analyzed separately, the concentrations for the containers shall be averaged. For that flare, the resulting average shall be substituted for each hour of the 3-hour period during which the sampling occurred. The substituted hourly total sulfur concentrations determined per this paragraph shall be used to determine hourly emissions from the flare.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each facility named in paragraph (a) of this section that does not certify that only natural gas or an inert gas is used for both the pilot gas and purge gas shall determine the H2S concentration of each pilot gas and purge gas stream for which natural gas or inert gas is not used by one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Measure the H2S concentration of the gas by continuous H2S analyzer.
