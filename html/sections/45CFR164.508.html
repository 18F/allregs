This exception includes combining an authorization for the use or disclosure of protected health information for a research study with another authorization for the same research study, with an authorization for the creation or maintenance of a research database or repository, or with a consent to participate in research. Where a covered health care provider has conditioned the provision of research-related treatment on the provision of one of the authorizations, as permitted under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, any compound authorization created under this paragraph must clearly differentiate between the conditioned and unconditioned components and provide the individual with an opportunity to opt in to the research activities described in the unconditioned authorization.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An authorization for a use or disclosure of psychotherapy notes may only be combined with another authorization for a use or disclosure of psychotherapy notes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An authorization under this section, other than an authorization for a use or disclosure of psychotherapy notes, may be combined with any other such authorization under this section, except when a covered entity has conditioned the provision of treatment, payment, enrollment in the health plan, or eligibility for benefits under paragraph (b)(4) of this section on the provision of one of the authorizations. The prohibition in this paragraph on combining authorizations where one authorization conditions the provision of treatment, payment, enrollment in a health plan, or eligibility for benefits under paragraph (b)(4) of this section does not apply to a compound authorization created in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Prohibition on conditioning of authorizations. A covered entity may not

condition the provision to an individual of treatment, payment, enrollment in the health plan, or eligibility for benefits on the provision of an authorization, except:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A covered health care provider may condition the provision of research-related treatment on provision of an authorization for the use or disclosure of protected health information for such research under this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A health plan may condition enrollment in the health plan or eligibility for benefits on provision of an authorization requested by the health plan prior to an individual's enrollment in the health plan, if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The authorization sought is for the health plan's eligibility or enrollment determinations relating to the individual or for its underwriting or risk rating determinations; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The authorization is not for a use or disclosure of psychotherapy notes under paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A covered entity may condition the provision of health care that is solely for the purpose of creating protected health information for disclosure to a third party on provision of an authorization for the disclosure of the protected health information to such third party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Revocation of authorizations. An individual may revoke an authorization provided under this section at any time, provided that the revocation is in writing, except to the extent that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The covered entity has taken action in reliance thereon; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the authorization was obtained as a condition of obtaining insurance coverage, other law provides the insurer with the right to contest a claim under the policy or the policy itself.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Documentation. A covered entity must document and retain any signed authorization under this section as required by Sec. 164.530(j).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Implementation specifications: Core elements and requirements--(1) Core elements. A valid authorization under this section must contain at least the following elements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Core elements. A valid authorization under this section must contain at least the following elements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of the information to be used or disclosed that identifies the information in a specific and meaningful fashion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The name or other specific identification of the person(s), or class of persons, authorized to make the requested use or disclosure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The name or other specific identification of the person(s), or class of persons, to whom the covered entity may make the requested use or disclosure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A description of each purpose of the requested use or disclosure. The statement ``at the request of the individual'' is a sufficient description of the purpose when an individual initiates the authorization and does not, or elects not to, provide a statement of the purpose.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> An expiration date or an expiration event that relates to the individual or the purpose of the use or disclosure. The statement ``end of the research study,'' ``none,'' or similar language is sufficient if the authorization is for a use or disclosure of protected health information for research, including for the creation and maintenance of a research database or research repository.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Signature of the individual and date. If the authorization is signed by a personal representative of the individual, a description of such representative's authority to act for the individual must also be provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Required statements.

when the prohibition on conditioning of authorizations in paragraph (b)(4) of this section applies; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The consequences to the individual of a refusal to sign the authorization when, in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the covered entity can condition treatment, enrollment in the health plan, or eligibility for benefits on failure to obtain such authorization.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The potential for information disclosed pursuant to the authorization to be subject to redisclosure by the recipient and no longer be protected by this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Plain language requirement. The authorization must be written in plain language.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Copy to the individual.
