                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When both purity and germination tests are required, seeds for  germination shall be taken from the separation of the kind, variety, or  type considered pure seed and shall be counted without discrimination as  to size or appearance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When only a germination test is required and the pure seed is  estimated or determined to be at least 98 percent, the pure seed for the  germination test may be taken indiscriminately from a representative  portion of the bulk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When only a germination test is required and the pure seed is  found to be less than 98 percent, the seed for the test shall be  obtained by separating the sample into two components as follows: (1)  Pure seed and (2) other crop seed, weed seed, and inert matter. In  making this separation at least \1/4\ of the quantity required for a  regular purity analysis shall be used. The whole sample must be well  mixed and divided in such a manner as to get a completely representative  subsample.  [10 FR 9952, Aug. 11, 1945, as amended at 20 FR 7931, Oct. 21, 1955]</p>
