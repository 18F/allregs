                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Duty-free entry; declaration of use; extension of liquidation-- </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Entry or withdrawal for consumption. Articles defined as  ``prototypes'' and meeting the other requirements prescribed in  paragraph (b) of this section may be entered or withdrawn from warehouse  for consumption, duty-free, under subheading 9817.85.01, Harmonized  Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), on CBP Form 7501 or an  electronic equivalent. A separate entry or withdrawal must be made for a  qualifying prototype article each time the article is imported/ reimported to the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Importer declaration. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Entry accepted as declaration. Entry  or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption under HTSUS subheading  9817.85.01   may be accepted by the port director as an effective declaration that  the articles will be used solely for the purposes stated in the  subheading.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Proof (declaration) of actual use. If it is believed the  circumstances so warrant, the port director may request the submission  of proof of actual use, executed and dated by the importer. The title of  the party executing the proof of actual use must be set forth. If proof  of actual use is requested, the importer must provide it within three  years after the date the article is entered or withdrawn from warehouse  for consumption. Liquidation of the related entry may be extended until  the requested proof or declaration of actual use is received or until  the three-year period from the date of entry allowed for the receipt of  such proof has expired. While requested proof of use must be given to  CBP within three years of the date of entry, the prototype may continue  to be used thereafter for the purposes enumerated in HTSUS subheading  9817.85.01. If requested proof of use is not timely received, the entry  will be liquidated as dutiable under the tariff provision that would  otherwise apply to the imported article. While there is no particular  form for this declaration, it may either be submitted in writing, or  electronically as authorized by CBP, and must include the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A description of the use that is being and/or that has been made  of the articles set forth in sufficient detail so as to enable the port  director to determine whether the articles have been entitled to entry  as claimed;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A statement that the articles have not and are not to be put to  any other use after the articles have been entered or withdrawn from  warehouse for consumption and prior to the completion of their use under  HTSUS 9817.85.01 (also see paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section  concerning the disposition(s) to which the articles may be put following  their use under HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A statement that the articles or any parts of the articles have  not been and are not intended to be sold, or incorporated into other  products that are sold, after the articles have been entered or  withdrawn from warehouse for consumption and prior to the completion of  their use as provided in HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01 (see paragraph  (b)(2)(ii) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Articles classifiable as prototypes--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prototypes defined. In  accordance with U.S. Note 6(a) to subchapter XVII of chapter 98, HTSUS,  applicable to subheading 9817.85.01, the term ``prototypes'' means  originals or models of articles pertaining to any industry that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Are either in the preproduction, production or postproduction  stage and are to be used exclusively for development, testing, product  evaluation, or quality control purposes (not including automobile racing  for purse, prize or commercial competition); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of originals or models of articles that are either  in the production or postproduction stage, are associated with a design  change from current production (including a refinement, advancement,  improvement, development or quality control in either the product itself  or the means of producing the product).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional requirements. In accordance with U.S. Note 6(b) and  (c) to subchapter XVII of chapter 98, HTSUS, applicable to subheading  9817.85.01, the following additional restrictions apply to articles that  may be classified as prototypes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Importations limited. Prototypes may be imported pursuant to  this section only in limited noncommercial quantities in accordance with  industry practice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sale prohibited after entry and prior to use. Prototypes or  parts of prototypes may not be sold, or be incorporated into other  products that are sold into the commerce of the United States, after the  prototypes have been entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption  under HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01, except that, after having been used  for the purposes for which they were entered or withdrawn from warehouse  under HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01, such prototypes or any part(s) of the  prototypes may be sold as scrap, waste, or for recycling, as prescribed  in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Articles subject to laws of another agency. Articles that are  subject to licensing requirements, or that must   comply with laws, rules or regulations administered by an agency other  than CBP before being imported, may be entered as prototypes pursuant to  this section if they meet all applicable provisions of law and otherwise  meet the definition of prototypes in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Articles excluded from being prototypes. Articles that are in  fact subject at the time of entry to quantitative restrictions,  antidumping orders or countervailing duty orders are excluded from being  classified as prototypes under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sale of prototype following use--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sale. Prototypes or any  part(s) of prototypes, after having been used for the purposes for which  they were entered or withdrawn under HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01, may  only be sold as scrap, waste, or for recycling. This includes a  prototype or any part thereof that is incorporated into another product,  as scrap, waste, or recycled material. If sold as scrap, waste, or for  recycling, applicable duty must be paid on the prototypes or parts as  provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, at the rate of duty in  effect for such scrap, waste, or recycled materials at the time the  prototypes were entered or withdrawn for consumption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)</em> of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Form and content of notice; tender of duty. While no particular  form is required for the notice of sale, a consumption entry (CBP Form  7501), appropriately modified, or an electronic equivalent as authorized  by CBP, may be used for this purpose. The notice may be a blanket notice  covering all those sales described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section  that occur over a quarterly (3-month) calendar period. Such notice must  be filed within 10 business days of the end of the related quarterly  period in which the sale(s) occurred. If an article sold is dutiable,  the payment of any duty due must be forwarded together with the notice  (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section). If the notice is filed  electronically, payment of any duty owed will be handled through the  Automated Clearinghouse (see Sec. 24.25 of this chapter). The notice of  sale must be executed by the importer, or other person having knowledge  of the facts surrounding the sale, and must include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The identity of the prototype; the consumption entry number  under which it was imported; a copy of the declaration of actual use, if  proof of actual use was requested under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this  section; and a detailed description of the condition of the prototype  following use for the intended permissible purposes, including any  damage, degradation or deterioration to the article resulting from such  use and/or otherwise resulting to the article from any other cause prior  to its sale for scrap, waste, or recycling;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The name and address of the party to whom the article was sold,  and (if known) the use to which the party intends to put the article;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The HTSUS subheading number for scrap, waste, or recycled  material, as applicable, claimed in connection with the sale of the  prototype, together with the corresponding rate of duty in effect at the  time the prototype was originally imported for consumption;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The value of the prototype article (if dutiable and the duty  owed is based upon value) (see paragraph (e)(2) of this section); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The title of the party executing the declaration and the date of  execution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prototypes not sold following use. As to those prototypes or  parts of prototypes that, after having been used as prescribed under  HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01, are disposed of otherwise than by sale (see  paragraph (c)(1) of this section), there is no requirement   that the importer notify CBP of any such alternative disposition. Nor  are there any dutiable consequences that ensue from any disposition of  the merchandise after the merchandise's use under HTSUS subheading  9817.85.01 other than sale to the extent authorized under paragraph  (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Recordkeeping; retention and production--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Recordkeeping. The  importer must be prepared to submit to the CBP officer, if requested,  any information, including any supporting documents, reports and  records, as was necessary for the preparation of the declaration of use,  if the declaration of use was requested under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of  this section, and the notice of sale, if applicable under paragraph  (c)(3) of this section. The notices, together with any related  supporting evidence, may be subject to such verification as the port  director reasonably deems necessary. Supporting documentary evidence  must be made available to the CBP officer, upon request, for a period of  five years (see Sec. 163.4(a) of this chapter) from the date of filing  in complete and proper form, the declaration of use, if requested, and,  if applicable, the notice of sale. The supporting records must be made  available to the CBP officer upon request in accordance with Sec. 163.6  of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Documents supporting the proof (declaration) of actual use must:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Establish that the identity and description of the prototype  article is the same article that the consumption entry was made for  under subheading 9817.85.01, HTSUS; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Describe the circumstances of the use of the article; the  operations, testing, review, manipulation, experimentation, and/or other  exercises that are being and/or that have been conducted in connection  with the prototype; and the location, such as the plant or production  facility, where these activities occurred, sufficient to demonstrate  that the purposes enumerated in HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01 are taking  and/or have actually taken place.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Documents supporting the notice of sale must establish that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The identity of the prototype sold is the same article for which  a consumption entry was made under subheading 9817.85.01 HTSUS when it  was imported, and that the article was in the condition described in the  notice of sale;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The article was sold to the party identified in the notice of  sale;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The HTSUS subheading number for scrap, waste, or recycled  material, as applicable, claimed in connection with the sale of the  prototype is accurate;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The date that the prototype was originally imported for  consumption, and the corresponding rate of duty in effect at the time  for the applicable HTSUS subheading; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The value of the prototype article (if dutiable and the duty  owed is based upon value) (see paragraph (e)(2) of this section) as  claimed in the notice of sale is accurate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Relevant value for used prototype or parts sold. For purposes of  this section, with respect to any duty owed on prototypes or parts of  prototypes that are sold as scrap, or waste, or for recycling, where the  duty owed is based upon value, the relevant value is the market value of  the prototypes or parts, based upon their character and condition  following use for the purposes prescribed in HTSUS subheading  9817.85.01. The relevant value should take into consideration any  damage, degradation or deterioration to the prototypes or parts  resulting from their use as a prototype and/or otherwise resulting to  the articles from any other cause prior to their sale as scrap, waste,  or for recycling. The market value will generally be measured by the  selling price. Should a prototype or part of a prototype become a  component of another product that is sold as scrap, waste, or recycled  material, the relevant market value would be that portion of the selling  price attributable to the component (prototype or part) as provided in  this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Articles admitted under TIB--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Duty-free entry available.  Under the procedure presented in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, an  entry of an article made under a temporary importation bond (TIB) solely  for testing, experimental or review purposes under HTSUS subheading  9813.00.30 may be converted into a duty-free entry under   HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01, if the following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The article meets the definition for ``prototypes'' in paragraph  (b) of this section (U.S. Note 6(a) to subchapter XVII, chapter 98,  HTSUS); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The TIB entry for the article was in effect and had not been  closed, and the TIB period for the article had not expired, as of  November 9, 2000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedure for converting TIB entry to duty-free entry--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  Importer request. The importer must submit a written request, or an  electronic equivalent as authorized by CBP, that a TIB entry made under  HTSUS subheading 9813.00.30, which was in effect and had not been  closed, and for which the TIB period had not expired, as of November 9,  2000, be converted instead into a duty-free consumption entry under  HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this  section have been met. When the TIB entry is converted, the bond will be  cancelled and the entry closed. Once the conversion is complete, the  port director will provide a courtesy acknowledgment to this effect to  the importer in writing or electronically.
