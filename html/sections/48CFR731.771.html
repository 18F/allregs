                            <p class="depth0">Pending the establishment of Government-wide principles in  Attachment B of OMB Circular A-122, USAID will treat bid and proposal  costs as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Bid and proposal costs are the costs of preparing bids,  proposals, and applications for potential activities such as Government  and non-Government grants, contracts and other agreements, including the  development of scientific, cost, and other data needed to support such  bids, proposals, and applications. Except as provided in (b) below, bid  and proposal costs of the current accounting period of both successful  and unsuccessful bids and proposals normally should be treated as  indirect costs for allocation to all current activities, and no bid and  proposal costs of past accounting periods will be allocable to the  current period. However, if the organization's established   practice is to treat bid and proposal costs by some other method, the  results obtained may be accepted only if found to be reasonable and  equitable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bid and proposal costs incurred by the organization to obtain  unrestricted funds are to be treated as fund raising and allocated an  appropriate share of indirect costs under the conditions described in  paragraph B.3 of Attachment A to OMB Circular A-122.</p>
