                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon application by a small business concern pursuant to  Sec. 21.3 the Regional Administrator will, if he finds that the  additions, alterations, or methods of operation covered by the  application are adequate and necessary to comply with an applicable  standard, issue a written statement to the applicant to that effect,  within 45 working days following receipt of the application, or within  45 working days following receipt of all information required to be  submitted pursuant to Sec. 21.3(c), whichever is later. Such a written  statement shall be classified as a full approval. If an application is  deficient in any respect, with regard to the specifications for  submission listed in Sec. 21.3(c), the Regional Administrator shall  promptly, but in no event later than 30 working days following receipt  of the application, notify the applicant of such deficiency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an application contains proposed alterations, additions,  or methods of operation that are adequate and necessary to comply with  an applicable standard but also contains proposed alterations,  additions, or methods of operation that are not necessary to comply with  an applicable standard, the Regional Administrator shall conditionally  approve the application within the time limit specified in paragraph (a)  of this section, and shall also identify in the approval those  alterations, additions, or methods of operation that he determines are  not necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(B)</em> of the Small Business Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Conditional approvals will not satisfy the requirements for  approval by EPA for those alterations, additions, or methods of  operation included in the application that are determined not to be  necessary. Unnecessary alterations, additions, or methods of operation  are those which are extraneous to the achievement of an applicable  standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Conditional approvals may be appealed to the Deputy  Administrator by an applicant in accordance with the procedures  identified in Sec. 21.8.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the Regional Administrator determines that the additions,  alterations, or methods of operation covered by an application are not  necessary and adequate to comply with an applicable standard, he shall  disapprove the application and shall so advise the applicant of such  determination within the time limit specified in paragraph (a) of this  section, and shall state in writing the reasons for his determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any application shall be disapproved if the Regional  Administrator determines that the proposed addition, alteration, or  method of operation would result in the violation of any other  requirement of this Act, or of any other Federal or State law or  regulation with respect to the protection of the environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An applicant need not demonstrate that its facility or method of  operation will meet all applicable requirements established under the  Act. The applicant need only demonstrate that the additions,  alterations, or methods of operation will assist in ensuring compliance  with one or more of the applicable standards for which financial  assistance is being requested.</p><p class="depth2">Comment: As an example, a small business has two discharge pipes-- one for process water, the other for cooling water. The application for  loan assistance is to control pollution from the process water  discharge. However, EPA or a State may review the applicant's situation  and identify for SBA that the applicant is subject to other requirements  for which the applicant has not sought assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An application should not include major alternative designs  significantly differing in scope, concept, or capability. It is expected  that the applicant at the time of submission will have selected the most  appropriate or suitable design for the addition, alteration, or method  of operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> EPA will not provide assistance in the form of engineering,  design, planning or other technical services to any applicant in the  preparation of his application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> An applicant may be issued a certification for additions,  alterations, or methods of operation constructed or undertaken before  loan assistance was applied for by the applicant. Any such applications  would be reviewed by SBA for eligibility under SBA criteria, including  refinancing and loan exposure.</p>
