                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Within 30 days of the effective date of the charge or the appeals decision, an agency must submit appropriate accounting information to the Service's Assistant Commissioner, Federal Finance. The charge will be calculated following procedures outlined in I TFM 6-8000, and will be assessed for each month that noncompliance continues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Collection noncompliance. In the case of cash management collection noncompliance, an agency will absorb the charge from amounts appropriated or otherwise made available to carry out the program to which the collections relate. Charges collected from an executive agency in the case of cash management collection noncompliance will be deposited in the Cash Management Improvements Fund as outlined in Sec. 206.10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Payment noncompliance. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If an agency does not voluntarily pay the charge assessed under Sec. 206.9(a), the Service will debit the appropriate account automatically. By failing to pay voluntarily the charges as required by the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, an agency will be deemed to authorize the automatic debit to its account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Commissioner will formally terminate the charge when the Commissioner has determined that an agency has complied. In addition, on an annual basis, the Commissioner will review an agency's performance and calculation of the charge, and will notify an agency in writing of any changes to the amount being charged.</p>
