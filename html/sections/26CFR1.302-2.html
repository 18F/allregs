                                Sec. 1.302-2  Redemptions not taxable as dividends.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The fact that a redemption fails to meet the  requirements of paragraph (2), (3) or (4) of section 302(b) shall not be  taken into account in determining whether the redemption is not  essentially equivalent to a dividend under section 302(b)(1). See,  however, paragraph (b) of this section. For example, if a shareholder  owns only nonvoting stock of a corporation which is not section 306  stock and which is limited and preferred as to dividends and in  liquidation, and one-half of such stock is redeemed, the distribution  will ordinarily meet the requirements of paragraph (1) of section 302(b)  but will not meet the requirements of paragraph (2), (3) or (4) of such  section. The determination of whether or not a distribution is within  the phrase ``essentially equivalent to a dividend'' (that is, having the  same effect as a distribution without any redemption of stock) shall be  made without regard to the earnings and profits of the corporation at  the time of the distribution. For example, if A owns all the stock of a  corporation and the corporation redeems part of his stock at a time when  it has no earnings and profits, the distribution shall be treated as a  distribution under section 301 pursuant to section 302(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. One of  the facts to be considered in making this determination is the  constructive stock ownership of such shareholder under section 318(a).  All distributions in pro rata redemptions of a part of the stock of a  corporation generally will be treated as distributions under section 301  if the corporation has only one class of stock outstanding. However, for  distributions in partial liquidation, see section 302(e). The redemption  of all of one class of stock (except section 306 stock) either at one  time or in a series of redemptions generally will be considered as a  distribution under section 301 if all classes of stock outstanding at  the time of the redemption are held in the same proportion.  Distributions in redemption of stock may be treated as distributions  under section 301 regardless of the provisions of the stock certificate  and regardless of whether all stock being redeemed was acquired by the  stockholders from whom the stock   was redeemed by purchase or otherwise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> BY [INSERT NAME AND TAXPAYER  IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (IF ANY) OF TAXPAYER], A SIGNIFICANT HOLDER OF THE  STOCK OF [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (IF ANY) OF  ISSUING CORPORATION].'' If a significant holder is a controlled foreign  corporation (within the meaning of section 957), each United States  shareholder (within the meaning of section 951(b)) with respect thereto  must include this statement on or with its return. The statement must  include--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The fair market value and basis of the stock transferred by the  significant holder to the issuing corporation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A description of the property received by the significant  holder from the issuing corporation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Significant holder means any person that, immediately before the  exchange--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Owned at least five percent (by vote or value) of the total  outstanding stock of the issuing corporation if the stock owned by such  person is publicly traded; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Owned at least one percent (by vote or value) of the total  outstanding stock of the issuing corporation if the stock owned by such  person is not publicly traded.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Publicly traded stock means stock that is listed on--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A national securities exchange registered under section 6 of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f); or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> An interdealer quotation system sponsored by a national  securities association registered under section 15A of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-3).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Issuing corporation means the corporation that issued the  shares of stock, some or all of which were transferred by a significant  holder to such corporation in the exchange described in paragraph (b)(2)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cross reference. See section 6043 of the Internal Revenue Code  for requirements relating to a return by a liquidating corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Basis adjustments. In any case in which an amount received in  redemption of stock is treated as a distribution of a dividend, proper  adjustment of the basis of the remaining stock will be made with respect  to the stock redeemed. (For adjustments to basis required for certain  redemptions of corporate shareholders that are treated as extraordinary  dividends, see section 1059 and the regulations thereunder.) The  following examples illustrate the application of this rule:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. A, an individual, purchased all of the stock of  Corporation X for $100,000. In 1955 the corporation redeems half of the  stock for $150,000, and it is determined that this amount constitutes a  dividend. The remaining stock of Corporation X held by A has a basis of  $100,000.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. H and W, husband and wife, each own half of the stock of  Corporation X. All of the stock was purchased by H for $100,000 cash. In  1950 H gave one-half of the stock to W, the stock transferred having a  value in excess of $50,000. In 1955 all of the stock of H is redeemed  for $150,000, and it is determined that the distribution to H in  redemption of his shares constitutes the distribution of a dividend.  Immediately after the transaction, W holds the remaining stock of  Corporation X with a basis of $100,000.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example (2) with the  additional facts that the outstanding stock of Corporation X consists of  1,000 shares and all but 10 shares of the stock of H is redeemed.  Immediately after the transaction, H holds 10 shares of the stock of  Corporation X with a basis of $50,000, and W holds 500 shares with a  basis of $50,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective/applicability date. Paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3) and  (b)(4) of this section apply to any taxable year beginning on or after  May 30, 2006. However, taxpayers may apply paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3) and  (b)(4) of this section to any original Federal income tax return  (including any amended return filed on or before the due date (including  extensions) of such original return) timely filed on or after May 30,  2006. For taxable years beginning before May 30,   2006, see Sec. 1.302-2 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April  1, 2006.  [T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11607, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 8724, 62 FR  38028, July 26, 1997; T.D. 9264, 71 FR 30593, May 30, 2006; T.D. 9329,  72 FR 32796, June 14, 2007]</p>
