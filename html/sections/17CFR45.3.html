                            <p class="depth0">Registered entities and swap counterparties must report required swap creation data electronically to a swap data repository as set forth in this Section. This obligation commences on the applicable compliance date set forth in the preamble to this part. The reporting obligations of swap counterparties with respect to swaps executed prior to the applicable compliance date and in existence on or after July 21, 2010, the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, are set forth in part 46 of this chapter. This section and Sec. 45.4 establish the general swap data reporting obligations of swap dealers, major swap participants, non-SD/MSP counterparties, swap execution facilities, designated contract markets, and derivatives clearing organizations to report swap data to a swap data repository. In addition to the reporting obligations

set forth in this section and Sec. 45.4, registered entities and swap counterparties are subject to other reporting obligations set forth in this chapter, including, without limitation, the following: Swap dealers, major swap participants, and non-SD/MSP counterparties are also subject to the reporting obligations with respect to corporate affiliations reporting set forth in Sec. 45.6; swap execution facilities, designated contract markets, swap dealers, major swap participants, and non-SD/MSP counterparties are subject to the reporting obligations with respect to real time reporting of swap data set forth in part 43 of this chapter; counterparties to a swap for which the clearing requirement exception in CEA section 2(h)(7) has been elected are subject to the reporting obligations set forth in part 39 of this chapter; and, where applicable, swap dealers, major swap participants, and non-SD/MSP counterparties are subject to the reporting obligations with respect to large traders set forth in parts 17 and 18 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market. (1) For each swap executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market, the swap execution facility or designated contract market must report all required swap creation data, as soon as technologically practicable after execution of the swap. This report must include all confirmation data for the swap, as defined in part 23 and in Sec. 45.1, and all primary economic terms data for the swap, as defined in Sec. 45.1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For each swap executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market, the swap execution facility or designated contract market must report all required swap creation data, as soon as technologically practicable after execution of the swap.
