The Administrative Law Judge shall then rule upon the motion  and, upon request of the movant, shall certify an adverse ruling for  appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Withdrawal sua sponte. The Administrative Law Judge may at any  time withdraw from any proceedings in which he deems himself  disqualified for any reason.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conduct.

Subject to review, as provided elsewhere in this part,  the Administrative Law Judge shall have power to take actions and  decisions in conformity with statute or in the interests of justice. The  Administrative Law Judge shall not interrupt the recording of the  proceedings on the record over the objection of any party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Absence or change of the Administrative Law Judge. In the case  of the absence or unavailability of the Administrative Law Judge, or his  inability to act, or his removal by disqualification or withdrawal, the  powers and duties to be performed by him under this part in connection  with a hearing assigned to him may, unless otherwise directed by the  Administrator, be assigned to another Administrative Law Judge so  designated to act by the Chief Administrative Law Judge, the  Administrator or the Environmental Appeals Board.
