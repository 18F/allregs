refund to us the amount of any recognition payment(s) we made to you for the earlier period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cancelling your waiver. You may cancel your waiver of State recognition payments at any time by making a written request with us. The cancellation will be effective the month in which it is filed.
