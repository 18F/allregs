                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. You must install, operate, and maintain each CPMS specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section according to paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section. You must install, operate, and maintain each CPMS specified in paragraph (b) of this section according to paragraphs (a)(3) through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The CPMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation for each successive 15-minute period. You must have a minimum of four equally spaced successive cycles of CPMS operation in 1 hour.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must determine the average of all recorded readings for each successive 3-hour period of the emission capture system and add-on control device operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must record the results of each inspection, calibration, and validation check of the CPMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must maintain the CPMS at all times and have available necessary parts for routine repairs of the monitoring equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You must operate the CPMS and collect emission capture system and add-on control device parameter data at all times that an engine test cell/stand is operating, except during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities (including, if applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> You must not use emission capture system or add-on control device parameter data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, out-of-control periods, or required quality assurance or control activities when calculating data averages. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in calculating the data averages for determining compliance with the emission capture system and add-on control device operating limits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the CPMS to provide valid data. Monitoring failures

that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. Any period for which the monitoring system is out-of-control and data are not available for required calculations is a deviation from the monitoring requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Capture system bypass line. You must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section for each emission capture system that contains bypass lines that could divert emissions away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must monitor or secure the valve or closure mechanism controlling the bypass line in a nondiverting position in such a way that the valve or closure mechanism cannot be opened without creating a record that the valve was opened. The method used to monitor or secure the valve or closure mechanism must meet one of the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Flow control position indicator. Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a flow control position indicator that takes a reading at least once every 15 minutes and provides a record indicating whether the emissions are directed to the add-on control device or diverted from the add-on control device. The time of occurrence and flow control position must be recorded, as well as every time the flow direction is changed. The flow control position indicator must be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that could divert the emissions away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Car-seal or lock-and-key valve closures. Secure any bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. You must visually inspect the seal or closure mechanism at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position, and the emissions are not diverted away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Valve closure monitoring. Ensure that any bypass line valve is in the closed (nondiverting) position through monitoring of valve position at least once every 15 minutes. You must inspect the monitoring system at least once every month to verify that the monitor will indicate valve position.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Automatic shutdown system. Use an automatic shutdown system in which the engine testing operation is stopped when flow is diverted by the bypass line away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere when an engine test cell/stand is operating. You must inspect the automatic shutdown system at least once every month to verify that it will detect diversions of flow and shut down the engine test cell/stand in operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If any bypass line is opened, you must include a description of why the bypass line was opened and the length of time it remained open in the semiannual compliance reports required in Sec. 63.9350.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Thermal oxidizers and catalytic oxidizers. If you are using a thermal oxidizer or catalytic oxidizer as an add-on control device, you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a thermal oxidizer, install a gas temperature monitor in the firebox of the thermal oxidizer or in the duct immediately downstream of the firebox before any substantial heat exchange occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a catalytic oxidizer, you must install a gas temperature monitor in the gas stream immediately before the catalyst bed, and if you established operating limits according to Sec. 63.9324(b)(1) and (2), also install a gas temperature monitor in the gas stream immediately after the catalyst bed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you establish operating limits according to Sec. 63.9324(b)(1) and (2), then you must install the gas temperature monitors both upstream and downstream of the catalyst bed. The temperature monitors must be in the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed to measure the temperature difference across the bed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you establish operating limits according to Sec. 63.9324(b)(3) and (4), then you must install a gas temperature monitor upstream of the catalyst bed. The temperature monitor must be in the gas stream immediately before the catalyst bed to measure the temperature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For all thermal oxidizers and catalytic oxidizers, you must meet the

requirements in paragraphs (a) and (c)(3)(i) through (vii) of this section for each gas temperature monitoring device.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Locate the temperature sensor in a position that provides a representative temperature.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use a temperature sensor with a measurement sensitivity of 4 degrees Fahrenheit or 0.75 percent of the temperature value, whichever is larger.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Shield the temperature sensor system from electromagnetic interference and chemical contaminants.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If a gas temperature chart recorder is used, it must have a measurement sensitivity in the minor division of at least 20 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Perform an electronic calibration at least semiannually according to the procedures in the manufacturer's owner's manual. Following the electronic calibration, you must conduct a temperature sensor validation check in which a second or redundant temperature sensor placed near the process temperature sensor must yield a reading within 30 degrees Fahrenheit of the process temperature sensor reading.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Conduct calibration and validation checks anytime the sensor exceeds the manufacturer's specified maximum operating temperature range or install a new temperature sensor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> At least monthly, inspect components for integrity and electrical connections for continuity, oxidation, and galvanic corrosion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Emission capture systems. The capture system monitoring system must comply with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each flow measurement device, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (d)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Locate a flow sensor in a position that provides a representative flow measurement in the duct from each capture device in the emission capture system to the add-on control device.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reduce swirling flow or abnormal velocity distributions due to upstream and downstream disturbances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Conduct a flow sensor calibration check at least semiannually.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> At least monthly, inspect components for integrity, electrical connections for continuity, and mechanical connections for leakage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each pressure drop measurement device, you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (d)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Locate the pressure sensor(s) in or as close to a position that provides a representative measurement of the pressure drop across each opening you are monitoring.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Minimize or eliminate pulsating pressure, vibration, and internal and external corrosion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Check pressure tap pluggage daily.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Using an inclined manometer with a measurement sensitivity of 0.0002 inch water, check gauge calibration quarterly and transducer calibration monthly.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Conduct calibration checks any time the sensor exceeds the manufacturer's specified maximum operating pressure range or install a new pressure sensor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> At least monthly, inspect components for integrity, electrical connections for continuity, and mechanical connections for leakage.</p>
