Information as to the number and size of display fireworks  contained in any one packaged display segment or packaged display shall  be provided to any ATF officer on request. Any discrepancy which might  indicate a theft or loss of explosive materials is to be reported in  accordance with Sec. 555.30.  [T.D. ATF-293, 55 FR 3722, Feb. 5, 1990, as amended by T.D.
