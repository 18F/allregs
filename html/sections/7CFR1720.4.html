                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with section 313A of the RE Act, a guarantee will  be issued by the Secretary only if the Secretary determines, in  accordance with the requirements set forth in this part, that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The proceeds of the guaranteed bonds will be used by the  guaranteed lender to make loans to borrowers for electrification or  telephone purposes eligible for assistance under this chapter, or to  refinance bonds or notes previously issued by the guaranteed lender for  such purposes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At the time the guarantee is executed, the total principal  amount of guaranteed bonds outstanding would not exceed the principal  amount of outstanding eligible loans previously made by the guaranteed  lender;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The proceeds of the guaranteed bonds will not be used directly  or indirectly to fund projects for the generation of electricity; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The guaranteed lender will not use any amounts obtained from the  reduction in funding costs provided by a loan guarantee issued prior to  June 18, 2008, to reduce the interest rates borrowers are paying on new  or outstanding loans, other than new concurrent loans as provided in  part 1710 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> During the term of the guarantee, the guaranteed lender shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Limit cash patronage refunds, for guaranteed lenders having a  credit rating below ``A-'' on its senior secured debt without regard to  the guarantee. For such guaranteed lenders, cash patronage refunds are  limited to five percent of the total patronage refund eligible. The  limit on patronage refunds must be maintained until the credit rating is  restored to ``A-'' or above. For those guaranteed lenders subject to  patronage limitations, equity securities issued as part of the patronage  refund shall not be redeemable in cash during the term of any part of  the guarantee, and the guaranteed lender shall not issue any dividends  on any class of equity securities during the term of the guarantee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maintain sufficient collateral equal to the principal amount  outstanding, for guaranteed lenders having a credit rating below ``A-''  on its senior secured debt without regard to the guarantee, or in the  case of a lender that does not have senior secured debt, a corporate  (counterparty) credit rating below ``A-'' without regard to the  guarantee. Collateral shall be in the form of specific and identifiable  unpledged securities equal to the value of the guaranteed amount. In the  case of a guaranteed lender's default, the U.S. government claim shall  not be subordinated to the claims of other creditors, and the indenture  must provide that in the event of default, the government has first  rights on the   asset. Upon application and throughout the term of the guarantee,  guaranteed lenders not subject to collateral pledging requirements shall  identify, with the concurrence of the Secretary, specific assets to be  held as collateral should the credit rating of its senior secured debt,  or its corporate credit rating, as applicable, without regard to the  guarantee fall below ``A-.'' The Secretary has discretion to require  collateral at any time should circumstances warrant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The final maturity of the guaranteed bonds shall not exceed 20  years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The guaranteed bonds shall be issued to the Federal Financing  Bank on terms and conditions consistent with comparable government- guaranteed bonds and satisfactory to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Secretary shall guarantee payment son guaranteed bonds in  such forms and on such terms and conditions and subject to such  covenants, representations, warranties and requirements (including  requirements for audits) as determined appropriate for satisfying the  requirements of this part. The Secretary shall require the guaranteed  lender to enter into a guarantee agreement to evidence its acceptance of  the foregoing. Any guarantee issued under this part shall be made in a  separate and distinct offering.  [69 FR 63049, Oct. 29, 2004, as amended at 75 FR 42574, July 22, 2010]</p>
