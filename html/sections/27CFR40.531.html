The appropriate TTB officer may approve an alternate method or procedure, subject to stated conditions, when the appropriate TTB officer finds that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Good cause has been shown for the use of the alternate method or procedure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed method or procedure, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any provision of law, and will not result in an increase in cost to the Government or hinder the effective administration of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. A manufacturer of processed tobacco who desires to employ an alternate method or procedure must submit a written application to the appropriate TTB officer.
