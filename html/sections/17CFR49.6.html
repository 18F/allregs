The registration of the predecessor shall be deemed to remain effective as the registration of the successor if the successor, within 30 days after such succession, files an application for registration on Form SDR, and the predecessor files a request for vacation of registration on Form SDR provided, however, that the registration of the predecessor swap data repository shall cease to be effective 90 days after the application for registration on Form SDR is filed by the successor swap data repository.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the succession is based solely on a change in the predecessor's date or state of incorporation, form of organization, or composition of a partnership, the successor may, within 30 days after the succession, amend the registration of the predecessor swap data repository on Form SDR to reflect these changes. This amendment shall be an application for registration filed by the predecessor and adopted by the successor.</p>
