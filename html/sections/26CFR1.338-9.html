                                Sec. 1.338-9  International aspects of section 338.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section provides guidance regarding international  aspects of section 338. As provided in Sec. 1.338-2(c)(18), a foreign  corporation, a DISC, or a corporation for which a section 936 election  has been made is considered a target affiliate for all purposes of  section 338. In addition, stock described in section 338(h)(6)(B)(ii)  held by a target affiliate is not excluded from the operation of section  338.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Application of section 338 to foreign targets--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.  For purposes of subtitle A, the deemed sale tax consequences, as defined  in Sec. 1.338-2(c)(7), of a foreign target for which a section 338  election is made (FT), and the corresponding earnings and profits, are  taken into account in determining the taxation of FT and FT's direct and  indirect shareholders. See, however, section 338(h)(16). For example,  the income and earnings and profits of FT are determined, for purposes  of sections 551, 951, 1248, and 1293, by taking into account the deemed  sale tax sentence consequences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ownership of FT stock on the acquisition date. A person who  transfers FT stock to the purchasing corporation on FT's acquisition  date is considered to own the transferred stock at the close of FT's  acquisition date. See, e.g., Sec. 1.951-1(f) (relating to determination  of holding period for purposes of sections 951 through 964). If on the  acquisition   date the purchasing corporation owns a block of FT stock that was  acquired before FT's acquisition date, the purchasing corporation is  considered to own such block of stock at the close of the acquisition  date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Carryover FT stock--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definition. FT stock is carryover FT  stock if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> FT was a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of  section 957 (taking into account section 953(c)) at any time during the  portion of the 12-month acquisition period that ends on the acquisition  date; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Such stock is owned as of the beginning of the day after FT's  acquisition date by a person other than a purchasing corporation, or by  a purchasing corporation if the stock is nonrecently purchased and is  not subject to a gain recognition election under Sec. 1.338-5(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Carryover of earnings and profits. The earnings and profits of  old FT (and associated foreign taxes) attributable to the carryover FT  stock (adjusted to reflect deemed sale tax sentence consequences) carry  over to new FT solely for purposes of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Characterizing an actual distribution with respect to a share of  carryover FT stock as a dividend;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Characterizing gain on a post-acquisition date transfer of a  share of carryover FT stock as a dividend under section 1248 (if such  section is otherwise applicable);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Characterizing an investment of earnings in United States  property as income under sections 951(a)(1)(B) and 956 (if such sections  are otherwise applicable); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Determining foreign taxes deemed paid under sections 902 and 960  with respect to the amount treated as a dividend or income by virtue of  this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) (subject to the operation of section  338(h)(16)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Cap on carryover of earnings and profits. The amount of  earnings and profits of old FT taken into account with respect to a  share of carryover FT stock is limited to the amount that would have  been included in gross income of the owner of such stock as a dividend  under section 1248 if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The shareholder transferred that share to the purchasing  corporation on FT's acquisition date for a consideration equal to the  fair market value of that share on that date; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of nonrecently purchased FT stock treated as  carryover FT stock, a gain recognition election under section  338(b)(3)(A) applied to that share. For purposes of the preceding  sentence, a shareholder that is a controlled foreign corporation is  considered to be a United States person, and the principle of section  1248(c)(2)(D)(ii) (concerning a United States person's indirect  ownership of stock in a foreign corporation) applies in determining the  correct holding period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Post-acquisition date distribution of old FT earnings and  profits. A post-acquisition date distribution with respect to a share of  carryover FT stock is considered to be derived first from earnings and  profits derived after FT's acquisition date and then from earnings and  profits derived on or before FT's acquisition date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Old FT earnings and profits unaffected by post-acquisition date  deficits. The carryover amount for a share of carryover FT stock is not  reduced by deficits in earnings and profits incurred by new FT. This  rule applies for purposes of determining the amount of foreign taxes  deemed paid regardless of the fact that there are no accumulated  earnings and profits. For example, a distribution by new FT with respect  to a share of carryover FT stock is treated as a dividend by the  distributee to the extent of the carryover amount for that share  notwithstanding that new FT has no earnings and profits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Character of FT stock as carryover FT stock eliminated upon  disposition. A share of FT stock is not considered carryover FT stock  after it is disposed of provided that all gain realized on the transfer  is recognized at the time of the transfer, or that, if less than all of  the realized gain is recognized, the recognized amount equals or exceeds  the remaining carryover amount for that share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Passive foreign investment company stock. Stock that is owned as  of the beginning of the day after FT's acquisition date by a person  other than a purchasing corporation, or by a purchasing corporation if  the FT stock is   nonrecently purchased stock not subject to a gain recognition election  under Sec. 1.338-5(d), is treated as passive foreign investment company  stock to the extent provided in section 1297(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Dividend treatment under section 1248(e). The principles of this  paragraph (b) apply to shareholders of a domestic corporation subject to  section 1248(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Allocation of foreign taxes. If a section 338 election is made  for target (whether foreign or domestic), and target's taxable year  under foreign law (if any) does not close at the end of the acquisition  date, foreign income taxes attributable to the foreign taxable income  earned by target during such foreign taxable year are allocated to old  target and new target. Such allocation is made under the principles of  Sec. 1.1502-76(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Operation of section 338(h)(16). [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as otherwise provided, all corporations use  the calendar year as the taxable year, have no earnings and profits (or  deficit) accumulated for any taxable year, and have only one class of  outstanding stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A  has owned 90 of the 100 shares of CFCT stock since CFCT was organized on  March 13, 1989. P has owned the remaining 10 shares of CFCT stock since  CFCT was organized. Those 10 shares constitute nonrecently purchased  stock in P's hands within the meaning of section 338(b)(6)(B). On  November 1, 1994, P purchases A's 90 shares of CFCT stock for $90,000  and makes a section 338 election for CFCT. P also makes a gain  recognition election under section 338(b)(3)(A) and Sec. 1.338-5(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> CFCT's earnings and profits for its short taxable year ending on  November 1, 1994, are $50,000, determined without taking into account  the deemed asset sale. Assume A recognizes gain of $81,000 on the sale  of the CFCT stock. Further, assume that CFCT recognizes gain of $40,000  by reason of its deemed sale of assets under section 338(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A's sale of CFCT stock to P is a transfer to which section 1248  and paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section apply. For purposes of  applying section 1248(a) to A, the earnings and profits of CFCT for its  short taxable year ending on November 1, 1994, are $90,000 (the earnings  and profits for that taxable year as determined under Sec. 1.1248-2(e)  ($50,000) plus earnings from the deemed sale ($40,000)). Thus, A's  entire gain is characterized as a dividend under section 1248 (but see  section 338(h)(16)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Assume that P recognizes a gain of $9,000 with respect to the 10  shares of nonrecently purchased CFCT stock by reason of the gain  recognition election. Because P is treated as selling the nonrecently  purchased stock for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, section  1248 applies. Thus, under Sec. 1.1248-2(e), $9,000 of the $90,000 of  earnings and profits for 1994 are attributable to the block of 10 shares  of CFCT stock deemed sold by P at the close of November 1, 1994 ($90,000  x 10/100). Accordingly, P's entire gain on the deemed sale of 10 shares  of CFCT stock is included under section 1248(a) in P's gross income as a  dividend (but see section 338(h)(16)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>  Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that P does not make a  gain recognition election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(3)(A)</em>. Under the  facts of Example 1, P would have recognized a gain of $9,000 with  respect to that block, all of which would have been a section 1248  dividend ($90,000 x 10/100). Accordingly, the carryover amount for the  block of 10 shares of nonrecently purchased CFCT stock is $9,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> X and Y, both U.S. corporations, have each  owned 50% of the CFCT stock since 1986. Among CFCT's assets are assets  the sale of which would generate subpart F income. On December 31, 1994,  X sells its CFCT stock to P. On June 30, 1995, Y sells its CFCT stock to  P. P makes a section 338 election for CFCT. In both 1994 and 1995, CFCT  has subpart F income resulting from operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For taxable year 1994, X and Y are United States shareholders on  the last day of CFCT's taxable year, so pursuant to section 951(a)(1)(A)  each must include in income its pro rata share of CFCT's subpart F  income for 1994. Because P's holding period in the CFCT stock acquired  from X does not begin until January 1, 1995, P is not a United States  shareholder on the last day of 1994 for purposes of section 951(a)(1)(A)  (see Sec. 1.951-1(f)). X must then determine the extent to   which section 1248 recharacterizes its gain on the sale of CFCT stock as  a dividend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For the short taxable year ending June 30, 1995, Y is considered  to own the CFCT stock sold to P at the close of CFCT's acquisition date.  Because the acquisition date is the last day of CFCT's taxable year, Y  and P are United States shareholders on the last day of CFCT's taxable  year. Pursuant to section 951(a)(1)(A), each must include its pro rata  share of CFCT's subpart F income for the short taxable year ending June  30, 1995. This includes any income generated on the deemed sale of  CFCT's assets. Y must then determine the extent to which section 1248  recharacterizes its gain on the sale of the CFCT stock as a dividend,  taking into account any increase in CFCT's earnings and profits due to  the deemed sale of assets.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Acquisition of control for purposes of section 951 prior  to the acquisition date. FS owns 100% of the FT stock. On July 1, 1994,  P buys 60% of the FT stock. On December 31, 1994, P buys the remaining  40% of the FT stock and makes a section 338 election for FT. For tax  year 1994, FT has earnings and profits of $1,000 (including earnings  resulting from the deemed sale). The section 338 election results in  $500 of subpart F income. As a result of the section 338 election, P  must include in gross income the following amount under section  951(a)(1)(A) (see Sec. 1.951-(b)(2)):  FT's subpart F income for 1994................................   $500.00 Less: reduction under section 951(a)(2)(A) for period (1-1-94     249.32</p><p class="depth0">through 7-1-94) during which FT is not a controlled foreign</p><p class="depth0">corporation ($500x182/365)...................................</p><p class="depth0">--------- Subpart F income as limited by section 951 (a)(2)(A)..........    250.68 P's pro rata share of subpart F income as determined under        150.41</p><p class="depth0">section 951(a)(2)(A) (60%x250.68)............................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> T is a corporation for  which a section 936 election has been made. P makes a qualified stock  purchase of T and makes a section 338 election for T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> T's deemed sale of assets under section 338 constitutes a sale  for purposes of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code, including  section 936(a)(1)(A)(ii). To the extent that the assets deemed sold are  used in the conduct of an active trade or business in a possession for  purposes of section 936(a)(1)(A)(i), and assuming all the other  conditions of section 936 are satisfied, the income from the deemed sale  qualifies for the credit granted by section 936(a). The source of income  from the deemed sale is determined as if the assets had actually been  sold and is not affected for purposes of section 936 by section  338(h)(16).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Because new T is treated a new corporation for purposes of  subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code, the three year testing period  in section 936(a)(2)(A) begins again for new T on the day following T's  acquisition date. Thus, if the character or source of old T's gross  income disqualified it for the credit under section 936, a fresh start  is allowed by a section 338 election.
