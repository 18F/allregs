                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Even though formal proceedings have begun, the parties again have full opportunity at every stage to dispose of the case by amicable adjustment and in compliance with the law. Thus, after the complaint has been issued and a hearing scheduled or commenced, the attorney in charge of the case and the Regional Director afford all parties every opportunity for the submission and consideration of facts, argument, offers of settlement, or proposals of adjustment, except where time, the nature of the proceeding, and the public interest do not permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> After the issuance of a complaint, the Agency favors a formal settlement agreement, which is subject to the approval of the Board in Washington, DC. In such an agreement, the parties agree to waive their right to hearing and agree further that the Board may issue an order requiring the respondent to take action appropriate to the terms of the settlement. Ordinarily the formal settlement agreement also contains the respondent's consent to the Board's application for the entry of a judgment by the appropriate circuit court of appeals enforcing the Board's order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After the issuance of a complaint, the Agency favors a formal settlement agreement, which is subject to the approval of the Board in Washington, DC.

Such agreement is not subject to approval by the Board and does not provide for a Board order. It provides for the withdrawal of the complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> If after issuance of a complaint but before opening of the hearing, the charging party will not join in a settlement tentatively agreed upon by the Regional Director, the respondent, and any other parties whose consent may be required, the Regional Director serves a copy of the proposed settlement agreement on the charging party with a brief written statement of the reasons for proposing its approval. Within 7 days after service of these documents, the charging party may file with the Regional Director a written statement of any objections to the proposed settlement. Such objections will be considered by the Regional Director in determining whether to approve the proposed settlement. If the settlement is approved by the Regional Director notwithstanding the objections, the charging party is so informed and provided a brief written statement of the reasons for the approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If after issuance of a complaint but before opening of the hearing, the charging party will not join in a settlement tentatively agreed upon by the Regional Director, the respondent, and any other parties whose consent may be required, the Regional Director serves a copy of the proposed settlement agreement on the charging party with a brief written statement of the reasons for proposing its approval.

Washington, DC, where they are reviewed by the General Counsel. If the General Counsel decides to approve the settlement agreement, the charging party is so informed and the agreement and accompanying documents are submitted to the Board, upon whose approval the settlement is contingent. Within 7 days after service of notice of submission of the settlement agreement to the Board, the charging party may file with the Board in Washington, DC, a further statement in support of objections to the settlement agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the settlement agreement approved by the Regional Director is an informal one, providing for the withdrawal of the complaint, the charging party may appeal the Regional Director's action to the General Counsel, as provided in Sec. 102.19 of the Board's Rules and Regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> If the settlement occurs after the opening of the hearing and before issuance of the administrative law judge's decision and there is an all-party informal settlement, the request for withdrawal of the complaint must be submitted to the administrative law judge for approval. If the all-party settlement is a formal one, final approval must come from the Board. If any party will not join in the settlement agreed to by the other parties, the administrative law judge will give such party an opportunity to state on the record or in writing its reasons for opposing the settlement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the settlement occurs after the opening of the hearing and before issuance of the administrative law judge's decision and there is an all-party informal settlement, the request for withdrawal of the complaint must be submitted to the administrative law judge for approval.
