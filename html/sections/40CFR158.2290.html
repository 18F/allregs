The following test notes apply to the data  requirements in the table to paragraph (h) of this section:</p><p class="depth4">1. A petition proposing a numerical tolerance or a tolerance  exemption is required for any food or feed use subject to section 408 of  FFDCA if the use is not covered by an existing tolerance or tolerance  exemption. If the use is subject to FFDCA section 409, the applicant  must identify to EPA an applicable section 409 food additive regulation  or clearance, or submit a copy of a petition to FDA requesting a section  409 food additive regulation or clearance for the food or feed use.</p><p class="depth4">2. An analytical reference standard is required for any food or feed  use requiring a numeric tolerance or exemption. Material safety data  sheets as specified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  in 29 CFR 1910.1200 must accompany analytical standards.</p><p class="depth4">3. Data are required if a pesticide may be used in a food-handling  establishment unless data including, but not limited to, theoretical  (high-end) estimates, radiolabeled laboratory data, or the nature of the  residue on surfaces study show that residues will not occur in food or  feed.</p><p class="depth4">4. If an antimicrobial pesticide may be applied to a food-contact  surface or impregnated into a food-contact material and if theoretical  (high-end) estimates of exposure exceed EPA's risk level of concern,  then the nature of the residue on surfaces study is required. Protocols  must be approved by the Agency prior to the initiation of the study.</p><p class="depth4">5. Based on the results of the nature of the residue on surfaces  study, if residues of concern are identified, then the migration study  will be required. Protocols must be approved by the Agency prior to the  initiation of the study.</p><p class="depth4">6. If a magnitude of the residue study, as specified in Sec.  158.2290(d), is required, then a residue analytical method suitable for  collecting data is also required. The method must be capable of  determining all residues of concern, to permit calculation of dietary  risk or to establish a tolerance or tolerance exemption.</p><p class="depth4">7. If a magnitude of the residue study, as specified in Sec.  158.2290(d), is required, then storage stability data are also required,  unless analytical samples are stored for 30 days or less. If, during  hazard characterization, a residue has been identified as ``of concern''  and is known to be volatile or labile, then storage stability data are  required regardless of sample storage time.</p><p class="depth4">8. If crop plants or metabolically active raw agricultural  commodities of food crops may be directly or indirectly exposed to an  antimicrobial, plant metabolism studies are required to determine the  transformation products that may enter the human diet. Such exposure  could include, but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth4">i. Treatment of storage or shipping containers,</p><p class="depth4">ii. Postharvest fruit and vegetable treatment prior to shipping or  storage,</p><p class="depth4">iii. Use of antimicrobial-treated water for irrigation, and</p><p class="depth4">iv. Any direct food contact use.</p><p class="depth4">9. If livestock may be exposed to an antimicrobial, then hen and  ruminant metabolism studies are required to determine the identities of  residues of concern that may enter the human diet from consumption of  livestock commodities. Livestock may be exposed via the oral, dermal, or  inhalation route following treatment or contamination of sites  including, but not limited to, livestock premises, feed, and drinking  water. Shell eggs and other metabolically active livestock products may  also be treated. If livestock may be exposed to one or more residues of  concern differing from those found in animals, then one or more  additional livestock metabolism studies involving dosing with these  residues may be required.</p><p class="depth4">10. If there is a numerical tolerance or tolerance exemption level  to enforce, then a residue analytical method suitable for enforcement  purposes is required. The method must be supported by an independent  laboratory validation.</p><p class="depth4">11. If there is a numerical tolerance or tolerance exemption level  to enforce, then testing is required to determine whether the Food and  Drug Administration/United States Department of Agriculture multiresidue  methodology would detect and identify   the antimicrobial and its residues of concern, as part of programs to  monitor pesticides in the U.S. food supply.</p><p class="depth4">12. Data are required if an antimicrobial may be applied directly to  water or if there is the potential that the antimicrobial-treated water  could be used directly for drinking water purposes by humans or animals  or that contaminated water could run-off, leach, or be discharged from  treated sites or materials and make its way into potable water.</p><p class="depth4">13. Data are required if an antimicrobial may be applied directly to  water inhabited by fish or that will be inhabited by fish or if  contaminated water could run-off, leach, or be discharged from treated  sites or materials and make its way into bodies of water containing fish  that may be used for human consumption.</p><p class="depth4">14. Data are required if an antimicrobial may be applied directly to  water used for irrigation of food crops or such that contaminated water  could run-off, leach, or be discharged from treated sites or materials  to make its way into water used for irrigation of food crops.</p><p class="depth4">15. If the antimicrobial may be applied directly to livestock,  metabolically-active livestock commodities (e.g., eggs), livestock feed  or drinking water, or livestock premises, or a livestock metabolism  study indicates that residues of the antimicrobial may result in  livestock commodities, studies are required to determine the magnitude  of the residues of concern in fat, meat, meat by-products, milk,  poultry, and eggs that may be consumed by humans. These studies,  however, may not be required in cases where the livestock metabolism  studies indicate that transfer of pesticide residues of concern to  tissues, milk, and eggs is not expected to occur at the maximum expected  exposure level for the animals.</p><p class="depth4">16. If food crops or raw agricultural commodities of food crops may  be exposed to an antimicrobial, then residue studies are required to  determine the magnitude of the residues of concern that may enter the  human diet. Such exposures include, but are not limited to, postharvest  fruit and vegetable treatments and application of antimicrobial  chemicals to field crops, mushroom houses, empty or occupied beehives,  or wood used to construct beehives.</p><p class="depth4">17. Data on the nature and magnitude of residues in processed food  or feed are required if antimicrobial residues could potentially  concentrate on processing. If so, the establishment of a separate  tolerance higher than that in the raw agricultural commodity may be  required.</p><p class="depth4">18. Data are required when dietary exposure values at the tolerance  level or screening-level (high-end) result in estimates of dietary or  aggregate risk that meet or exceed the Agency's level of concern. These  data may include, but are not limited to, washing, cooking, processing,  or degradation studies as well as market basket surveys for a more  realistic residue determination. Protocols must be approved by the  Agency prior to the initiation of the study.</p><p class="depth4">Subparts X	Z [Reserved]    Sec. Sec. 158.2300-158.2500  [Reserved]</p>
