This requirement does not preclude combining of exhaust gas streams provided the combined steam is ducted through a control system from which the concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm, or equivalent as provided in Sec. 61.66. This requirement does not apply to equipment that has been opened, is out of operation, and met the requirement in Sec. 61.65(b)(6)(i) before being opened.
