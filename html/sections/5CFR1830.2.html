                                Sec. 1830.2  Requirements for making Privacy Act requests.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How made and addressed. A request for OSC records under the  Privacy Act should be made by writing to the agency. The request should  be sent by regular mail addressed to: Privacy Act Officer, U.S. Office  of Special Counsel, 1730 M Street, N.W. (Suite 218), Washington, DC  20036-4505. Such requests may also be faxed to the Privacy Act Officer  at the number provided on the FOIA/PA page of OSC's web site (see  1830.1). For the quickest handling, both the request letter and envelope  or any fax cover sheet should be clearly marked ``Privacy Act Request.''  A Privacy Act request may also be delivered in person at OSC's  headquarters office in Washington, DC. Whether sent by mail or by fax,  or delivered in person, a Privacy Act request will not be considered to  have been received by OSC until it reaches the Privacy Act Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Description of records sought. Requesters must describe the  records sought in enough detail for them to be located with a reasonable  amount of effort. Whenever possible, requests should describe any  particular record sought, such as the date, title or name, author,  recipient, and subject matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Proof of identity. Requests received by mail, fax, or personal  delivery should contain sufficient information to enable OSC to  determine that the requester and the subject of the record are one and  the same. To assist in this process, an individual should submit his or  her name and home address, business title and address, and any other  known identifying information such as an agency file number or  identification number, a description of the circumstances under which  the records were compiled, and any other information deemed necessary by  OSC to properly process the request. An individual delivering a request  in person may be required to present proof of identity, preferably a  government-issued document bearing the individual's photograph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Freedom of Information Act processing. OSC also processes all  Privacy Act requests for access to records under the Freedom of  Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, following the rules contained in part  1820 of this chapter, which gives requesters the benefit of both  statutes.</p>
