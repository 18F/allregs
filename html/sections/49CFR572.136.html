The test procedure for the knee assembly is as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Soak the knee assembly in a controlled environment at any temperature between 18.9 and 25.6 [deg]C (66 and 78 [deg]F) and a relative humidity from 10 to 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mount the test material and secure it to a rigid test fixture as shown

in Figure O5. No part of the foot or tibia may contact any exterior surface.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Align the test probe so that throughout its stroke and at contact with the knee it is within 2 degrees of horizontal and collinear with the longitudinal centerline of the femur.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Guide the pendulum so that there is no significant lateral vertical or rotational movement at the time of initial contact between the impactor and the knee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The test probe velocity at the time of contact shall be 2.1 0.03 m/s (6.9 0.1 ft/s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> No suspension hardware, suspension cables, or any other attachments to the probe, including the velocity vane, shall make contact with the dummy during the test.
