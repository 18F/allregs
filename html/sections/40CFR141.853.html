                                Sec.  141.853  General monitoring requirements for all public
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sample siting plans. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Systems must develop a written sample  siting plan that identifies sampling sites and a sample collection  schedule that are representative of water throughout the distribution  system not later than March 31, 2016. These plans are subject to State  review and revision. Systems must collect total coliform samples  according to the written sample siting plan. Monitoring required by  Sec. Sec.  141.854 through 141.858 may take place at a customer's  premise, dedicated sampling station, or other designated compliance  sampling location. Routine and repeat sample sites and any sampling   points necessary to meet the requirements of subpart S must be reflected  in the sampling plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Systems must collect samples at regular time intervals  throughout the month, except that systems that use only ground water and  serve 4,900 or fewer people may collect all required samples on a single  day if they are taken from different sites.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Systems must take at least the minimum number of required  samples even if the system has had an E. coli MCL violation or has  exceeded the coliform treatment technique triggers in Sec.  141.859(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A system may conduct more compliance monitoring than is required  by this subpart to investigate potential problems in the distribution  system and use monitoring as a tool to assist in uncovering problems. A  system may take more than the minimum number of required routine samples  and must include the results in calculating whether the coliform  treatment technique trigger in Sec.  141.859(a)(1)(i) and (ii) has been  exceeded only if the samples are taken in accordance with the existing  sample siting plan and are representative of water throughout the  distribution system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)(ii)</em> of this section, systems required to conduct  triggered source water monitoring under Sec.  141.402(a) must take  ground water source sample(s) in addition to repeat samples required  under this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Systems may propose repeat monitoring locations to the State  that the system believes to be representative of a pathway for  contamination of the distribution system. A system may elect to specify  either alternative fixed locations or criteria for selecting repeat  sampling sites on a situational basis in a standard operating procedure  (SOP) in its sample siting plan. The system must design its SOP to focus  the repeat samples at locations that best verify and determine the  extent of potential contamination of the distribution system area based  on specific situations. The State may modify the SOP or require  alternative monitoring locations as needed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ground water systems serving 1,000 or fewer people may propose  repeat sampling locations to the State that differentiate potential  source water and distribution system contamination (e.g., by sampling at  entry points to the distribution system). A ground water system with a  single well required to conduct triggered source water monitoring may,  with written State approval, take one of its repeat samples at the  monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring under  Sec.  141.402(a) if the system demonstrates to the State's satisfaction  that the sample siting plan remains representative of water quality in  the distribution system. If approved by the State, the system may use  that sample result to meet the monitoring requirements in both Sec.   141.402(a) and this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If a repeat sample taken at the monitoring location required for  triggered source water monitoring is E. coli-positive, the system has  violated the E. coli MCL and must also comply with Sec.  141.402(a)(3).  If a system takes more than one repeat sample at the monitoring location  required for triggered source water monitoring, the system may reduce  the number of additional source water samples required under Sec.   141.402(a)(3) by the number of repeat samples taken at that location  that were not E. coli-positive.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If a system takes more than one repeat sample at the monitoring  location required for triggered source water monitoring under Sec.   141.402(a), and more than one repeat sample is E. coli-positive, the  system has violated the E. coli MCL and must also comply with Sec.   141.403(a)(1).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If all repeat samples taken at the monitoring location required  for triggered source water monitoring are E. coli-negative and a repeat  sample taken at a monitoring location other than the one required for  triggered source water monitoring is E. coli-positive, the system has  violated the E. coli MCL, but is not required to comply with Sec.   141.402(a)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> States may review, revise, and approve, as appropriate, repeat  sampling proposed by systems under paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (ii) of this  section. The system must demonstrate that the sample siting plan remains  representative of the water quality in the distribution system. The  State may determine that monitoring at the entry point to the  distribution system (especially for undisinfected ground water systems)  is effective to differentiate between potential source water and  distribution system problems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special purpose samples. Special purpose samples, such as those  taken to determine whether disinfection practices are sufficient  following pipe placement, replacement, or repair, must not be used to  determine whether the coliform treatment technique trigger has been  exceeded. Repeat samples taken pursuant to Sec.  141.858 are not  considered special purpose samples, and must be used to determine  whether the coliform treatment technique trigger has been exceeded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of this section  does not count toward meeting the minimum monitoring requirements of  this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em>, (ii), or (iii) of this section  are met.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The laboratory establishes that improper sample analysis caused  the total coliform-positive result.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The State, on the basis of the results of repeat samples  collected as required under Sec.  141.858(a), determines that the total  coliform-positive sample resulted from a domestic or other non- distribution system plumbing problem. The State cannot invalidate a  sample on the basis of repeat sample results unless all repeat sample(s)  collected at the same tap as the original total coliform-positive sample  are also total coliform-positive, and all repeat samples collected at a  location other than the original tap are total coliform-negative (e.g.,  a State cannot invalidate a total coliform-positive sample on the basis  of repeat samples if all the repeat samples are total coliform-negative,  or if the system has only one service connection).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The State has substantial grounds to believe that a total  coliform-positive result is due to a circumstance or condition that does  not reflect water quality in the distribution system. In this case, the  system must still collect all repeat samples required under Sec.   141.858(a), and use them to determine whether a coliform treatment  technique trigger in Sec.  141.859 has been exceeded. To invalidate a  total coliform-positive sample under this paragraph, the decision and  supporting rationale must be documented in writing, and approved and  signed by the supervisor of the State official who recommended the  decision. The State must make this document available to EPA and the  public. The written documentation must state the specific cause of the  total coliform-positive sample, and what action the system has taken, or  will take, to correct this problem. The State may not invalidate a total  coliform-positive sample solely on the grounds that all repeat samples  are total coliform-negative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A laboratory must invalidate a total coliform sample (unless  total coliforms are detected) if the sample produces a turbid culture in  the absence of gas production using an analytical method where gas  formation is examined (e.g., the Multiple-Tube Fermentation Technique),  produces a turbid culture in the absence of an acid reaction in the  Presence-Absence (P-A) Coliform Test, or exhibits confluent   growth or produces colonies too numerous to count with an analytical  method using a membrane filter (e.g., Membrane Filter Technique). If a  laboratory invalidates a sample because of such interference, the system  must collect another sample from the same location as the original  sample within 24 hours of being notified of the interference problem,  and have it analyzed for the presence of total coliforms. The system  must continue to re-sample within 24 hours and have the samples analyzed  until it obtains a valid result. The State may waive the 24-hour time  limit on a case-by-case basis. Alternatively, the State may implement  criteria for waiving the 24-hour sampling time limit to use in lieu of  case-by-case extensions.</p>
