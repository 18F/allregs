Holders of approved applications for the identified drug  products will be provided notice and an opportunity to respond to the  proposed withdrawal of their applications as described in paragraphs (b)  and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The published notice of opportunity for hearing on the  withdrawal of the listed drug will serve as notice to holders of  identified abbreviated new drug applications of the grounds for the  proposed withdrawal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Holders of applications for drug products identified in the  notice of opportunity for hearing may submit written comments on the  notice of opportunity for hearing issued on the proposed withdrawal of  the listed drug.

Documents available for examination  or copying will be placed on public display in the Division of Dockets  Management (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, room. 1-23, 12420  Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, promptly upon receipt in that office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the agency determines, based upon information submitted by  the holder of an abbreviated new drug application, that the grounds for  withdrawal of the listed drug are not applicable to a drug identified in  the notice of opportunity for hearing, the final decision will state  that the approval of the abbreviated new drug application for such drug  is not withdrawn.
