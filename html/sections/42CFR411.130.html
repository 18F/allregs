After CMS determines that a plan has been a  nonconforming GHP in a particular year, it refers its determination to  the IRS, but only after the parties have exhausted all CMS appeal rights  with respect to the determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> IRS responsibility. The IRS administers section 5000 of the IRC,  which imposes a tax on employers (other than governmental entities) and  employee organizations that contribute to a nonconforming GHP. The tax  is equal to 25 percent of the employer's or employee organization's  expenses, incurred during the calendar year in which the plan is a  nonconforming GHP, for each GHP, both conforming and nonconforming, to  which the employer or employee organization contributes.</p>
