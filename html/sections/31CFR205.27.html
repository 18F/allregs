                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> We will compensate a State annually for the costs of calculating interest, including the cost of developing and maintaining clearance patterns in support of interest calculations, pursuant to this subpart A, subject to the conditions and limitations of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> We may deny an interest calculation cost claim if a State does not:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Have a Treasury-State agreement with us, as set forth in Sec.
