                            <p class="depth0">This part sets forth the base year service and compensation required  of an employee to qualify for benefits under the Railroad Unemployment  Insurance Act with respect to a benefit year. Under the Act, only  employees who satisfy the qualifying conditions of section 3 of the Act  may be paid benefits. No provision is made for payment of dependents  benefits for an employee's spouse or children. A qualified employee who  claims benefits must demonstrate that he or she is eligible for benefits  in accordance with the other provisions of the Act and this chapter.  However, a qualified employee who is disqualified under any of the  provisions of section 4 of the Act does not forfeit his or her status as  a qualified employee.</p>
