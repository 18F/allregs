                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Each airplane must meet the trim requirements of this  section after being trimmed and without further pressure upon, or  movement of, the primary controls or their corresponding trim controls  by the pilot or the automatic pilot. In addition, it must be possible,  in other conditions of loading, configuration, speed and power to ensure  that the pilot will not be unduly fatigued or distracted by the need to  apply residual control forces exceeding those for prolonged application  of Sec. 23.143(c). This applies in normal operation of the airplane  and, if applicable, to those conditions associated with the failure of  one engine for which performance characteristics are established.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Lateral and directional trim. The airplane must maintain lateral  and directional trim in level flight with the landing gear and wing  flaps retracted as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes, at a  speed of 0.9 VH, VC, or VMO/ MO, whichever is lowest; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For commuter category airplanes, at all speeds from 1.4  VS1 to the lesser of VH or VMO/ MMO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Longitudinal trim. The airplane must maintain longitudinal trim  under each of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A climb with--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Takeoff power, landing gear retracted, wing flaps in the takeoff  position(s), at the speeds used in determining the climb performance  required by Sec. 23.65; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Maximum continuous power at the speeds and in the configuration  used in determining the climb performance required by Sec. 23.69(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Level flight at all speeds from the lesser of VH and  either VNO or VMO/MMO (as appropriate),  to 1.4 VS1, with the landing gear and flaps retracted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A descent at VNO or VMO/MMO,  whichever is applicable, with power off and with the landing gear and  flaps retracted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Approach with landing gear extended and with--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A 3 degree angle of descent, with flaps retracted and at a speed  of 1.4 VS1;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A 3 degree angle of descent, flaps in the landing position(s)  at VREF; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An approach gradient equal to the steepest used in the landing  distance demonstrations of Sec. 23.75, flaps in the landing position(s)  at VREF.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In addition, each multiple airplane must maintain longitudinal  and directional trim, and the lateral control force must not exceed 5  pounds at the speed used in complying with Sec. 23.67(a), (b)(2), or  (c)(3), as appropriate, with--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The critical engine inoperative, and if applicable, its  propeller in the minimum drag position;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The remaining engines at maximum continuous power;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The landing gear retracted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Wing flaps retracted; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An angle of bank of not more than five degrees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In addition, each commuter category airplane for which, in the  determination of the takeoff path in accordance with Sec. 23.57, the  climb in the takeoff configuration at V2 extends beyond 400  feet above the takeoff surface, it must be possible to reduce the  longitudinal and lateral control forces to 10 pounds and 5 pounds,  respectively, and the directional control force must not exceed 50  pounds at V2 with--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The critical engine inoperative and its propeller in the minimum  drag position;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The remaining engine(s) at takeoff power;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Landing gear retracted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Wing flaps in the takeoff position(s); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An angle of bank not exceeding 5 degrees.
