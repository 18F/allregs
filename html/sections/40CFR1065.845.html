                            <p class="depth0">Since FID analyzers generally have an incomplete response to  alcohols and carbonyls, determine each FID analyzer's alcohol/carbonyl  response factor (RFOHCi[THC-FID]) after FID optimization to  subtract those responses from the FID reading. Use the most recently  determined alcohol/carbonyl response factors to compensate for alcohol/ carbonyl response. You are not required to determine the response factor  for a compound unless you will subtract its response to compensate for a  response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You may generate response factors as described in paragraph (b)  of this section, or you may use the following default response factors,  consistent with good engineering judgment:</p><p class="depth2">Table 1 of Sec.   1065.845--Default Values for THC FID Response Factor</p><p class="depth2">Relative to Propane on a C1-Equivalent Basis ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Response factor</p><p class="depth2">Compound                               (RF) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ acetaldehyde...........................................             0.50 ethanol................................................             0.75 formaldehyde...........................................             0.00 methanol...............................................             0.63 propanol...............................................             0.85 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determine the alcohol/carbonyl response factors as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Select a C3H8 span gas that meets the  specifications of Sec.  1065.750. Note that FID zero and span balance  gases may be any combination of purified air or purified nitrogen that  meets the specifications of Sec.  1065.750. We recommend FID analyzer  zero and span gases that contain approximately the flow-weighted mean  concentration of O2 expected during testing. Record the  C3H8 concentration of the gas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Select or prepare an alcohol/carbonyl calibration gas that meets  the specifications of Sec.  1065.750 and has a concentration typical of  the peak concentration expected at the hydrocarbon standard. Record the  calibration concentration of the gas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Start and operate the FID analyzer according to the  manufacturer's instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Confirm that the FID analyzer has been calibrated using  C3H8. Calibrate on a carbon number basis of one  (C1). For example, if you use a C3H8  span gas of concentration 200 [micro]mol/mol, span the FID to respond  with a value of 600 [micro]mol/mol.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Zero the FID. Note that FID zero and span balance gases may be  any combination of purified air or purified nitrogen that meets the  specifications of Sec.  1065.750. We recommend FID analyzer zero and  span gases that contain approximately the flow-weighted mean  concentration of O2 expected during testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Span the FID with the C3H8 span gas that  you selected under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Introduce at the inlet of the FID analyzer the alcohol/carbonyl  calibration gas that you selected under paragraph (a)(2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Allow time for the analyzer response to stabilize. Stabilization  time may include time to purge the analyzer and to account for its  response.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> While the analyzer measures the alcohol/carbonyl concentration,  record 30 seconds of sampled data. Calculate the arithmetic mean of  these values.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Divide the mean measured concentration by the recorded span  concentration of the alcohol/carbonyl calibration gas on a  C1-equivalent basis.   The result is the FID analyzer's response factor for alcohol/carbonyl,  RFOHCi[THC-FID] on a C1-equivalent basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Alcohol/carbonyl calibration gases must remain within 2% of the labeled concentration. You must demonstrate  the stability based on a quarterly measurement procedure with a  precision of 2% percent or another method that we  approve. Your measurement procedure may incorporate multiple  measurements. If the true concentration of the gas changes deviates by  more than 2%, but less than 10%, the gas may be relabeled with the new  concentration.
