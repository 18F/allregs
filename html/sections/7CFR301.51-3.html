Less than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated articles; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The designation of less than an entire State as a quarantined area will be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate spread of the Asian longhorned beetle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any nonquarantined area as a quarantined area in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

nonquarantined area. Thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated article from an area temporarily designated as a quarantined area is subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area either will be added to the list of designated quarantined areas in paragraph (c) of this section, or the Administrator will terminate the designation.
