                                Sec.  447.30  Withholding the Federal share of payments to Medicaid
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basis and purpose. This section implements section 1914 of the  Act, which provides for withholding the Federal share of Medicaid  payments to a provider if the provider has not arranged to repay  Medicare overpayments or has failed to provide information to determine  the amount of the overpayments. The intent of the statute and  regulations is to facilitate the recovery of Medicare overpayments. The  provision enables recovery of overpayments when institutions have  reduced participation in Medicare or when physicians and suppliers have  submitted few or no claims under Medicare, thus not receiving enough in  Medicare reimbursement to permit offset of the overpayment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When withholding occurs. The Federal share of Medicaid payments  may be withheld from any provider specified in paragraph (c) of this  section to recover Medicare overpayments that CMS has been unable to  collect if the provider participates in Medicaid and--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provider has not made arrangements satisfactory to CMS to  repay the Medicare overpayment; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CMS has been unable to collect information from the provider to  determine the existence or amount of Medicare overpayment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Federal share of Medicaid payments may be withheld with  respect to the following providers:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An institutional provider that has or previously had in effect a  Medicare provider agreement under section 1866 of the Act; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A Medicaid provider who has previously accepted Medicare payment  on the basis of an assignment under section 1842(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the  Act; and during the 12 month period preceding the quarter in which the  Federal share is to be withheld for a Medicare overpayment, submitted no  claims under Medicare or submitted claims which total less than the  amount of overpayment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Order to reduce State payment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CMS may, at its discretion,  issue an order to the Medicaid agency of any   State that is using the provider's services, to reduce its payment to  the provider by the amount specified in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The order to reduce payment to the provider will remain in  effect until--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Medicaid agency determines that the overpayment has been  completely recovered; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> CMS terminates the order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> CMS may withhold FFP from any State that does not comply with  the order specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to reduce  payment to the provider and claims FFP for the expenditure on its  quarterly expenditure report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice of withholding. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before the Federal share of payments  may be withheld under this section, CMS will notify the provider and the  Medicaid agency of each State that CMS believes may use the overpaid  provider's services under Medicaid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The notice will include the instruction to reduce State  payments, as provided under paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> CMS will send the notice referred to in paragraph (e)(1) by  certified mail, return receipt requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each Medicaid agency must identify the amount of payment due the  provider under Medicaid and give that information to CMS in the next  quarterly expenditure report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Medicaid agency may appeal any disallowance of FFP resulting  from the withholding decision to the Grant Appeals Board, in accordance  with 45 CFR part 16.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Amount to be withheld. CMS may require the Medicaid agency to  reduce the Federal share of its payment to the provider by the lesser of  the following amounts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Federal matching share of payments to the provider, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The total Medicare overpayment to the provider.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Effective date of withholding. Withholding of payment will  become effective no less than 60 days after the day on which the agency  receives notice of withholding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Duration of withholding. No Federal funds are available in  expenditures for services that are furnished by a provider specified in  paragraph (c) of this section from the date on which the withholding  becomes effective until the termination of withholding under paragraph  (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Termination of withholding. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CMS will terminate the order to  reduce State payment if it determines that any of the following has  occurred:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Medicare overpayment is completely recovered:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The institution or person makes an agreement satisfactory to  CMS to repay the overpayment; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> CMS determines that there is no overpayment based on newly  acquired evidence or a subsequent audit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CMS will notify each State that previously received a notice  ordering the withholding that the withholding has been terminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Procedures for restoring excess withholding. If an amount  ultimately determined to be in excess of the Medicare overpayment is  withheld, CMS will restore any excess funds withheld.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Recovery of funds from Medicaid agency. A provider is not  entitled to recover from the Medicaid agency the amount of payment  withheld by the agency in accordance with a CMS order issued under  paragraph (d) of this section.
