As a condition to receiving such a waiver for either model year 2004, 2005 or both, the manufacturer must discontinue production of engines for sale in the U.S. according to a schedule determined by the Administrator upon granting this waiver. Failure to do so by the manufacturer will void ab initio the applicable certificate of conformity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A manufacturer request under paragraph (b)(2) of this section must be in writing and apply to a specific engine family. The request must identify the engine family designation, a written rationale supporting the FEL choice, the type of information used as a basis for the FEL (e.g., previous emission tests, development tests), the specific source of the information including when the information was generated, the requested schedule for phasing the engine family out of production, and any other information the Administrator may require.
