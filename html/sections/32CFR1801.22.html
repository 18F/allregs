                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial action for access. NACIC offices tasked pursuant to a  Privacy Act access request shall search all relevant record systems  within their cognizance. They shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine whether responsive records exist;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine whether access must be denied in whole or part and on  what legal basis under both Acts in each such case;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Approve the disclosure of records for which they are the  originator; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Forward to the Coordinator all records approved for release or  necessary for coordination with or referral to another originator or  interested party as well as the specific determinations with respect to  denials (if any).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial action for amendment. NACIC offices tasked pursuant to a  Privacy Act amendment request shall review the official records alleged  to be inaccurate and the proposed amendment submitted by the requester.  If they determine that NACIC's records are not accurate, relevant,  timely or complete, they shall promptly:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Make the amendment as requested;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Write to all other identified persons or agencies to whom the  record has been disclosed (if an accounting of the disclosure was made)  and inform of the amendment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inform the Coordinator of such decisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Action otherwise on amendment request. If the NACIC office  records manager declines to make the requested amendment (or declines to  make the requested amendment) but agrees to augment the official  records, that manager shall promptly:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Set forth the reasons for refusal; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inform the Coordinator of such decision and the reasons  therefore.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Referrals and coordinations. As applicable and within ten (10)  days of receipt by the Coordinator, any NACIC records containing  information originated by other NACIC offices shall be forwarded to  those entities for action in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), or (c)  of this section and return. Records originated by other federal agencies  or NACIC records containing other federal information shall be forwarded  to such agencies within ten (10) days of our completion of initial  action in the case for action under their regulations and direct  response to the requester (for other NACIC records) or return to NACIC  (for NACIC records).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effect of certain exemptions. This section shall not be  construed to allow access to systems of records exempted by the  Director, NACIC pursuant to subsections (j) and (k) of the Privacy Act  or where those exemptions require that NACIC can neither confirm nor  deny the existence or nonexistence of responsive records.</p>
