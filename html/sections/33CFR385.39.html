                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The overarching objective of the Plan is the  restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem  while providing for other water-related needs of the region, including  water supply and flood protection. Progress towards providing for these  other water-related needs shall also be evaluated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As provided for in paragraph (c) of this section, the Secretary  of the Army and the Governor shall establish interim targets for  evaluating progress towards other water-related needs of the region  provided for in the Plan throughout the implementation process. The  interim targets and interim goals shall be consistent with each other.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Department of the Army shall include these interim targets  in appropriate Corps of Engineers guidance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To ensure flexibility in implementing the Plan over the next  several decades, and to ensure that interim targets may reflect changed  circumstances or new information resulting from adaptive management, the  interim targets may be modified, consistent with the processes set forth  in paragraph (c) of this section, to reflect new information resulting  from changed or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific and technical  information, new or updated modeling; information developed through the  assessment principles contained in the Plan; and future authorized  changes to the   Plan integrated into the implementation of the Plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management  District shall sequence and schedule projects as appropriate to achieve  the interim goals and interim targets for other water-related needs of  the region provided for in the Plan, to the extent practical given  funding, technical, or other constraints.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the interim targets have not been met or are unlikely to be  met, then the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management  District shall determine why the interim targets have not been met or  are unlikely to be met and either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Initiate adaptive management actions pursuant to Sec. 385.31(d)  to achieve the interim targets as soon as practicable, consistent with  the purposes of the Plan and consistent with the interim goals  established pursuant to Sec. 385.38; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Recommend changes to the interim targets in accordance with  paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Principles for developing interim targets. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> RECOVER, using  best available science and information, shall recommend a set of interim  targets for evaluating progress towards other water-related needs of the  region provided for in the Plan. These interim targets shall reflect the  incremental accomplishment of the expected performance level of the  Plan, and will identify improvements in quantity, quality, timing and  distribution of water in five-year increments that begin in 2005, with  the targets reflecting the results expected to be achieved by 2010 and  for each five-year increment thereafter. The interim targets shall be  developed through the use of appropriate models and tools and shall  provide a quantitative basis for evaluating progress towards other  water-related needs of the region provided for in the Plan during the  period of implementation. In developing the interim targets for the  five-year increments, RECOVER shall use the Master Implementation  Sequencing Plan as the basis for predicting the performance at a given  time. RECOVER may recommend additional interim targets for  implementation of CERP in addition to those initially developed and may  propose revisions to the initial set of interim targets as new  information is gained through adaptive management.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In developing its recommendations for interim targets, RECOVER  shall consider indicators including, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The frequency of water restrictions in the Lower East Coast  Service Areas at each time increment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The frequency of water restrictions in the Lake Okeechobee  Service Areas at each time increment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The frequency of meeting salt-water intrusion protection  criteria for the Lower East Coast Service Area at each time increment;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The frequency of water shortage restrictions on lands covered  under the Water Rights Compact Among the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the  State of Florida, and the South Florida Water Management District at  each time increment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Process for establishing interim targets. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  recommendations of RECOVER shall be provided to the Corps of Engineers  and the South Florida Water Management District. These recommendations  shall be provided no later than June 14, 2004. The proposed interim  targets shall be developed by the Secretary of the Army and the  Governor, in consultation with the Department of the Interior, the  Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the  Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida,  the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal,  State, and local agencies, and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration  Task Force. In considering the interim targets, the Secretary of the  Army and the Governor, shall be provided with, and consider, the  technical recommendations of RECOVER and any modifications to those  recommendations by the Corps of Engineers or the South Florida Water  Management District. The Secretary of the Army shall provide a notice of  availability of the proposed interim targets to the public in the  Federal Register and seek public comments. After considering comments of  the public on the proposed interim targets, and incorporating any  suggestions that   are appropriate and consistent with the goals and purposes of the Plan,  the Secretary of the Army and the Governor, shall establish the final  interim targets, and the Secretary of the Army shall provide a notice of  availability to the public in the Federal Register by no later than  December 13, 2004, but not prior to the execution of the Interim Goals  Agreement pursuant to Sec. 385.38. Interim targets are intended to  facilitate inter-agency planning, monitoring, and assessment throughout  the implementation process and are not standards or schedules  enforceable in court.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In developing its recommendations for interim targets, RECOVER  shall use the principles in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Secretary of the Army and the Governor shall review the  interim targets at a minimum every five years beginning five years after  the establishment of the interim targets to determine if they should be  revised and to determine what those revisions should be. The public  shall also be provided with an opportunity to comment on the proposed  revisions. The Secretary of the Army and the Governor may also revise  the interim targets whenever appropriate as new information becomes  available. Any revisions to the interim targets shall be established  consistent with the process described in this section.</p>
