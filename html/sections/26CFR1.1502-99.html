                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, Secs. 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96 and Sec. 1.1502-98 apply to any testing date on or after June 25, 1999. Sections 1.1502-94 through 1.1502-96 also apply to a corporation that becomes a member of a group or ceases to be a member of a group (or loss subgroup) on any date on or after June 25, 1999.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special rules--(1) Election to treat subgroup parent requirement as satisfied. Section 1.1502-91(d)(4), Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(7), Example 4, Sec. 1.1502-92(b)(1)(iii), Sec. 1.1502-92(b)(2), Example 5, the last two sentences of Sec. 1.1502-95(b)(3), Sec. 1.1502-95(d)(2)(i), and Sec. 1.1502-96(e)(all of which relate to the election under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(4) to treat the loss subgroup parent requirement as satisfied) apply to corporations that become members of a consolidated group in taxable years for which the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is after June 25, 1999.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Election to treat subgroup parent requirement as satisfied. Section 1.1502-91(d)(4), Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(7), Example 4, Sec. 1.1502-92(b)(1)(iii), Sec. 1.1502-92(b)(2), Example 5, the last two sentences of Sec. 1.1502-95(b)(3), Sec. 1.1502-95(d)(2)(i), and Sec. 1.1502-96(e)(all of which relate to the election under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(4) to treat the loss subgroup parent requirement as satisfied) apply to corporations that become members of a consolidated group in taxable years for which the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is after June 25, 1999.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Principal purpose of avoiding a limitation. The third sentence of Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(5) (relating to members excluded from a loss subgroup) applies to corporations that become members of a consolidated group on or after June 25, 1999.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ceasing to be a member of a loss subgroup--(i) Ownership change of a loss subgroup. Section 1.1502-95(d)(2)(ii) and Sec. 1.1502-95(d)(3), Example 3 apply to corporations that cease to bear a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to a loss subgroup parent in taxable years for which the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is after June 25, 1999.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ownership change of a loss subgroup. Section 1.1502-95(d)(2)(ii) and Sec. 1.1502-95(d)(3), Example 3 apply to corporations that cease to bear a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to a loss subgroup parent in taxable years for which the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is after June 25, 1999.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Expiration of 5-year period. Section 1.1502-95(d)(2)(iii) applies with respect to the day after the last day of any 5 consecutive year period described in that section that ends in a taxable year for which the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is after June 25, 1999.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reattribution of losses under Sec. 1.1502-36(d)(6). Section 1.1502-96(d) applies to reattributions of net operating loss carryovers, capital loss carryovers, and deferred deductions in connection with a transfer of stock to which Sec. 1.1502-36 applies, and the election under Sec. 1.1502-96(d)(5) (relating to an election to reattribute section 382 limitation) can be made with an election under Sec. 1.1502-36(d)(6) to reattribute a loss to the common parent that is filed at the time and in the manner provided in Sec. 1.1502-36(e)(5)(x).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Election to apportion net unrealized built-in gain. In the case of corporations that cease to be members of a loss group (or loss subgroup) before June 25, 1999 in a taxable year for which the due

date of the income tax return (without extensions) is after June 25, 1999, Sec. 1.1502-95(a), (b), (c), and (f) apply to those corporations if the common parent makes the election described in the second sentence of paragraph (c)(1) of Sec. 1.1502-95 in the time and manner prescribed in paragraph (f) of Sec. 1.1502-95.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Testing period may include a period beginning before June 25, 1999--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A testing period for purposes of Secs. 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96 and 1.1502-98 may include a period beginning before June 25, 1999. Thus, for example, in applying Sec. 1.1502-92(b)(1)(i)(relating to the determination of an ownership change of a loss group), the determination of the lowest percentage of ownership interest of any 5-percent shareholder of the common parent during a testing period ending on a testing date occurring on or after June 25, 1999 takes into account the period beginning before June 25, 1999, except to the extent that the period is more than 3 years before the testing date or is otherwise before the beginning of the testing period. See Sec. 1.1502-92(b)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transition rule for net unrealized built-in loss. A loss group (or loss subgroup) that has a net unrealized built-in loss on a testing date on or after June 25, 1999 may apply Sec. 1.1502-91A(g) (and Sec. 1.1502-96A(a) as it relates to Sec. 1.1502-91A(g)) for the period ending on the day before June 25, 1999 to determine under Sec. 1.382-2T(d)(ii)(A) the earliest date that its testing period begins (treating the day before June 25, 1999 as the end of a taxable year.) Thus, for example, if a consolidated group with no net operating losses has a net unrealized built-in loss determined under Sec. 1.1502-91(g) on a testing date after June 25, 1999, but, under Sec. 1.1502-91A(g), does not have a net unrealized built-in loss for the period ending on the day before June 25, 1999, the group's testing period begins no earlier than June 25, 1999.
