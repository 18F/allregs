                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A cable operator has the burden of proving that its existing or  proposed rates for basic service and associated equipment comply with 47  U.S.C. 543, and Sec. Sec.  76.922 and 76.923.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For an existing or a proposed rate for basic tier service or  associated equipment that is within the permitted tier charge and actual  cost of equipment as set forth in Sec. Sec.  76.922 and 76.923, the  cable operator must submit the appropriate FCC form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For an existing or a proposed rate for basic tier service that  exceeds the permitted tier charge as set forth in Sec. Sec.  76.922 and  76.923, the cable operator must submit a cost-of-service showing to  justify the proposed rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A franchising authority or the Commission may find a cable  operator that does not attempt to demonstrate the reasonableness of its  rates in default and, using the best information available, enter an  order finding the cable operator's rates unreasonable and mandating  appropriate relief, as specified in Sec. Sec.  76.940, 76.941, and  76.942.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A franchising authority or the Commission may order a cable  operator that has filed a facially incomplete form to file supplemental  information, and the franchising authority's deadline to rule on the  reasonableness of the proposed rates will be tolled pending the receipt  of such information. A franchising authority may set reasonable  deadlines for the filing of such information, and may find the cable  operator in default and mandate appropriate relief, pursuant to  paragraph (d) of this section, for the cable operator's failure to  comply with the deadline or otherwise provide complete information in  good faith.
