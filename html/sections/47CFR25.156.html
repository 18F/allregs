In the event that the  Commission receives NGSO-like applications and GSO-like applications at  the same time, and the Commission has not adopted sharing criteria in  that band, the Commission will divide the spectrum between GSO-like and   NGSO-like licensees based on the proportion of qualified GSO-like and  NGSO-like applicants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> An application for DBS or DARS services will be entitled to  comparative consideration with one or more conflicting applications only  if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The application is mutually exclusive with another application;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The application is received by the Commission in a condition  acceptable for filing by the ``cut-off'' date specified in a public  notice.
