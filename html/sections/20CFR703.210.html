The Branch will issue its decision  requiring additional security in accordance with Sec. 703.204, and the  procedures set forth at Sec. Sec. 703.204(d) and 703.205 for requesting  a hearing and complying with the Office's decision will apply as  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Branch may reduce the required security at any time on its  own initiative, or upon application of a carrier, when in the Branch's  opinion the facts warrant a reduction. A carrier seeking a reduction  must furnish any information the Office requests regarding its  outstanding LHWCA obligations for any State in which it does business,  its obligations not secured by a State guaranty fund in each of these  States, and any other evidence as the Branch considers necessary.</p>
