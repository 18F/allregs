                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Offers of enrollment. Based on the priority ranking, NRCS will  notify an affected landowner of tentative acceptance into the program.  This notice of tentative acceptance into the program does not bind NRCS  or the United States to enroll the proposed project in HFRP, nor does it  bind the landowner to convey an easement, or to contract or agree to  HFRP activities. The letter notifies the landowner that NRCS intends to  continue the enrollment process on their land unless otherwise notified  by the landowner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acceptance of offer of enrollment. An agreement to purchase or a  restoration cost-share agreement or contract will be presented by NRCS  to the landowner which will describe the easement, agreement, or  contract area; the easement, agreement, or contract terms and  conditions; and other terms and conditions for participation that may be  required by NRCS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of the acceptance of the offer. After the agreement to  purchase or restoration cost-share agreement or contract is executed by  NRCS and the landowner, the land will be considered enrolled in the  HFRP. For easements, NRCS will proceed with various easement acquisition  activities, which may include conducting a survey of the easement area,  securing necessary subordination agreements, procuring title insurance,  and conducting other activities necessary to record the easement or  implement the HFRP, as appropriate for the enrollment option being  considered. For restoration cost-share agreements and contracts, the  landowner will proceed to implement the restoration plan with technical  assistance and cost-share from NRCS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Withdrawal of offers. Prior to execution of an agreement to  purchase, a restoration cost-share agreement, or contract between the  United States and the landowner, NRCS may withdraw the land from  enrollment at any time due to lack of availability of funds, inability  to clear title, or other reasons. An agreement to purchase will be void,  and the offer withdrawn, if not executed by the landowner within the  time specified.</p>
