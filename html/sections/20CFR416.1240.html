                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where the resources of an individual (and spouse, if any) are  determined to exceed the limitations prescribed in Sec. 416.1205, such  individual (and spouse, if any) shall not be eligible for payment except  under the conditions provided in this section. Payment will be made to  an individual (and spouse, if any) if the individual agrees in writing  to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Dispose of, at current market value, the nonliquid resources (as  defined in Sec. 416.1201(c)) in excess of the limitations prescribed in  Sec. 416.1205 within the time period specified in Sec. 416.1242; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Repay any overpayments (as defined in Sec. 416.1244) with the  proceeds of such disposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payment made for the period during which the resources are being  disposed of will be conditioned upon the disposition of those resources  as prescribed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section. Any  payments so made are (at the time of disposition) considered  overpayments to the extent they would not have been paid had the  disposition occurred at the beginning of the period for which such  payments were made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If an individual fails to dispose of the resources as prescribed  in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, regardless of the  efforts he or she makes to dispose of them, the resources will be  counted at their current market value and the individual will be  ineligible due to excess resources. We will use the original estimate of  current market value unless the individual submits evidence establishing  a lower value (e.g., an estimate from a disinterested knowledgeable  source).
