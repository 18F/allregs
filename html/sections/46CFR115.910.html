                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A vessel that carries more than 12 passengers on an international voyage must have a valid SOLAS Passenger Ship Safety Certificate. The Commandant authorizes the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI) to issue the original SOLAS Passenger Ship Safety Certificate after receiving notification from the cognizant OCMI that the vessel complies with the applicable SOLAS regulations. Subsequent SOLAS Passenger Ship Safety Certificates are issued by the cognizant OCMI unless any changes to the vessel or its operations have occurred that changes the information on the certificate, in which case the Commandant will authorize the cognizant OCMI to reissue the certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The route specified on the Certificate of Inspection and the SOLAS Passenger Ship Safety Certificate must agree.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A SOLAS Passenger Ship Safety Certificate is issued for a period of not more than 12 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The SOLAS Passenger Ship Safety Certificate may be withdrawn, revoked, or suspended at any time when the vessel is not in compliance with applicable SOLAS requirements.
