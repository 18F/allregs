                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An employer who believes that reinstatement may be denied to a  key employee, must give written notice to the employee at the time the  employee gives notice of the need for FMLA leave (or when FMLA leave  commences, if earlier) that he or she qualifies as a key employee. At  the same time, the employer must also fully inform the employee of the  potential consequences with respect to reinstatement and maintenance of  health benefits if the employer should determine that substantial and  grievous economic injury to the employer's operations will result if the  employee is reinstated from FMLA leave. If such notice cannot be given  immediately because of the need to determine whether the employee is a  key employee, it shall be given as soon as practicable after being  notified of a need for leave (or the commencement of leave, if earlier).  It is expected that in most circumstances there will be no desire that  an employee be denied restoration after FMLA leave and, therefore, there  would be no need to provide such notice. However, an employer who fails  to provide such timely notice will lose its right to deny restoration  even if substantial and grievous economic injury will result from  reinstatement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As soon as an employer makes a good faith determination, based  on the facts available, that substantial and grievous economic injury to  its operations will result if a key employee who has given notice of the  need for FMLA leave or is using FMLA leave is reinstated, the employer  shall notify the employee in writing of its determination, that it  cannot deny FMLA leave, and that it intends to deny restoration to  employment on completion of the FMLA leave. It is anticipated that an  employer will ordinarily be able to give such notice prior to the  employee starting leave. The employer must serve this notice either in  person or by certified mail. This notice must explain the basis for the  employer's finding that substantial and grievous economic injury will  result, and, if leave has commenced, must provide the employee a  reasonable time in which to return to work, taking into account the  circumstances, such as the length of the leave and the urgency of the  need for the employee to return.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If an employee on leave does not return to work in response to  the employer's notification of intent to deny restoration, the employee  continues to be entitled to maintenance of health benefits and the  employer may not recover its cost of health benefit premiums. A key  employee's rights under FMLA continue unless and until the employee  either gives notice that he or she no longer wishes to return to work,  or the employer actually denies reinstatement at the conclusion of the  leave period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> After notice to an employee has been given that substantial and  grievous economic injury will result if the employee is reinstated to  employment, an employee is still entitled to request reinstatement at  the end of the leave period even if the employee did not return to work  in response to the employer's notice. The employer must then again  determine whether there will be substantial and grievous economic injury  from reinstatement, based on the facts at that time. If it is determined  that substantial and grievous economic injury will result, the employer  shall notify the employee in writing (in person or by certified mail) of  the denial of restoration.</p>
