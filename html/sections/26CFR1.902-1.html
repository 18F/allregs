                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(13)</em> of this section apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Domestic shareholder. In the case of dividends received by a  domestic corporation from a foreign corporation after December 31, 1986,  the term domestic shareholder means a domestic corporation, other than  an S corporation as defined in section 1361(a), that owns at least 10  percent of the voting stock of the foreign corporation at the time the  domestic corporation receives a dividend from that foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> as income from sources without the  United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Second-tier corporation. In the case of dividends paid to a  first-tier corporation by a foreign corporation in a taxable year  beginning after December 31, 1986, the foreign corporation is a second- tier corporation if, at the time a first-tier corporation receives a  dividend from that foreign corporation, the first-tier corporation owns  at least 10 percent of the foreign corporation's voting stock and the  product of the following equals at least 5 percent--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The percentage of voting stock owned by the domestic shareholder  in the first-tier corporation; multiplied by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The percentage of voting stock owned by the first-tier  corporation in the second-tier corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Third- or lower-tier corporation.-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Third-tier corporation.  In the case of dividends paid to a second-tier corporation by a foreign  corporation in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, a  foreign corporation is a third-tier corporation if, at the time a  second-tier corporation receives a dividend from that foreign  corporation, the second-tier corporation owns at least 10 percent of the  foreign corporation's voting stock and the product of the following  equals at least 5 percent--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The percentage of voting stock owned by the domestic shareholder  in the first-tier corporation; multiplied by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The percentage of voting stock owned by the first-tier  corporation in the second-tier corporation; multiplied by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The percentage of voting stock owned by the second-tier  corporation in the third-tier corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fourth-, fifth-, or sixth-tier corporation. In the case of  dividends paid to a third-, fourth-, or fifth-tier corporation by a  foreign corporation in a taxable year beginning after August 5, 1997,  the foreign corporation is a fourth-, fifth-, or sixth-tier corporation,  respectively, if at the time the dividend is paid, the   corporation receiving the dividend owns at least 10 percent of the  foreign corporation's voting stock, the chain of foreign corporations  that includes the foreign corporation is connected through stock  ownership of at least 10 percent of their voting stock, the domestic  shareholder in the first-tier corporation in such chain indirectly owns  at least 5 percent of the voting stock of the foreign corporation  through such chain, such corporation is a controlled foreign corporation  (as defined in section 957) and the domestic shareholder is a United  States shareholder (as defined in section 951(b)) in the foreign  corporation. Taxes paid by a fourth-, fifth-, or sixth-tier corporation  shall be taken into account in determining post-1986 foreign income  taxes only if such taxes are paid with respect to taxable years  beginning after August 5, 1997, in which the corporation was a  controlled foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the ownership  requirements of paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Domestic corporation M owns 30 percent of the voting  stock of foreign corporation A on January 1, 1991, and for all periods  thereafter. Corporation A owns 40 percent of the voting stock of foreign  corporation B on January 1, 1991, and continues to own that stock until  June 1, 1991, when Corporation A sells its stock in Corporation B. Both  Corporation A and Corporation B use the calendar year as the taxable  year. Corporation B pays a dividend out of its post-1986 undistributed  earnings to Corporation A, which Corporation A receives on February 16,  1991. Corporation A pays a dividend out of its post-1986 undistributed  earnings to Corporation M, which Corporation M receives on January 20,  1992. Corporation M uses a fiscal year ending on June 30 as the taxable  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On February 16, 1991, when Corporation B pays a dividend to  Corporation A, Corporation M satisfies the 10 percent stock ownership  requirement of paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section with respect  to Corporation A. Therefore, Corporation A is a first-tier corporation  within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of this section and Corporation M  is a domestic shareholder of Corporation A within the meaning of  paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Also on February 16, 1991, Corporation  B is a second-tier corporation within the meaning of paragraph (a)(3) of  this section because Corporation A owns at least 10 percent of its  voting stock, and the percentage of voting stock owned by Corporation M  in Corporation A on February 16, 1991 (30 percent) multiplied by the  percentage of voting stock owned by Corporation A in Corporation B on  February 16, 1991 (40 percent) equals 12 percent. Corporation A shall be  deemed to have paid foreign income taxes of Corporation B with respect  to the dividend received from Corporation B on February 16, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> On January 20, 1992, Corporation M satisfies the 10-percent  stock ownership requirement of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section  with respect to Corporation A. Therefore, Corporation A is a first-tier  corporation within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of this section and  Corporation M is a domestic shareholder within the meaning of paragraph  (a)(1) of this section. Accordingly, for its taxable year ending on June  30, 1992, Corporation M is deemed to have paid a portion of the post- 1986 foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed to be paid, by  Corporation A. Those taxes will include taxes paid by Corporation B that  were deemed paid by Corporation A with respect to the dividend paid by  Corporation B to Corporation A on February 16, 1991, even though  Corporation B is no longer a second-tier corporation with respect to  Corporations A and M on January 20, 1992, and has not been a second-tier  corporation with respect to Corporations A and M at any time during the  taxable years of Corporations A and M that include January 20, 1992.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Upper- and lower-tier corporations. In the case of a sixth-tier  corporation, the term upper-tier corporation means a first-, second-,  third-, fourth-, or fifth-tier corporation. In the case of a fifth-tier  corporation, the term upper-tier corporation means a first-, second-,  third-, or fourth-tier corporation. In the case of a fourth-tier  corporation, the term upper-tier corporation means a first-, second-, or  third-tier corporation. In the case of a third-tier corporation, the  term upper-tier corporation means a first- or second-tier corporation.  In the case of a second-tier corporation, the term upper-tier  corporation means a first-tier corporation. In the case of a first-tier  corporation, the term lower-tier corporation means a second-, third-,  fourth-, fifth-, or sixth-tier corporation. In the case of a second-tier  corporation, the term lower-tier corporation means a third-, fourth-,  fifth-, or sixth-tier corporation. In the case of a third-tier  corporation, the term lower-tier corporation means a   fourth-, fifth-, or sixth-tier corporation. In the case of a fourth-tier  corporation, the term lower-tier corporation means a fifth- or sixth- tier corporation. In the case of a fifth-tier corporation, the term  lower-tier corporation means a sixth-tier corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Foreign income taxes. The term foreign income taxes means  income, war profits, and excess profits taxes as defined in Sec. 1.901- 2(a), and taxes included in the term income, war profits, and excess  profits taxes by reason of section 903, that are imposed by a foreign  country or a possession of the United States, including any such taxes  deemed paid by a foreign corporation under this section. Foreign income,  war profits, and excess profits taxes shall not include amounts excluded  from the definition of those taxes pursuant to section 901 and the  regulations under that section. See section 901(f) and (i) and paragraph  (c)(5) of this section. Foreign income, war profits, and excess profits  taxes also shall not include taxes for which a credit is disallowed  under section 901 and the regulations under section 901. See section  901(j), (k), and (l), and paragraphs (c)(4) and (8) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Post-1986 foreign income taxes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as  provided in paragraphs (a)(10) and (13) of this section, the term post- 1986 foreign income taxes of a foreign corporation means the sum of the  foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid in the taxable year  of the foreign corporation in which it distributes a dividend plus the  foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid in the foreign  corporation's prior taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, to  the extent the foreign taxes were not attributable to dividends  distributed to, or earnings otherwise included (for example, under  section 304, 367(b), 551, 951(a), 1248, or 1293) in the income of, a  foreign or domestic shareholder in prior taxable years. Except as  provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, foreign taxes paid or  deemed paid by the foreign corporation on or with respect to earnings  that were distributed or otherwise removed from post-1986 undistributed  earnings in prior post-1986 taxable years shall be removed from post- 1986 foreign income taxes regardless of whether the shareholder is  eligible to compute an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid under section  902, and regardless of whether the shareholder in fact chose to credit  foreign income taxes under section 901 for the year of the distribution  or inclusion. Thus, if an amount is distributed or deemed distributed by  a foreign corporation to a United States person that is not a domestic  shareholder within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section (for  example, an individual or a corporation that owns less than 10% of the  foreign corporation's voting stock), or to a foreign person that does  not meet the definition of an upper-tier corporation under paragraph  (a)(6) of this section, then although no foreign income taxes shall be  deemed paid under section 902, foreign income taxes attributable to the  distribution or deemed distribution that would have been deemed paid had  the shareholder met the ownership requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)  through (4) of this section shall be removed from post-1986 foreign  income taxes. Further, if a domestic shareholder chooses to deduct  foreign taxes paid or accrued for the taxable year of the distribution  or inclusion, it shall nonetheless be deemed to have paid a  proportionate share of the foreign corporation's post-1986 foreign  income taxes under section 902(a), and the foreign income taxes deemed  paid must be removed from post-1986 foreign income taxes. In the case of  a foreign corporation the foreign income taxes of which are determined  based on an accounting period of less than one year, the term year means  that accounting period. See sections 441(b)(3) and 443.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Distributions out of earnings and profits accumulated by a  lower-tier corporation in its taxable years beginning before January 1,  1987, and included in the gross income of an upper-tier corporation in  its taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986. Post-1986 foreign  income taxes shall include foreign income taxes that are deemed paid by  an upper-tier corporation with respect to distributions from a lower- tier corporation out of nonpreviously taxed pre-1987 accumulated  profits, as defined in paragraph (a)(10) of this section, that are  received by an upper-tier corporation in any taxable year of the upper-   tier corporation beginning after December 31, 1986, provided the upper- tier corporation's earnings and profits in that year are included in its  post-1986 undistributed earnings under paragraph (a)(9) of this section.  Foreign income taxes deemed paid with respect to a distribution of pre- 1987 accumulated profits shall be translated from the functional  currency of the lower-tier corporation into dollars at the spot exchange  rate in effect on the date of the distribution. To determine the  character of the earnings and profits and associated taxes for foreign  tax credit limitation purposes, see section 904 and Sec. 1.904-7(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> (26 CFR  revised as of April 1, 2006). The reduction in foreign income taxes paid  or accrued by the amount of tax in excess of 5 percent imposed on high  withholding tax interest income must be computed in functional currency  before foreign income taxes are translated into U.S. dollars and  included in post-1986 foreign income taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Post-1986 undistributed earnings--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as  provided in paragraphs (a) (10) and (13) of this section, the term post- 1986 undistributed earnings means the amount of the earnings and profits  of a foreign corporation (computed in accordance with sections 964(a)  and 986) accumulated in taxable years of the foreign corporation  beginning after December 31, 1986, determined as of the close of the  taxable year of the foreign corporation in which it distributes a  dividend. Post-1986 undistributed earnings shall not be reduced by  reason of any earnings distributed or otherwise included in income, for  example under section 304, 367(b), 551, 951(a), 1248 or 1293, during the  taxable year. Post-1986 undistributed earnings shall be reduced to  account for distributions or deemed distributions that reduced earnings  and profits and inclusions that resulted in previously-taxed amounts  described in section 959(c) (1) and (2) or section 1293(c) in prior  taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. Thus, post-1986  undistributed earnings shall not be reduced to the extent of the ratable  share of a controlled foreign corporation's subpart F income, as defined  in section 952, attributable to a shareholder that is not a United  States shareholder within the meaning of section 951(b) or section  953(c)(1)(A), because that amount has not been included in a  shareholder's gross income. Post-1986 undistributed earnings shall be  reduced as provided herein regardless of whether any shareholder is  deemed to have paid any foreign taxes, and regardless of whether any  domestic shareholder chose to claim a foreign tax credit under section  901(a) for the year of the distribution. For rules on carrybacks and  carryforwards of deficits and their effect on post-1986 undistributed  earnings, see Sec. 1.902-2. In the case of a foreign corporation the  foreign income taxes of which are computed based on an accounting period  of less than one year, the term year means that accounting period. See  sections 441(b)(3) and 443.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Distributions out of earnings and profits accumulated by a  lower-tier corporation in its taxable years beginning before January 1,  1987, and included in the gross income of an upper-tier corporation in  its taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986. Distributions by a  lower-tier corporation out of non-previously taxed pre-1987 accumulated  profits, as defined in paragraph (a)(10) of this section, that are  received by an upper-tier corporation in any taxable year of the upper- tier corporation beginning after December 31, 1986, shall be treated as  post-1986 undistributed earnings of the upper-tier corporation, provided  the upper-tier corporation's earnings and profits for that year are  included in its post-1986 undistributed earnings under paragraph  (a)(9)(i) of this section. To determine the character of the earnings  and profits and associated taxes for foreign tax credit limitation  purposes, see section 904 and Sec. 1.904-7(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this section. Earnings and profits of an  upper-tier corporation, however, shall not be reduced by foreign income  taxes paid by a lower-tier corporation and deemed to have been paid by  the upper-tier corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Special allocations. The term post-1986 undistributed earnings  means the total amount of the earnings of the corporation determined at  the corporate level. Special allocations of earnings and taxes to  particular shareholders, whether required or permitted by foreign law or  a shareholder agreement, shall be disregarded. If, however, the  Commissioner establishes that there is an agreement to pay dividends  only out of earnings in the separate categories for passive or high  withholding tax interest income, then only taxes imposed on passive or  high withholding tax interest earnings shall be treated as related to  the dividend. See Sec. 1.904-6(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Pre-1987 accumulated profits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definition. The term pre-1987  accumulated profits means the amount of the earnings and profits of a  foreign corporation computed in accordance with section 902 and  attributable to its taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987. If  the special effective date of paragraph (a)(13) of this section applies,  pre-1987 accumulated profits also includes any earnings and profits  (computed in accordance with sections 964(a) and 986) attributable to  the foreign corporation's taxable years beginning after December 31,  1986, but before the first day of the first taxable year of the foreign  corporation in which the ownership requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B)  and paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this section are met with respect  to that corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Computation of pre-1987 accumulated profits. Pre-1987  accumulated profits must be computed under United States principles  governing the computation of earnings and profits. Pre-1987 accumulated  profits are determined at the corporate level. Special allocations of  accumulated profits and taxes to particular shareholders with respect to  distributions of pre-1987 accumulated profits in taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1986, whether required or permitted by foreign law or  a shareholder agreement, shall be disregarded. Pre-1987 accumulated  profits of a particular year shall be reduced by amounts distributed  from those accumulated profits or otherwise included in income from  those accumulated profits, for example under sections 304, 367(b), 551,  951(a), 1248 or 1293. If a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings  is carried back to offset pre-1987 accumulated profits, pre-1987  accumulated profits of a particular taxable year shall be reduced by the  amount of the deficit carried back to that year. See Sec. 1.902-2. The  amount of a distribution out of pre-1987 accumulated profits, and the  amount of foreign income taxes deemed paid under section 902, shall be  determined and translated into United States dollars by applying the law  as in effect prior to the effective date of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  See Sec. Sec. 1.902-3, 1.902-4 and 1.964-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Foreign income taxes attributable to pre-1987 accumulated  profits. The term pre-1987 foreign income taxes means any foreign income  taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid by a foreign corporation on or with  respect to its pre-1987 accumulated profits. Pre-1987 foreign income  taxes of a particular year shall be reduced by the amount of taxes paid  or deemed paid by the foreign corporation on or with respect to amounts  distributed or otherwise included in income from pre-1987 accumulated  profits of that year. Thus, pre-1987 foreign income taxes shall be  reduced by the amount of taxes deemed paid by a domestic shareholder  (regardless of whether the shareholder chose to credit foreign income  taxes under section 901 for the year of the distribution or inclusion)  or a first-tier or second-tier corporation, and by the amount of taxes  that would have been deemed   paid had any other shareholder been eligible to compute an amount of  foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902. Foreign income taxes deemed  paid with respect to a distribution of pre-1987 accumulated profits  shall be translated from the functional currency of the distributing  corporation into United States dollars at the spot exchange rate in  effect on the date of the distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Dividend. For purposes of section 902, the definition of the  term dividend in section 316 and the regulations under that section  applies. Thus, for example, distributions and deemed distributions under  sections 302, 304, 305(b) and 367(b) that are treated as dividends  within the meaning of section 301(c)(1) also are dividends for purposes  of section 902. In addition, the term dividend includes deemed dividends  under sections 551 and 1248, but not deemed inclusions under sections  951(a) and 1293. For rules concerning excess distributions from section  1291 funds that are treated as dividends solely for foreign tax credit  purposes, (see Regulation Project INTL-656-87 published in 1992-1 C.B.  1124; see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Dividend received. A dividend shall be considered received for  purposes of section 902 when the cash or other property is unqualifiedly  made subject to the demands of the distributee. See Sec. 1.301-1(b). A  dividend also is considered received for purposes of section 902 when it  is deemed received under section 304, 367(b), 551, or 1248.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Special effective date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Rule. If the first day on which the  ownership requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B) and paragraphs (a)(1)  through (4) of this section are met with respect to a foreign  corporation, without regard to whether a dividend is distributed, is in  a taxable year of the foreign corporation beginning after December 31,  1986, then--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign  income taxes of the foreign corporation shall be determined by taking  into account only taxable years beginning on and after the first day of  the first taxable year of the foreign corporation in which the ownership  requirements are met, including subsequent taxable years in which the  ownership requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B) and paragraphs (a)(1)  through (4) of this section are not met; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> and paragraphs (a)(1) through (4)  of this section are met shall be considered pre-1987 accumulated  profits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the special  effective date rules of this paragraph (a)(13):</p><p class="depth0">Example. As of December 31, 1991, and since its incorporation,  foreign corporation A has owned 100 percent of the stock of foreign  corporation B. Corporation B is not a controlled foreign corporation.  Corporation B uses the calendar year as its taxable year, and its  functional currency is the u. Assume 1u equals $1 at all relevant times.  On April 1, 1992, Corporation B pays a 200u dividend to Corporation A  and the ownership requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B) and paragraphs  (a)(1) through (4) of this section are not met at that time. On July 1,  1992, domestic corporation M purchases 10 percent of the Corporation B  stock from Corporation A and, for the first time, Corporation B meets  the ownership requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B) and paragraph (a)(2)  of this section. Corporation M uses the calendar year as its taxable  year. Corporation B does not distribute any dividends to Corporation M  during 1992. For its taxable year ending December 31, 1992, Corporation  B has 500u of earnings and profits (after foreign taxes but before  taking into account the 200u distribution to Corporation A) and pays  100u of foreign income taxes that is equal to $100. Pursuant to  paragraph (a)(13)(i) of this section, Corporation B's post-1986  undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes will include  earnings and profits and foreign income taxes attributable to  Corporation B's entire 1992 taxable year and all taxable years  thereafter. Thus, the April 1, 1992, dividend to Corporation A will  reduce post-1986 undistributed earnings to 300u (500u-200u) under  paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section. The foreign income taxes  attributable to the amount distributed as a dividend to Corporation A  will not be creditable because Corporation A is not a domestic  shareholder. Post-1986 foreign income taxes, however, will be reduced by  the amount of foreign taxes attributable to the dividend. Thus, as of  the beginning of 1993, Corporation B has $60 ($100-[$100x40% (200u/ 500u)]) of post-1986 foreign income taxes. See paragraphs (a)(8)(i) and  (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Computation of foreign income taxes deemed paid by a domestic  shareholder, first-tier corporation, or lower-tier corporation--(1)  General rule. If a foreign corporation pays a dividend in any taxable  year out of post-1986 undistributed earnings to a shareholder that is a  domestic shareholder or an upper-tier corporation at the time it  receives the dividend, the recipient shall be deemed to have paid the  same proportion of any post-1986 foreign income taxes paid, accrued or  deemed paid by the distributing corporation on or with respect to post- 1986 undistributed earnings which the amount of the dividend out of  post-1986 undistributed earnings (determined without regard to the  gross-up under section 78) bears to the amount of the distributing  corporation's post-1986 undistributed earnings. An upper-tier  corporation shall not be entitled to compute an amount of foreign taxes  deemed paid on a dividend from a lower-tier corporation, however, unless  the ownership requirements of paragraphs (a) </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> through (4) of this  section are met at each tier at the time the upper-tier corporation  receives the dividend. Foreign income taxes deemed paid by a domestic  shareholder or an upper-tier corporation must be computed under the  following formula: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC07OC91.030</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Allocation rule for dividends attributable to post-1986  undistributed earnings and pre-1987 accumulated profits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Portion of  dividend out of post-1986 undistributed earnings. Dividends will be  deemed to be paid first out of post-1986 undistributed earnings to the  extent thereof. If dividends exceed post-1986 undistributed earnings and  dividends are paid to more than one shareholder, then the dividend to  each shareholder shall be deemed to be paid pro rata out of post-1986  undistributed earnings, computed as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC07OC91.031</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Portion of dividend out of pre-1987 accumulated profits. After  the portion of the dividend attributable to post-1986 undistributed  earnings is determined under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the  remainder of the dividend received by a shareholder is attributable to  pre-1987 accumulated profits to the extent thereof. That part of the  dividend attributable to pre-1987 accumulated profits will be treated as  paid first from the most recently accumulated earnings and profits. See  Sec. 1.902-3. If dividends paid out of pre-1987 accumulated profits are  attributable to more than one pre-1987 taxable year and are paid to more  than one shareholder, then the dividend to each shareholder attributable  to earnings and profits accumulated in a particular pre-1987 taxable  year shall be deemed to be paid pro rata out of accumulated   profits of that taxable year, computed as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC07OC91.032</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Dividends paid out of pre-1987 accumulated profits. If dividends  are paid by a first-tier corporation or a lower-tier corporation out of  pre-1987 accumulated profits, the domestic shareholder or upper-tier  corporation that receives the dividends shall be deemed to have paid  foreign income taxes to the extent provided under section 902 and the  regulations thereunder as in effect prior to the effective date of the  Tax Reform Act of 1986. See paragraphs (a) (10) and (13) of this section  and Sec. Sec. 1.902-3 and 1.902-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Deficits in accumulated earnings and profits. No foreign income  taxes shall be deemed paid with respect to a distribution from a foreign  corporation out of current earnings and profits that is treated as a  dividend under section 316(a)(2), and post-1986 foreign income taxes  shall not be reduced, if as of the end of the taxable year in which the  dividend is paid or accrued, the corporation has zero or a deficit in  post-1986 undistributed earnings and the sum of current plus accumulated  earnings and profits is zero or less than zero. The dividend shall  reduce post- 1986 undistributed earnings and accumulated earnings and  profits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  paragraph (b):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Domestic corporation M owns 100 percent of foreign  corporation A. Both Corporation M and Corporation A use the calendar  year as the taxable year, and Corporation A uses the u as its functional  currency. Assume that 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. All of  Corporation A's pre-1987 accumulated profits and post-1986 undistributed  earnings are non-subpart F general limitation earnings and profits under  section 904(d)(1)(I). As of December 31, 1992, Corporation A has 100u of  post-1986 undistributed earnings and $40 of post-1986 foreign income  taxes. For its 1986 taxable year, Corporation A has accumulated profits  of 200u (net of foreign taxes) and paid 60u of foreign income taxes on  those earnings. In 1992, Corporation A distributes 150u to Corporation  M. Corporation A has 100u of post-1986 undistributed earnings and the  dividend, therefore, is treated as paid out of post-1986 undistributed  earnings to the extent of 100u. The first 100u distribution is from  post-1986 undistributed earnings, and, because the distribution exhausts  those earnings, Corporation M is deemed to have paid the entire amount  of post-1986 foreign income taxes of Corporation A ($40). The remaining  50u dividend is treated as a dividend out of 1986 accumulated profits  under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Corporation M is deemed to have  paid $15 (60ux50u/200u, translated at the appropriate exchange rates) of  Corporation A's foreign income taxes for 1986. As of January 1, 1993,  Corporation A's post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign  income taxes are 0. Corporation A has 150u of accumulated profits and  45u of foreign income taxes remaining in 1986.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Domestic corporation M (incorporated on January 1, 1987)  owns 100 percent of foreign corporation A (incorporated on January 1,  1987). Both Corporation M and Corporation A use the calendar year as the  taxable year, and Corporation A uses the u as its functional currency.  Assume that 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. Corporation A has no  pre-1987 accumulated profits. All of Corporation A's post-1986  undistributed earnings are non-subpart F general limitation earnings and  profits under section 904(d)(1)(I). On January 1, 1992, Corporation A  has a deficit in accumulated earnings and profits and a deficit in post- 1986 undistributed earnings of (200u). No foreign taxes have been paid  with respect to post-1986 undistributed earnings. During 1992,  Corporation A earns 100u (net of foreign taxes), pays $40 of foreign  taxes on those earnings and distributes 50u to Corporation M. As of the  end of 1992, Corporation A has a deficit of (100u) ((200u) post1986  undistributed earnings + 100u current earnings and profits) in post-1986  undistributed earnings. Corporation A, however, has current earnings and  profits of   100u. Therefore, the 50u distribution is treated as a dividend in its  entirety under section 316(a)(2). Under paragraph (b)(4) of this  section, Corporation M is not deemed to have paid any of the foreign  taxes paid by Corporation A because post-1986 undistributed earnings and  the sum of current plus accumulated earnings and profits are (100u). The  dividend reduces both post-1986 undistributed earnings and accumulated  earnings and profits. Therefore, as of January 1, 1993, Corporation A's  post-1986 undistributed earnings are (150u) and its accumulated earnings  and profits are (150u). Corporation A's post-1986 foreign income taxes  at the start of 1993 are $40.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Separate computations required for dividends  from each first-tier and lower-tier corporation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Rule. If in a  taxable year dividends are received by a domestic shareholder or an  upper-tier corporation from two or more first-tier corporations or two  or more lower-tier corporations, the foreign income taxes deemed paid by  the domestic shareholder or the upper-tier corporation under sections  902 (a) and (b) and paragraph (b) of this section shall be computed  separately with respect to the dividends received from each first-tier  corporation or lower-tier corporation. If a domestic shareholder  receives dividend distributions from one or more first-tier corporations  and in the same taxable year the first-tier corporation receives  dividends from one or more lower-tier corporations, then the amount of  foreign income taxes deemed paid shall be computed by starting with the  lowest-tier corporation and working upward.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of  this paragraph (c)(1):</p><p class="depth0">Example. P, a domestic corporation, owns 40 percent of the voting  stock of foreign corporation S. S owns 30 percent of the voting stock of  foreign corporation T, and 30 percent of the voting stock of foreign  corporation U. Neither S, T, nor U is a controlled foreign corporation.  P, S, T and U all use the calendar year as their taxable year. In 1993,  T and U both pay dividends to S and S pays a dividend to P. To compute  foreign taxes deemed paid, paragraph (c)(1) of this section requires P  to start with the lowest tier corporations and to compute foreign taxes  deemed paid separately for dividends from each first-tier and lower-tier  corporation. Thus, S first will compute foreign taxes deemed paid  separately on its dividends from T and U. The deemed paid taxes will be  added to S's post-1986 foreign income taxes, and the dividends will be  added to S's post-1986 undistributed earnings. Next, P will compute  foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to the dividend from S. This  computation will take into account the taxes paid by T and U and deemed  paid by S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 78 gross-up--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Foreign income taxes deemed paid by a  domestic shareholder.

Amounts included in gross income under section 78 shall, for purposes of  section 904, be deemed to be derived from sources within the United  States to the extent the earnings and profits on which the taxes were  paid are treated under section 904(g) as United States source earnings  and profits.

As of the end of 1992, but before dividend payments, S has 150u  of post-1986 undistributed earnings and $60 of post-1986 foreign income  taxes. Assume that 50u of S's earnings for 1992 are from United States  sources. S pays P a dividend of 75u which P receives in 1992. Under  Sec. 1.904-5(m)(4), one-third of the dividend, or 25u (75ux50u/150u),  is United States source income to P. P computes foreign taxes deemed  paid on the dividend under paragraph (b)(1) of this section of $30  ($60x50%[75u/150u]) and includes that amount in gross income under  section 78 as a dividend. Because 25u of the 75u dividend is United  States source income to P, $10 ($30x33.33%[25u/75u]) of the section 78  dividend will be treated as United States source income to P under this  paragraph (c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Creditable foreign income taxes.

Since 1987, domestic corporation M has owned 10 percent  of the one class of stock of foreign corporation A. The remaining 90  percent of Corporation A's stock is owned by Z, a foreign corporation.  Corporation A is not a controlled foreign corporation. Corporation A  uses the u as its functional currency, and 1u equals $1 at all relevant  times.

Both the  income inclusion and the credit are subject to a separate limitation for  dividends from Corporation A, a noncontrolled section 902 corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> (the same country dividend exception)  applies. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, Corporation A  is not required to include the deemed paid taxes in earnings and  profits. Corporation A has no pre-1987 accumulated profits and a deficit  in post-1986 undistributed earnings for 1992. In 1992, Corporation A  pays a dividend of 100u to Corporation M out of its earnings and profits  for 1992 (current earnings and profits). Under paragraph (b)(4) of this  section, Corporation M is not deemed to have paid any of the foreign  income taxes paid or deemed paid by Corporation A because Corporation A  has a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings as of December 31,  1992, and the sum of its current plus accumulated profits is less than  zero. Note that if instead of paying a dividend to Corporation A in  1992, Corporation B had made an additional investment of $150 in United  States property under section 956, that amount would have been included  in gross income by Corporation M under section 951(a)(1)(B) and  Corporation M would have been deemed to have paid $50 of foreign income  taxes paid by Corporation B.

Corporation A has no subpart F income, as  defined in section 952, and no increase in earnings invested in United  States property under section 956 for 1992. Corporation A also has no  previously taxed income accounts. Corporation A has general limitation  income and high withholding tax interest income that, by operation of  section 954(b)(4), does not constitute foreign base company income under  section 954(a). Because Corporation A is a controlled foreign  corporation, it is not required to reduce post-1986 foreign income taxes  by foreign taxes paid or accrued with respect to high withholding tax  interest in excess of 5 percent. See Sec. 1.902-1(a)(8)(iii).  Corporation A pays a 60u dividend to Corporation M in 1992.
