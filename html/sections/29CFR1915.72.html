When ladders with such defects are  discovered, they shall be immediately withdrawn from service. Inspection  of metal ladders shall include checking for corrosion of interiors of  open end, hollow rungs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When sections of ladders are spliced, the ends shall be abutted,  and not fewer than 2 cleats shall be securely nailed or bolted to each  rail. The combined cross sectional area of the cleats shall be not less  than the cross sectional area of the side rail. The dimensions of side  rails for their total length shall be those specified in paragraph (b)  or (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Portable ladders shall be lashed, blocked or otherwise secured  to prevent their being displaced. The side rails of ladders used for  access to any level shall extend not less than 36 inches above that  level. When this is not practical, grab rails which will provide a  secure grip for an employee moving to or from the point of access shall  be installed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Portable metal ladders shall be of strength equivalent to that  of wood ladders. Manufactured portable metal ladders provided by the  employer shall be in accordance with the provisions of ANSI Standard  A14.2-1972: Safety Requirements for Portable Metal Ladders (incorporated  by reference, see Sec. 1915.5).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Portable metal ladders shall not be used near electrical  conductors nor for electric arc welding operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Manufactured portable wood ladders provided by the employer  shall be in accordance with the provisions of ANSI Standard A14.1-1975:  Safety Requirements for Portable Wood Ladders (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 1915.5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Construction of portable wood cleated ladders up to 30 feet in  length. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wood side rails shall be made from West Coast hemlock,  Eastern spruce, Sitka spruce, or wood of equivalent strength. Material  shall be seasoned, straight-grained wood, and free from shakes, checks,  decay or other defects which will impair its strength. The use of low  density woods is prohibited.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Side rails shall be dressed on all sides and kept free of  splinters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All knots shall be sound and hard. The use of material  containing loose knots is prohibited. Knots shall not appear on the  narrow face of the rail and, when in the side face, shall be not more  than \1/2\ inch in diameter or within \1/2\ inch of the edge of the rail  or nearer than 3 inches to a tread or rung.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Pitch pockets not exceeding \1/8\ inch in width, 2 inches in  length and \1/2\ inch in depth are permissible in wood side rails,  provided that not more than one such pocket appears in each 4 feet of  length.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The width between side rails at the base shall be not less than  11\1/2\ inches for ladders 10 feet or less in length. For longer ladders  this width shall be increased at least \1/4\ inch for each additional 2  feet in length.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Side rails shall be at least 1\5/8\x3\5/8\ inches in cross  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Cleats (meaning rungs rectangular in cross section with the wide  dimension parallel to the rails) shall be of the material used for side  rails, straight-grained and free from knots. Cleats shall be mortised  into the edges of the side rails \1/2\ inch, or filler blocks shall be  used on the rails between the cleats. The cleats shall be secured to  each rail with three 10d common wire nails or fastened with through  bolts or other fasteners of equivalent strength. Cleats shall be  uniformly spaced not more than 12 inches apart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Cleats 20 inches or less in length shall be at least 25/32x3  inches in cross section. Cleats over 20 inches but not more than 30  inches in length shall be at least 25/32x3\3/4\ inches in cross section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Construction of portable wood cleated ladders from 30 to 60 feet  in length. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ladders from 30 to 60 feet in length shall be in  accordance with the specifications of paragraph (b) of this section with  the following exceptions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Rails shall be of not less than 2x6 inch lumber.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Cleats shall be of not less than 1x4 inch lumber.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Cleats shall be nailed to each rail with five 10d common wire  nails or fastened with through bolts or other fasteners of equivalent  strength.
