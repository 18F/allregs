accompanies it?

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> OWCP will send a copy of the final decision to the individual from whom recovery is sought; his or her representative, if any; and the employing agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The only review of a final decision concerning an overpayment is to the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board. The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8124(b) (concerning hearings) and 5 U.S.C. 8128(a) (concerning reconsiderations) do not apply to such a decision. The pendency of an appeal with ECAB has no effect on the finality of the order being appealed; in the event ECAB reverses the final overpayment decision, any monies collected will be restored to the beneficiary.</p>
