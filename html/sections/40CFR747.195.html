Definitions in section 3 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 2602, apply to this section unless otherwise specified in this paragraph. In addition, the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The terms Act, article, chemical substance, commerce, importer, impurity, Inventory, manufacturer, person, process, processor, and small quantities solely for research and development, have the same meaning as in Sec. 720.3 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Metalworking fluid means a liquid of any viscosity or color containing intentionally added water used in metal machining operations for the purpose of cooling, lubricating, or rust inhibition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nitrosating agent means any substance that has the potential to transfer a nitrosyl group (--NO) to a primary, secondary, or tertiary amine to form the corresponding nitrosamine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Process or distribute in commerce solely for export means to process or distribute in commerce solely for export from the United States under the following restrictions on domestic activity:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Processing must be performed at sites under the control of the processor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Distribution in commerce is limited to purposes of export.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The processor or distributor may not use the substance except in small quantities solely for research and development.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use limitations. (1) Any person producing a metalworking fluid, or a product which could be used in or as a metalworking fluid, which includes as one of its components P-84-310, is prohibited from adding any nitrosating agent to the metalworking fluid or product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any person producing a metalworking fluid, or a product which could be used in or as a metalworking fluid, which includes as one of its components P-84-310, is prohibited from adding any nitrosating agent to the metalworking fluid or product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A person using as a metalworking fluid a product containing P-84-310 is prohibited from adding any nitrosating agent to the product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Warnings and instructions. (1) Any person who distributes in commerce P-84-310 in a metalworking fluid, or in any form in which it could be used as

a component of a metalworking fluid, must send to each recipient of P-84-310 and confirm receipt in writing prior to the first shipment to that person:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any person who distributes in commerce P-84-310 in a metalworking fluid, or in any form in which it could be used as

a component of a metalworking fluid, must send to each recipient of P-84-310 and confirm receipt in writing prior to the first shipment to that person:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A letter that includes the following statements: A substance, identified generically as a triethanolamine salt of a substituted organic acid, contained in the product (insert distributor's trade name or other identifier for product containing P-84-310) has been regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, at 40 CFR 747.195, as published in the Federal Register of June 14, 1984. A copy of the regulation is enclosed. The regulation prohibits the addition of any nitrosating agent, including nitrites, to the triethanolamine salt of a substituted organic acid, when the substance is or could be used in metalworking fluids. The addition of nitrites or other nitrosating agents to this substance leads to formation of a substance known to cause cancer in laboratory animals. The triethanolamine salt of a substituted organic acid has been specifically designed to be used without nitrites. Consult the enclosed regulation for further information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A copy of this Sec. 747.195.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> Any person who distributes in commerce a metalworking fluid containing P-84-310 must affix a label to each container containing the fluid.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any person who distributes in commerce a metalworking fluid containing P-84-310 must affix a label to each container containing the fluid.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The label shall contain a warning statement which shall consist only of the following language:</p><p class="depth4">WARNING! Do Not Add Nitrites to This Metalworking Fluid under Penalty of Federal Law. Addition of nitrites leads to formation of a substance known to cause cancer.
