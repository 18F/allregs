                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Paints mixed with toxic vehicles or solvents. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When paints  mixed with toxic vehicles or solvents are sprayed, the following  conditions shall apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In confined spaces, employees continuously exposed to such  spraying shall be protected by air line respirators in accordance with  the requirements of subpart I of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In tanks or compartments, employees continuously exposed to  such spraying shall be protected by air line respirators in accordance  with the requirements of subpart I. Where mechanical ventilation is  provided, employees shall be protected by respirators in accordance with  the requirements of subpart I of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In large and well ventilated areas, employees exposed to such  spraying shall be protected by respirators in accordance with the  requirements of subpart I of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where brush application of paints with toxic solvents is done in  confined spaces or in other areas where lack of ventilation creates a  hazard, employees shall be protected by filter respirators in accordance  with the requirements of subpart I of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When flammable paints or vehicles are used, precautions shall be  taken in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1915.36.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The metallic parts of air moving devices, including fans,  blowers, and jet-type air movers, and all duct work shall be  electrically bonded to the vessel's structure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Paints and tank coatings dissolved in highly volatile, toxic and  flammable solvents. Several organic coatings, adhesives and resins are  dissolved in highly toxic, flammable and explosive solvents with flash  points below 80 [deg]F. Work involving such materials shall be done only  when all of the following special precautions have been taken:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sufficient exhaust ventilation shall be provided to keep the  concentration of solvent vapors below ten (10) percent of the lower  explosive limit. Frequent tests shall be made by a competent person to  ascertain the concentration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the ventilation fails or if the concentration of solvent  vapors reaches or exceeds ten (10) percent of the lower explosive limit,  painting shall be stopped and the compartment shall be evacuated until  the concentration again falls below ten (10) percent   of the lower explosive limit. If the concentration does not fall when  painting is stopped, additional ventilation to bring the concentration  to below ten (10) percent of the lower explosive limit shall be  provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ventilation shall be continued after the completion of painting  until the space or compartment is gas free. The final determination as  to whether the space or compartment is gas free shall be made after the  ventilating equipment has been shut off for at least 10 minutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Exhaust ducts shall discharge clear of working areas and away  from sources of possible ignition. Periodic tests shall be made to  ensure that the exhausted vapors are not accumulating in other areas  within or around the vessel or dry dock.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All motors and control equipment shall be of the explosion-proof  type. Fans shall have nonferrous blades. Portable air ducts shall also  be of nonferrous materials. All motors and associated control equipment  shall be properly maintained and grounded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Only non-sparking paint buckets, spray guns and tools shall be  used. Metal parts of paint brushes and rollers shall be insulated.  Staging shall be erected in a manner which ensures that it is non- sparking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Only explosion proof lights, approved by the Underwriters'  Laboratories for use in Class I, Group D atmospheres, or approved as  permissible by the Mine Safety and Health Administration or the U.S.  Coast Guard, shall be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A competent person shall inspect all power and lighting cables  to ensure that the insulation is in excellent condition, free of all  cracks and worn spots, that there are no connections within fifty (50)  feet of the operation, that lines are not overloaded, and that they are  suspended with sufficient slack to prevent undue stress or chafing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The face, eyes, head, hands, and all other exposed parts of the  bodies of employees handling such highly volatile paints shall be  protected. All footwear shall be non-sparking, such as rubbers, rubber  boots or rubber soled shoes without nails. Coveralls or other outer  clothing shall be of cotton. Rubber, rather than plastic, gloves shall  be used because of the danger of static sparks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> No matches, lighted cigarettes, cigars, or pipes, and no  cigarette lighters or ferrous articles shall be taken into the area  where work is being done.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> All solvent drums taken into the compartment shall be placed on  nonferrous surfaces and shall be grounded to the vessel. Metallic  contact shall be maintained between containers and drums when materials  are being transferred from one to another.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Spray guns, paint pots, and metallic parts of connecting tubing  shall be electrically bonded, and the bonded assembly shall be grounded  to the vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> All employees continuously in a compartment in which such  painting is being performed shall be protected by air line respirators  in accordance with the requirements of subpart I of this part and by  suitable protective clothing. Employees entering such compartments for a  limited time shall be protected by filter cartridge type respirators in  accordance with the requirements of subpart I of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> All employees doing exterior paint spraying with such paints  shall be protected by suitable filter cartridge type respirators in  accordance with the requirements of subpart I of this part and by  suitable protective clothing.
