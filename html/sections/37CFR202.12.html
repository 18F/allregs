Application for registration for single works restored to copyright protection under URAA should be made on Form GATT. Form GATT may be submitted by completing Form GATT electronically, submitting the appropriate filing fee electronically, and sending the deposit copies and materials required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section by postal mail; or by printing Form GATT from the Office's website, sending it with the appropriate filing fee and deposit copies and materials required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section in the same package by mail; or by obtaining a Form GATT, completing it, and sending the appropriate filing fee and the deposit copies and materials required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section in the same package by mail.

CURRENCY WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> U.S. Copyright Office Deposit Account. The U.S. Copyright Office maintains a system of Deposit Accounts for the convenience of those who frequently use its services. The system allows an individual or firm to establish a Deposit Account in the U.S. Copyright Office and to make advance deposits into that account. Deposit Account holders can charge copyright fees against the balance in their accounts instead of sending separate remittances with each request for service. For information on Deposit Accounts, visit the U.S. Copyright Office Web site or write to the address specified in Sec.  201.1 of this chapter and request a copy of Circular 5.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Credit cards. For URAA registrations the Copyright Office will accept VISA, MasterCard, and American Express. Debit cards cannot be accepted for payment. With the registration application, an applicant using a credit card must submit a separate cover letter stating the name of the credit card, the credit card number, the expiration date of the credit card, the total amount authorized and a signature authorizing the Office to charge the fees to the account. To protect the security of the credit card number, the applicant must not write the credit card number on the registration application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Deposit--(i) General. The deposit for a work registered as a restored work under the amended section 104A, except for those works listed in paragraphs (c)(4) (ii) through (iv) of this section, should consist of one copy or phonorecord which best represents the copyrightable content of the restored work.

An applicant who is unable to submit any of the preferred deposits may seek an alternative deposit under special relief (37 CFR 202.20(d)). In such a case, the applicant should indicate in writing why the deposit preferences cannot be met, and submit alternative identifying materials clearly showing some portion of the copyrightable contents of the restored work which is the subject of registration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Motion pictures. If the deposit is a film print (16 or 35 mm), the applicant should contact the Performing Arts Division of the Registration Program for delivery instructions. The telephone number is: (202) 707-6040; the telefax number is: (202) 707-1236.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Works excluded.
