                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, prior to the opening

of a leverage customer account, a leverage transaction merchant soliciting an order for any leverage contract shall furnish to the prospective leverage customer a dated Disclosure Document and receive from such prospective leverage customer a signed and dated copy of the risk disclosure statement contained in such document which acknowledges that the customer received and understood the Disclosure Document. The Disclosure Document shall contain then current information with respect to the leverage contract being offered by the person soliciting the order therefor, and shall contain:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following bold-faced risk disclosure statement in at least ten-point type on the first page of the Disclosure Document:</p><p class="depth3">BECAUSE OF THE UNPREDICTABLE NATURE OF THE PRICES OF PRECIOUS AND OTHER METALS, LEVERAGE CONTRACTS INVOLVE A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK AND ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR MANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. THE LEVERAGE CUSTOMER SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THE VALUE OF A LEVERAGE CONTRACT ORIGINALLY PURCHASED BY A CUSTOMER (``LONG LEVERAGE CONTRACT'') MUST EXCEED THE BREAK-EVEN PRICE BEFORE IT IS POSSIBLE TO REALIZE A PROFIT ON THE CONTRACT. SIMILARLY, THE VALUE OF A LEVERAGE CONTRACT ORIGINALLY SOLD BY A LEVERAGE CUSTOMER (``SHORT LEVERAGE CONTRACT'') MUST BE LESS THAN THE BREAK-EVEN PRICE BEFORE IT IS POSSIBLE TO REALIZE A PROFIT ON THE CONTRACT. A FILLED IN VERSION OF THE CUSTOMER CONFIRMATION STATEMENT REFLECTING A SINGLE TRANSACTION IN A REPRESENTATIVE LEVERAGE COMMODITY FOR A LONG LEVERAGE TRANSACTION AND A SHORT LEVERAGE TRANSACTION WHICH INCLUDES A FORMULA FOR CALCULATING AN ESTIMATE OF THE LEVERAGE CONTRACT'S BREAK-EVEN VALUE IS ATTACHED TO THIS DOCUMENT. THIS IS IN THE SAME FORMAT AS THE CONFIRMATION STATEMENT YOU WILL RECEIVE TO CONFIRM YOUR ACTUAL TRANSACTION. BE CERTAIN THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THIS STATEMENT BEFORE YOU ENTER INTO A LEVERAGE TRANSACTION.</p><p class="depth3">YOU SHOULD ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHARGES FOR SIMILAR LEVERAGE CONTRACTS WHICH ARE REFLECTED ON THE FILLED-IN CONFIRMATION STATEMENT AS ESTIMATED MAY VARY AMONG LEVERAGE FIRMS, AND THAT SUCH FIRMS HAVE COMPLETE DISCRETION IN SETTING THEIR CHARGES AND THE PRICE OF THE LEVERAGE CONTRACTS THEY OFFER. PRIOR TO ENTERING INTO ANY LEVERAGE CONTRACT A PROSPECTIVE LEVERAGE CUSTOMER SHOULD COMPARE THE CHARGES AND PRICES OF SUCH FIRMS WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH THE COMMISSIONS FOR AND PRICES OF FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADED ON DESIGNATED EXCHANGES.</p><p class="depth3">YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT YOU ARE SUBJECT TO MARGIN CALLS. THE LEVERAGE FIRM RESERVES THE RIGHT TO LIQUIDATE YOUR POSITION IF YOU DO NOT RESPOND TO A MARGIN CALL WITHIN THE TIME SPECIFIED IN YOUR LEVERAGE AGREEMENT. IN ANY EVENT, IF THE EQUITY IN YOUR CONTRACT AT ANY TIME FALLS BELOW 50% OF THE MINIMUM MARGIN, YOUR CONTRACT MAY BE LIQUIDATED WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE. YOU MUST, HOWEVER, BE NOTIFIED OF LIQUIDATION WITHIN NO MORE THAN 24 HOURS THEREAFTER AND PERMITTED TO REESTABLISH YOUR CONTRACT FOR A PERIOD OF 5 BUSINESS DAYS. LEVERAGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED FROM A LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT ARE RE-ESTABLISHED AT THE THEN PREVAILING BID PRICE AND LEVERAGE CONTRACTS SOLD TO A LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT ARE RE-ESTABLISHED AT THE THEN PREVAILING ASK PRICE WITHOUT COMMISSIONS, FEES OR OTHER MARK-UPS OR CHARGES UNDER RULES SET BY THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION, AS MORE COMPLETELY DESCRIBED IN THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT. IN CASE OF LIQUIDATION, ALL OF YOUR FUNDS MAY BE USED TO SETTLE THE DEFICIT IN THE ACCOUNT, AND YOU MAY BE LIABLE FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SETTLE IN FULL.</p><p class="depth3">IF YOU ARE A FIRST-TIME LEVERAGE CUSTOMER, YOU MAY RESCIND YOUR FIRST LEVERAGE TRANSACTION SUBJECT ONLY TO ACTUAL PRICE LOSSES BUT OTHERWISE WITHOUT PENALTY FOR THREE BUSINESS DAYS FOLLOWING AND INCLUDING THE DAY OF RECEIPT OF THE CONFIRMATION.</p><p class="depth3">YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IN ORDER TO REALIZE ANY VALUE FROM A LONG LEVERAGE CONTRACT, THE LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT WHICH SOLD YOU THE LEVERAGE CONTRACT MUST REPURCHASE IT, OR YOU MUST PAY THE LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT THE FULL PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE LEVERAGE CONTRACT, TAKE DELIVERY OF THE LEVERAGE COMMODITY, AND THEN SELL THE LEVERAGE COMMODITY, POSSIBLY AT A LOWER PRICE THAN THE PRICE PAID TO PURCHASE THE LEVERAGE COMMODITY

FROM THE LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT. YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT IN ORDER TO REALIZE ANY VALUE FROM A SHORT LEVERAGE CONTRACT, THE LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT TO WHICH YOU SOLD THE LEVERAGE CONTRACT MUST RESELL IT TO YOU, OR YOU MUST ACQUIRE THE LEVERAGE COMMODITY IN ORDER TO MAKE DELIVERY TO THE LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT, POSSIBLY AT A HIGHER PRICE THAN THE PRICE YOU WILL RECEIVE FROM THE LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT.</p><p class="depth3">THERE IS NO MARKET FOR THE LEVERAGE CONTRACT ITSELF OTHER THAN TO HAVE IT REPURCHASED BY OR RESOLD TO THE LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT. A LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO OFFER TO REPURCHASE OR RESELL A LEVERAGE CONTRACT AT ALL TIMES, ALTHOUGH THE LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT MUST OFFER TO REPURCHASE ANY LONG LEVERAGE CONTRACT PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED BY A LEVERAGE CUSTOMER AND MUST ALSO OFFER TO RESELL ANY SHORT LEVERAGE CONTRACT PREVIOUSLY SOLD BY A LEVERAGE CUSTOMER AT ANY TIME DURING WHICH THE LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT IS OFFERING TO ENTER INTO NEW LONG OR SHORT LEVERAGE CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS INVOLVING THE SAME LEVERAGE COMMODITY. AS NOTED ABOVE, HOWEVER, A LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT HAS COMPLETE DISCRETION IN SETTING THE PRICE AND ANY CHARGES RELATED THERETO.</p><p class="depth3">THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION HAS NOT PASSED UPON THE MERITS OF THESE LEVERAGE CONTRACTS AS AN INVESTMENT VEHICLE NOR UPON THE ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY OF THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A VIOLATION OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT AND THE REGULATIONS THEREUNDER.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Immediately following the statement required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a section, captioned ``Provisions of Leverage Contract'' in at least ten point type, containing the terms and conditions of the leverage contract being offered.
