Variations from  requirements granted under this section are conditioned on compliance  with the procedures, conditions, and limitations set forth in the  approval of the application. Failure to comply in good faith with such  procedures, conditions and limitations shall automatically terminate the  authority for such variations and the manufacturer thereupon shall fully  comply with the prescribed requirements of regulations from which the  variations were authorized. Authority for any variation may be withdrawn  whenever in the judgment of the appropriate TTB officer the revenue is  jeopardized or the effective administration of this subpart is hindered  by the continuation of such variation. Where a manufacturer desires to  employ such variation, the manufacturer shall submit a written  application to do so (in triplicate) to the appropriate TTB officer. The  application shall describe the proposed variations and set forth the  reasons therefor. Variations shall not be employed until the application  has been approved. In accordance with this subpart, any authorization of  the appropriate TTB officer under this section shall be retained as part  of the manufacturer's records.</p>
