                            <p class="depth0">During the performance test required by Sec. Sec. 63.4340 or 63.4350 and described in Sec. Sec. 63.4360, 63.4361, and 63.4362, you must establish the operating limits required by Sec. 63.4292 according to this section, unless you have received approval for alternative monitoring and operating limits under Sec. 63.8(f) as specified in Sec. 63.4292.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Thermal oxidizers. If your add-on control device is a thermal oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the performance test, you must monitor and record the temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. You must monitor the temperature in the firebox of the thermal oxidizer or immediately downstream of the firebox before any substantial heat exchange occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature maintained during the performance test. This average temperature is the minimum operating limit for your thermal oxidizer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Catalytic oxidizers. If your add-on control device is a catalytic oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to either paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) or paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the performance test, you must monitor and record the temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed and the temperature difference across the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed and the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test. These are the minimum operating limits for your catalytic oxidizer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As an alternative to monitoring the temperature difference across the catalyst bed, you may monitor the temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed and implement a site-specific inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. During the performance test, you must monitor and record the temperature just before the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature just before the catalyst bed during the performance test. This is the minimum operating limit for your catalytic oxidizer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must develop and implement an inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer(s) for which you elect to monitor according to paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The plan must address, at a minimum, the elements specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Annual sampling and analysis of the catalyst activity (i.e., conversion efficiency) following the manufacturer's or catalyst supplier's recommended procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Monthly inspection of the oxidizer system, including the burner assembly and fuel supply lines for problems and, as necessary, adjust the equipment to assure proper air-to-fuel mixtures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Annual internal and monthly external visual inspection of the catalyst bed to check for channeling, abrasion, and settling. If problems are found, you must take corrective action consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations and conduct a new performance test to determine destruction efficiency according to Sec. 63.4362.</p>
