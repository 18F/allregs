                            <p class="depth0">As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the  meaning given them in the CAA and in subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Certified emissions life means the period during which the engine is  designed to properly function in terms of reliability and fuel  consumption, without being remanufactured, specified as a number of  hours of operation or calendar years, whichever comes first. The values  for certified emissions life for stationary SI ICE with a maximum engine  power less than or equal to 19 KW (25 HP) are given in 40 CFR 90.105, 40  CFR 1054.107, and 40 CFR 1060.101, as appropriate. The values for  certified emissions life for stationary SI ICE with a maximum engine  power greater than 19 KW (25 HP) certified to 40 CFR part 1048 are given  in 40 CFR 1048.101(g). The certified emissions life for stationary SI  ICE with a maximum engine power greater than 75 KW (100 HP) certified  under the voluntary manufacturer certification program of this subpart  is 5,000 hours or 7 years, whichever comes first. You may request in  your application for certification that we approve a shorter certified  emissions life for an engine family. We may approve a shorter certified  emissions life, in hours of engine operation but not in years, if we  determine that these engines will rarely operate longer than the shorter  certified emissions life. If engines identical to those in the engine  family have already been produced and are in use, your demonstration  must include documentation from such in-use engines. In other cases,  your demonstration must include an engineering analysis of information  equivalent to such in-use data, such as data from research engines or  similar engine models that are already in production. Your demonstration  must also include any overhaul interval that you recommend, any  mechanical warranty that you offer for the engine or its components, and  any relevant customer design specifications. Your demonstration may  include any other relevant information. The certified emissions life  value may not be shorter than any of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 1,000 hours of operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Your recommended overhaul interval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Your mechanical warranty for the engine.</p><p class="depth0">Certified stationary internal combustion engine means an engine that  belongs to an engine family that has a certificate of conformity that  complies with the emission standards and requirements in this part, or  of 40 CFR part 90, 40 CFR part 1048, or 40 CFR part 1054, as  appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">Combustion turbine means all equipment, including but not limited to  the turbine, the fuel, air, lubrication and exhaust gas systems, control  systems (except emissions control equipment), and any ancillary  components and sub-components comprising any simple cycle combustion  turbine, any regenerative/recuperative cycle combustion turbine, the  combustion turbine portion of any cogeneration cycle combustion system,  or the combustion turbine portion of any combined cycle steam/electric  generating system.</p><p class="depth0">Compression ignition means relating to a type of stationary internal  combustion engine that is not a spark ignition engine.</p><p class="depth0">Date of manufacture means one of the following things:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For freshly manufactured engines and modified engines, date of  manufacture means the date the engine is originally produced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For reconstructed engines, date of manufacture means the date  the engine was originally produced, except as specified in paragraph (3)  of this definition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reconstructed engines are assigned a new date of manufacture if  the fixed capital cost of the new and refurbished components exceeds 75  percent of the fixed capital cost of a comparable entirely new facility.  An engine that is produced from a previously used engine block does not  retain the date of manufacture of the engine in which the engine block  was previously used if the engine is produced using all new components  except for the engine block. In these cases, the date of manufacture is  the date of reconstruction or the date the new engine is produced.</p><p class="depth0">Diesel fuel means any liquid obtained from the distillation of  petroleum with a boiling point of approximately 150 to 360 degrees  Celsius. One commonly used form is number 2 distillate oil.</p><p class="depth0">Digester gas means any gaseous by-product of wastewater treatment  typically formed through the anaerobic decomposition of organic waste  materials and composed principally of methane and carbon dioxide  (CO2).</p><p class="depth0">Emergency stationary internal combustion engine means any stationary  reciprocating internal combustion engine that meets all of the criteria  in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this definition. All emergency  stationary ICE must comply with the requirements specified in Sec.  60.4243(d) in order to be considered emergency stationary ICE. If the  engine does not comply with the requirements specified in Sec.  60.4243(d), then it is not considered to be an emergency stationary ICE  under this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The stationary ICE is operated to provide electrical power or  mechanical work during an emergency situation. Examples include  stationary ICE used to produce power for critical networks or equipment  (including power supplied to portions of a facility) when electric power  from the local utility (or the normal power source, if the facility runs  on its own power production) is interrupted, or stationary ICE used to  pump water in the case of fire or flood, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The stationary ICE is operated under limited circumstances for  situations not included in paragraph (1) of this definition, as  specified in Sec. 60.4243(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0">Engine manufacturer means the manufacturer of the engine. See the  definition of ``manufacturer'' in this section.</p><p class="depth0">Four-stroke engine means any type of engine which completes the  power cycle in two crankshaft revolutions, with intake and compression  strokes in the first revolution and power and exhaust strokes in the  second revolution.</p><p class="depth0">Freshly manufactured engine means an engine that has not been placed  into service. An engine becomes freshly manufactured when it is  originally produced.</p><p class="depth0">Gasoline means any fuel sold in any State for use in motor vehicles  and motor vehicle engines, or nonroad or stationary engines, and  commonly or   commercially known or sold as gasoline.</p><p class="depth0">Installed means the engine is placed and secured at the location  where it is intended to be operated.</p><p class="depth0">Landfill gas means a gaseous by-product of the land application of  municipal refuse typically formed through the anaerobic decomposition of  waste materials and composed principally of methane and CO2.</p><p class="depth0">Lean burn engine means any two-stroke or four-stroke spark ignited  engine that does not meet the definition of a rich burn engine.</p><p class="depth0">Liquefied petroleum gas means any liquefied hydrocarbon gas obtained  as a by-product in petroleum refining or natural gas production.</p><p class="depth0">Manufacturer has the meaning given in section 216(1) of the Clean  Air Act. In general, this term includes any person who manufactures a  stationary engine for sale in the United States or otherwise introduces  a new stationary engine into commerce in the United States. This  includes importers who import stationary engines for resale.</p><p class="depth0">Maximum engine power means maximum engine power as defined in 40 CFR  1048.801.</p><p class="depth0">Model year means the calendar year in which an engine is  manufactured (see ``date of manufacture''), except as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Model year means the annual new model production period of the  engine manufacturer in which an engine is manufactured (see ``date of  manufacture''), if the annual new model production period is different  than the calendar year and includes January 1 of the calendar year for  which the model year is named. It may not begin before January 2 of the  previous calendar year and it must end by December 31 of the named  calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For an engine that is converted to a stationary engine after  being placed into service as a nonroad or other non-stationary engine,  model year means the calendar year or new model production period in  which the engine was manufactured (see ``date of manufacture'').</p><p class="depth0">Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and  non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the Earth's  surface, of which the principal constituent is methane. Natural gas may  be field or pipeline quality.</p><p class="depth0">Other internal combustion engine means any internal combustion  engine, except combustion turbines, which is not a reciprocating  internal combustion engine or rotary internal combustion engine.</p><p class="depth0">Pipeline-quality natural gas means a naturally occurring fluid  mixture of hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, ethane, or propane) produced in  geological formations beneath the Earth's surface that maintains a  gaseous state at standard atmospheric temperature and pressure under  ordinary conditions, and which is provided by a supplier through a  pipeline. Pipeline-quality natural gas must either be composed of at  least 70 percent methane by volume or have a gross calorific value  between 950 and 1,100 British thermal units per standard cubic foot.</p><p class="depth0">Rich burn engine means any four-stroke spark ignited engine where  the manufacturer's recommended operating air/fuel ratio divided by the  stoichiometric air/fuel ratio at full load conditions is less than or  equal to 1.1. Engines originally manufactured as rich burn engines, but  modified prior to June 12, 2006, with passive emission control  technology for NOX (such as pre-combustion chambers) will be  considered lean burn engines. Also, existing engines where there are no  manufacturer's recommendations regarding air/fuel ratio will be  considered a rich burn engine if the excess oxygen content of the  exhaust at full load conditions is less than or equal to 2 percent.</p><p class="depth0">Rotary internal combustion engine means any internal combustion  engine which uses rotary motion to convert heat energy into mechanical  work.</p><p class="depth0">Spark ignition means relating to either: a gasoline-fueled engine;  or any other type of engine with a spark plug (or other sparking device)  and with operating characteristics significantly similar to the  theoretical Otto combustion cycle. Spark ignition engines usually use a  throttle to regulate intake air flow to control power during normal  operation. Dual-fuel engines in which a liquid fuel (typically diesel  fuel) is used for compression ignition and gaseous fuel (typically  natural gas)   is used as the primary fuel at an annual average ratio of less than 2  parts diesel fuel to 100 parts total fuel on an energy equivalent basis  are spark ignition engines.</p><p class="depth0">Stationary internal combustion engine means any internal combustion  engine, except combustion turbines, that converts heat energy into  mechanical work and is not mobile. Stationary ICE differ from mobile ICE  in that a stationary internal combustion engine is not a nonroad engine  as defined at 40 CFR 1068.30 (excluding paragraph (2)(ii) of that  definition), and is not used to propel a motor vehicle, aircraft, or a  vehicle used solely for competition. Stationary ICE include  reciprocating ICE, rotary ICE, and other ICE, except combustion  turbines.</p><p class="depth0">Stationary internal combustion engine test cell/stand means an  engine test cell/stand, as defined in 40 CFR part 63, subpart PPPPP,  that tests stationary ICE.</p><p class="depth0">Stoichiometric means the theoretical air-to-fuel ratio required for  complete combustion.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart means 40 CFR part 60, subpart JJJJ.</p><p class="depth0">Two-stroke engine means a type of engine which completes the power  cycle in single crankshaft revolution by combining the intake and  compression operations into one stroke and the power and exhaust  operations into a second stroke. This system requires auxiliary  scavenging and inherently runs lean of stoichiometric.</p><p class="depth0">Volatile organic compounds means volatile organic compounds as  defined in 40 CFR 51.100(s).</p><p class="depth0">Voluntary certification program means an optional engine  certification program that manufacturers of stationary SI internal  combustion engines with a maximum engine power greater than 19 KW (25  HP) that do not use gasoline and are not rich burn engines that use LPG  can choose to participate in to certify their engines to the emission  standards in Sec. 60.4231(d) or (e), as applicable.
