                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Due to the age, original media type, and general condition of many of the items in NARA's holdings, it is occasionally difficult to make a legible reproduction. NARA staff will notify customers if they anticipate that the original will result in a reproduction of questionable legibility before requesting the reproduction and after approval of the customer. After a records reproduction is completed, the product undergoes a review to determine if it is an accurate representation of the original item. Because of the preapproval process, NARA does not provide refunds except in special cases. If a customer requests a refund, a review is made of the order to determine if the customer was properly notified of the questionable nature of the original and if the product is a true representation of the original. If the customer authorized proceeding and the product is a true representation of the original, no refund will be issued.</p>
