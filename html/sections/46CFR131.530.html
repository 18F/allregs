                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Material for abandon-ship training must be aboard each vessel. The material must consist of a manual of one or more volumes, or audiovisual training aids, or both.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The material must contain instructions and information about the lifesaving appliances aboard the vessel and about the best methods of survival. Any manual must be written in easily understood terms, illustrated wherever possible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a manual is used, there must be a copy in each messroom and recreation room for crew members or in each stateroom for them. If audiovisual aids are used, they must be incorporated in the training sessions aboard under paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The material must explain the--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Method of donning immersion suits and lifejackets carried aboard;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Mustering at assigned stations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Proper boarding, launching, and clearing of survival craft and rescue boats;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Method of launching survival craft by people within them;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Method of releasing survival craft from launching-appliances;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Use of devices for protecting survival craft in launching-areas, where appropriate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Illumination of launching-areas;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Use of each item of survival equipment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Instructions for emergency repair of lifesaving appliances;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Use of radio lifesaving-appliances, with illustrations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Use of sea anchors;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> Use of engine and accessories, where appropriate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiii)</em> Recovery of survival craft and rescue boats, including stowage and securing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiv)</em> Hazards of exposure and need for warm clothing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xv)</em> Best use of survival craft for survival; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xvi)</em> Methods of retrieving personnel, including use of helicopter-mounted rescue gear (slings, baskets, stretchers) and vessel's line-throwing apparatus.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An abandon-ship drill must be held on each vessel in alternate weeks. If none can be held during the appointed week, because of bad weather or other unavoidable constraint, one must be held at the first opportunity afterward. If the crew changes more than once in any 2 weeks, one must be held as soon after the arrival of each crew as practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any crew member excused from an abandon-ship drill must participate in the next one, so that each member participates in at least one each month. Unless more than 25 percent of the members have participated in one on that particular vessel in the previous month, one must be held before the vessel leaves port if reasonable and practicable; but, unless the Commandant (CG-CVC) accepts alternative arrangements as at least equivalent, one must be held not later than 24 hours after the vessel leaves port in any event.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> On a voyage likely to take more than 24 hours to complete, a muster of offshore workers must be held on departure. The master shall ensure that each worker is assigned to a survival craft and is directed to its location. Each person in charge of such a craft shall maintain a list of workers assigned to the craft.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> On a voyage likely to take more than 24 hours to complete, a muster of offshore workers must be held on departure. The master shall ensure that each worker is assigned to a survival craft and is directed to its location.

If individual instructional sessions cover different parts of the vessel's lifesaving system, they must cover each part of the vessel's lifesaving equipment and appliances each 2 months. Each member must be instructed in at least--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Operation and use of the vessel's inflatable liferafts;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Problems of hypothermia, first aid for hypothermia, and other appropriate procedures; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Special procedures necessary for use of the vessel's lifesaving equipment and appliances in heavy weather.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Training in the use of davit-launched inflatable liferafts must take place at intervals of not more than 4 months on each vessel with such liferafts. Whenever practicable this must include the inflation and lowering of a liferaft. If this liferaft is a special one intended for training only, and is not part of the vessel's lifesaving system, it must be conspicuously so marked.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Dates when musters are held, details of abandon-ship drills, drills on other lifesaving equipment and appliances, and training aboard must be entered in the vessel's official logbook. Each logbook entry must include the following, as applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Time and date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Length of drill or training session.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identification of survival craft used in drills.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Subject of training session.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Statement on the condition of the equipment used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Unless a full muster, drill, or training session is held at the appointed time, the circumstances and the extent of the muster, drill, or training session held.
