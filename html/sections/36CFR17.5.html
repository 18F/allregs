                            <p class="depth0">Bids may be made by the principal or his agent, either personally or  by mail. Bids will be considered only if received at the place and prior  to the hour fixed   in the notice. No particular form is specified for bids. However, a bid  must be in writing, clearly identify the bidder, be signed by the bidder  or his designated agent, state the amount of the bid, and refer to the  notice. Bids conditioned in ways not provided for by the notice will not  be considered. Bids must be accompanied by certified checks, post office  money orders, bank drafts, or cashier's checks made payable to the  United States of America for 2 percent of the amount of the fair market  value or $2,500, whichever is greater, in the case of a freehold  interest or for the amount of the first year's rent in the case of a  leasehold interest. This payment will be refunded to unsuccessful  bidders. A separate nonrefundable payment of $100 to cover costs of  publication and of processing of bids will also be included with the  bid. The bid and payments must be enclosed in a sealed envelope upon  which the prospective bidder shall write: (a) Bid on interest in land of  the National Park System, and (b) the scheduled date the bids are to be  opened. In the event two or more valid bids are received in the same  amount, the determination of which is the highest will be by drawing.  Bids will be opened at the time and place specified in the notice.  Bidders, their agents or representatives, and any other persons may  attend the bid opening. No bid in an amount less than the fair market  value, as herein defined, shall be considered.  [42 FR 46302, Sept. 15, 1977, as amended at 61 FR 28508, June 5, 1996]</p>
