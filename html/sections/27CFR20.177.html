The total surface (including the opening) of the actual  container of the spirits must be enclosed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When specially denatured spirits are packaged in unlabeled  containers, the dealer shall apply the required marks to an exposed  surface of the case. The case shall be constructed so that the portion  bearing the marks will remain securely attached to the encased container  until all the spirits have been removed. A statement reading ``Do not  remove inner container until emptied,'' or of similar meaning, shall be  placed on the portion of the case bearing the marks.  (Sec. 201, Pub.
