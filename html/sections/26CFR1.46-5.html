                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Effective date. This section applies to taxable years ending after December 31, 1974. This section reflects amendments to the Internal Revenue Code made only by the Tax Reduction Act of 1975, the Tax Reform Act of 1976, and the Revenue Act of 1978.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General rule. Under section 46(d), a taxpayer may elect to take the investment credit for qualified progress expenditures (as defined in paragraph (g) of this section). In general, qualified progress expenditures are amounts paid (paid or incurred in the case of self-constructed property) for construction of progress expenditure property. The taxpayer must reasonably estimate that the property will take at least 2 years to construct and that the useful life of the property will be 7 years or more. Qualified progress expenditures may not be taken into account if made before the later of January 22, 1975, or the first taxable year to which an election under section 46(d) applies. In general, qualified progress expenditures are not allowed for the year property is placed in service, nor for the first year or any subsequent year recapture is required under section 47(a)(3). There is a percentage limitation on qualified progress expenditures for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1980. For a special rule relating to transfers of progress expenditure property, see paragraph (r) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reduction of qualified investment. Under section 46(c)(4), a taxpayer must reduce qualified investment for the year property is placed in service by qualified progress expenditures taken into account by that person or a predecessor. A ``predecessor'' of a taxpayer is a person whose election under section 46(d) carries over to the taxpayer under paragraph (o)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Progress expenditure property. Progress expenditure property is property constructed by or for the taxpayer, with a normal construction period of 2 years or more. The taxpayer must reasonably believe that the property will be new section 38 property with a useful life of 7 years or more when placed in service. Whether property is progress expenditure property is determined on the basis of facts know at the close of the taxable year of the taxpayer in which construction begins (or, if later, at the close of the first taxable year to which an election under section 46(d) applies). For purposes of this paragraph (d), property is

constructed by or for the taxpayer only if it is built or manufactured from materials and component parts. Accordingly, progress expenditure property does not include property such as orchards, vineyards, livestock, or motion picture films or videotapes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Normal construction period--(1) In general. (i) The normal construction period is the period the taxpayer reasonably expects will be required to construct the property. The period begins on the date physical work on construction of the property commences and ends on the date the property is available to be placed in service. The normal construction period does not include, however, construction before January 22, 1975, nor construction before the first day of the first taxable year for which an election under section 46(d) is in effect. Physical work on construction of property does not include preliminary activities such as planning, designing, preparing blueprints, exploring, or securing financing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. (i) The normal construction period is the period the taxpayer reasonably expects will be required to construct the property. The period begins on the date physical work on construction of the property commences and ends on the date the property is available to be placed in service. The normal construction period does not include, however, construction before January 22, 1975, nor construction before the first day of the first taxable year for which an election under section 46(d) is in effect. Physical work on construction of property does not include preliminary activities such as planning, designing, preparing blueprints, exploring, or securing financing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The normal construction period is the period the taxpayer reasonably expects will be required to construct the property. The period begins on the date physical work on construction of the property commences and ends on the date the property is available to be placed in service. The normal construction period does not include, however, construction before January 22, 1975, nor construction before the first day of the first taxable year for which an election under section 46(d) is in effect. Physical work on construction of property does not include preliminary activities such as planning, designing, preparing blueprints, exploring, or securing financing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The determination of the time when physical work on construction commences is based on the facts and circumstances of each case. Physical work on construction of property may include the physical work done by a subcontractor on a component specifically designated as part of the property. Also, the commencement of physical work on construction may occur at a site different from the main site of construction of the property. For example, if a shipyard orders a turbine before it begins work on building a ship, the normal construction period of the ship is measured from the time the subcontractor commences physical work on construction of the turbine (if it is normal for such work to precede the work of the main contractor).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Generally, physical work on construction does not include physical activity that is not necessary to complete construction of the property, nor does it include physical work on construction of a building or other property that will not be new section 38 property when placed in service. Physical work on construction also does not include research and development activities in a laboratory or experimental setting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The normal construction period of property ends on the date it is expected the property will be available to be placed in service. Property is considered available to be placed in service when construction is completed and the property is available for delivery to the site of its assigned function. It is not necessary that property be in a state of readiness for a specifically assigned function. Nor is it necessary that it actually be delivered to the site of its assigned function.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Estimates. Taxpayers should refer to normal industry practice in estimating the normal construction period of particular items. A different period may be used if special circumstances exist making it impractical to make the estimate on the basis of normal industry practice. The estimate must be based on information available at the close of the taxable year in which physical work on construction of the property begins, or, if later, at the close of the first taxable year for which an election under section 46(d) is in effect for the taxpayer. If the estimate is reasonable when made, the actual time it takes to complete the work is, in general, irrelevant in determining whether property is progress expenditure property. However, if there is a significant error in estimating the normal construction period, it may be evidence that the estimate was unreasonable when made. For taxable years ending after April 1, 1988, a taxpayer not relying or normal industry practice to estimate the normal construction period of particular property must attach to the tax return for the taxable year in which physical work on construction of the property begins (or, if later, the first taxable year for which an election under section 46(d) is in effect) a statement of the basis relied upon in estimating the normal construction period of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Integrated unit. (i) In determining whether property has a normal construction period of 2 years or more, property that will be placed in service separately is to be considered separately. For example, if two ships are contracted for at the same time, each ship is considered separately under this paragraph. However, for property that

will be placed in service as an integrated unit, the taxpayer must determine the normal construction period of the integrated unit. If the normal construction period of the integrated unit is 2 years or more, the normal construction period of each item of new section 38 property that is a part of the integrated unit is considered to be 2 years or more. Thus, the normal construction period of an integrated unit may be 2 years or more even if no part of the unit has a normal construction period of 2 years or more.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In determining whether property has a normal construction period of 2 years or more, property that will be placed in service separately is to be considered separately. For example, if two ships are contracted for at the same time, each ship is considered separately under this paragraph. However, for property that

will be placed in service as an integrated unit, the taxpayer must determine the normal construction period of the integrated unit. If the normal construction period of the integrated unit is 2 years or more, the normal construction period of each item of new section 38 property that is a part of the integrated unit is considered to be 2 years or more. Thus, the normal construction period of an integrated unit may be 2 years or more even if no part of the unit has a normal construction period of 2 years or more.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Property is part of an integrated unit only if the operation of that item is essential to the performance of the function to which the unit is assigned. Property essential to the performance of the function to which the unit is assigned includes property the use of which is significantly connected to that function and which effects the safe, proper, or efficient performance of the unit. Generally, property must be placed in service at the same time to be considered part of the same integrated unit. Properties are not an integrated unit, however, solely because they are to be placed in service at the same time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The normal construction period for an integrated unit begins on the date the normal construction period of the first item of new section 38 property that is part of the unit begins. It is not necessary that physical work commence at the main construction site of the integrated unit.
The period ends on the date the last item of new section 38 property that is part of that unit is available to be placed in service. Property that is not new section 38 property, such as a building, is not considered part of an integrated unit for purposes of determining the normal construction period of that unit. For example, if a manufacturing plant has a normal construction period of two years or more but the equipment (i.e., new section 38 property) to be installed in the plant has a normal construction period of less than two years, the plant and the equipment do not constitute an integrated unit with a construction period of two years or more and the equipment is not progress expenditure property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On July 1, 1974, corporation X begins physical work on construction of a machine with an estimated useful life when placed in service of more than 7 years. For its taxable year ending June 30, 1975, X makes an election under section 46(d). For purposes of determining on June 30, 1975, whether the machine is ``progress expenditure property'', the normal construction period is treated as having begun on January 22, 1975. Thus, the machine will be considered to be progress expenditure property on June 30, 1975, only if the estimated time required to complete construction after June 30 is at least 18 months and 22 days (i.e., 2 years less the period January 22, 1975, through June 30, 1975).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation X constructs a pipeline in two sections and simultaneously begins physical work on construction of each section on January 1, 1976. One section extends from city M to city N. The other extends from city N to city O. Oil will be transferred to storage tanks at both city N and city O. Corporation X also begins construction on January 1, 1976, of a pumping station necessary to the operation of the pipeline from city M to city N. Construction of a pumping station necessary to the operation of the pipeline from city N to city O begins on June 30, 1977. For 1976, corporation X makes an election under section 46(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The section of pipeline from city M to city N and the associated pumping station will be available to be placed in service on January 1, 1977. Construction of the section of the pipeline from city N to city O will be completed on June 30, 1977. However, that section of the pipeline will not be available to be placed in service until completion of the associated pumping station on January 1, 1978.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The section of pipeline from city M to city N and the section from city N to city O must be considered separately in determining the normal construction period of the property. Each section will be placed in service separately. However, each section of the pipeline and the associated pumping station may be considered an integrated unit. The pumping stations are essential to the operation of each section of pipeline. Each section of pipeline and the associated pumping station are placed in service at the same time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The section of pipeline from city M to city N and the associated pumping station are not progress expenditure property, because the normal construction period of that unit is only 1 year (January 1, 1976 to January 1, 1977).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The section of pipeline from city N to city O and the associated pumping station are progress expenditure property, because

the normal construction of that integrated unit is 2 years (January 1, 1976 to January 1, 1978). It is immaterial that neither the construction period of that section of pipeline (January 1, 1976 to June 30, 1977) nor the construction period of the associated pumping station (June 30, 1977 to January 1, 1978) is 2 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Assume the pumping station associated with the pipeline from city N to city O includes backup pumping equipment that will be used only if the primary pumping equipment fails. The backup equipment is part of the integrated unit because it serves to effect the safe or efficient performance of the unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> New section 38 property with a 7-year useful life--(1) In general. The taxpayer must determine if property will be new section 38 property with a useful life of 7 years or more when placed in service. The determination must be made at the close of the taxable year in which construction begins or, if later, at the close of the first taxable year to which an election under section 46(d) applies for the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The taxpayer must determine if property will be new section 38 property with a useful life of 7 years or more when placed in service. The determination must be made at the close of the taxable year in which construction begins or, if later, at the close of the first taxable year to which an election under section 46(d) applies for the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination based on reasonably expected use. The determination of whether property will be ``new section 38 property'' (within the meaning of Sec. Sec.  1.48-1 and 1.48-2 when placed in service must be based on the reasonably expected use of the property by the taxpayer. There is a presumption that property will be new section 38 property if it would be new section 38 property if placed in service by the taxpayer when the determination is made. For example, in determining if property is an integral part of manufacturing under section 48(a)(1)(B)(i), it will be presumed that property will be new section 38 property if the taxpayer is engaged in manufacturing when the determination is made. Also, significant steps taken to establish a trade or business will be evidence the taxpayer will be engaged in that trade or business when the property is placed in service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Estimated useful life. The determination of whether property will have an estimated useful life of 7 years or more when placed in service must be made by applying the principles of Sec.  1.46-3(e). If the estimated useful life is less than 7 years when the property is actually placed in service, the credit previously allowed under section 46(d) must be recomputed under section 47(a)(3)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Definition of qualified progress expenditures--(1) In general. A taxpayer's qualified progress expenditures are the sum of qualified progress expenditures for self-constructed property (determined under paragraph (h) of this section), plus qualified progress expenditures for non-self-constructed property (determined under paragraph (j) of this section). Only amounts includible under Sec.  1.46-3(c) in the basis of new section 38 property may be considered as qualified progress expenditures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A taxpayer's qualified progress expenditures are the sum of qualified progress expenditures for self-constructed property (determined under paragraph (h) of this section), plus qualified progress expenditures for non-self-constructed property (determined under paragraph (j) of this section). Only amounts includible under Sec.  1.46-3(c) in the basis of new section 38 property may be considered as qualified progress expenditures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Excluded amounts. Qualified progress expenditures do not include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of non-self-constructed property, amounts incurred (whether or not paid)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Before the normal construction period begins, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Before the later of January 22, 1975, or the first day of the first taxable year for which an election under section 46(d) applies for the taxpayer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of self-constructed property, amounts chargeable to capital account--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Before the normal construction period begins, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Before the later of January 22, 1975, or the first day of the first taxable year for which an election under section 46(d) applies for the taxpayer,

Qualified progress expenditures for self-constructed property (as defined in

paragraph (k) of this section) are amounts properly chargeable to capital account in connection with that property. In general, amounts paid or incurred are chargeable to capital account if under the taxpayer's method of accounting they are properly includible in computing basis under Sec.  1.46-3. Qualified progress expenditures for self-constructed property include both direct costs (e.g., labor, material, parts) and indirect costs (e.g., overhead, insurance) associated with construction of property to the extent those costs are properly chargeable to capital account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

If an item of property is self-constructed because more than half of the construction expenditures are made directly by the taxpayer, then any expenditures (whether or not made directly by the taxpayer) for construction of that item of property are not subject to the limitations of section 46(d)(3)(B) and paragraph (j) of this section (relating to actual payment and progress in construction).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Time when amounts paid or incurred are properly chargeable to capital account. (i) In general, expenditures for component parts and materials to be used in construction of self-constructed property are not properly chargeable to capital account until consumed or physically attached in the construction process. Component parts and materials that have been neither consumed nor physically attached in the construction process, but which have been irrevocably allocated to construction of that property are properly chargeable to capital account. Component parts and materials designed specifically for the self-constructed property may be considered irrevocably allocated to construction of that property at the time of manufacture of the component parts and materials. Component parts and materials not designed specifically for the property may be considered irrevocably allocated to construction at the time of delivery to the construction site if they would be economically impractical to remove. For example, pumps delivered to sites of construction of a tundra pipeline may be treated as irrevocably allocated to that pipeline on the date of delivery, even if they would be usable, but for their location on the tundra, in connection with other property. Component parts and materials are not to be considered irrevocably allocated to use in self-constructed property until physical work on construction of that property has begun (as determined under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section). Mere bookkeeping notations are not sufficient evidence that the necessary allocation has been made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general, expenditures for component parts and materials to be used in construction of self-constructed property are not properly chargeable to capital account until consumed or physically attached in the construction process.

Under section 446(e), the method of accounting, once adopted, may not be changed without consent of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Records requirement. The taxpayer shall maintain detailed records which permit specific identification of the amounts properly chargeable by the taxpayer during each taxable year to capital account for each item of self-constructed property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Qualified progress expenditures for non-self-constructed property--(1) In general. Qualified progress expenditures for non-self-constructed property (as defined in paragraph (l) of this section) are amounts actually paid by the taxpayer to another person for construction of the property, but only to the extent progress is made in construction. For example, such expenditures may include payments to the manufacturer of an item of progress expenditure property, payments to a contractor building progress expenditure property, or payments for engineering designs or blueprints that are drawn up during the normal construction period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Qualified progress expenditures for non-self-constructed property (as defined in paragraph (l) of this section) are amounts actually paid by the taxpayer to another person for construction of the property, but only to the extent progress is made in construction. For example, such expenditures may include payments to the manufacturer of an item of progress expenditure property, payments to a contractor building progress expenditure property, or payments for engineering designs or blueprints that are drawn up during the normal construction period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Property partially self-constructed. If an item of property is non-self-constructed, but a taxpayer uses its own employees to construct a portion of the property, expenditures for construction of that portion are made directly by the taxpayer (see Sec.  1.46-5(h)(1)). Subject to the limitations of paragraph (g) of this section, those expenditures are qualified progress expenditures for non-self-constructed property if they satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (j) (4), (5), and (6) of this section. Wages

actually paid to the taxpayer's employees are presumed to correspond to progress in construction. Other amounts, including expenditures for materials, parts, and overhead, must be actually paid, not borrowed from the payee, and attributable to progress made in construction by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Property constructed by more than one person. The percentage of completion limitation (as prescribed in paragraph (j)(6) of this section), including the presumption of ratable progress in construction, applies to an item of progress expenditure property as a whole. However, if several manufacturers or contractors do work in connection with the same property, the progress that each person makes toward completion of construction of the property must be determined separately. Section 46(d)(3)(B) is then applied separately to amounts paid to each manufacturer or contractor based on each person's progress in construction. For example, assume the taxpayer contracts with three persons to build an item of equipment. The taxpayer contracts with A to build the frame, B to build the motor, and C to assemble the frame and motor. Assume each contract represents 33\1/3\ percent of the construction costs of the property. If, within the taxable year in which construction begins, A and B each complete 50 percent of the construction of the frame and motor, respectively, amounts paid to A during that taxable year not in excess of 16\2/3\ percent of the overall cost of the property, and amounts paid to B during that taxable year not in excess of 16\2/3\ percent of the overall cost of the property, are qualified progress expenditures. Section 46(d)(3)(B) does not apply, however, to persons, such as lower-tier subcontractors, that do not have a direct contractual relationship with the taxpayer. If, in the above example, A engages a subcontractor to construct part of the frame, section 46(d)(3)(B) is applied only to amounts paid by the taxpayer to A, B, and C, but the portion of construction completed by A during a taxable year includes the portion completed by A's subcontractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Requirement of actual payment. Qualified progress expenditures for non-self-constructed property must be actually paid and not merely incurred. Amounts paid during the taxable year to another person for construction of non-self-constructed property may be in the form of money or property (e.g., materials). However, property given as payment may be considered only to the extent it will be includible under Sec.  1.46-3(c) in the basis of the non-self-constructed property when it is placed in service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Certain borrowing disregarded. Qualified progress expenditures for non-self-constructed property do not include any amount paid to another person (the ``payee'') for construction if the amount is paid out of funds borrowed directly or indirectly from the payee. Amounts borrowed directly or indirectly from the payee by any person that is related to the taxpayer (within the meaning of section 267) or that is a member of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in section 1563(a)) will be considered borrowed indirectly from the payee. Similarly, amounts borrowed under any financing arrangement that has the effect of making the payee a surety will be considered amounts borrowed indirectly by the taxpayer from the payee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Percentage of completion limitation. (i) Under section 46(d)(3)(B)(ii), payments made in any taxable year may be considered qualified progress expenditures for non-self-constructed property only to the extent they are attributable to progress made in construction (percentage of completion limitation). Progress will generally be measured in terms of the manufacturer's incurred cost, as a fraction of the anticipated cost (as adjusted from year to year). Architectural or engineering estimates will be evidence of progress made in construction. Cost accounting records also will be evidence of progress. Progress will be presumed to occur not more rapidly than ratably over the normal construction period. However, the taxpayer may rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence of a greater percentage of completion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under section 46(d)(3)(B)(ii), payments made in any taxable year may be considered qualified progress expenditures for non-self-constructed property only to the extent they are attributable to progress made in construction (percentage of completion limitation).

the taxpayer must recompute the percentage of completion limitation on the basis of revised cost. However, the recomputation will affect only amounts allowed as qualified progress expenditures in the taxable year in which the change occurs and in subsequent taxable years. The recomputation remains subject to the presumption of pro rata completion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If, for any taxable year, the amount paid to another person for construction of an item of property under section 46(d)(3)(B)(i) exceeds the percentage of completion limitation in section 46(d)(3)(B)(ii), the excess is treated as an amount paid to the other person for construction for the succeeding taxable year. If for any taxable year the percentage of completion limitation for an item of property exceeds the amount paid to another during the taxable year for construction, the excess is added to the percentage of completion limitation for that property for the succeeding taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The taxpayer must maintain detailed records which permit specific identification of the amounts paid to each person for construction of each item of property and the percentage of construction completed by each person for each taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Example. The following example illustrates paragraph (j)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation X agrees to build an airplane for corporation Y, a calendar year taxpayer. The airplane is non-self-constructed progress expenditure property. Physical work on construction begins on January 1, 1980. The normal construction period for the airplane is five years and the airplane is delivered and placed in service on December 31, 1984.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The cost of construction to corporation X is $500,000. The contract price is $550,000. Corporation Y makes a $110,000 payment in each of the years 1980 and 1981, an $85,000 payment in 1982, a $135,000 payment in 1983, and a $110,000 payment in 1984.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For 1980, corporation Y makes an election under section 46(d). Progress is presumed to occur ratably over the 5-year construction period, which is 20 percent in each year. Twenty percent of the contract price is $110,000. The percentage of completion limitation for each year, thus, is $110,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For each of the years 1980 and 1981, the $110,000 payments may be treated as qualified progress expenditures. The payments equal the percentage of completion limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For 1982, the $85,000 payment may be treated as a qualified progress expenditure, because it is less than the percentage of completion limitation. The excess of the percentage of completion limitation ($110,000) over the 1982 payment ($85,000) is added to the percentage of completion limitation for 1983. One hundred and ten thousand dollars minus $85,000 equals $25,000. Twenty-five thousand dollars plus $110,000 equals $135,000, which is the percentage of completion limitation for 1983.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> For 1983, the entire $135,000 payment may be treated as a qualified progress expenditure. The payment equals the percentage of completion limitation for 1983.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> For 1984, no qualified progress expenditures may be taken into account, because the airplane is placed in service in that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> See example 2 of paragraph (r)(4) of this section for the result if Y sells its contract rights to the property on December 31, 1982.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Definition of self-constructed property--(1) In general. Property is self-constructed property if it is reasonable to believe that more than half of the construction expenditures for the property will be made directly by the taxpayer. Construction expenditures made directly by the taxpayer include direct costs such as wages and materials and indirect costs such as overhead attributable to construction of the property. Expenditures for direct and indirect costs of construction will be treated as construction expenditures made directly by the taxpayer only to the extent that the expenditures directly benefit the construction of the property by employees of the taxpayer. Thus, wages paid to taxpayers's employees and expenditures for basic construction materials, such as sheet metal, lumber, glass, and nails, which are used by employees of the taxpayer to construct progress expenditure property, will be considered made directly by the taxpayer. Construction expenditures made by the taxpayer to a contractor or manufacturer, in general, will not be considered made directly by the taxpayer. Thus, the cost of component parts, such as boilers and turbines, which are purchased and merely installed or assembled by the taxpayer, will not be considered expenditures made directly by the taxpayer for construction. (See paragraph (h)(3) of this section to determine when such cost is

properly chargeable to capital account.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

(See paragraph (h)(3) of this section to determine when such cost is

The determination of whether property is self-constructed is to be made at the close of the taxable year in which physical work on construction of the property begins, or, if later, the close of the first taxable year to which an election under this section applies. Once it is reasonably estimated that more than half of construction expenditures will be made directly by the taxpayer, the fact the taxpayer actually makes half, or less than half, of the expenditures directly will not affect classification of the property as self-constructed property. Similarly, once a determination has been made, classification of property as self-constructed property is not affected by a change in circumstances in a later taxable year. However, a significant error unrelated to a change in circumstances may be evidence that the estimate was unreasonable when made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determination based on certain expenditures. For purposes of determining whether more than half of the expenditures for construction of an item of property will be made directly by the taxpayer, the taxpayer may take into account only expenditures properly includable by the taxpayer in the basis of the property under the provisions of Sec.  1.46-3(c). Thus, property is self-constructed property only if more than half of the estimated basis of the property to be used for purposes of determining the credit allowed by section 38 is attributable to expenditures made directly by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Definition of non-self-constructed property. Non-self-constructed property is property that is not self-constructed property. Thus, property is non-self-constructed property if it is reasonable to believe that only half, or less than half, of the expenditures for construction will be made directly by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Alternative limitations for public utility, railroad, or airline property. The alternative limitations on qualified investment under section 46(a) (7) and (8) for public utility, railroad, or airline property (whichever applies) apply in determining the credit for qualified progress expenditures. The determination of whether progress expenditure property will be public utility, railroad, or airline property (whichever applies) when placed in service must be made at the close of the taxable year in which physical work on construction begins or, if later, at the close of the first taxable year for which an election under section 46(d) is in effect. If, at that time, the taxpayer is in a trade or business as a public utility, railroad, or airline (as described in section 46(c)(3)(B) and 46(a)(8) (D) and (E), respectively), it is evidence the property will be public utility, railroad, or airline property when placed in service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Leased property. A lessor of progress expenditure property may not elect under section 48(d) to treat a lessee (or a person who will be a lessee) as having made qualified progress expenditures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Election--(1) In general. The election under section 46(d)(6) to increase qualified investment by qualified progress expenditures may be made for any taxable year ending after December 31, 1974. Except as provided in paragraph (o)(2) of this section, the election is effective for the first taxable year for which it is made and for all taxable years thereafter unless it is revoked with the consent of the Commissioner. Except as provided in paragraphs (o) (2) and (3) of this section, the election applies to all qualified progress expenditures made by the taypayer during the taxable year for construction of any progress expenditure property. Thus, the taxpayer may not make the election for one item of progress expenditure property and not for other items. If progress expenditure property is being constructed by or for a partnership, S corporation (as defined in section 1361(a)), trust, or estate, an election under section 46(d)(6) must be made separately by each partner or shareholder, or each beneficiary if the beneficiary, in determining his tax liability, would be allowed investment credit under section 38 for property subject to the election. The election may not be made by a partnership or S corporation, and may be made by a trust or estate only if the trust or estate, in determining its tax liability, would be allowed investment credit under section 38 for property subject to

the election. The election of any partner, shareholder, beneficiary, trust, or estate will be effective for that person, even if a related partner, shareholder, beneficiary, trust, or estate does not make the election. An election made by a partner, shareholder, beneficiary, trust, or estate applies to all progress expenditure property of that person.

For example, an election made by corporation X, which is a partner in the XYZ partnership, applies to progress expenditure property the corporation holds in its own capacity and also to its interest in progress expenditure property of the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Time and manner of making election. An election under section 46(d)(6) must be made on Form 3468 and filed with the original income tax return for the first taxable year ending after December 31, 1974 to which the election will apply. An election made before March 2, 1988, by filing a written statement (whether or not attached to the income tax return) will be considered valid. The election may not be made on an amended return filed after the time prescribed for filing the original return (including extensions) for that taxable year. However, an election under this section may be made or revoked by filing a statement with an amended return filed on or before May 31, 1988, if the due date for filing a return for the first taxable year to which the election applies is before May 31, 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Carryover of election in certain transactions. In general, and election under section 46(d)(6) does not carry over to the transferee of progress expenditure property (or an interest therein). However, if under section 47(b) the property does not cease to be progress expenditure property because of the transfer, the election will carry over to the transferee. If so, the election will apply only to the property transferred. For rules relating to the determination of qualified progress expenditures of the transferee, see paragraph (r) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> Partnerships, S corporations, trusts, or estates--(1) In general. Each partner, shareholder, trust, estate, or beneficiary of a trust or estate that makes an election under section 46(d) shall take into account its share of qualified progress expenditures (determined under paragraph (p)(2) of this section) made by the partnership, S corporation, trust, or estate. In determining qualified investment for the year in which the property is placed in service, the basis of the property is apportioned as provided in Sec. Sec.  1.46-3(f), 1.48-6, or 1.48-5 (whichever applies).

Once the status of the property as self-constructed or non-self-constructed property in the hands of the transferee has been determined, all rules under this section for determining the amount of qualified progress expenditures for that type of property apply. For example, if the property is non-self-constructed in the hands of the transferee, amounts merely incurred (but not paid) for the transfer are not taken into account as qualified progress expenditures. Actual payment is necessary (see paragraph (j)(3) of this section). In applying section 46(d)(3)(B)(ii), the amount paid or incurred for the transfer (to the extent that it qualifies as a payment for construction under the first sentence of this paragraph (r)(3)(ii)) is considered to be part of the overall cost to the transferee of construction by another person, and the portion of construction which is completed during the taxable year is determined by taking into account construction that was completed before the constructed property was acquired by the transferee. If the transferee makes an election under section 46(d) and this section for the taxable year in which the transfer occurs, then

for purposes of applying the presumption in section 46(d)(4)(D) that construction is deemed to occur not more rapidly than ratably over the normal construction period, the transferee's normal construction period is considered to have begun on the date on which physical work on construction of the acquired property began.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (r).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Corporation X begins physical work on construction of progress expenditure property for corporation Y on January 1, 1976. Y accurately estimates a 3-year normal construction period and elects under section 46(d) on its return for its taxable year ending December 31, 1976. On January 1, 1978, Y sells the contract rights for construction of the property to corporation Z, which uses a fiscal year ending June 30. Qualified progress expenditures allowed to Y in 1976 and 1977 are subject to recapture under section 47(a)(3). Because Z's normal construction period for the property is less than 2 years (January 1, 1978 to January 1, 1979), the property is not progress expenditure property in Z's hands. Z may not elect progress expenditure treatment for the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assume the same facts as in the example in paragraph (j)(7) of this section, except, on December 31, 1982, Y sells its contract rights to the property for $340,000 to corporation Z, which also uses the calendar year. Z pays Y the full $340,000 on that date. The property is still to be placed in service on December 31, 1984, and will not be available for placing in service at an earlier date.

Since the remaining construction period is two years, the property is progress expenditure property if it otherwise qualifies in Z's hands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Only $305,000 of the $340,000 payment to Y can qualify as a qualified progress expenditure, because only that amount is attributable to construction costs paid by Y and does not exceed the sum of the amount by which Y increased qualified investment in 1980 and 1981 for qualified progress expenditures ($220,000) and the amount that Y would have treated as a qualified progress expenditure in 1982 ($85,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Assume that Z cannot establish that progress in construction has been completed more rapidly than ratably. If Z makes an election under section 46(d) for 1982, then for purposes of applying the percentage of completion limitation, Z's normal construction period is considered to begin on January 1, 1980. Progress is presumed to occur ratably over the 5-year construction period, which is 20 percent in each year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> For 1982, Z may treat the full $305,000 as a qualified progress expenditure because it is less than the percentage of completion limitation, $330,000 ($110,000 a year for 1980, 1981, and 1982).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> For 1983, Z may treat the entire $135,000 payment as a qualified progress expenditure, since it does not exceed the percentage of completion limitation for that year, $135,000 ($110,000 plus the $25,000 excess from 1982).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> For Z's taxable year ending December 31, 1984, no qualified progress expenditures may be taken into account because the property is placed in service during that year.
