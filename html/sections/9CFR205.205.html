                            <p class="depth0">The Section provides at subsection (c)(4)(G) for a fee for filing an EFS. The fee can be set in any manner provided by the law of the State in which such EFS is filed. The basis for this is that (c)(4)(G) provides for the fee to be set by the ``Secretary of State'' but (c)(11) defines the latter term to include ``designee of the State.'' The fee structure is discretionary with the State.
