debtor requesting settlement will be shown at the top of Form RD 1956-1 followed by name and status of the other debtor. For example, ``John Doe, joint debtor with Jane Doe, deceased.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Joint debtors must be advised in writing that all debtors will remain liable for the balance of the debt until any payment(s) due under the joint offer have been made.</p>
