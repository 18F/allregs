However, since MPP-Dairy is first being made available after potential applicants may have already applied for 2014 or 2015 coverage under LGM-Dairy, for the annual election period for MPP-Dairy established for the 2014 and 2015 calendar year coverage only, a producer with coverage under LGM-Dairy that wishes to participate through their dairy operation in MPP-Dairy, is required to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Register the dairy operation to participate in MPP-Dairy during the annual election period established for calendar year 2014 and 2015, as established by the Deputy Administrator;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Agree not to extend or obtain new LGM-Dairy coverage;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Acknowledge in writing at the time of registration that no MPP-Dairy payment will be made to the dairy operation for any month included in any period for which any producer in the dairy operation has LGM-Dairy coverage; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Pay applicable administrative fees in the same manner as other participating dairy operations by paying fees and premiums that may be prorated by the Deputy Administrator to reflect the limited period of coverage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Margin protection coverage under MPP-Dairy will not become effective until after the target month of marketings under LGM-Dairy has ended by natural expiration of the LGM-Dairy agreement or by an RMA-allowed cancellation. Any applicable premium for the participating dairy operation will be prorated based on the remaining months of the applicable calendar year of coverage following the month the LGM-Dairy target month has ended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> MPP-Dairy payment may only trigger after the target month of marketings under LGM-Dairy has ended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A participating dairy operation will be required to provide proof, to the satisfaction of FSA, of the cancellation or expiration of the LGM-Dairy policy based on the final month of target marketings under the LGM-Dairy policy.</p>
