                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Types of agreements requiring assurances. With respect to any  manufacturing license agreement or technical assistance agreement which  relates to significant military equipment or classified defense  articles, including classified technical data, a Nontransfer and Use  Certificate (Form DSP-83) (see Sec. 123.10 of this subchapter) signed  by the applicant and the foreign party must be submitted to the  Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. With respect to all agreements  involving classified articles, including classified technical data, an  authorized representative of the foreign government must sign the DSP-83  (or provide the same assurances in the form of a diplomatic note),  unless the Directorate of   Defense Trade Controls has granted an exception to this requirement. The  Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may require that a DSP-83 be  provided in conjunction with an agreement that does not relate to  significant military equipment or classified defense articles. The  Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may also require with respect to  any agreement that an appropriate authority of the foreign party's  government also sign the DSP-83 (or provide the same assurances in the  form of a diplomatic note).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Timing of submission of assurances. Submission of a Form DSP-83  and/or diplomatic note must occur as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Agreements which have been signed by all parties before being  submitted to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may only be  submitted along with any required DSP-83 and/or diplomatic note.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an agreement has not been signed by all parties before being  submitted, the required DSP-83 and/or diplomatic note must be submitted  along with the signed agreement.</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (b): In no case may a transfer occur before a  required DSP-83 and/or diplomatic note has been submitted to the  Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.
