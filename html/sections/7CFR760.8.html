                            <p class="depth0">The affected farmer or his legal representative, as provided in Sec. Sec. 760.25 and 760.29, must sign and file an application for payment on a form which is approved for that purpose by the Deputy Administrator. The form must be filed with the county FSA office for the county where the farm headquarters are located no later than December 31 following the end of the fiscal year in which the loss occurred, or such later date as the Deputy Administrator may specify. The application for payment shall cover application periods of at least 28 days, except that, if the entire application period, or the last application period, is shorter than 28 days, applications for payment may be filed for such shorter period. The application for payment shall be accompanied by the information required by Sec. 760.6 as well as any other information which will enable the county committee to determine whether the making of an indemnity payment is precluded for any of the reasons set forth in Sec. 760.7. Such information shall be submitted on forms approved for the purpose by the Deputy Administrator.
