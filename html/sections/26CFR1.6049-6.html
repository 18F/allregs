                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement of furnishing statement to recipient. Every person filing a Form 1099 under section 6049(a) and Sec. 1.6049-4(e) shall furnish to the person whose identifying number is required to be shown on the form a written statement showing the information required by paragraph (b) of this section. With respect to interest other than interest reported on a transactional basis under Sec. 1.6049-4(e), no statement is required to be furnished under section 6049(c) and this section if the aggregate of the payments for the calendar year is less than $10, unless such payment is subject to the tax imposed under section 3406. In the case of any payment that is subject to withholding under section 3406, a statement shall be furnished irrespective of the amount of the payment. With respect to payments which are reported on a transactional basis, no statement is required to be furnished under section 6049(c) and this section to a person if the payment of interest to (or received on behalf of) such person for the transaction is less than $10 unless the payment is subject to withholding under section 3406. Again, in the case of any payment that is subject to withholding under section 3406, a statement shall be furnished irrespective of the amount of the payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form of statement. The written statement required to be furnished to a person under paragraph (a) of this section shall show the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With respect to payments of interest (other than original issue discount) to any person during a calendar year, the statement shall show:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The aggregate amount of payments shown on Form 1099 as having been made to (or received on behalf of) such person;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of tax withheld under section 3406, if any;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The name and address of the person filing the form; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A legend stating that such amount is being reported to the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With respect to original issue discount includible in the gross income of

a holder of an obligation during a calendar year, the statement shall show:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The aggregate amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income by (or on behalf of) such person for the calendar year with respect to the obligation (determined by applying the rules of paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.6049-4);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of tax withheld under section 3406, if any;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The account, serial, or other identifying number of each obligation with respect to which a return is being made;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> All other items shown on Form 1099 for such calendar year; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A legend stating that such amount and such items are being reported to the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> With respect to both statements to persons receiving payments of interest and persons holding obligations, the statement shall include the name, address, and taxpayer identifying number of such person. An IRS truncated taxpayer identifying number (TTIN) may be used as the identifying number for the person. For provisions relating to the use of TTINs, see Sec. 301.6109-4 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time for furnishing statements. Each statement required by this section to be furnished to any person for a calendar year with respect to a payment of interest (other than interest where a middleman or a Federal agency makes a return on a transactional basis (as described in paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.6049-4)) shall be furnished to such person after April 30 of the year of payment and on or before January 31 of the following year, but no statement may be furnished before the final interest payment for the calendar year. If a middleman or a Federal agency makes a return on a transactional basis, the statement shall be furnished at, or any time subsequent to, the time of payment, but in no event later than January 31 of the year following the calendar year of payment. However, for a statement required to be furnished after December 31, 2008, the February 15 due date under section 6045 applies to the statement if the statement is furnished in a consolidated reporting statement under section 6045. See Sec. Sec. 1.6045-1(k)(3), 1.6045-2(d)(2), 1.6045-3(e)(2), 1.6045-4(m)(3), and 1.6045-5(a)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special rule. The requirements of this section for the furnishing of a statement to any person, including the legend requirement of paragraph (b)(1)(iv) and (2)(v) of this section, may be met by the furnishing to such person a copy of the Form 1099 filed pursuant to Sec. 1.6049-4, or an acceptable substitute, in respect of such person. However, in the case of Form 1099 with respect to original issue discount on obligations subject to section 1232A, a copy of the instructions must also be sent to such person. A statement shall be considered to be furnished to a person within the meaning of this section if it is mailed to such person at his last known address.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Statements to recipients--(1) Requirement. A person required to make an information return under section 6049(a) and Sec. 1.6049-4 must furnish a statement to each recipient whose identifying number is required to be shown on the related information return for interest or original issue discount paid or accrued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requirement. A person required to make an information return under section 6049(a) and Sec. 1.6049-4 must furnish a statement to each recipient whose identifying number is required to be shown on the related information return for interest or original issue discount paid or accrued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Form, manner, and time for providing statements to recipients. The statement required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section must be either the official Form 1099 prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service for the respective calendar year or an acceptable substitute statement. The rules under Sec. 1.6042-4 (relating to statements with respect to dividends) apply comparably in determining the form of an acceptable substitute statement permitted by this paragraph (e). Those rules also apply for purposes of determining the manner of and time for providing the Form 1099 or its acceptable substitute to a recipient under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. However, with respect to original issue discount, the Form 1099 or acceptable substitute statement required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section must show the aggregate amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income by the recipient for the calendar year with respect to the obligation (determined by applying the rules of Sec. 1.6049-4(b)(2)), and the amount, serial number, or other identifying number of each obligation with

respect to which a return is being made. With respect to interest or original issue discount, the Form 1099 or acceptable substitute statement required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section must be furnished to the recipient on or before January 31 of the year following the calendar year for which the return under section 6049(a)(1) was required to be made. However, for a statement required to be furnished after December 31, 2008, the February 15 due date under section 6045 applies to the statement if the statement is furnished in a consolidated reporting statement under section 6045. See Sec. Sec. 1.6045-1(k)(3), 1.6045-2(d)(2), 1.6045-3(e)(2), 1.6045-4(m)(3), and 1.6045-5(a)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cross-reference to penalty. For provisions relating to the penalty provided for failure to furnish timely a correct payee statement required under section 6049(c) and Sec. 1.6049-6(a), see Sec. 301.6722-1 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations). See Sec. 301.6724-1 of this chapter for the waiver of a penalty if the failure is due to reasonable cause and is not due to willful neglect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Special rule for amounts described in Sec. 1.6049-8(a). In the case of amounts described in Sec. 1.6049-8(a) (relating to payments of deposit interest to certain nonresident alien individuals) paid on or after January 1, 2013, any person who makes a Form 1042-S, ``Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding,'' under section 6049(a) and Sec. 1.6049-4(b)(5) shall furnish a statement to the recipient either in person or by first class mail to the recipient's last known address. The statement shall include a copy of the Form 1042-S required to be prepared pursuant to Sec. 1.6049-4(b)(5) and a statement to the effect that the information on the form is being furnished to the United States Internal Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Effective/applicability date. Paragraph (b)(3) applies to payee statements due after December 31, 2014. Paragraph (e)(4) of this section applies to payee statements reporting payments of deposit interest to nonresident alien individuals paid on or after January 1, 2013. For the substantially similar statement mailing requirements that apply with respect to forms required to be filed after October 22, 1986, and before January 1, 1996, see Rev. Proc. 84-70 (1984-2 C.B. 716) (or successor revenue procedures). See Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter. (For interest paid to a Canadian nonresident alien individual on or before December 31, 2012, see paragraph (e)(4) of this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 2000.)
