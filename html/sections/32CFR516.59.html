                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> TJAG has overall responsibility for the coordination of remedies in procurement fraud and corruption within the Army. This responsibility has been delegated to PFD.

including, but not limited to the following: DOD criminal investigative organizations; audit agencies; contracting officers; inspectors general of the executive branch; correspondence from the public; and, commanders.

For example, consideration of suspension or debarment of a contractor or individual should normally be initiated within 30 days of indictment or conviction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Coordinating, as appropriate, with other DOD components affected by a significant fraud or corruption case being monitored by the Army.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Developing, with the responsible DOD investigative organization, Procurement Fraud Coordinators and Advisers, and other involved agencies, a specific comprehensive remedies plan for each significant fraud or corruption case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Coordinating remedies with DOJ.

PFD will specifically ensure that contract reviews (DD 350 reports) and adverse impact statements (See Sec. 516.64(c)(2) are prepared, and that such information is used to determine if further inquiry is warranted to prevent reoccurrence and to detect other possible fraud. Impact statements will not be released to prosecutive agencies until reviewed by PFD. When appropriate, PFD will coordinate with other DOD agencies to establish a lead agency for victim impact statements in multi-DOD agency cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Commanding General, USACIDC, will take the following actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notify PFD of any investigations involving fraud or corruption related to procurement activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notify other DOD component criminal investigative organizations when investigations involving fraud or corruption affect that component. This includes evidence of fraud by a contractor, subcontractor, or employee of either, on current or past contracts with, or affecting, that component.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notify the Defense Investigative Service of any investigations that develop evidence which affects DOD cleared industrial facilities or personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Determine the effect on any ongoing investigations or prosecutions of any criminal, civil, contractual, or administrative actions being considered by a centralized organization and advise of any adverse impact.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Promptly provide commanders, contracting officers, Procurement Fraud Advisers, and suspension and debarment authorities, when needed to allow consideration of applicable remedies, any court records, documents, or other evidence of fraud or corruption from ongoing or completed criminal investigations.
