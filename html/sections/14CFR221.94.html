Where a tariff is filed pursuant to an intercarrier agreement approved by the Department, the explanation shall identify such agreement by DOT Docket number, DOT order of approval number, IATA resolution number, or if none is designated, then by other definite identification. Where a tariff is filed on behalf of a foreign air carrier pursuant to a Government order, a copy of such order shall be submitted with the tariff.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Appropriate Economic data and/or information in support of the new or changed matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions.

In such case the justification or attachment shall state whether the new or changed matter is identical to the competing tariff matter which it purports to meet or whether it approximates the competing tariff matter. If the new or changed matter is not identical, the transmittal letter or attachment shall contain a statement explaining, in reasonable detail, the basis for concluding that the tariff publication being filed is substantially similar to the competing tariff matter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p>
