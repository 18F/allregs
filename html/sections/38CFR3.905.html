                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Jurisdiction. At the regional office level, except in VA Regional Office, Manila, Philippines, the Regional Counsel is authorized to determine whether the evidence warrants formal consideration as to forfeiture. In the Manila Regional Office the Veterans Service Center Manager is authorized to make this determination. Submissions may also be made by the director of a service, the Chairman, Board of Veterans Appeals, and the General Counsel. Jurisdiction to determine whether the claimant or payee has forfeited the right to gratuitous benefits or to remit a prior forfeiture is vested in the Director, Compensation Service, and the Director, Pension and Fiduciary Service, and personnel to whom authority has been delegated under the provisions of Sec.  3.100(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fraud or treasonable acts. Forfeiture of benefits under Sec.  3.901 or Sec.  3.902 will not be declared until the person has been notified by the Regional Counsel or, in VA Regional Office, Manila, Philippines, the Veterans Service Center Manager, of the right to present a defense. Such notice shall consist of a written statement sent to the person's latest address of record setting forth the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The specific charges against the person;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A detailed statement of the evidence supporting the charges, subject to regulatory limitations on disclosure of information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Citation and discussion of the applicable statute;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The right to submit a statement or evidence within 60 days, either to rebut the charges or to explain the person's position;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The right to a hearing within 60 days, with representation by counsel of the person's own choosing, that fees for the representation are limited in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 5904(c) and that no expenses incurred by a claimant, counsel or witness will be paid by VA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Subversive activities. Automatic forfeiture of benefits under Sec.  3.903 will be effectuated by an official authorized to declare a forfeiture as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Finality of decisions. A decision of forfeiture is subject to the provisions of Sec.  3.104(a) and Sec. Sec.  20.1103 and 20.1104 of this chapter. The officials authorized to file administrative appeals and the time limit for filing such appeals are set forth in Sec.  19.51 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Remission of forfeiture. In event of remission of forfeiture under Sec.  3.901(e), any amounts paid as an apportionment(s) during periods of the previously forfeited beneficiary's reentitlement will be offset.</p><p class="depth2">Cross References: Effective dates; forfeiture.
