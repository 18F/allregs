                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Name. The name of the viticultural area described in this section is ``Sierra Pelona Valley''. For purposes of part 4 of this chapter, ``Sierra Pelona Valley'' and ``Sierra Pelona'' are terms of viticultural significance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approved maps. The three United States Geological Survey 1:24,000 scale topographic maps used to determine the boundary of the Sierra Pelona Valley viticultural area are titled:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Agua Dulce, CA, 1995;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sleepy Valley, CA, 1995; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ritter Ridge, Calif., 1958, Photorevised 1974.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Boundary. The Sierra Pelona Valley viticultural area is located in Los Angeles County, California. The boundary of the Sierra Pelona Valley viticultural area is as described below:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The beginning point is on the Agua Dulce map at the intersection of the section 26 east boundary line, the pipeline, and Escondido Canyon Road, a secondary highway, T5N, R14W. From

the beginning point, proceed in a straight line south 0.3 mile to the line's intersection with the northeast corner of the Vasquez Rocks County Park, T5N, R14W; then</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Proceed southwest through section 26 along the straight lines and 90-degree turns of the county park boundary line to the line's intersection with the southeast corner of section 27, T5N, R14W; then</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Proceed southwest in a straight line 0.4 mile to the line's intersection with BM 2258, section 34, T5N, R14W; then</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Proceed west-northwest in a straight line 0.15 mile, crossing over the Agua Dulce Road, to the line's intersection with the 2,400-foot elevation line and an unimproved dirt road, section 34, T5N, R14W; then</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Proceed generally west along the meandering 2,400-foot elevation line to the line's intersection with the section 34 west boundary line, T5N, R14W; then</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Proceed north along the section 34 west boundary line 1 mile to the line's intersection with the 2,800-foot elevation line and the section 27 west boundary line; then</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Proceed along the 2,800-foot elevation line first generally northeast, then northwest around Saddleback Mountain, and then north across a trail and an unimproved dirt road, to the line's intersection with the section 21 south boundary line, T5N, R14W; then</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Proceed straight east along the section 21 south boundary line 0.25 mile to the southeast corner of section 21, T5N, R14W; then</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Proceed north along the section 21 south boundary line onto the Sleepy Valley map 0.6 mile to the line's intersection with the 2,800-foot elevation line and the section 22 west boundary line, T5N, R14W;
