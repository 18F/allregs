                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Self-employment income. The State agency must calculate a  household's self-employment income as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Averaging self-employment income. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Self-employment income  must be averaged over the period the income is intended to cover, even  if the household receives income from other sources. If the averaged  amount does not accurately reflect the household's actual circumstances  because the household has experienced a substantial increase or decrease  in business, the State agency must calculate the self-employment income  on the basis of anticipated, not prior, earnings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a household's self-employment enterprise has been in  existence for less than a year, the income from that self-employment  enterprise must be averaged over the period of time the business has  been in operation and the monthly amount projected for the coming year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and  (a)(1)(ii) of this section, households subject to monthly reporting and  retrospective budgeting who derive their self-employment income from a  farming operation and who incur irregular expenses to produce such  income have the option to annualize the allowable costs of producing  self-employment income from farming when the self-employment farm income  is annualized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determining monthly income from self-employment. (i) For the  period of time over which self-employment income is determined, the  State agency must add all gross self-employment income (either actual or  anticipated, as provided in paragraph (a)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section) and  capital gains (according to paragraph (a)(3) of this section), exclude  the costs of producing the self-employment income (as determined in  paragraph (a)(4) of this section), and divide the remaining amount of  self-employment income by the number of months over which the income  will be averaged. This amount is the monthly net self-employment income.  The monthly net self-employment income must be added to any other earned  income received by the household to determine total monthly earned  income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> as a self-employed farmer who  receives or anticipates receiving annual gross proceeds of $1,000 or  more from the farming enterprise), such losses must be prorated in  accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and then offset  against countable income to the household as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Offset farm self-employment losses first against other self- employment income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Offset any remaining farm self-employment losses against the  total amount of earned and unearned income after the earned income  deduction has been applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a State agency determines that a household is eligible  based on its monthly net income, the State may elect to offer the  household an option to determine the benefit level by using either the  same net income which was used to determine eligibility, or by unevenly  prorating the household's total net income over the period for which the  household's self-employment income was averaged to more closely  approximate the time when the income is actually received. If income is  prorated, the net income assigned in any month cannot exceed the maximum  monthly income eligibility standards for the household's size.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Capital gains. The proceeds from the sale of capital goods or  equipment must be calculated in the same manner as a capital gain for  Federal income tax purposes. Even if only 50 percent of the proceeds  from the sale of capital goods or equipment is taxed for Federal income  tax purposes, the State agency must count the full amount of the capital  gain as income for SNAP purposes. For households whose self-employment  income is calculated on an anticipated   (rather than averaged) basis in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this  section, the State agency must count the amount of capital gains the  household anticipates receiving during the months over which the income  is being averaged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Allowable costs of producing self-employment income. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Allowable costs of producing self-employment income include, but are not  limited to, the identifiable costs of labor; stock; raw material; seed  and fertilizer; payments on the principal of the purchase price of  income-producing real estate and capital assets, equipment, machinery,  and other durable goods; interest paid to purchase income-producing  property; insurance premiums; and taxes paid on income-producing  property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In determining net self-employment income, the following items  are not allowable costs of doing business:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Net losses from previous periods;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Federal, State, and local income taxes, money set aside for  retirement purposes, and other work-related personal expenses (such as  transportation to and from work), as these expenses are accounted for by  the 20 percent earned income deduction specified in Sec. 273.9(d)(2);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Depreciation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any amount that exceeds the payment a household receives from a  boarder for lodging and meals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When calculating the costs of producing self-employment income,  State agencies may elect to use actual costs for allowable expenses in  accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section or  determine self-employment expenses as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For income from day care, use the current reimbursement amounts  used in the Child and Adult Care Food Program or a standard amount based  on estimated per-meal costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For income from boarders, other than those in commercial  boarding houses or from foster care boarders, use:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The maximum SNAP allotment for a household size that is equal to  the number of boarders; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A flat amount or fixed percentage of the gross income, provided  that the method used to determine the flat amount or fixed percentage is  objective and justifiable and is stated in the State's SNAP manual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For income from foster care boarders, refer to  Sec. 273.1(c)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Use the standard amount the State uses for its TANF program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Use an amount approved by FNS. State agencies may submit a  proposal to FNS for approval to use a simplified self-employment expense  calculation method that does not result in increased Program costs.  Different methods may be proposed for different types of self- employment. The proposal must include a description of the proposed  method, the number and type of households and percent of the caseload  affected, and documentation indicating that the proposed procedure will  not increase Program costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Treatment of income and resources of certain nonhousehold  members. During the period of time that a household member cannot  participate for the reasons addressed in this section, the eligibility  and benefit level of any remaining household members shall be determined  in accordance with the procedures outlined in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Intentional Program violation, felony drug conviction, or  fleeing felon disqualifications, and workfare or work requirement  sanctions. The eligibility and benefit level of any remaining household  members of a household containing individuals determined ineligible  because of a disqualification for an intentional Program violation, a  felony drug conviction, their fleeing felon status, noncompliance with a  work requirement of Sec. 273.7, or imposition of a sanction while they  were participating in a household disqualified because of failure to  comply with workfare requirements shall be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Income, resources, and deductible expenses. The income and  resources of the ineligible household member(s) shall continue to count  in their entirety, and the entire household's allowable earned income,  standard, medical, dependent care, child support, and excess shelter  deductions shall continue to apply to the remaining household members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Eligibility and benefit level. The ineligible member shall not  be included   when determining the household's size for the purposes of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Assigning a benefit level to the household;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Assigning a standard deduction to the household;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Comparing the household's monthly income with the income  eligibility standards; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Comparing the household's resources with the resource  eligibility limits. The State agency shall ensure that no household's  coupon allotment is increased as a result of the exclusion of one or  more household members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> SSN disqualifications, comparable disqualifications, child  support disqualifications, and ineligible ABAWDs. The eligibility and  benefit level of any remaining household members of a household  containing individuals determined to be ineligible for refusal to obtain  or provide an SSN, for meeting the time limit for able-bodied adults  without dependents or for being disqualified under paragraphs (k), (o),  (p), or (q) of this section shall be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Resources. The resources of such ineligible members shall  continue to count in their entirety to the remaining household members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Income. A pro rata share of the income of such ineligible  members shall be counted as income to the remaining members. This pro  rata share is calculated by first subtracting the allowable exclusions  from the ineligible member's income and dividing the income evenly among  the household members, including the ineligible members. All but the  ineligible members' share is counted as income for the remaining  household members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Deductible expenses. The 20 percent earned income deduction  shall apply to the prorated income earned by such ineligible members  which is attributed to their households. That portion of the households'  allowable child support payment, shelter and dependent care expenses  which are either paid by or billed to the ineligible members shall be  divided evenly among the households' members including the ineligible  members. All but the ineligible members' share is counted as a  deductible child support payment, shelter or dependent care expense for  the remaining household members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Eligibility and benefit level. Such ineligible members shall  not be included when determining their households' sizes for the  purposes of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Assigning a benefit level to the household;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Assigning a standard deduction to the household;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Comparing the household's monthly income with the income  eligibility standards; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Comparing the household's resources with the resource  eligibility limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ineligible alien. The State agency must determine the  eligibility and benefit level of any remaining household members of a  household containing an ineligible alien as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> does not apply to an alien:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence under the INA;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Who is granted asylum under section 208 of the INA;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Who is admitted as a refugee under section 207 of the INA;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Who is paroled in accordance with section 212(d)(5) of the INA;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Whose deportation or removal has been withheld in accordance  with section 243 of the INA;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Who is aged, blind, or disabled in accordance with section  1614(a)(1) of the Social Security Act and is admitted for temporary or  permanent residence under section 245A(b)(1) of the INA; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Who is a special agricultural worker admitted for temporary  residence under section 210(a) of the INA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For an ineligible alien within a category described in  paragraphs   (c)(3)(i)(A) through (c)(3)(i)(G) of this section, State agencies may  either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Count all of the ineligible alien's resources and all but a pro  rata share of the ineligible alien's income and deductible expenses; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Count all of the ineligible alien's resources, count none of the  ineligible alien's income and deductible expenses, count any money  payment (including payments in currency, by check, or electronic  transfer) made by the ineligible alien to at least one eligible  household member, not deduct as a household expense any otherwise  deductible expenses paid by the ineligible alien, but cap the resulting  benefit amount for the eligible members at the allotment amount the  household would receive if the household member within the one of the  categories described in paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(A) through (c)(3)(i)(G) of  this section were still an eligible alien. The State agency must elect  one State-wide option for determining the eligibility and benefit level  of households with members who are aliens within the categories  described paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(A) through (c)(3)(i)(G) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>, the State agency may count all of the alien's  income for purposes of applying the gross income test for eligibility  purposes while only counting all but a pro rata to apply the net income  test and determine level of benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The State agency must compute the income of the ineligible  aliens using the income definition in Sec. 273.9(b) and the income  exclusions in Sec. 273.9(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), the State agency must not  include the resources and income of the sponsor and the sponsor's spouse  in determining the resources and income of an ineligible sponsored  alien.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reduction or termination of benefits within the certification  period. Whenever an individual is determined ineligible within the  household's certification period, the State agency shall determine the  eligibility or ineligibility of the remaining household members based,  as much as possible, on information in the case file.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Excluded for intentional Program violation disqualification. If  a household's benefits are reduced or terminated within the  certification period because one of its members was excluded because of  disqualification for intentional Program violation, the State agency  shall notify the remaining members of their eligibility and benefit  level at the same time the excluded member is notified of his or her  disqualification. The household is not entitled to a notice of adverse  action but may request a fair hearing to contest the reduction or  termination of benefits, unless the household has already had a fair  hearing on the amount of the claim as a result of consolidation of the  administrative disqualification hearing with the fair hearing. However,  a participating household is entitled to a notice of adverse action  prior to any action to reduce, suspend or terminate its benefits, if a  State agency determines that it contains an individual who was  disqualified in another State and is still within the period of  disqualification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disqualified or determined ineligible for reasons other than  intentional Program violation. If a household's benefits are reduced or  terminated within the certification period for reasons other than an  Intentional Program Violation disqualification, the State agency shall  issue a notice of adverse action in accordance with Sec. 273.13(a)(2)  which informs the household of the ineligibility, the reason for the  ineligibility, the eligibility and benefit level of the remaining  members, and the action the household must take to end the  ineligibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Treatment of income and resources of other nonhousehold members.  (1) For all other nonhousehold members defined in Sec. 273.1 (b)(1) and  (b)(2) who are   not specifically mentioned in paragraph (c) of this section, the income  and resources of such individuals shall not be considered available to  the household with whom the individual resides. Cash payments from the  nonhousehold member to the household will be considered income under the  normal income standards set in Sec. 273.9(b). Vendor payments, as  defined in Sec. 273.9(c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>, shall be excluded as income. If the  household shares deductible expenses with the nonhousehold member, only  the amount actually paid or contributed by the household shall be  deducted as a household expense. If the payments or contributions cannot  be differentiated, the expenses shall be prorated evenly among persons  actually paying or contributing to the expense and only the household's  pro rata share deducted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When the earned income of one or more household members and the  earned income of a nonhousehold member are combined into one wage, the  income of the household members shall be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the household's share can be identified, the State agency  shall count that portion due to the household as earned income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the household's share cannot be identified the State agency  shall prorate the earned income among all those whom it was intended to  cover and count that prorated portion to the household.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Such nonhousehold members shall not be included when determining  the size of the household for the purposes of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assigning a benefit level to the household;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Comparing the household's monthly income with the income  eligibility standards; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Comparing the household's resources with the resource  eligibility limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Residents of drug and alcohol treatment and rehabilitation  programs. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Narcotic addicts or alcoholics who regularly participate  in publicly operated or private non-profit drug addict or alcoholic  (DAA) treatment and rehabilitation programs on a resident basis may  voluntarily apply for SNAP. Applications must be made through an  authorized representative who is employed by the DAA center and  designated by the center for that purpose. The State agency may require  the household to designate the DAA center as its authorized  representative for the purpose of receiving and using an allotment on  behalf of the household. Residents must be certified as one-person  households unless their children are living with them, in which case  their children must be included in the household with the parent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Prior to certifying any residents for SNAP, the State agency  must verify that the DAA center is authorized by FNS as a retailer in  accordance with Sec. 278.1(e) of this chapter or that it comes under  part B of title XIX of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 300x et  seq., (as defined in ``Drug addiction or alcoholic treatment and  rehabilitation program'' in Sec. 271.2 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(2), the  State agency must certify residents of DAA centers by using the same  provisions that apply to all other households, including, but not  limited to, the same rights to notices of adverse action and fair  hearings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> DAA centers in areas without EBT systems may redeem the  households' paper coupons through authorized food stores. DAA centers in  areas with EBT systems may redeem benefits in various ways depending on  the State's EBT system design. The designs may include DAA use of  individual household EBT cards at authorized stores, authorization of  DAA centers as retailers with EBT access via POS at the center, DAA use  of a center EBT card that is an aggregate of individual household  benefits, and other designs. Guidelines for approval of EBT systems are  contained in Sec. 274.12 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The treatment center must notify the State agency of changes in  the household's circumstances as provided in Sec. 273.12(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The DAA center must provide the State agency a list of currently  participating residents that includes a statement signed by a  responsible center official attesting to the validity of the list. The  State agency must require   submission of the list on either a monthly or semimonthly basis. In  addition, the State agency must conduct periodic random on-site visits  to the center to assure the accuracy of the list and that the State  agency's records are consistent and up to date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The State agency may issue allotments on a semimonthly basis to  households in DAA centers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> When a household leaves the center, the center must notify the  State agency and the center must provide the household with its ID card.  If possible, the center must provide the household with a change report  form to report to the State agency the household's new address and other  circumstances after leaving the center and must advise the household to  return the form to the appropriate office of the State agency within 10  days. After the household leaves the center, the center can no longer  act as the household's authorized representative for certification  purposes or for obtaining or using benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The center must provide the household with its EBT card if it  was in the possession of the center, any untransacted ATP, or the  household's full allotment if already issued and if no coupons have been  spent on behalf of that individual household. If the household has  already left the center, the center must return them to the State  agency. These procedures are applicable at any time during the month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the coupons have already been issued and any portion spent  on behalf of the household, the following procedures must be followed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the household leaves prior to the 16th of the month and  benefits are not issued under an EBT system, the center must provide the  household with one-half of its monthly coupon allotment unless the State  agency issues semi-monthly allotments and the second half has not been  turned over to the center. If benefits are issued under an EBT system,  the State must ensure that the EBT design or procedures for DAAs  prohibit the DAA from obtaining more than one-half of the household's  allotment prior to the 16th of the month or permit the return of one- half of the allotment to the household's EBT account through a refund,  transfer, or other means if the household leaves prior to the 16th of  the month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the household leaves on or after the 16th day of the month,  the State agency, at its option, may require the center to give the  household a portion of its allotment. Under an EBT system where the  center has an aggregate EBT card, the State agency may, but is not  required to transfer a portion of the household's monthly allotment from  a center's EBT account back to the household's EBT account. However, the  household, not the center, must be allowed to receive any remaining  benefits authorized by the household's HIR or ATP or posted to the EBT  account at the time the household leaves the center.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The center must return to the State agency any EBT card or  coupons not provided to departing residents by the end of each month.  These coupons include those not provided to departing residents because  they left either prior to the 16th and the center was unable to provide  the household with the coupons or the household left on or after the  16th of the month and the coupons were not returned to the household.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The organization or institution shall be responsible for any  misrepresentation or intentional Program violation which it knowingly  commits in the certification of center residents. As an authorized  representative, the organization or institution must be knowledgeable  about household circumstances and should carefully review those  circumstances with residents prior to applying on their behalf. The  organization or institution shall be strictly liable for all losses or  misuse of food coupons held on behalf of resident households and for all  overissuances which occur while the households are residents of the  treatment center.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The organization or institution authorized by FNS as a retail  food store may be penalized or disqualified, as described in Sec. 278.6,  if it is determined administratively or judicially that coupons were  misappropriated or used for purchases that did not contribute to a  certified household's   meals. The State agency shall promptly notify FNS when it has reason to  believe that an organization or institution is misusing coupons in its  possession. However, the State agency shall take no action prior to FNS  action against the organization or institution. The State agency shall  establish a claim for overissuances of food coupons held on behalf of  resident clients as stipulated in paragraph (e)(6) of this section if  any overissuances are discovered during an investigation or hearing  procedure for redemption violations. If FNS disqualifies an organization  or institution as an authorized retail food store, the State agency  shall suspend its authorized representative status for the same period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Residents of a group living arrangement. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Disabled or blind  residents of a group living arrangement (GLA) (as defined in Sec. 271.2  of this chapter) may apply either through use of an authorized  representative employed and designated by the group living arrangement  or on their own behalf or through an authorized representative of their  choice. The GLA must determine if a resident may apply on his or her own  behalf based on the resident's physical and mental ability to handle his  or her own affairs. Some residents of the GLA may apply on their own  behalf while other residents of the same GLA may apply through the GLA's  representative. Prior to certifying any residents, the State agency must  verify that the GLA is authorized by FNS or is certified by the  appropriate agency of the State (as defined in Sec. 271.2 of this  chapter) including the agency's determination that the center is a  nonprofit organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the residents apply on their own behalf, the household size  must be in accordance with the definition in Sec. 273.1. The State  agency must certify these residents using the same provisions that apply  to all other households. If FNS disqualifies the GLA as an authorized  retail food store, the State agency must suspend its authorized  representative status for the same time; but residents applying on their  own behalf will still be able to participate if otherwise eligible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the residents apply through the use of the GLA's authorized  representative, their eligibility must be determined as a one-person  household.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each group living arrangement shall provide the State agency  with a list of currently participating residents. This list shall  include a statement signed by a responsible center official attesting to  the validity of the list. The State shall require the list on a periodic  basis. In addition, the State agency shall conduct periodic random  onsite visits to assure the accuracy of the list and that the State  agency's records are consistent and up to date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> to residents  of treatment centers also apply to blind or disabled residents of group  living arrangements when the facility acts as the resident's authorized  representative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the resident has made application on his/her own behalf, the  household is responsible for reporting changes to the State agency as  provided in Sec. 273.12(a). If the group living arrangement is acting in  the capacity of an authorized representative, the group living  arrangement shall notify the State agency, as provided in  Sec. 273.12(a), of changes in the household's income or other household  circumstances and when the individual leaves the group living  arrangement. The group living arrangement shall return any household's  ATP card or coupons to the State agency if they are received after the  household has left the group living arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When the household leaves the facility, the group living  arrangement, either acting as an authorized representative or retaining  use of the coupons on behalf of the residents (regardless of the method  of application), shall provide residents with their ID cards (if  applicable) and any untransacted ATP cards. The household, not the group  living arrangement, shall be allowed to sign for and receive any  remaining authorized benefits reflected on HIR cards. Also, the  departing household shall receive its full allotment if issued and if no  coupons have been spent on behalf of that individual household. These  procedures are applicable at any time during the month. However, if the  coupons have already been issued and any portion spent on behalf of the  individual, and the household leaves the   group living arrangement prior to the 16th day of the month, the  facility shall provide the household with its ID card (if applicable)  and one half of its monthly coupon allotment. If the household leaves on  or after the 16th day of the month and the coupons have already been  issued and used, the household does not receive any coupons. If a group  of residents have been certified as one household and have returned the  coupons to the facility to use, the departing residents shall be given a  pro rata share of one-half of the coupon allotment if leaving prior to  the 16th day of the month and shall be instructed to obtain ID cards or  written authorizations to use the coupons from the local office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Once the resident leaves, the group living arrangement no  longer acts as his/her authorized representative. The group living  arrangement, if possible, shall provide the household with a change  report form to report to the State agency the individual's new address  and other circumstances after leaving the group living arrangement and  shall advise the household to return the form to the appropriate office  of the State agency within 10 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The group living arrangement shall return to the State agency  any coupons not provided to departing residents at the end of each  month. These returned coupons shall include those not provided to  departing residents because they left on or after the 16th of the month  or they left prior to the 16th and the facility was unable to provide  them with the coupons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> and (7) of this section also apply to group  living arrangements when acting as an authorized representative. These  provisions, however, are not applicable if a resident has applied on  his/her own behalf. The resident applying on his/her own behalf shall be  responsible for overissuances as would any other household as discussed  in Sec. 273.18.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> If the residents are certified on their own behalf, the SNAP  benefits may either be returned to the GLA to be used to purchase meals  served either communally or individually to eligible residents or  retained and used to purchase and prepare food for their own  consumption. The GLA may purchase and prepare food to be consumed by  eligible residents on a group basis if residents normally obtain their  meals at a central location as part of the GLA's service or if meals are  prepared at a central location for delivery to the individual residents.  If personalized meals are prepared and paid for with SNAP, the GLA must  ensure that the resident's SNAP benefits are used for meals intended for  that resident.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Shelters for battered women and children. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prior to  certifying its residents under this paragraph, the State agency shall  determine that the shelter for battered women and children meets the  definition in Sec. 271.2 and document the basis of this determination.  Shelters having FNS authorization to redeem at wholesalers shall be  considered as meeting the definition and the State agency is not  required to make any further determination. The State agency may choose  to require local project area offices to maintain a list of shelters  meeting the definition to facilitate prompt certification of eligible  residents following the special procedures outlined below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Many shelter residents have recently left a household containing  the person who has abused them. Their former household may be certified  for participation in the Program, and its certification may be based on  a household size that includes the women and children who have just  left. Shelter residents who are included in such certified households  may nevertheless apply for and (if otherwise eligible) participate in  the Program as separate households if such certified household which  includes them is the household containing the person who subjected them  to abuse. Shelter residents who are included in such certified  households may receive an additional allotment as a separate household  only once a month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Shelter residents who apply as separate households shall be  certified solely on the basis of their income and resources and the  expenses for which they are responsible. They shall be certified without  regard to the income, resources, and expenses of their former household.  Jointly held resources shall   be considered inaccessible in accordance with Sec. 273.8. Room payments  to the shelter shall be considered as shelter expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any shelter residents eligible for expedited service shall be  handled in accordance with Sec. 273.2(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> State agencies must take prompt action to ensure that the former  household's eligibility or allotment reflects the change in the  household's composition. Such action must include acting on the reported  change in accordance with Sec. 273.12 or Sec. 273.21, as appropriate, by  issuing a notice of adverse action in accordance with Sec. 273.13.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>, (j) and (k), and Sec. 273.10(a), as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Reduction of public assistance benefits. If the benefits of a  household that is receiving public assistance are reduced under a  Federal, State, or local means-tested public assistance program because  of the failure of a SNAP household member to perform an action required  under the assistance program or for fraud, the State agency shall not  increase the household's SNAP allotment as the result of the decrease in  income. In addition to prohibiting an increase in SNAP benefits, the  State agency may impose a penalty on the household that represents a  percentage of the SNAP allotment that does not exceed 25 percent. The 25  percent reduction in SNAP benefits must be based on the amount of SNAP  benefits the household should have received under the regular SNAP  benefit formula, taking into account its actual (reduced) income.  However, under no circumstances can the SNAP benefits be allowed to  rise. Reaching a time limit for time-limited benefits, having a child  that is not eligible because of a family cap, failing to reapply or  complete the application process for continued assistance under the  other program, failing to perform an action that the individual is  unable to perform as opposed to refusing to perform, or failing to  comply with a purely procedural requirement, shall not be considered a  failure to perform an action required by an assistance program for  purposes of this provision. A procedural requirement, which would not  trigger a SNAP sanction, is a step that an individual must take to  continue receiving benefits in the assistance program such as submitting  a monthly report form or providing verification of circumstances. A  substantive requirement, which would trigger a SNAP sanction, is a  behavioral requirement in the assistance program designed to improve the  well being of the recipient family, such as participating in job search  activities. The State agency shall not apply this provision to  individuals who fail to perform a required action at the time the  individual initially applies for assistance. The State agency shall not  increase SNAP benefits, and may reduce SNAP benefits only if the person  is receiving such assistance at the time the reduction in assistance is  imposed or the reduction in assistance is imposed at the time of  application for continued assistance benefits if there is no break in  participation. The individual must be certified for SNAP benefits at the  time of the failure to perform a required action for this provision to  apply. Assistance benefits shall be considered reduced if they are  decreased, suspended, or terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of this provision a Federal, State or local  ``means-tested public assistance program'' shall mean public or general  assistance as defined in Sec. 271.2 of this chapter, and is referred to  as ``assistance''. This provision must be applied to all applicable  cases. If a State agency is not successful in obtaining the necessary  cooperation from another Federal, State or local means-tested welfare or  public assistance program to enable it to comply with the requirements  of this provision, the   State agency shall not be held responsible for noncompliance as long as  the State agency has made a good faith effort to obtain the information.  The State agency, rather than the household, shall be responsible for  obtaining information about sanctions from other programs and changes in  those sanctions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The prohibition on increasing SNAP benefits applies for the  duration of the reduction in the assistance program. If at any time the  State agency can no longer ascertain the amount of the reduction, then  the State agency may terminate the SNAP sanction. However, the sanction  may not exceed the sanction in the other program. If the sanction is  still in effect at the end of one year, the State agency shall review  the case to determine if the sanction continues to be appropriate. If,  for example, the household is not receiving assistance, it would not be  appropriate to continue the sanction. Sanctions extended beyond one year  must be reviewed at least annually but may be ended by the State agency  at any time. It shall be concurrent with the reduction in the other  assistance program to the extent allowed by normal SNAP change  processing and notice procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The State agency shall determine how to prevent an increase in  SNAP benefits. Among other options, the State agency may increase the  assistance grant by a flat percent, not to exceed 25 percent, for all  households that fail to perform a required action in lieu of computing  an individual amount or percentage for each affected household.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the allotment of a household is reduced under Title IV-A of  the Social Security Act, the State agency may use the same procedures  that apply under Title IV-A to prevent an increase in SNAP benefits as  the result of the decrease in Title IV-A benefits. For example, the same  budgeting procedures and combined notices and hearings may be used, but  the SNAP allotment may not be reduced by more than 25 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The State agency must lift the ban on increasing SNAP benefits  if it becomes aware that the person has become ineligible for the  assistance program during the disqualification period for some other  reason, or the person's assistance case is closed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If an individual moves within the State, the prohibition on  increasing SNAP benefits shall be applied to the gaining household  unless that person is ineligible for the assistance program for some  other reason. If such individual moves to a new State the prohibition on  increasing benefits shall not be applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The State agency must restore lost benefits when necessary in  accordance with Sec. 273.17 if it is later determined that the reduction  in the public assistance grant was not appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The State agency must act on changes which are not related to  the assistance violation and that would affect the household's benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The State agency must include in its State Plan of Operations  any options it has selected in this paragraph (j).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Comparable disqualifications. If a disqualification is imposed  on a member of a household for failure to perform an action required  under a Federal, State or local means-tested public assistance program,  the State agency may impose the same disqualification on the member of  the household under SNAP. The program must be authorized by a Federal,  State, or local law, but the provision itself does not have to be  specified in the law. A State agency may choose to apply this provision  to one or more of these programs, and it may select the types of  disqualifications within a program that it wants to impose on SNAP  recipients. The State agency shall be responsible for obtaining  information about sanctions from other programs and changes in those  sanctions. In the case of disqualification from the Food Distribution  Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) for an intentional program  violation as described under Sec. 253.8 of this chapter, the State  agency shall impose the same disqualification on the member of the  household under SNAP. The State agency must, in cooperation with the  appropriate FDPIR agency, develop a procedure that ensures that these  household members are identified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of this section Federal, State or local ``means- tested public assistance program'' shall mean public and general  assistance as defined in Sec. 271.2 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The State agency shall not apply this provision to individuals  who are disqualified at the time the individual initially applies for  assistance benefits. It may apply the provision if the person was  receiving such assistance at the time the disqualification in the  assistance program was imposed and to disqualifications imposed at the  time of application for continued assistance benefits if there is no  break in participation with the following exceptions: Reaching a time  limit for time-limited benefits, having a child that is not eligible  because of a family cap, failing to reapply or complete the application  process for continued assistance, failing to perform an action that the  individual is unable to perform as opposed to refusing to perform, and  failing to perform purely procedural requirements, shall not be  considered failures to perform an action required by an assistance  program. A procedural requirement, which would not trigger a SNAP  sanction, is a step that an individual must take to continue receiving  benefits in the assistance program such as submitting a monthly report  form or providing verification of circumstances. A substantive  requirement, which would trigger a SNAP sanction, is a behavioral  requirement in the assistance program designed to improve the well being  of the recipient family, such as participating in job search activities.  The individual must be receiving SNAP at the time of the  disqualification in the assistance program to be disqualified from SNAP  under this provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The State agency must stop the SNAP disqualification when it  becomes aware that the person has become ineligible for assistance for  some other reason, or the assistance case is closed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If a disqualification is imposed for a failure of an individual  to perform an action required under a program under Title IV-A of the  Social Security Act, the State may use the rules and procedures that  apply under the Title IV-A program to impose the same disqualification  under SNAP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Only the individual who committed the violation in the  assistance program may be disqualified for SNAP purposes even if the  entire assistance unit is disqualified for Title IV-A purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A comparable disqualification for SNAP purposes shall be imposed  concurrently with the disqualification in the assistance program to the  extent allowed by normal SNAP processing times and notice requirements.  The State agency may determine the length of the disqualification,  providing that the disqualification does not exceed the disqualification  in the other program. If the sanction is still in effect at the end of  one year, the State agency shall review the case to determine if the  sanction continues to be appropriate. If, for example, the household is  not receiving assistance, if would not be appropriate to continue the  sanction. Sanctions extended beyond one year must be reviewed at least  annually but may be ended by the State agency at any time. In instances  where the disqualification is a reciprocal action based on  disqualification from the Food Distribution Program on Indian  Reservations, the length of disqualification shall mirror the period  prescribed by the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> If there is a pending disqualification for a SNAP violation and  a pending comparable disqualification, they shall be imposed  concurrently to the extent appropriate. For example, if the household is  disqualified for June for a SNAP violation and an individual is  disqualified for June and July for an assistance program violation, the  whole household shall be disqualified for June and the individual shall  be disqualified for July for SNAP purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The State agency must treat the income and resources of the  disqualified individual in accordance with Sec. 273.11(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> After a disqualification period has expired, the person may  apply for SNAP benefits and shall be treated as a new applicant or a new  household member, except that a current disqualification based on a SNAP  work requirement shall be considered in determining eligibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> A comparable SNAP disqualification may be imposed in addition  to any coupon allotment reductions made in accordance with paragraph (j)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> State agencies shall state in their Plan of Operation if they  have elected to apply comparable disqualifications, identify which  sanctions in the other programs this provision applies to, and indicate  the options and procedures allowed in paragraphs (k)(1), (k)(2), (k)(3),  (k)(4), and (k)(10) of this section which they have selected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> The State agency must act on changes which are not related to  the assistance violation and that would affect the household's benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> The State agency must restore lost benefits when necessary in  accordance with 7 CFR 273.17 if it is later determined that the  reduction in the public assistance grant was not appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> School Attendance. Section 404(i) of Part A of the Social  Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 601, et seq., provides that any state receiving  a TANF block grant cannot be prohibited from sanctioning a family that  includes an adult who has received assistance financed with federal TANF  dollars or provided from SNAP if such adult fails to ensure that the  minor dependent children of such adult attend school as required by the  law of the State in which the minor children reside. Section 404(j) of  Part A of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 601, et seq., provides that  States shall not be prohibited from sanctioning a family that includes  an adult who is older than 20 and younger than 51 and who has received  assistance that is either financed with federal TANF funds or provided  through SNAP if such adult does not have, or is not working toward  attaining, a secondary school diploma or recognized equivalent. These  provisions do not provide independent authority for SNAP sanctions  beyond any that may apply through paragraphs (j) and (k) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> shall be treated in accordance with the procedures at  paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Fleeing felons and probation or parole violators. Individuals  who are fleeing to avoid prosecution or custody for a crime, or an  attempt to commit a crime, that would be classified as a felony (or in  the State of New Jersey, a high misdemeanor) or who are violating a  condition of probation or parole under a Federal or State law shall not  be considered eligible household members. The income and resources of  the ineligible member shall be handled in accordance with (c)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Custodial parent's cooperation with the State Child Support  Agency. For purposes of this provision, a custodial parent is a natural  or adoptive parent who lives with his or her child, or other individual  who is living with and exercises parental control over a child under the  age of 18.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Option to disqualify custodial parent for failure to cooperate.  At the option of a State agency, subject to paragraphs (o)(2) and (o)(4)  of this section, no natural or adoptive parent or, at State agency  option, other individual (collectively referred to in this paragraph (o)  as ``the individual'') who is living with and exercising parental  control over a child under the age of 18 who has an absent parent shall  be eligible to participate in SNAP unless the individual cooperates with  the agency administering a State Child Support Enforcement Program  established under Part   D of Title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 651, et seq.),  hereafter referred to as the State Child Support Agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the State agency chooses to implement paragraph (o)(1) of  this section, it must notify all individuals of this requirement in  writing at the time of application and reapplication for continued  benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the State agency chooses to implement paragraph (o)(1) of  this section, it must refer all appropriate individuals to the State  Child Support Agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the individual is receiving TANF or Medicaid, or assistance  from the State Child Support Agency, and has already been determined to  be cooperating, or has been determined to have good cause for not  cooperating, then the State agency shall consider the individual to be  cooperating for SNAP purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The individual must cooperate with the State Child Support  Agency in establishing paternity of the child, and in establishing,  modifying, or enforcing a support order with respect to the child and  the individual in accordance with section 454(29) of the Social Security  Act (42 U.S.C. 654(29)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Pursuant to Section 454(29)(E) of the Social Security Act (42  U.S.C. 654(29)(E) the State Child Support Agency will notify the  individual and the State agency whether or not it has determined that  the individual is cooperating in good faith.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Claiming good cause for non-cooperation. Prior to requiring  cooperation under paragraph (o)(1) of this section, the State agency  will notify the household in writing at initial application and at  application for continued benefits of the right to good cause as an  exception to the cooperation requirement and of all the requirements  applicable to a good cause determination. Paragraph (o)(1) of this  section shall not apply to the individual if good cause is found for  refusing to cooperate, as determined by the State agency:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Circumstances under which cooperation may be ``against the best  interests of the child.'' The individual's failure to cooperate is  deemed to be for ``good cause'' if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The individual meets the good cause criteria established under  the State program funded under Part A of Title IV or Part D of Title IV  of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601, et seq, or 42 U.S.C. 651, et  seq.) (whichever agency is authorized to define and determine good  cause) for failing to cooperate with the State Child Support Agency; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Cooperating with the State Child Support Agency would make it  more difficult for the individual to escape domestic violence or  unfairly penalize the individual who is or has been victimized by such  violence, or the individual who is at risk of further domestic violence.  For purposes of this provision, the term ``domestic violence'' means the  individual or child would be subject to physical acts that result in, or  are threatened to result in, physical injury to the individual; sexual  abuse; sexual activity involving a dependent child; being forced as the  caretaker relative of a dependent child to engage in nonconsensual  sexual acts or activities; threats of, or attempts at physical or sexual  abuse; mental abuse; or neglect or deprivation of medical care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The individual meets any other good cause criteria identified by  the State agency. These criteria will be defined in consultation with  the Child Support Agency or TANF program, whichever is appropriate, and  identified in the State plan according to Sec. 272.2(d) (xiii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Proof of good cause claim. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The State agency will accept as  corroborative evidence the same evidence required by Part A of Title IV  or Part D of Title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601, et seq.  or 42 U.S.C. 651, et seq.) to corroborate a claim of good cause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The State agency will make a good cause determination based on  the corroborative evidence supplied by the individual only after it has  examined the evidence and found that it actually verifies the good cause  claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Review by the State Child Support or TANF Agency. Prior to  making a final determination of good cause for refusing to cooperate,  the State agency will afford the State Child Support Agency or the  agency which administers the program funded under Part A   of the Social Security Act the opportunity to review and comment on the  findings and the basis for the proposed determination and consider any  recommendation from the State Child Support or TANF Agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Delayed finding of good cause. The State agency will not deny,  delay, or discontinue assistance pending a determination of good cause  for refusal to cooperate if the applicant or recipient has complied with  the requirements to furnish corroborative evidence and information. In  such cases, the State agency must abide by the normal processing  standards according to Sec. 273.2(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Individual disqualification. If the State agency has elected to  implement this provision and determines that the individual has not  cooperated without good cause, then that individual shall be ineligible  to participate in SNAP. The disqualification shall not apply to the  entire household. The income and resources of the disqualified  individual shall be handled in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fees. A State electing to implement this provision shall not  require the payment of a fee or other cost for services provided under  Part D of Title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 651, et seq.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Terminating the disqualification. The period of disqualification  ends once it has been determined that the individual is cooperating with  the State Child Support Agency. The State agency must have procedures in  place for re-qualifying such an individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> Non-custodial parent's cooperation with child support agencies.  For purposes of this provision, a ``non-custodial parent'' is a putative  or identified parent who does not live with his or her child who is  under the age of 18.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Option to disqualify non-custodial parent for refusal to  cooperate. At the option of a State agency, subject to paragraphs (p)(2)  and (p)(4) of this section, a putative or identified non-custodial  parent of a child under the age of 18 (referred to in this subsection as  ``the individual'') shall not be eligible to participate in SNAP if the  individual refuses to cooperate with the State agency administering the  program established under Part D of Title IV of the Social Security Act  (42 U.S.C. 651, et seq.), hereafter referred to as the State Child  Support Agency, in establishing the paternity of the child (if the child  is born out of wedlock); and in providing support for the child.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the State agency chooses to implement paragraph (p)(1) of  this section, it must notify all individuals in writing of this  requirement at the time of application and reapplication for continued  benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the individual is receiving TANF, Medicaid, or assistance  from the State Child Support Agency, and has already been determined to  be cooperating, or has been determined to have good cause for not  cooperating, then the State agency shall consider the individual is  cooperating for SNAP purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the State agency chooses to implement paragraph (p)(1) of  this section, it must refer all appropriate individuals to the State  Child Support Agency established under Part D of Title IV of the Social  Security Act (42 U.S.C. 651, et seq.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The individual must cooperate with the State Child Support  Agency in establishing the paternity of the child (if the child is born  out of wedlock), and in providing support for the child.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Pursuant to Section 454(29)(E) of the Social Security Act (42  U.S.C. 654(29)(E)), the State Child Support Agency will notify the  individual and the State agency whether or not it has determined that  the individual is cooperating in good faith.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determining refusal to cooperate. If the State Child Support  Agency determines that the individual is not cooperating in good faith,  then the State agency will determine whether the non-cooperation  constitutes a refusal to cooperate. Refusal to cooperate is when an  individual has demonstrated an unwillingness to cooperate as opposed to  an inability to cooperate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Individual disqualification. If the State agency determines that  the non-custodial parent has refused to cooperate, then that individual  shall be ineligible to participate in SNAP. The disqualification shall  not apply to the entire household. The income and resources of the  disqualified individual   shall be handled according to paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fees. A State electing to implement this provision shall not  require the payment of a fee or other cost for services provided under  Part D of Title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 651, et seq.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Privacy. The State agency shall provide safeguards to restrict  the use of information collected by a State agency administering the  program established under Part D of Title IV of the Social Security Act  (42 U.S.C. 651, et seq.) to purposes for which the information is  collected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Termination of disqualification. The period of disqualification  ends once it has been determined that the individual is cooperating with  the child support agency. The State agency must have procedures in place  for re-qualifying such an individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> Disqualification for child support arrears--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Option to  disqualify. At the option of a State agency, no individual shall be  eligible to participate in SNAP as a member of any household during any  month that the individual is delinquent in any payment due under a court  order for the support of a child of the individual. The State agency may  opt to apply this provision to only non-custodial parents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. A disqualification under paragraph (q)(1) of this  section shall not apply if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A court is allowing the individual to delay payment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The individual is complying with a payment plan approved by a  court or the State agency designated under Part D of Title IV of the  Social Security Act (42 U.S.C., 651 et seq.) to provide support of a  child of the individual; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The State agency determines the individual has good cause for  non-support.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Individual disqualification. If the State agency has elected to  implement this provision and determines that the individual should be  disqualified for child support arrears, then that individual shall be  ineligible to participate in SNAP. The disqualification shall not apply  to the entire household. The income and resources of the disqualified  individual shall be handled according to paragraph (c)(2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Collecting claims. State agencies shall initiate collection  action as provided for in Sec. 273.18 for any month a household member  is disqualified for child support arrears by sending the household a  written demand letter which informs the household of the amount owed,  the reason for the claim and how the household may pay the claim. The  household should also be informed as to the adjusted amount of income,  resources, and deductible expenses of the remaining members of the  household for the month(s) a member is disqualified for child support  arrears.
