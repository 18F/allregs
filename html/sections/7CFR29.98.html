                            <p class="depth0">Immediately after an appeal has been heard and the tobacco involved therein has been reexamined, an appeal certificate shall be issued or an appeal sample prepared by the appeal inspector. Such certificate or sample shall show the finding of the appeal inspector and shall be labeled ``Appeal Certificate'' or ``Appeal Sample'', as the case may be, over the signature of the appeal inspector. An appeal certificate or sample shall supersede all other certificates or samples for the same lot of tobacco and shall refer specifically to the certificate or sample from which the appeal was made. In all other respects the provisions of this subpart relative to certificates or samples shall apply to an appeal certificate or sample. The findings of the appeal inspector as certificated shall be final, unless the Director shall direct a review of such findings.</p>
