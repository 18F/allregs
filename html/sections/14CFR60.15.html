                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For each FSTD, the sponsor must submit a request to the NSPM to evaluate the FSTD for initial qualification at a specific level and simultaneously request the Training Program Approval Authority (TPAA) forward a concurring letter to the NSPM. The request must be submitted in the form and manner described in the applicable QPS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The management representative described in Sec. 60.9(c) must sign a statement (electronic signature is acceptable for electronic transmissions) after confirming the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The performance and handling qualities of the FSTD represent those of the aircraft or set of aircraft within the normal operating envelope. This determination must be made by a pilot(s) meeting the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section after having flown all of the Operations Tasks listed in the applicable QPS appendix relevant to the qualification level of the FSTD. Exceptions, if any, must be noted. The name of the person(s) making this determination must be available to the NSPM upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The FSTD systems and sub-systems (including the simulated aircraft systems) functionally represent those in the aircraft or set of aircraft. This determination must be made by the pilot(s) described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or by a person(s) trained on simulator systems/sub-systems and trained on the operation of the simulated aircraft systems, after having exercised the operation of the FSTD and the pertinent functions available through the Instructor Operating Station(s). Exceptions, if any, must be noted. The name of the person(s) making this determination must be available to the NSPM upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The cockpit represents the configuration of the specific type; or aircraft make, model, and series aircraft being simulated, as appropriate. This determination must be made by the pilot(s) described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or by a person(s) trained on the configuration and operation of the aircraft simulated. Exceptions, if any, must be noted. The name of the person(s) making this determination must be available to the NSPM upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except for those FSTDs previously qualified and described in Sec. 60.17, each FSTD evaluated for initial qualification must meet the standard that is in effect at the time of the evaluation. However--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the FAA publishes a change to the existing standard or publishes a new standard for the evaluation for initial qualification, a sponsor may request that the NSPM apply the standard that was in effect when an FSTD was ordered for delivery if the sponsor--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Within 30 days of the publication of the change to the existing standard or publication of the new standard, notifies the NSPM that an FSTD has been ordered;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Within 90 days of the NSPM notification described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, requests that the standard in effect at the time the order was placed be used for the evaluation for initial qualification; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The evaluation is conducted within 24 months following the publication of the change to the existing standard or publication of the new standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This notification must include a description of the FSTD; the anticipated qualification level of the FSTD; the make, model, and series of aircraft simulated; and any other pertinent information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any tests, tolerances, or other requirements that are current at the time of the evaluation may be used during the initial evaluation, at the request of the sponsor, if the sponsor provides acceptable updates to the required qualification test guide.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The standards used for the evaluation for initial qualification will be used for all subsequent evaluations of the FSTD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The pilot(s) who contributes to the confirmation statement required by paragraph (b) of this section must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be designated by the sponsor; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be qualified in--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The aircraft or set of aircraft being simulated; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For aircraft not yet issued a type certificate, or aircraft not previously operated by the sponsor or not having previous FAA-approved training programs conducted by the sponsor, an aircraft similar in size and configuration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The subjective tests that form the basis for the statements described in paragraph (b) of this section and the objective tests referenced in paragraph (f) of this section must be accomplished at the sponsor's training facility, except as provided for in the applicable QPS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The person seeking to qualify the FSTD must provide the NSPM access to the FSTD for the length of time necessary for the NSPM to complete the required evaluation of the FSTD for initial qualification, which includes the conduct and evaluation of objective and subjective tests, including general FSTD requirements, as described in the applicable QPS, to determine that the FSTD meets the standards in that QPS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> When the FSTD passes an evaluation for initial qualification, the NSPM issues a Statement of Qualification that includes all of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification of the sponsor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identification of the make, model, and series of the aircraft or set of aircraft being simulated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identification of the configuration of the aircraft or set of aircraft being simulated (e.g., engine model or models, flight instruments, or navigation or other systems).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement that the FSTD is qualified as either a full flight simulator or a flight training device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Identification of the qualification level of the FSTD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A statement that (with the exception of the noted exclusions for which the FSTD has not been subjectively tested by the sponsor or the NSPM and for which qualification is not sought) the qualification of the FSTD includes the tasks set out in the applicable QPS appendix relevant to the qualification level of the FSTD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> After the NSPM completes the evaluation for initial qualification, the sponsor must update the Qualification Test Guide (QTG), with the results of the FAA-witnessed tests together with the results of all the objective tests described in the applicable QPS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Upon issuance of the Statement of Qualification the updated QTG becomes the Master Qualification Test Guide (MQTG). The MQTG must be made available to the NSPM upon request.</p>
