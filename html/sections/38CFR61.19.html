                            <p class="depth0">In the case of a previously awarded project that can no longer  provide services and/or housing and the recipient agency has decided to  withdraw or the project has been terminated for failure to comply with  the terms and conditions of the award, VA may transfer a capital grant  or non-capital grant to another eligible entity in the same geographical  area without competition, in order to prevent a loss of capacity of  services and housing to homeless veterans. The new entity must meet all  of the requirements to which the original grantee was subject. In the  case of a capital grant transfer the new grantee will only be entitled  to the funding that remains from the original capital obligation and  remains responsible for all commitments made by the original grantee.  (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501, 2011)</p>
