                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authorities designated in paragraph A, appendix E shall record the issuance, denial or revocation of a personnel security clearance in the DCII (see Sec. 154.43). A record of the clearance issued shall also be recorded in an individual's personnel/security file or official personnel folder, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A personnel security clearance remains valid until the individual is separated from the Armed Forces, separated from DoD civilian employment, has no further official relationship with DoD, official action has been taken to deny, revoke or suspend the clearance or access, or regular access to the level of classified information for which the individual holds a clearance is no longer necessary in the normal course of his or her duties. If an individual resumes his or her affiliation with DoD no single break in the individual's relationship with DoD exists greater than 24 months and/or, the need for regular access to classified information at or below the previous level recurs, and no record of an unfavorable administrative action exists, the appropriate clearance shall be reissued without further investigation or adjudication provided there has been no additional investigation or development of derogatory information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Personnel security clearances of DoD military personnel shall be granted denied or revoked only by the designated authority of the parent Military Department. Issuance, reissuance, denial, or revocation of a personnel security clearance by any DoD Component concerning personnel who have been determined to be eligible for clearance by another component is expressly prohibited. Investigations conducted on Army, Navy, and Air Force personnel by DIS will be returned only to the parent service of the subject for adjudication regardless of the source of the original request. The adjudicative authority will be responsible for expeditiously transmitting the results of the clearance determination. As an exception, the employing DoD Component may issue an interim clearance to personnel under their administrative jurisdiction pending a final eligibility determination by the individual's parent Component. Whenever an employing DoD Component issues an interim clearance to an individual from another Component, written notice of the action shall be provided to the parent Component.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When a Defense agency, to include Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, initiates an SBI (or PR) for access to SCI on a military member, DIS will return the completed investigation to the appropriate Military Department adjudicative authority in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section for issuance (or reissuance) of the Top Secret clearance. Following the issuance of the security clearance, the military adjudicative authority will forward the investigative file to the Defense agency identified in the ``Return Results To'' block of the DD Form 1879. The receiving agency will then forward the completed SBI on to DIA for the SCI adjudication in accordance with DCID 1/14.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The interim clearance shall be recorded in the DCSI (Sec. 154.43) by the parent DoD Component in the same manner as a final clearance.
