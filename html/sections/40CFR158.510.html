                            <p class="depth0">For nonfood use pesticides only, applicants have two options for  generating and submitting required toxicology (Sec. 158.500) and human  exposure (Sec. 158.1020, Sec. 158.1070, and Sec. 158.1410) studies.  Applicants are to select one of the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Acute, subchronic, chronic, and other toxicological studies on  the active ingredient must be submitted together. The specific makeup of  the set of toxicology study requirements is based on the anticipated  exposure to the pesticide as determined by the Agency. If hazards are  identified based upon review of these studies, specific exposure data  will be required to evaluate risk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Certain toxicological and exposure studies must be submitted  simultaneously with the toxicology data submitted in a tiered system.  Exposure data must be submitted along with first tier toxicology data.  The requirement for additional second and third level toxicology testing  will be determined by the Agency based on the results of the first  tiered studies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The required first-tier toxicology studies consist of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Battery of acute studies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A subchronic 90-day dermal study or a subchronic 90-day  inhalation study.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An acute and subchronic neurotoxicity screening battery in the  rat.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Prenatal developmental toxicity studies in both the rat and  rabbit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Reproduction and fertility studies in rats.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Battery of mutagenicity studies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Immunotoxicity study.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The conditionally required second-tier studies include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Subchronic 90-day feeding studies in both the rodent and  nonrodent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Dermal penetration study.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The conditionally required third-tier studies include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Chronic feeding studies in the rodent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Carcinogenicity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Metabolism study.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Additional mutagenicity testing.</p>
