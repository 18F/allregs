                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Treatment as debts or volunteer services. If a political  committee does not pay an employee for services rendered to the  political committee in accordance with an employment contract or a  formal or informal agreement to do so, the unpaid amount either may be  treated as a debt owed by the political committee to the employee or,  provided that the employee signs a written statement agreeing to be  considered a volunteer, converted to a volunteer services arrangement  under 11 CFR 100.74. The unpaid amount shall not be treated as a  contribution under 11 CFR part 100, subparts B and C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Settlement or forgiveness of the debt. If the unpaid amount is  treated as a debt, the employee and the political committee may agree to  a settlement of the debt for less than the entire amount owed pursuant  to 11 CFR 116.7. The provisions of this part shall not be construed to  require the employee to settle the debt for less than the entire amount  owed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reporting. If the unpaid amount is treated as a debt, the  political committee shall continue to report the debt in accordance with  11 CFR 104.3(d) and 104.11 until the Commission has completed a review  of the debt settlement plan pursuant to 11 CFR 116.7(f) or until the  employee agrees to be considered a volunteer, or until the political  committee pays the debt, whichever occurs first.
