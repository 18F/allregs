                                Sec. 622.172  Wreckfish individual transferable quota (ITQ) system.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The provisions of this section apply to wreckfish in or from the  South Atlantic EEZ.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Percentage shares--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Initial ITQ shares. In  accordance with the procedure specified in the Fishery Management Plan  for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic Region, percentage  shares of the quota for wreckfish were assigned at the beginning of the  program. Each person was notified by the RA of his or her percentage  share and shareholder certificate number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reverted ITQ shares. Any shares determined by NMFS to be  inactive, will be redistributed proportionately among remaining  shareholders (subject   to cap restrictions) based on shareholder landings history. Inactive  shares are, for purposes of this section, those shares held by ITQ  shareholders who have not reported any wreckfish landings between April  16, 2006, and January 14, 2011.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Percentage share set-aside to accommodate resolution of  appeals. During the 2012-2013 fishing year, the RA will reserve 1.401  percent of wreckfish ITQ shares prior to redistributing shares (see  paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section) to accommodate resolution of  appeals, if necessary. NMFS will distribute any portion of the 1.401- percent share remaining after the appeals process as soon as possible  among the remaining shareholders.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Procedure for appealing wreckfish quota share status and  landings information. Appeals must be submitted to the RA postmarked no  later than January 24, 2013, and must contain documentation supporting  the basis for the appeal. The only items subject to appeal are the  status of wreckfish quota shares, as active or inactive, and the  accuracy of the amount of landings. The RA will review and evaluate all  appeals, render final decisions on the appeals, and advise the appellant  of the final decision. Appeals based on hardship factors will not be  considered. The RA will determine the outcome of appeals based on NMFS'  logbooks. If NMFS' logbooks are not available, the RA may use state  landings records. Appellants must submit NMFS' logbooks or state  landings records, as appropriate, to support their appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Share transfers. All or a portion of a person's percentage  shares are transferrable. Transfer of shares must be reported on a form  available from the RA. The RA will confirm, in writing, each transfer of  shares. The effective date of each transfer is the confirmation date  provided by the RA. NMFS charges a fee for each transfer of shares and  calculates the amount in accordance with the procedures of the NOAA  Finance Handbook. The handbook is available from the RA. The fee may not  exceed such costs and is specified with each transfer form. The  appropriate fee must accompany each transfer form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ITQ share cap. No person, including a corporation or other  entity, may individually or collectively hold ITQ shares in excess of 49  percent of the total shares. For the purposes of considering the share  cap, a corporation's total ITQ share is determined by adding the  corporation's ITQ shares to any other ITQ shares the corporation owns in  another corporation. If an individual ITQ shareholder is also a  shareholder in a corporation that holds ITQ shares, an individual's  total ITQ share is determined by adding the applicable ITQ shares held  by the individual to the applicable ITQ shares equivalent to the  corporate share the individual holds in a corporation. A corporation  must provide the RA the identity of the shareholders of the corporation  and their percent of shares in the corporation, and provide updated  information to the RA within 30 days of when a change occurs. This  information must also be provided to the RA any time a commercial vessel  permit for wreckfish is renewed or transferred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> List of wreckfish shareholders. Annually, on or about March 1,  the RA will provide each wreckfish shareholder with a list of all  wreckfish shareholders and their percentage shares, reflecting share  transactions on forms received through February 15.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> ITQs. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Annually, as soon after March 1 as the TAC for  wreckfish for the fishing year that commences April 16 is known, the RA  will calculate each wreckfish shareholder's ITQ. Each ITQ is the product  of the wreckfish TAC, in round weight, for the ensuing fishing year, the  factor for converting round weight to eviscerated weight, and each  wreckfish shareholder's percentage share, reflecting share transactions  reported on forms received by the RA through February 15. Thus, the ITQs  will be in terms of eviscerated weight of wreckfish.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The RA will provide each wreckfish shareholder with ITQ coupons  in various denominations, the total of which equals his or her ITQ, and  a copy of the calculations used in determining his or her ITQ. Each  coupon will be coded to indicate the initial recipient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An ITQ coupon may be transferred from one wreckfish shareholder  to another by completing the sale endorsement thereon (that is, the  signature and shareholder certificate number of the buyer). An ITQ  coupon may be possessed only by the shareholder to whom it has been  issued, or by the shareholder's employee, contractor, or agent, unless  the ITQ coupon has been transferred to another shareholder. An ITQ  coupon that has been transferred to another shareholder may be possessed  only by the shareholder whose signature appears on the coupon as the  buyer, or by the shareholder's employee, contractor, or agent, and with  all required sale endorsements properly completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Wreckfish may not be possessed on board a fishing vessel that  has been issued a commercial vessel permit for South Atlantic snapper- grouper and a commercial vessel permit for wreckfish--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In an amount exceeding the total of the ITQ coupons on board the  vessel; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That does not have on board logbook forms for that fishing  trip, as required under Sec. 622.176(a)(3)(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Prior to termination of a trip, a signature and date signed must  be affixed in ink to the ``Fisherman'' part of ITQ coupons in  denominations equal to the eviscerated weight of the wreckfish on board.  The ``Fisherman'' part of each such coupon must be separated from the  coupon and submitted with the logbook forms required by  Sec. 622.176(a)(3)(i) for that fishing trip.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The ``Fish House'' part of each such coupon must be given to the  dealer to whom the wreckfish are transferred in amounts totaling the  eviscerated weight of the wreckfish transferred to that dealer.  Wreckfish may be transferred only to a Gulf and South Atlantic dealer  permit holder, as required under Sec. 622.170(c)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A dealer may first receive wreckfish only from a vessel for  which a commercial permit for wreckfish has been issued, as required  under Sec. 622.170(a)(2). A dealer must receive the ``Fish House'' part  of ITQ coupons in amounts totaling the eviscerated weight of the  wreckfish received; enter the permit number of the vessel from which the  wreckfish were received, enter the date the wreckfish were received,  enter the dealer's permit number, and sign each such ``Fish House''  part; and submit all such parts with the electronic dealer reports  required by Sec. 622.5(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> An owner or operator of a vessel and a dealer must make  available to an authorized officer all ITQ coupons in his or her  possession upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Wreckfish limitations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A wreckfish taken in the South  Atlantic EEZ may not be transferred at sea, regardless of where the  transfer takes place; and a wreckfish may not be transferred in the  South Atlantic EEZ.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A wreckfish possessed by a fisherman or dealer shoreward of the  outer boundary of the South Atlantic EEZ or in a South Atlantic coastal  state will be presumed to have been harvested from the South Atlantic  EEZ unless accompanied by documentation that it was harvested from other  than the South Atlantic EEZ.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A wreckfish harvested by a vessel that has been issued a  commercial vessel permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper and a  commercial vessel permit for wreckfish may be offloaded from a fishing  vessel only between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., local time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a wreckfish harvested by a vessel that has been issued a  commercial vessel permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper and a  commercial vessel permit for wreckfish is to be offloaded at a location  other than a fixed facility of a dealer who holds a Gulf and South  Atlantic dealer permit, as required under Sec. 622.170(c)(1), the  wreckfish shareholder or the vessel operator must advise the NMFS Office  for Law Enforcement, Southeast Region, St. Petersburg, FL, by telephone  (727-824-5344), of the location not less than 24 hours prior to  offloading.  [78 FR 22952, Apr. 17, 2013, as amended at 79 FR 19495, Apr. 9, 2014]    Secs. 622.173-622.175  [Reserved]</p>
