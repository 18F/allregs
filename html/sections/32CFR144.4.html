                            <p class="depth0">It is DoD policy to permit members of the Armed Forces to maximally  fulfill their civic responsibilities consistent with their military  duties. For Service members stationed in the United States, serving on a  State or local jury is one such civic obligation. Service members are  exempt from jury duty, when it unreasonably would interfere with  performance of their military duties or adversely affect the readiness  of a unit, command, or activity.</p>
