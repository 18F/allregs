                            <p class="depth0">The presiding officer shall file a recommended decision within 30 days after completion of proceedings on the application, and, promptly upon filing, shall serve a copy of the recommended decision upon each party to the proceedings. The decision shall include written findings and conclusions on the applicant's eligibility, status as a prevailing party, the recommended amount of the award, if any, and an explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount requested and the amount awarded. The decision shall also include, if at issue, findings on whether the FCA's position was substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the adversary adjudication, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust. If the applicant has sought an award against more than one agency, the decision shall allocate responsibility for payment of any award made among the agencies, and shall explain the reasons for the allocation made.</p>
