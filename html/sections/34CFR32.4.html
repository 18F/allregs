                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Voluntary repayment agreement. Within 7 days of receipt of the written notice under Sec. 32.3, the employee may submit a request to the Secretary to arrange for a voluntary repayment schedule. To arrange for a voluntary repayment schedule, the employee shall submit a financial statement and sign a written repayment agreement approved by the Secretary. An employee who arranges for a voluntary repayment schedule may nonetheless request a waiver of the overpayment under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Waiver. An employee seeking a waiver of collection of the debt that is authorized by law must request the waiver in writing to the Secretary within 10 days of receipt of the written notice under Sec. 32.3. The employee must state why he or she believes a waiver should be granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Involuntary repayment schedule. If the employee claims that the amount of the involuntary deduction will cause extreme financial hardship and should be reduced, he or she must submit a written explanation and a financial statement signed under oath or affirmation to the Secretary within 10 days of receipt of the written notice under Sec. 32.3. An employee who fails to submit this financial information in a timely manner waives the right to object to the involuntary repayment schedule at a hearing under Sec. 32.5. The Secretary notifies the employee, in writing, whether the Secretary will reduce the rate of the involuntary deduction.
