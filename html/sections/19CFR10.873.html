                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A good will be considered an originating good under the  OFTA when imported directly from the territory of a Party into the  territory of the other Party only if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The good is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of one or  both of the Parties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The good is a new or different article of commerce, as defined  in Sec. 10.872(i) of this subpart, that has been grown, produced, or  manufactured in the territory of one or both of the Parties, is provided  for in a heading or subheading of the HTSUS that is not covered by the  product-specific rules set forth in General Note 31(h), HTSUS,   and meets the value-content requirement specified in paragraph (b) of  this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The good is provided for in a heading or subheading of the HTSUS  covered by the product-specific rules set forth in General Note 31(h),  HTSUS, and:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Each of the non-originating materials used in the production  of the good undergoes an applicable change in tariff classification  specified in General Note 31(h), HTSUS, as a result of production  occurring entirely in the territory of one or both of the Parties; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The good otherwise satisfies the requirements specified in  General Note 31(h), HTSUS; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The good meets any other requirements specified in General Note  31, HTSUS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Value-content requirement. A good described in paragraph (a)(2)  of this section will be considered an originating good under the OFTA  only if the sum of the value of materials produced in one or both of the  Parties, plus the direct costs of processing operations performed in one  or both of the Parties, is not less than 35 percent of the appraised  value of the good at the time the good is entered into the territory of  the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Combining, packaging, and diluting operations. For purposes of  this subpart, a good will not be considered a new or different article  of commerce by virtue of having undergone simple combining or packaging  operations, or mere dilution with water or another substance that does  not materially alter the characteristics of the good. The principles and  examples set forth in Sec. 10.195(a)(2) of this part will apply equally  for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
