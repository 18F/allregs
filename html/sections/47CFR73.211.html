Class C stations must  have an antenna height above average terrain (HAAT) of at least 451  meters (1480 feet).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Stations of any class except Class A may have an ERP less than  that specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, provided that the  reference distance, determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of  this section, exceeds the distance to the class contour for the next  lower class. Class A stations may have an ERP less than 100 watts  provided that the reference distance, determined in accordance with  paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, equals or exceeds 6 kilometers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Maximum limits. (1) Except for stations located in Puerto Rico  or the Virgin Islands, the maximum ERP in any direction, reference HAAT,  and distance to the class contour for each FM station class are listed  below:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Class</p><p class="depth0">Reference     contour</p><p class="depth0">Station class             Maximum ERP           HAAT in     distance</p><p class="depth0">meters        in</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ft.)</em>     kilometers ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A..................  6 kW (7.8 dBk)............    100 (328)          28 B1.................  25 kW (14.0 dBk)..........    100 (328)          39 B..................  50 kW (17.0 dBk)..........    150 (492)          52 C3.................  25 kW (14.0 dBk)..........    100 (328)          39 C2.................  50 kW (17.0 dBk)..........    150 (492)          52 C1.................  100 kW (20.0 dBk).........    299 (981)          72 C0.................  100 kW (20.0 dBk).........   450 (1476)          83 C..................  100 kW (20.0 dBk).........   600 (1968)          92 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The reference distance of a station is obtained by finding the  predicted distance to the 1mV/m contour using Figure 1 of Sec.  73.333  and then rounding to the nearest kilometer. Antenna HAAT is determined  using the procedure in Sec.  73.313. If the HAAT so determined is less  than 30 meters (100 feet), a HAAT of 30 meters must be used when finding  the predicted distance to the 1 mV/m contour.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a station's ERP is equal to the maximum for its class, its  antenna HAAT must not exceed the reference HAAT, regardless of the  reference distance. For example, a Class A station operating with 6 kW  ERP may have an antenna HAAT of 100 meters, but not 101 meters, even  though the reference distance is 28 km in both cases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, no  station will be authorized in Zone I or I-A with an ERP equal to 50 kW  and a HAAT exceeding 150 meters. No station will be authorized in Zone  II with an ERP equal to 100 kW and a HAAT exceeding 600 meters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a station has an antenna HAAT greater than the reference HAAT  for its class, its ERP must be lower than the class maximum such that  the reference distance does not exceed the class contour distance. If  the antenna HAAT is so great that the station's ERP must be lower than  the minimum ERP for its class (specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3)  of this section), that lower ERP will become the minimum for that  station.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For stations located in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands, the  maximum ERP in any direction, reference HAAT, and distance to the class  contour for each FM station class are listed below:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Class</p><p class="depth0">Reference     contour</p><p class="depth0">Station class             Maximum ERP           HAAT in     distance</p><p class="depth0">meters        in</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ft.)</em>     kilometers ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A..................  6kW (7.8 dBk).............    240 (787)          42 B1.................  25kW (14.0 dBk)...........    150 (492)          46 B..................  50kW (17.0 dBk)...........   472 (1549)          78 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Existing stations. Stations authorized prior to March 1, 1984  that do not conform to the requirements of this section may continue to  operate as authorized. Stations operating with facilities in excess of  those specified in paragraph (b) of this section may not increase their  effective radiated powers or extend their 1 mV/m field strength contour  beyond the location permitted by their present authorizations. The  provisions of this section will not apply to applications to increase  facilities for those stations operating with less than the minimum power  specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Existing Class C stations below minimum antenna HAAT. Class C  stations authorized prior to January 19, 2001 that do not meet the  minimum antenna HAAT specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for  Class C stations may continue to operate as authorized subject to the  reclassification procedures set forth in Note 4 to Sec.  73.3573.
