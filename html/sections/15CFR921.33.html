NOAA  will publish notice of the proposed new site including an invitation for  comments from the public in the Federal Register. The state shall be  responsible for publishing an equivalent notice in the local  newspaper(s). An EIS, if required, shall be prepared in accordance with  section Sec. 921.13 and shall include an administrative framework for  the multiple-site Reserve and a description of the complementary  research and educational programs within the Reserve. If NOAA  determines, based on the scope of the project and the issues associated  with the additional site(s), that an environmental assessment is  sufficient to establish a multiple-site Reserve, then the state shall  develop a revised management plan which, concerning the additional  component, incorporates each of the elements described in Sec.  921.13(a). The revised management plan shall address goals and  objectives for all components of the multi-site Reserve and the  additional component's relationship to the original site(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The state shall revise the management plan for a Reserve at  least every five years, or more often if necessary. Management plan  revisions are subject to (a) above.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> NOAA will approve boundary changes, amendments to management  plans, or the addition of multiple-site components, by notice in the  Federal Register. If necessary NOAA will revise the designation document  (findings) for the site.</p>
