Late-filed acreage reports will be accepted as the Deputy Administrator determines appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The farm's crop acreage base shall be used to determine the farm's proportionate share.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The regulations at part 718 of this title shall apply to this subpart, except reconstitution of farms with a sugar crop acreage base shall not be allowed across State lines.
