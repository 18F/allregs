Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section, to the extent that any limitation or restriction is placed on the amount of a miscellaneous itemized deduction, that limitation shall apply prior to the application of the 2-percent floor.

The provisions of this paragraph (d) may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. For 1987 A, a Member of Congress, has adjusted gross income of $100,000, and miscellaneous itemized deductions of $10,750 of which $3,750 is for meals, $3,000 is for other living expenses, and $4,000 is for other miscellaneous itemized deductions (none of which is subject to any percentage limitations other than the 2-percent floor of section 67). The amount of A's business meal expenses that are disallowed under section 274(n) is $750 ($3,750x20%). The amount of A's miscellaneous itemized deductions that are disallowed under section 67 is $2,000 ($100,000x2%). The portion of the amount disallowed under section 67 that is allocated to A's living expenses is $1,200. This portion is equal to the amount of A's deductions for living expenses allowable after the application of section 274(n) and before the application of section 67 ($6,000) multiplied by the ratio of A's total miscellaneous itemized deductions disallowed under section 67 to A's total miscellaneous itemized deductions, determined without regard to the $3,000 limitation of section 162(a) ($2,000/$10,000). Thus, after application of section 274(n) and section 67, A's deduction for living expenses is $4,800 ($6,750-$750-$1,200). However, pursuant to section 162(a), A may deduct only $3,000 of such expenses. The amount of A's other miscellaneous itemized deductions that are disallowed under section 67 is $800 ($4,000x$2,000/$10,000). Thus, $3,200 ($4,000-$800) of A's miscellaneous itemized deductions (other than deductions for living expenses) are allowable after application of section 67. A's total allowable miscellaneous itemized deductions are $6,200 ($3,000+$3,200).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> State legislators.

In general, for purposes of this section the term ``affected RIC expenses'' means the excess of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The aggregate amount of the expenses (other than expenses described in sections 62(a)(3) and 67(b) and Sec. 1.67-1T(b)) paid or incurred in the calendar year that are allowable as a deduction in determining the investment company taxable income (without regard to section 852(b)(2)(D)) of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company for a taxable year that begins or ends with or within the calendar year, over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of expenses taken into account under paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section that are allocable to the following items (whether paid separately or included as part of a fee paid to an investment advisor or other person for a variety of services):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Registration fees;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Directors' or trustees' fees;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Periodic meetings of directors, trustees, or shareholders;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Transfer agent fees;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Legal and accounting fees (other than fees for income tax return preparation or income tax advice); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Shareholder communications required by law (e.g. the preparation and mailing of prospectuses and proxy statements).
Expenses described in paragraph (j)(1)(ii) (A) through (F) of this section do not include, for example, expenses allocable to investment advice, marketing activities, shareholder communications and other services not specifically described in paragraph (j)(1)(ii) (A) through (F) of this section, and custodian fees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Safe harbor. If a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company makes an election under this paragraph (j)(2), the affected RIC expenses for a calendar year shall be treated as equal to 40 percent of the amount determined under paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section for that calendar year. The nonpublicly offered regulated investment company shall make the election by attaching to its income tax return for the taxable year that includes the last day of the first calendar year for which the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company makes the

election a statement that it is making an election under paragraph (j)(2) of this section. An election made pursuant to this paragraph (j)(2) shall remain in effect for all subsequent calendar years unless revoked with the consent of the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reduction for unused RIC expenses. The amount determined under paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section shall be reduced by the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company's net operating loss, if any, for the taxable year ending with or within the calendar year. In computing the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company's net operating loss for purposes of this section, the deduction for dividends paid shall not be allowed and any net capital gain for the taxable year shall be excluded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Exception. The affected RIC expenses of a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company will be treated as zero if the amount of its gross income for the calendar year (determined without regard to capital gain net income) is not greater than 1 percent of the sum of (i) such gross income and (ii) the amount of its interest income for the calendar year that is not includible in gross income pursuant to section 103.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Allocation of expenses among nonpublicly offered regulated investment company shareholders--(1) General rule. A nonpublicly offered regulated investment company shall allocate to each of its affected investors that is a shareholder at any time during the calendar year, the affected investor's allocable share of the affected RIC expenses of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company for that calendar year. (See paragraph (m) of this section for rules regarding estimates with respect to the amount of an affected investor's share of affected RIC expenses upon which certain persons can rely for certain purposes.) A nonpublicly offered regulated investment company may use any reasonable method to make the allocation. A method of allocation shall not be reasonable if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. A nonpublicly offered regulated investment company shall allocate to each of its affected investors that is a shareholder at any time during the calendar year, the affected investor's allocable share of the affected RIC expenses of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company for that calendar year. (See paragraph (m) of this section for rules regarding estimates with respect to the amount of an affected investor's share of affected RIC expenses upon which certain persons can rely for certain purposes.) A nonpublicly offered regulated investment company may use any reasonable method to make the allocation. A method of allocation shall not be reasonable if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The method can be expected to have the effect, if applied to all affected RIC expenses and all shareholders (whether or not affected investors), of allocating to the shareholders an amount of affected RIC expenses that is less than the affected RIC expenses of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company for the calendar year,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The method can be expected to have the effect of allocating a disproportionately high share of the affected RIC expenses of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company to shareholders that are not affected investors or affected investors, the amount of whose miscellaneous itemized deductions (including their allocable share of affected RIC expenses) exceeds the 2-percent floor described in section 67, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A principal purpose of the method of allocation is to avoid allocating affected RIC expenses to persons described in paragraph (h)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section whose miscellaneous itemized deductions (inclusive of their allocable share of affected RIC expenses) may not exceed the 2-percent floor described in section 67.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reasonable allocation method described--(i) In general. The allocation method described in this paragraph (k)(2) shall be treated as a reasonable allocation method. Under the method described in this paragraph, an affected investor's allocable share of the affected RIC expenses of a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company is the amount that bears the same ratio to the amount of affected RIC expenses of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company for the calendar year as--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The allocation method described in this paragraph (k)(2) shall be treated as a reasonable allocation method. Under the method described in this paragraph, an affected investor's allocable share of the affected RIC expenses of a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company is the amount that bears the same ratio to the amount of affected RIC expenses of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company for the calendar year as--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount of dividends paid to the affected investor during the calendar year, bears to</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The aggregate amount of dividends paid by the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company during the calendar year to all shareholders, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any amount on which tax is imposed under section 852(b)(1) for any taxable year of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company ending within or with the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception. Paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section does not apply if the amount of the deduction for dividends paid during the calendar year is zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Dividends paid. For purposes of this paragraph (k)(2)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Dividends that are treated as paid during a calendar year pursuant to section 852(b)(7) are treated as paid during that calendar year and not during the succeeding calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The term ``dividends paid'' does not include capital gain dividends (as defined in section 852(b)(3)(C)), exempt-interest dividends (as defined in section 852(b)(5)(A)), or any amount to which section 302(a) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The dividends paid during a calendar year is determined without regard to section 855(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reasonable allocation made by District Director. If a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company does not make a reasonable allocation of affected RIC expenses to its affected investors as required by paragraph (k)(1) of this section, a reasonable allocation shall be made by the District Director of the internal revenue district in which the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company is located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (k) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Nonpublicly offered regulated investment company M, in calculating its investment company taxable income, claims a dividends paid deduction for a portion of redemption distributions (to which section 302(a) applies) to shareholders, as well as for nonredemption distributions. M allocates affected expenses among shareholders who have received nonredemption distributions by multiplying the amount of nonredemption distributions distributed to each shareholder by a fraction, the numerator of which is the affected RIC expenses of M and the denominator of which is M's investment company taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis and without regard to deductions described in section 852(b)(2)(D). No affected RIC expenses are allocated with respect to the redemption distributions. This allocation method can be expected to have the effect of allocating among the shareholders an amount of expenses that is less than the total amount of affected RIC expenses of M. Accordingly, the allocation method is not reasonable.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Nonpublicly offered regulated investment company N has two classes of stock, a ``capital'' class and an ``income'' class. Owners of the capital class receive the benefit of all capital appreciation on the stocks owned by N, and bear the burden of certain capital expenditures of N; owners of the income class receive the benefit of all other income of N, and bear the burden of all expenses of N that are deductible under section 162. M allocates all affected RIC expenses among shareholders of the income class shares under a method that would be reasonable if the income class were the only class of N stock. Corporations and other shareholders that are not affected investors own a higher proportion of income class shares than of capital class shares. The affected RIC expenses of N are properly allocated among the shareholders who bear the burden of those expenses. Accordingly, the allocation method does not have the effect of allocating a disproportionately high share of the affected RIC expenses of N to shareholders that are not affected investors merely because a disproportionate share of income class shares are owned by shareholders that are not affected investors. The allocation method is reasonable.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Nonpublicly offered regulated investment company O has two classes of stock, Class A and Class B. Shares of Class A, which may be purchased without payment of a sales or brokerage commission, are charged with the expenses of a Rule 12b-1 distribution plan of O. Shares of Class B, which may be purchased only upon payment of a sales or brokerage commission, are not charged with the expenses of the Rule 12b-1 distribution plan of O. O allocates all affected RIC expenses among shareholders of Class A and Class B shares under a method that would be reasonable if Class A or Class B shares, respectively, were the only class of O stock. The affected RIC expenses attributable to the Rule 12b-1 plan are allocated to the shareholders of Class A shares. Shareholders that are not affected investors own a higher proportion of Class A shares than of Class B shares. The affected RIC expenses of O are properly allocated among the shareholders who bear the burden of those expenses. Accordingly, the allocation method does not have the effect of allocating a disproportionately high share of the affected RIC expenses of O to shareholders that are not affected investors merely because a disproportionately high share of Class A shares are owned by persons that are not affected investors. The allocation method is reasonable.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the facts are the same as in example (3) except that a portion of the affected RIC expenses attributable to the Rule 12b-1 plan are allocated to the shareholders of Class B shares, and shareholders that are not affected investors own a higher proportion of Class B shares than of Class A shares. Thus, the affected RIC expenses are not allocated among the class of shareholders that bear the burden of the expenses. Accordingly, the allocation method has the

effect of allocating a disproportionate share of the affected RIC expenses of O to the shareholders of Class B shares. Because shareholders that are not affected investors own a higher proportion of Class B shares than Class A shares, the method can be expected to allocate a disproportionately high share of the affected RIC expenses of O to shareholders that are not affected investors. Accordingly, the allocation method is not reasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Affected RIC expenses not subject to backup withholding. The amount of dividend income that an affected investor in a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company is treated as having received or accrued under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section is not subject to backup withholding under section 3406.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Reliance by nominees and pass-through investors on notices--(1) General rule. Persons described in paragraph (m)(3) of this section may, for the purposes described in that paragraph (m)(3), treat an affected investor's allocable share of the affected RIC expenses of a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company as being equal to an amount determined by the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company on the basis of a reasonable estimate (e.g., of allocable expenses as a percentage of dividend distributions or allocable expenses per share) that is (i) reported in writing by the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company to the person or (ii) reported in a newspaper or financial publication having a nationwide circulation (e.g., the Wall Street Journal or Standard and Poor's Weekly Dividend Record).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Persons described in paragraph (m)(3) of this section may, for the purposes described in that paragraph (m)(3), treat an affected investor's allocable share of the affected RIC expenses of a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company as being equal to an amount determined by the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company on the basis of a reasonable estimate (e.g., of allocable expenses as a percentage of dividend distributions or allocable expenses per share) that is (i) reported in writing by the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company to the person or (ii) reported in a newspaper or financial publication having a nationwide circulation (e.g., the Wall Street Journal or Standard and Poor's Weekly Dividend Record).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Estimates must be reasonable. In general, for purposes of paragraph (m)(1) of this section, estimates of affected RIC expenses of a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company will be treated as reasonable only if the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company makes a reasonable effort to offset material understatements (or overstatements) of affected RIC expenses for a period by increasing (or decreasing) estimates of affected RIC expenses for a subsequent period. Understatements or overstatements of affected RIC expenses that are not material may be corrected by making offsetting adjustments in future periods, provided that understatements and overstatements are treated consistently.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Application. Paragraph (m)(1) of this section shall apply to the following persons for the following purposes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A nominee who, pursuant to section 6042(a)(1)(B) and paragraph (n)(2) of this section, is required to report dividends paid by a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company to the Internal Revenue Service and to the person to whom the payment is made, for purposes of reporting to the Internal Revenue Service and the person to whom the payment is made the amount of affected RIC expenses allocated to such person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An affected investor to whom a nominee (to which paragraph (m)(3)(i) of this section applies) reports, for purposes of calculating the affected investor's taxable income and the amount of its affected expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A shareholder that is a pass-through entity, for purposes of calculating its taxable income and the amount of its affected expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Return of information and reporting to affected investors by a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company--(1) In general--(i) Return of information.
