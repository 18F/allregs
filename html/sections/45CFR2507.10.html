                            <p class="depth0">Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to  any person requesting such record after deletion of portions which are  exempt under this section. The following categories are examples of  records maintained by the Corporation which, under the provision of 5  U.S.C. 552(b), are exempted from disclosure:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Records required to be withheld under criteria established by an  Executive Order in the interest of national defense and policy and which  are in fact properly classified pursuant to any such Executive Order.  Included in this category are records required by Executive Order No.  12958 (3 CFR, 1995 Comp., p. 333), as amended, to be classified in the  interest of national defense or foreign policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Records related solely to internal personnel rules and  practices. Included in this category are internal rules and regulations  relating to personnel management operations which cannot be disclosed to  the public without substantial prejudice to the effective performance of  significant functions of the Corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Information of a commercial or financial nature including trade  secrets given in confidence. Included in this category are records  containing commercial or financial information obtained from any person  and customarily regarded as privileged and confidential by the person  from whom they were obtained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Interagency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not  be available by law to a party other than a party in litigation with the  Corporation. Included in this category are memoranda, letters, inter- agency and intra-agency communications and internal drafts, opinions and  interpretations prepared by staff or consultants and records meant to be  used as part of deliberations by staff, or ordinarily used in arriving  at policy determinations and decisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Personnel, medical and similar files. Included in this category  are personnel and medical information files of staff, individual  national service applicants and participants, lists of names and home  addresses, and other files or material containing private or personal  information, the public disclosure of which would amount to a clearly  unwarranted invasion of the privacy of any person to whom the  information pertains.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Investigatory files. Included in this category are files  compiled for the enforcement of all laws, or prepared in connection with  government litigation and adjudicative proceedings, provided however,  that such records shall be made available to the extent that their  production will not:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interfere with enforcement proceedings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial  adjudication;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Disclose the identity of a confidential source, and in the case  of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the  course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful  security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished  by confidential source;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Disclose investigative techniques and procedures; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement  personnel.</p>
