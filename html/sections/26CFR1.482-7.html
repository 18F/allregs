                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The arm's length amount charged in a controlled  transaction reasonably anticipated to contribute to developing  intangibles pursuant to a cost sharing arrangement (CSA), as described  in paragraph (b) of this section, must be determined under a method  described in this section. Each method must be applied in accordance  with the provisions of Sec. 1.482-1, except as those provisions are  modified in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> of this  section, share intangible development costs (IDCs) in proportion to   their shares of reasonably anticipated benefits (RAB shares) by entering  into cost sharing transactions (CSTs).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(iii)</em>  (Coordination of methods applicable to certain intangible development  arrangements), and paragraph (g) of this section (Supplemental guidance  on methods applicable to PCTs).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Methods for other controlled transactions--(i) Contribution to a  CSA by a controlled taxpayer that is not a controlled participant. If a  controlled taxpayer that is not a controlled participant contributes to  developing a cost shared intangible, as defined in section (j)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of  this section, it must receive consideration from the controlled  participants under the rules of Sec. 1.482-4(f)(4) (Contribution to the  value of an intangible owned by another). Such consideration will be  treated as an intangible development cost for purposes of paragraph (d)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transfer of interest in a cost shared intangible. If at any  time (during the term, or upon or after the termination, of a CSA) a  controlled participant transfers an interest in a cost shared intangible  to another controlled taxpayer, the controlled participant must receive  an arm's length amount of consideration from the transferee under the  rules of Secs. 1.482-4 through 1.482-6 as supplemented by paragraph  (f)(4) of this section regarding arm's length consideration for a change  in participation. For this purpose, a capability variation described in  paragraph (f)(3) of this section is considered to be a controlled  transfer of interests in cost shared intangibles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other controlled transactions in connection with a CSA.  Controlled transactions between controlled participants that are not  PCTs or CSTs and are not described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this  section (for example, provision of a cross operating contribution, as  defined in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section, or make-or-sell rights,  as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section) require arm's length  consideration under the rules of Secs. 1.482-1 through 1.482-6, and  1.482-9 as supplemented by paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Controlled transactions in the absence of a CSA. If a  controlled transaction is reasonably anticipated to contribute to  developing intangibles pursuant to an arrangement that is not a CSA  described in paragraph (b)(1) or (5) of this section, whether the  results of any such controlled transaction are consistent with an arm's  length result must be determined under the applicable rules of the other  sections of the regulations under section 482. For example, an  arrangement for developing intangibles in which one controlled  taxpayer's costs of developing the intangibles significantly exceeds its  share of reasonably anticipated benefits from exploiting the developed  intangibles would not in substance be a CSA, as described in paragraphs  (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section or paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this  section. In such a case, unless the rules of this section are applicable  by reason of paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the arrangement must be  analyzed under other applicable sections of regulations under section  482 to determine whether it achieves arm's length results, and if not,  to determine any allocations by the Commissioner that are consistent  with such other regulations under section 482. See Sec. 1.482- 1(b)(2)(ii) (Selection of category of method applicable to transaction)  and (iii) (Coordination of methods applicable to certain intangible  development arrangements).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> of this  section) equals its RAB share, each controlled participant compensates  its RAB share of the value of all platform contributions by other  controlled participants,   and all other requirements of this section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> through (4) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Substantive requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> CSTs. All controlled participants  must commit to, and in fact, engage in cost sharing transactions. In  CSTs, the controlled participants make payments to each other (CST  Payments) as appropriate, so that in each taxable year each controlled  participant's IDC share is in proportion to its respective RAB share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> PCTs. All controlled participants must commit to, and in fact,  engage in platform contributions transactions to the extent that there  are platform contributions pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. In  a PCT, each other controlled participant (PCT Payor) is obligated to,  and must in fact, make arm's length payments (PCT Payments) to each  controlled participant (PCT Payee) that provides a platform  contribution. For guidance on determining such arm's length obligation,  see paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Divisional interests. Each controlled participant must receive  a non-overlapping interest in the cost shared intangibles without  further obligation to compensate another controlled participant for such  interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (b)(1):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Company A and Company B, who are members of the same  controlled group, execute an agreement to jointly develop vaccine X and  own the exclusive rights to commercially exploit vaccine X in their  respective territories, which together comprise the whole world. The  agreement provides that they will share some, but not all, of the costs  for developing Vaccine X in proportion to RAB share. Such agreement is  not a CSA because Company A and Company B have not agreed to share all  of the IDCs in proportion to their respective RAB shares.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Company A and Company B agree to share all the costs of  developing Vaccine X. The agreement also provides for employing certain  resources and capabilities of Company A in this program including a  skilled research team and certain research facilities, and provides for  Company B to make payments to Company A in this respect. However, the  agreement expressly provides that the program will not employ, and so  Company B is expressly relieved of the payments in regard to, certain  software developed by Company A as a medical research tool to model  certain cellular processes expected to be implicated in the operation of  Vaccine X even though such software would reasonably be anticipated to  be relevant to developing Vaccine X and, thus, would be a platform  contribution. See paragraph (c) of this section. Such agreement is not a  CSA because Company A and Company B have not engaged in a necessary PCT  for purposes of developing Vaccine X.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Companies C and D, who are members of the same controlled  group, enter into a CSA. In the first year of the CSA, C and D conduct  the intangible development activity, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of  this section. The total IDCs in regard to such activity are $3,000,000  of which C and D pay $2,000,000 and $1,000,000, respectively, directly  to third parties. As between C and D, however, their CSA specifies that  they will share all IDCs in accordance with their RAB shares (as  described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section), which are 60% for C and  40% for D. It follows that C should bear $1,800,000 of the total IDCs  (60% of total IDCs of $3,000,000) and D should bear $1,200,000 of the  total IDCs (40% of total IDCs of $3,000,000). D makes a CST payment to C  of $200,000, that is, the amount by which D's share of IDCs in  accordance with its RAB share exceeds the amount of IDCs initially borne  by D ($1,200,000-$1,000,000), and which also equals the amount by which  the total IDCs initially borne by C exceeds its share of IDCS in  accordance with its RAB share ($2,000,000--$1,800,000). As a result of  D's CST payment to C, the IDC shares of C and D are in proportion to  their respective RAB shares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Administrative requirements. The CSA must meet the requirements  of paragraph (k) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Date of a PCT. The controlled participants must enter into a PCT  as of the earliest date on or after the CSA is entered into on which a  platform contribution is reasonably anticipated to contribute to  developing cost shared intangibles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Divisional interests--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Pursuant to paragraph  (b)(1)(iii) of this section, each controlled participant must receive a  non-overlapping interest in the cost shared intangibles without further  obligation to compensate another controlled participant for such   interest. Each controlled participant must be entitled to the perpetual  and exclusive right to the profits from transactions of any member of  the controlled group that includes the controlled participant with  uncontrolled taxpayers to the extent that such profits are attributable  to such interest in the cost shared intangibles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Territorial based divisional interests. The CSA may divide all  interests in cost shared intangibles on a territorial basis as follows.  The entire world must be divided into two or more non-overlapping  geographic territories. Each controlled participant must receive at  least one such territory, and in the aggregate all the participants must  receive all such territories. Each controlled participant will be  assigned the perpetual and exclusive right to exploit the cost shared  intangibles through the use, consumption, or disposition of property or  services in its territories. Thus, compensation will be required if  other members of the controlled group exploit the cost shared  intangibles in such territory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Field of use based divisional interests. The CSA may divide  all interests in cost shared intangibles on the basis of all uses  (whether or not known at the time of the division) to which cost shared  intangibles are to be put as follows. All anticipated uses of cost  shared intangibles must be identified. Each controlled participant must  be assigned at least one such anticipated use, and in the aggregate all  the participants must be assigned all such anticipated uses. Each  controlled participant will be assigned the perpetual and exclusive  right to exploit the cost shared intangibles through the use or uses  assigned to it and one controlled participant must be assigned the  exclusive and perpetual right to exploit cost shared intangibles through  any unanticipated uses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Other divisional bases. (A) In the event that the CSA does not  divide interests in the cost shared intangibles on the basis of  exclusive territories or fields of use as described in paragraphs  (b)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the CSA may adopt some other basis  on which to divide all interests in the cost shared intangibles among  the controlled participants, provided that each of the following  criteria is met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The basis clearly and unambiguously divides all interests in  cost shared intangibles among the controlled participants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The consistent use of such basis for the division of all  interests in the cost shared intangibles can be dependably verified from  the records maintained by the controlled participants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The rights of the controlled participants to exploit cost shared  intangibles are non-overlapping, exclusive, and perpetual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The resulting benefits associated with each controlled  participant's interest in cost shared intangibles are predictable with  reasonable reliability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> See paragraph (f)(3) of this section for rules regarding the  requirement of arm's length consideration for changes in participation  in CSAs involving divisions of interest described in this paragraph  (b)(4)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (b)(4):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Companies P and S, both members of the same controlled  group, enter into a CSA to develop product Z. Under the CSA, P receives  the interest in product Z in the United States and S receives the  interest in product Z in the rest of the world, as described in  paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section. Both P and S have plants for  manufacturing product Z located in their respective geographic  territories. However, for commercial reasons, product Z is nevertheless  manufactured by P in the United States for sale to customers in certain  locations just outside the United States in close proximity to P's U.S.  manufacturing plant. Because S owns the territorial rights outside the  United States, P must compensate S to ensure that S realizes all the  cost shared intangible profits from P's sales of product Z in S's  territory. The pricing of such compensation must also ensure that P  realizes an appropriate return for its manufacturing efforts. Benefits  projected with respect to such sales will be included for purposes of  estimating S's, but not P's, RAB share.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that P and  S agree to divide their interest in product Z based on site of  manufacturing. P will have exclusive and perpetual rights in product Z  manufactured in facilities owned by P. S will have exclusive and  perpetual rights to product Z manufactured in facilities owned by S. P  and S agree that neither will license manufacturing rights in product Z  to any related or   unrelated party. Both P and S maintain books and records that allow  production at all sites to be verified. Both own facilities that will  manufacture product Z and the relative capacities of these sites are  known. All facilities are currently operating at near capacity and are  expected to continue to operate at near capacity when product Z enters  production so that it will not be feasible to shift production between  P's and S's facilities. P and S have no plans to build new facilities  and the lead time required to plan and build a manufacturing facility  precludes the possibility that P or S will build a new facility during  the period for which sales of Product Z are expected. Based on these  facts, this basis for the division of interests in Product Z is a  division described in paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section. The basis  for the division of interest is unambiguous and clearly defined and its  use can be dependably verified. P and S both have non-overlapping,  exclusive and perpetual rights in Product Z. The division of interest  results in the participant's relative benefits being predictable with  reasonable reliability.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2 except that P's  and S's manufacturing facilities are not expected to operate at full  capacity when product Z enters production. Production of Product Z can  be shifted at any time between sites owned by P and sites owned by S,  although neither P nor S intends to shift production as a result of the  agreement. The division of interests in Product Z between P and S based  on manufacturing site is not a division described in paragraph  (b)(4)(iv) of this section because their relative shares of benefits are  not predictable with reasonable reliability. The fact that neither P nor  S intends to shift production is irrelevant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Treatment of certain arrangements as CSAs--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Situation in  which Commissioner must treat arrangement as a CSA. The Commissioner  must apply the rules of this section to an arrangement among controlled  taxpayers if the administrative requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this  section are met with respect to such arrangement and the controlled  taxpayers reasonably concluded that such arrangement was a CSA meeting  the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1), (3), and (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, any such arrangement shall be  interpreted by reference to paragraph (k)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (b)(5). In the examples, assume that Companies P and S  are both members of the same controlled group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P owns the patent on a formula for a capsulated pain  reliever, P-Cap. P reasonably anticipates, pending further research and  experimentation, that the P-Cap formula could form the platform for a  formula for P-Ves, an effervescent version of P-Cap. P also owns  proprietary software that it reasonably anticipates to be critical to  the research efforts. P and S execute a contract that purports to be a  CSA by which they agree to proportionally share the costs and risks of  developing a formula for P-Ves. The agreement reflects the various  contractual requirements described in paragraph (k)(1) of this section  and P and S comply with the documentation, accounting, and reporting  requirements of paragraphs (k)(2) through (4) of this section. Both the  patent rights for P-Cap and the software are reasonably anticipated to  contribute to the development of P-Ves and therefore are platform  contributions for which compensation is due from S as part of PCTs.  Though P and S enter into and implement a PCT for the P-Cap patent  rights that satisfies the arm's length standard, they fail to enter into  a PCT for the software.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> and (b)(3) of this section, for the software that  was reasonably anticipated to contribute to the development of P-Ves  (see paragraph (c) of this section), they cannot reasonably conclude  that their arrangement was a CSA. Accordingly, the Commissioner is not  required under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section to apply the rules of  this section to their arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Nevertheless, the arrangement between P and S closely  resembles a CSA. If   the Commissioner concludes that the rules of this section provide the  most reliable measure of an arm's length result for such arrangement,  then pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, the Commissioner  may apply the rules of this section and treat P and S as entering into a  PCT for the software in accordance with the requirements of paragraph  (b)(1)(ii) of this section, and make any appropriate allocations under  paragraph (i) of this section. Alternatively, the Commissioner may  conclude that the rules of this section do not provide the most reliable  measure of an arm's length result. In such case, the arrangement would  be analyzed under the methods under other sections of the 482  regulations to determine whether the arrangement reaches an arm's length  result.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that P and  S do enter into and implement a PCT for the software as required under  this paragraph (b). The Commissioner determines that the PCT Payments  for the software were not arm's length; nevertheless, under the facts  and circumstances at the time they entered into the CSA and PCTs, P and  S reasonably concluded their arrangement to be a CSA. Because P and S  have met the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section and  reasonably concluded their arrangement is a CSA, pursuant to paragraph  (b)(5)(i) of this section, the Commissioner must apply the rules of this  section to their arrangement. Accordingly, the Commissioner treats the  arrangement as a CSA and makes adjustments to the PCT Payments as  appropriate under this section to achieve an arm's length result for the  PCT for the software.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that P  and S do enter into a PCT for the software as required under this  paragraph (b). The agreement entered into by P and S provides for a  fixed consideration of $50 million per year for four years, payable at  the end of each year. This agreement satisfies the arm's length  standard. However, S actually pays P consideration at the end of each  year in the form of four annual royalties equal to two percent of sales.  While such royalties at the time of the PCT were expected to be $50  million per year, actual sales during the first year were less than  anticipated and the first royalty payment was only $25 million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this case, P and S failed to implement the terms of their  agreement. Under these circumstances, P and S could not reasonably  conclude that their arrangement was a CSA, as described in paragraph  (b)(1) of this section. Accordingly, the Commissioner is not required  under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section to apply the rules of this  section to their arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Nevertheless, the arrangement between P and S closely  resembles a CSA. If the Commissioner concludes that the rules of this  section provide the most reliable measure of an arm's length result for  such arrangement, then pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section,  the Commissioner may apply the rules of this section and make any  appropriate allocations under paragraph (i) of this section.  Alternatively, the Commissioner may conclude that the rules of this  section do not provide the most reliable measure of an arm's length  result. In such case, the arrangement would be analyzed under the  methods under other sections of the 482 regulations to determine whether  the arrangement reaches an arm's length result.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that P  does not own proprietary software and P and S use a method for  determining the arm's length amount of the PCT Payment for the P-Cap  patent rights different from the method used in Example 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section, and reduces the  reliability of the method used by P and S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The method used by P and S employs a declining royalty. The  royalty starts at 8% of sales, based on an application of the CUT method  in which the purported CUTs all involve licenses to manufacture and sell  the current generation of P-Cap, and declines to 0% over eight years,  declining by 1% each year. Such make-or-sell rights are fundamentally  different from use of the P-Cap patent rights to generate a new product.  This difference raises the issue of whether the make-or-sell rights are  sufficiently comparable to the rights that are the subject of the PCT  Payment. See Sec. 1.482-4(c). While a royalty rate for make-or-sell  rights can form the basis for a reliable determination of an arm's  length PCT Payment in the CUT-based   implementation of the income method described in paragraph (g)(4) of  this section, under that method such royalty rate does not decline to  zero. Therefore, the use of a declining royalty rate based on an initial  rate for make-or-sell rights further reduces the reliability of the  method used by P and S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Sales of the next-generation product are not anticipated until  after seven years, at which point the royalty rate will have declined to  1%. The temporal mismatch between the period of the royalty rate decline  and the period of exploitation raises further concerns about the  method's reliability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For the reasons given in paragraphs (ii) through (iv) of this  Example 4, the method used by P and S is so unreliable and so contrary  to provisions of this section that P and S could not reasonably conclude  that they had contracted to make arm's length PCT Payments as required  by paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(3) of this section, and thus could not  reasonably conclude that their arrangement was a CSA. Accordingly, the  Commissioner is not required under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section  to apply the rules of this section to their arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Nevertheless, the arrangement between P and S closely resembles  a CSA. If the Commissioner concludes that the rules of this section  provide the most reliable measure of an arm's length result for such  arrangement, then pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, the  Commissioner may apply the rules of this section and make any  appropriate allocations under paragraph (i) of this section.  Alternatively, the Commissioner may conclude that the rules of this  section do not provide the most reliable measure of an arm's length  result. In such case, the arrangement would be analyzed under the  methods under other section 482 regulations to determine whether the  arrangement reaches an arm's length result.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Entity classification of CSAs. See Sec. 301.7701-1(c) of this  chapter for the classification of CSAs for purposes of the Internal  Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em>, platform contributions do not  include rights in land or depreciable tangible property, and do not  include rights in other resources acquired by IDCs. See paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Terms of platform contributions--(i) Presumed to be exclusive.  For purposes of a PCT, the PCT Payee's provision of a platform  contribution is presumed to be exclusive. Thus, it is presumed that the  platform resource, capability, or right is not reasonably anticipated to  be committed to any business activities other than the CSA Activity, as  defined in paragraph (j)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section, whether carried out by  the controlled participants, other controlled taxpayers, or uncontrolled  taxpayers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rebuttal of exclusivity. The controlled participants may rebut  the presumption set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section to the  satisfaction of the Commissioner. For example, if the platform resource  is a research tool, then the controlled participants could rebut the  presumption by establishing to the satisfaction of the Commissioner  that, as of the date of the PCT, the tool is reasonably anticipated not  only to contribute to the CSA Activity but also to be licensed to an  uncontrolled taxpayer. In such case, the PCT Payments may need to be  prorated as described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Proration of PCT Payments to the extent allocable to other  business activities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Some transfer pricing methods  employed to determine the arm's length amount of the PCT Payments do so  by considering the overall value of the platform contributions as  opposed to, for example, the   value of the anticipated use of the platform contributions in the CSA  Activity. Such a transfer pricing method is consistent with the  presumption that the platform contribution is exclusive (that is, that  the resources, capabilities or rights that are the subject of a platform  contribution are reasonably anticipated to contribute only to the CSA  Activity). See paragraph (c)(2)(i) (Terms of platform contributions-- Presumed to be exclusive) of this section. The PCT Payments determined  under such transfer pricing method may have to be prorated if the  controlled participants can rebut the presumption that the platform  contribution is exclusive to the satisfaction of the Commissioner as  provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. In the case of a  platform contribution that also contributes to lines of business of a  PCT Payor that are not reasonably anticipated to involve exploitation of  the cost shared intangibles, the need for explicit proration may in some  cases be avoided through aggregation of transactions. See paragraph  (g)(2)(iv) of this section (Aggregation of transactions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Determining the proration of PCT Payments. Proration will be  done on a reasonable basis in proportion to the relative economic value,  as of the date of the PCT, reasonably anticipated to be derived from the  platform contribution by the CSA Activity as compared to the value  reasonably anticipated to be derived from the platform contribution by  other business activities. In the case of an aggregate valuation done  under the principles of paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section that  addresses payment for resources, capabilities, or rights used for  business activities other than the CSA Activity (for example, the right  to exploit an existing intangible without further development), the  proration of the aggregate payments may have to reflect the economic  value attributable to such resources, capabilities, or rights as well.  For purposes of the best method rule under Sec. 1.482-1(c), the  reliability of the analysis under a method that requires proration  pursuant to this paragraph is reduced relative to the reliability of an  analysis under a method that does not require proration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Categorization of the PCT. For purposes of Sec. 1.482- 1(b)(2)(ii) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a PCT must be  identified by the controlled participants as a particular type of  transaction (for example, a license for royalty payments). See paragraph  (k)(2)(ii)(H) of this section. Such designation must be consistent with  the actual conduct of the controlled participants. If the conduct is  consistent with different, economically equivalent types of transactions  then the controlled participants may designate the PCT as being any of  such types of transactions. If the controlled participants fail to make  such designation in their documentation, the Commissioner may make a  designation consistent with the principles of paragraph (k)(1)(iv) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Certain make-or-sell rights excluded--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Any right  to exploit an existing resource, capability, or right without further  development of such item, such as the right to make, replicate, license,  or sell existing products, does not constitute a platform contribution  to a CSA (and the arm's length compensation for such rights (make-or- sell rights) does not satisfy the compensation obligation under a PCT)  unless exploitation without further development of such item is  reasonably anticipated to contribute to developing or further developing  a cost shared intangible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (c)(4):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. P and S, which are members of the same controlled group,  execute a CSA. Under the CSA, P and S will bear their RAB shares of IDCs  for developing the second generation of ABC, a computer software  program. Prior to that arrangement, P had incurred substantial costs and  risks to develop ABC. Concurrent with entering into the arrangement, P  (as the licensor) executes a license with S (as the licensee) by which S  may make and sell copies of the existing ABC. Such make-or-sell rights  do not constitute a platform contribution to the CSA. The rules of  Secs. 1.482-1 and 1.482-4 through 1.482-6 must be applied to determine  the arm's length consideration in connection with the make-or-sell  licensing arrangement. In certain circumstances, this determination of  the arm's length consideration may be done on an aggregate basis with  the   evaluation of compensation obligations pursuant to the PCTs entered into  by P and S in connection with the CSA. See paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P, a software company, has developed and currently  exploits software program ABC. P and S enter into a CSA to develop  future generations of ABC. The ABC source code is the platform on which  future generations of ABC will be built and is therefore a platform  contribution of P for which compensation is due from S pursuant to a  PCT. Concurrent with entering into the CSA, P licenses to S the make-or- sell rights for the current version of ABC. P has entered into similar  licenses with uncontrolled parties calling for sales-based royalty  payments at a rate of 20%. The current version of ABC has an expected  product life of three years. P and S enter into a contingent payment  agreement to cover both the PCT Payments due from S for P's platform  contribution and payments due from S for the make-or-sell license. Based  on the uncontrolled make-or-sell licenses, P and S agree on a sales- based royalty rate of 20% in Year 1 that declines on a straight line  basis to 0% over the 3 year product life of ABC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The make-or-sell rights for the current version of ABC are not  platform contributions, though paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section  provides for the possibility that the most reliable determination of an  arm's length charge for the platform contribution and the make-or-sell  license may be one that values the two transactions in the aggregate. A  contingent payment schedule based on the uncontrolled make-or-sell  licenses may provide an arm's length charge for the separate make-or- sell license between P and S, provided the royalty rates in the  uncontrolled licenses similarly decline, but as a measure of the  aggregate PCT and licensing payments it does not account for the arm's  length value of P's platform contributions which include the rights in  the source code and future development rights in ABC.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. S is a controlled participant that owns Patent Q, which  protects S's use of a research tool that is helpful in developing and  testing new pharmaceutical compounds. The research tool, which is not  itself such a compound, is used in the CSA Activity to develop such  compounds. However, the CSA Activity is not anticipated to result in the  further development of the research tool or in patents based on Patent  Q. Although the right to use Patent Q is not anticipated to result in  the further development of Patent Q or the technology that it protects,  that right constitutes a platform contribution (as opposed to make-or- sell rights) because it is anticipated to contribute to the research  activity to develop cost shared intangibles relating to pharmaceutical  compounds covered by the CSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (c). In each example, Companies P and S are members of  the same controlled group, and execute a CSA providing that each will  have the exclusive right to exploit cost shared intangibles in its own  territory. See paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section (Territorial based  divisional interests).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Company P has developed and currently markets version 1.0  of a new software application XYZ. Company P and Company S execute a CSA  under which they will share the IDCs for developing future versions of  XYZ. Version 1.0 is reasonably anticipated to contribute to the  development of future versions of XYZ and therefore Company P's rights  in version 1.0 constitute a platform contribution from Company P that  must be compensated by Company S pursuant to a PCT. Pursuant to  paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the controlled participants designate  the platform contribution as a transfer of intangibles that would  otherwise be governed by Sec. 1.482-4, if entered into by controlled  parties. Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the  applicable method for determining the arm's length value of the  compensation obligation under the PCT between Company P and Company S  will be governed by Sec. 1.482-4 as supplemented by paragraph (g) of  this section. Absent a showing to the contrary by P and S, the platform  contribution in this case is presumed to be the exclusive provision of  the benefit of all rights in version 1.0, other than the rights  described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section (Certain make-or-sell  rights excluded). This includes the right to use version 1.0 for  purposes of research and the exclusive right in S's territory to exploit  any future products that incorporated the technology of version 1.0, and  would cover a term extending as long as the controlled participants were  to exploit future versions of XYZ or any other product based on the  version 1.0 platform. The compensation obligation of Company S pursuant  to the PCT will reflect the full value of the platform contribution, as  limited by Company S's RAB share.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Company P and Company S execute a CSA under which they  will share the IDCs for developing Vaccine Z. Company P will commit to  the project its research team that has successfully developed a number  of other vaccines. The expertise and existing integration of the  research team is a unique resource or capability of Company P which is  reasonably anticipated to contribute to the development of Vaccine Z.  Therefore, P's provision of the capabilities of the research team  constitute a platform contribution for which compensation is due from  Company S   as part of a PCT. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the  controlled parties designate the platform contribution as a provision of  services that would otherwise be governed by Sec. 1.482-9(a) if entered  into by controlled parties. Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of  this section, the applicable method for determining the arm's length  value of the compensation obligation under the PCT between Company P and  Company S will be governed by Sec. 1.482-9(a) as supplemented by  paragraph (g) of this section. Absent a showing to the contrary by P and  S, the platform contribution in this case is presumed to be the  exclusive provision of the benefits by Company P of its research team to  the development of Vaccine Z. Because the IDCs include the ongoing  compensation of the researchers, the compensation obligation under the  PCT is only for the value of the commitment of the research team by  Company P to the CSA's development efforts net of such researcher  compensation. The value of the compensation obligation of Company S for  the PCT will reflect the full value of the provision of services, as  limited by Company S's RAB share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Intangible development costs--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determining whether costs are  IDCs. Costs included in IDCs are determined by reference to the scope of  the intangible development activity (IDA).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definition and scope of the IDA. For purposes of this section,  the IDA means the activity under the CSA of developing or attempting to  develop reasonably anticipated cost shared intangibles. The scope of the  IDA includes all of the controlled participants' activities that could  reasonably be anticipated to contribute to developing the reasonably  anticipated cost shared intangibles. The IDA cannot be described merely  by a list of particular resources, capabilities, or rights that will be  used in the CSA, because such a list would not identify reasonably  anticipated cost shared intangibles. Also, the scope of the IDA may  change as the nature or identity of the reasonably anticipated cost  shared intangibles changes or the nature of the activities necessary for  their development become clearer. For example, the relevance of certain  ongoing work to developing reasonably anticipated cost shared  intangibles or the need for additional work may only become clear over  time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Costs included in IDCs. For purposes of this section, IDCs  mean all costs, in cash or in kind (including stock-based compensation,  as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section), but excluding  acquisition costs for land or depreciable property, in the ordinary  course of business after the formation of a CSA that, based on analysis  of the facts and circumstances, are directly identified with, or are  reasonably allocable to, the IDA. Thus, IDCs include costs incurred in  attempting to develop reasonably anticipated cost shared intangibles  regardless of whether such costs ultimately lead to development of those  intangibles, other intangibles developed unexpectedly, or no  intangibles. IDCs shall also include the arm's length rental charge for  the use of any land or depreciable tangible property (as determined  under Sec. 1.482-2(c) (Use of tangible property)) directly identified  with, or reasonably allocable to, the IDA. Reference to generally  accepted accounting principles or Federal income tax accounting rules  may provide   a useful starting point but will not be conclusive regarding inclusion  of costs in IDCs. IDCs do not include interest expense, foreign income  taxes (as defined in Sec. 1.901-2(a)), or domestic income taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (d)(1):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A contract that purports to be a CSA provides that the  IDA to which the agreement applies consists of all research and  development activity conducted at laboratories A, B, and C but not at  other facilities maintained by the controlled participants. The contract  does not describe the reasonably anticipated cost shared intangibles  with respect to which research and development is to be undertaken. The  contract fails to meet the requirements set forth in paragraph  (k)(1)(ii)(B) of this section because it fails to adequately describe  the scope of the IDA to be undertaken.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A contract that purports to be a CSA provides that the  IDA to which the agreement applies consists of all research and  development activity conducted by any of the controlled participants  with the goal of developing a cure for a particular disease. Such a cure  is thus a reasonably anticipated cost shared intangible. The contract  also contains a provision that the IDA will exclude any activity that  builds on the results of the controlled participants' prior research  concerning Enzyme X even though such activity could reasonably be  anticipated to contribute to developing such cure. The contract fails to  meet the requirement set forth in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section  that the scope of the IDA include all of the controlled participants'  activities that could reasonably be anticipated to contribute to  developing reasonably anticipated cost shared intangibles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Allocation of costs. If a particular cost is directly identified  with, or reasonably allocable to, a function the results of which will  benefit both the IDA and other business activities, the cost must be  allocated on a reasonable basis between the IDA and such other business  activities in proportion to the relative economic value that the IDA and  such other business activities are anticipated to derive from such  results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Stock-based compensation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. As used in this  section, the term stock-based compensation means any compensation  provided by a controlled participant to an employee or independent  contractor in the form of equity instruments, options to acquire stock  (stock options), or rights with respect to (or determined by reference  to) equity instruments or stock options, including but not limited to  property to which section 83 applies and stock options to which section  421 applies, regardless of whether ultimately settled in the form of  cash, stock, or other property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> will be made in accordance with the rules of section 424(h)  and related regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>, the  cost attributable to stock-based compensation is equal to the amount  allowable to the controlled participant as a deduction for federal  income tax purposes with respect to that stock-based compensation (for  example, under section 83(h)) and is taken into account as an IDC under  this section for the taxable year for which the deduction is allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Transfers to which section 421 applies. Solely for purposes of  this paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(A), section 421 does not apply to the  transfer of stock pursuant to the exercise of an option that meets the  requirements of section 422(a) or 423(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Deductions of foreign controlled participants. Solely for  purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(A), an amount is treated as an  allowable deduction of a foreign controlled participant to the extent  that a deduction would be allowable to a United States taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(iii)(A))</em> to the controlled participant upon exercise of  the stock option immediately before the modification must be taken into  account as an IDC as of the date of the modification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Expiration or termination of CSA. Solely for purposes of this  paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(A), if an item of stock-based compensation  identified with, or reasonably allocable to, the IDA is not exercised  during the term of a CSA, that item of stock-based compensation will be  treated as being exercised immediately before the expiration or  termination of the CSA, provided that the stock-based compensation is  then exercisable and the fair market value of the underlying stock then  exceeds the price at which the stock-based compensation is exercisable.  Accordingly, the amount of the deduction that would be allowable (or  treated as allowable under this paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(A)) to the  controlled participant upon exercise of the stock-based compensation  must be taken into account as an IDC as of the date of the expiration or  termination of the CSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Election with respect to options on publicly traded stock--(1)  In general. With respect to stock-based compensation in the form of  options on publicly traded stock, the controlled participants in a CSA  may elect to take into account all IDCs attributable to those stock  options in the same amount, and as of the same time, as the fair value  of the stock options reflected as a charge against income in audited  financial statements or disclosed in footnotes to such financial  statements, provided that such statements are prepared in accordance  with United States generally accepted accounting principles by or on  behalf of the company issuing the publicly traded stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Publicly traded stock. As used in this paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B),  the term publicly traded stock means stock that is regularly traded on  an established United States securities market and is issued by a  company whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with  United States generally accepted accounting principles for the taxable  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(iii)(B)</em>, a financial statement prepared in accordance  with a comprehensive body of generally accepted accounting principles  other than United States generally accepted accounting principles is  considered to be prepared in accordance with United States generally  accepted accounting principles provided that either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The fair value of the stock options under consideration is  reflected in the reconciliation between such other accounting principles  and United States generally accepted accounting principles required to  be incorporated into the financial statement by the securities laws  governing companies whose stock is regularly traded on United States  securities markets; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the absence of a reconciliation between such other  accounting principles and United States generally accepted accounting  principles that reflects the fair value of the stock options under  consideration, such other accounting principles require that the fair  value of the stock options under consideration be reflected as a charge  against income in audited financial statements or disclosed in footnotes  to such statements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Time and manner of making the election. The election described  in this paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) is made by an explicit reference to the  election in the written contract required by paragraph (k)(1) of this  section or in a written amendment to the CSA entered into with the  consent of the Commissioner pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(C) of this  section. In the case of a CSA in existence on August 26, 2003, the  election by written amendment to the CSA may   be made without the consent of the Commissioner if such amendment is  entered into not later than the latest due date (with regard to  extensions) of a federal income tax return of any controlled participant  for the first taxable year beginning after August 26, 2003.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em>. Thus, for example, if the controlled participants make  the election described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) of this section upon  the formation of the CSA, the election may be revoked only with the  consent of the Commissioner, and the consent will apply only to stock  options granted in taxable years subsequent to the taxable year in which  consent is obtained. Similarly, if controlled participants already have  granted stock options that have been or will be taken into account under  the general rule of paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, then  except in cases specified in the last sentence of paragraph  (d)(3)(iii)(B)(4) of this section, the controlled participants may make  the election described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) of this section only  with the consent of the Commissioner, and the consent will apply only to  stock options granted in taxable years subsequent to the taxable year in  which consent is obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> IDC share. A controlled participant's IDC share for a taxable  year is equal to the controlled participant's cost contribution for the  taxable year, divided by the sum of all IDCs for the taxable year. A  controlled participant's cost contribution for a taxable year means all  of the IDCs initially borne by the controlled participant, plus all of  the CST Payments that the participant makes to other controlled  participants, minus all of the CST Payments that the participant  receives from other controlled participants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (d):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Foreign parent (FP) and its U.S. subsidiary (USS) enter  into a CSA to develop a better mousetrap. USS and FP share the costs of  FP's R&D; facility that will be exclusively dedicated to this research,  the salaries of the researchers at the facility, and overhead costs  attributable to the project. They also share the cost of a conference  facility that is at the disposal of the senior executive management of  each company. Based on the facts and circumstances, the cost of the  conference facility cannot be directly identified with, and is not  reasonably allocable to, the IDA. In this case, the cost of the  conference facility must be excluded from the amount of IDCs.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. U.S. parent (USP) and its foreign subsidiary (FS) enter  into a CSA to develop intangibles for producing a new device. USP and FS  share the costs of an R&D; facility, the salaries of the facility's  researchers, and overhead costs attributable to the project. Although  USP also incurs costs related to field testing of the device, USP does  not include those costs in the IDCs that USP and FS will share under the  CSA. The Commissioner may determine, based on the facts and  circumstances, that the costs of field testing are IDCs that the  controlled participants must share.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. U.S. parent (USP) and its foreign subsidiary (FS) enter  into a CSA to develop a new process patent. USP assigns certain  employees to perform solely R&D; to develop a new mathematical algorithm  to perform certain calculations. That algorithm will be used both to  develop the new process patent and to develop a new design patent the  development of which is outside the scope of the CSA. During years  covered by the CSA, USP compensates such employees with cash salaries,  stock-based compensation, or a combination of both. USP and FS  anticipate that the economic value attributable to the R&D; will be  derived from the process patent and the design patent in a relative  proportion of 75% and 25%, respectively. Applying the principles of  paragraph (d)(2) of this section, 75% of the compensation of such  employees must be allocated to the development of the new process patent  and, thus, treated as IDCs. With respect to the cash salary  compensation, the IDC is 75% of the face value of the cash. With respect  to the stock-based compensation, the IDC is 75% of the value of the  stock-based compensation as determined under paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Foreign parent (FP) and its U.S. subsidiary (USS) enter  into a CSA to develop a new computer source code. FP has an executive  officer who oversees a research facility and employees dedicated solely  to the IDA. The executive officer also oversees other research  facilities and employees unrelated to the IDA, and performs certain  corporate overhead functions. The full amount of the costs of the  research facility and employees dedicated solely to the IDA can be  directly identified with the IDA and, therefore, are IDCs. In addition,  based on the executive officer's records of time worked on various  matters, the controlled participants reasonably allocate 20% of the  executive officer's compensation to supervision of the facility and  employees dedicated to the IDA, 50% of the executive officer's  compensation to supervision of the facilities and employees unrelated to  the IDA, and 30% of the executive officer's compensation to corporate  overhead functions. The controlled participants also reasonably  determine that the results of the executive officer's corporate overhead  functions yield equal economic benefit to the IDA and the other business  activities of FP. Applying the principles of paragraph (d)(1) of this  section, the executive officer's compensation allocated to supervising  the facility and employees dedicated to the IDA (amounting to 20% of the  executive officer's total compensation) must be treated as IDCs.  Applying the principles of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, half of the  executive officer's compensation allocated to corporate overhead  functions (that is, half of 30% of the executive officer's total  compensation), must be treated as IDCs. Therefore, a total of 35% (20%  plus 15%) of the executive officer's total compensation must be treated  as IDCs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> shall limit the  Commissioner's use of subsequently available information for purposes of  its allocation determinations in accordance with the provisions of  paragraph </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> (Allocations by the Commissioner in connection with a CSA)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> (Data and assumptions). Thus, the  reliability of an estimate will depend largely on the completeness and  accuracy of the data, the soundness of the assumptions, and the relative  effects of particular deficiencies in data or assumptions on different  estimates. If two estimates are equally reliable, no adjustment should  be made based on differences between the estimates. The following  factors will be particularly relevant in determining the reliability of  an estimate of RAB shares:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The basis used for measuring benefits, as described in paragraph  (e)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The projections used to estimate benefits, as described in  paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (e)(1):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> USP and FS plan to conduct research to develop  Product Lines A and B. USP and FS reasonably anticipate respective  benefits from Product Line A of 100X and 200X and respective benefits  from Product Line B, respectively, of 300X and 400X. USP and FS thus  reasonably anticipate combined benefits from Product Lines A and B of  400X and 600X, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> USP and FS could enter into a separate CSA to develop Product  Line A with respective RAB shares of 33\1/3\ percent and 66\2/3\ percent  (reflecting a ratio of 100X to 200X), and into a separate CSA to develop  Product Line B with respective RAB shares of 42\6/7\ percent and 57\1/7\  percent (reflecting a ratio of 300X to 400X). Alternatively, USP and FS  could enter into a single CSA to develop both Product Lines A and B with  respective RAB shares of 40 percent and 60 percent (in the ratio of 400X  to 600X). If the separate CSAs are chosen, then any costs for activities  that contribute to developing both Product Line A and Product Line B  will constitute IDCs of the respective CSAs as required by paragraphs  (d)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> USP, a US company, wholly owns foreign subsidiary,  FS. USP and FS enter into a CSA at the start of Year 1. The CSA's total  IDCs are $100,000 in each year for Years 1 through 4. In Year 1, USP  correctly estimates its RAB share as 50%, based on information available  at the time, and therefore correctly computes $50,000 as its cost  contribution for Year 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In Year 4, USP correctly estimates its RAB share to be 70%,  based on information available at the time and, therefore, correctly  computes $70,000 as its cost contribution for Year 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In Year 4, USP also files an amended return for Year 1 in  which USP deducts a cost contribution of $70,000, asserting that, for  this purpose, it should revise its Year 1 estimated RAB share to 70%  based on the information that is now available to it in Year 4. The  Commissioner determines that USP is incorrect for two reasons. First, a  RAB share determined for a particular purpose (here, to determine USP's  IDC shares and thus USP's cost contributions in Year 1) should not be  revised based on information not available to USP until Year 4. See  paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section. Second, more generally, USP is not  permitted to file an amended return for this purpose under Sec. 1.482- 1(a)(3). Therefore, for both of these reasons, Commissioner adjusts  USP's amended return for Year 1 by disallowing $20,000 of the $70,000  deduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Measure of benefits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. In order to estimate a  controlled participant's RAB share, the amount of each controlled  participant's reasonably anticipated benefits must be measured on a  basis that is consistent for all such participants. See paragraph  (e)(2)(ii)(E) Example 9 of this section. If a controlled participant  transfers a cost shared intangible to another controlled taxpayer, other  than by way of a transfer described in paragraph (f) of this section,  that controlled participant's benefits from the transferred intangible  must be measured by reference to the transferee's benefits, disregarding  any consideration paid by the transferee to the controlled participant  (such as a royalty pursuant to a license agreement). Reasonably  anticipated benefits are measured either on a direct basis, by reference  to estimated benefits to be generated by the use of cost shared  intangibles (generally based on additional revenues plus cost savings  less any additional costs incurred), or on an indirect basis, by  reference to certain measurements that reasonably can be assumed to  relate to benefits to be generated. Such indirect bases of measurement  of anticipated benefits are described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this  section. A controlled participant's reasonably anticipated benefits must  be measured on the basis, whether direct or indirect, that most reliably  determines RAB shares. In determining which of two bases of measurement  is most reliable, the factors set forth in Sec. 1.482-1(c)(2)(ii) (Data  and assumptions) must be taken into account. It normally will be  expected that the basis that provided the most reliable estimate for a  particular year will continue to provide the most reliable estimate in  subsequent years, absent a material change in the factors that affect  the reliability of the estimate. Regardless of whether a direct or  indirect basis of measurement is used, adjustments may be required to  account for material differences in the activities that controlled  participants undertake to exploit their interests in cost shared  intangibles. See Examples 4 and 7 of paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(E) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Indirect bases for measuring anticipated benefits. Indirect  bases for measuring anticipated benefits from participation in a CSA  include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Units used, produced, or sold. Units of items used, produced, or  sold by each controlled participant in the business   activities in which cost shared intangibles are exploited may be used as  an indirect basis for measuring its anticipated benefits. This basis of  measurement will more reliably determine RAB shares to the extent that  each controlled participant is expected to have a similar increase in  net profit or decrease in net loss attributable to the cost shared  intangibles per unit of the item or items used, produced, or sold. This  circumstance is most likely to arise when the cost shared intangibles  are exploited by the controlled participants in the use, production, or  sale of substantially uniform items under similar economic conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Sales. Sales by each controlled participant in the business  activities in which cost shared intangibles are exploited may be used as  an indirect basis for measuring its anticipated benefits. This basis of  measurement will more reliably determine RAB shares to the extent that  each controlled participant is expected to have a similar increase in  net profit or decrease in net loss attributable to cost shared  intangibles per dollar of sales. This circumstance is most likely to  arise if the costs of exploiting cost shared intangibles are not  substantial relative to the revenues generated, or if the principal  effect of using cost shared intangibles is to increase the controlled  participants' revenues (for example, through a price premium on the  products they sell) without affecting their costs substantially. Sales  by each controlled participant are unlikely to provide a reliable basis  for measuring RAB shares unless each controlled participant operates at  the same market level (for example, manufacturing, distribution, etc.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Operating profit. Operating profit of each controlled  participant from the activities in which cost shared intangibles are  exploited, as determined before any expense (including amortization) on  account of IDCs, may be used as an indirect basis for measuring  anticipated benefits. This basis of measurement will more reliably  determine RAB shares to the extent that such profit is largely  attributable to the use of cost shared intangibles, or if the share of  profits attributable to the use of cost shared intangibles is expected  to be similar for each controlled participant. This circumstance is most  likely to arise when cost shared intangibles are closely associated with  the activity that generates the profit and the activity could not be  carried on or would generate little profit without use of those  intangibles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other bases for measuring anticipated benefits. Other bases for  measuring anticipated benefits may in some circumstances be appropriate,  but only to the extent that there is expected to be a reasonably  identifiable relationship between the basis of measurement used and  additional revenue generated or net costs saved by the use of cost  shared intangibles. For example, a division of costs based on employee  compensation would be considered unreliable unless there were a  relationship between the amount of compensation and the expected  additional revenue generated or net costs saved by the controlled  participants from using the cost shared intangibles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrates this paragraph  (e)(2)(ii):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Controlled parties A and B enter into a CSA to develop  product and process intangibles for already existing Product P. Without  such intangibles, A and B would each reasonably anticipate revenue, in  present value terms, of $100M from sales of Product P until it becomes  obsolete. With the intangibles, A and B each reasonably anticipate  selling the same number of units each year, but reasonably anticipate  that the price will be higher. Because the particular product intangible  is more highly regarded in A's market, A reasonably anticipates an  increase of $20M in present value revenue from the product intangible,  while B reasonably anticipates an increase of only $10M in present value  from the product intangible. Further, A and B each reasonably anticipate  spending an additional amount equal to $5M in present value in  production costs to include the feature embodying the product  intangible. Finally, A and B each reasonably anticipate saving an amount  equal to $2M in present value in production costs by using the process  intangible. A and B reasonably anticipate no other economic effects from  exploiting the cost shared intangibles. A's reasonably anticipated  benefits from exploiting the cost shared intangibles equal its  reasonably anticipated increase in revenue ($20M) plus its reasonably  anticipated cost savings ($2M) less its reasonably anticipated increased  costs ($5M), which equals $17M. Similarly, B's reasonably anticipated  benefits from exploiting the cost   shared intangibles equal its reasonably anticipated increase in revenue  ($10M) plus its reasonably anticipated cost savings ($2M) less its  reasonably anticipated increased costs ($5M), which equals $7M. Thus A's  reasonably anticipated benefits are $17M and B's reasonably anticipated  benefits are $7M.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2.

Producing the feedstock requires large amounts of  electricity, which accounts for a significant portion of its production  cost. FP and USS enter into a CSA to develop a new process that will  reduce the amount of electricity required to produce a unit of the  feedstock. FP and USS currently both incur an electricity cost of $2 per  unit of feedstock produced and rates for each are expected to remain  similar in the future. The new process, if it is successful, will reduce  the amount of electricity required by each company to produce a unit of  the feedstock by 50%. Switching to the new process would not require FP  or USS to incur significant investment or other costs. Therefore, the  cost savings each company is expected to achieve after implementing the  new process are $1 per unit of feedstock produced. Under the CSA, FP and  USS divide the costs of developing the new process based on the units of  the feedstock each is anticipated to produce in the future. In this  case, units produced is the most reliable basis for measuring RAB shares  and dividing the IDCs because each controlled participant is expected to  have a similar $1 (50% of current charge of $2) decrease in costs per  unit of the feedstock produced.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that  currently USS pays $3 per unit of feedstock produced for electricity  while FP pays $6 per unit of feedstock produced. In this case, units  produced is not the most reliable basis for measuring RAB shares and  dividing the IDCs because the participants do not expect to have a  similar decrease in costs per unit of the feedstock produced. The  Commissioner determines that the most reliable measure of RAB shares may  be based on units of the feedstock produced if FP's units are weighted  relative to USS's units by a factor of 2. This reflects the fact that FP  pays twice as much as USS for electricity and, therefore, FP's savings  of $3 per unit of the feedstock (50% reduction of current charge of $6)  would be twice USS's savings of $1.50 per unit of feedstock (50%  reduction of current charge of $3) from any new process eventually  developed.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that to  supply the particular needs of the U.S. market USS manufactures the  feedstock with somewhat different properties than FP's feedstock. This  requires USS to employ a somewhat different production process than does  FP. Because of this difference, USS would incur significant construction  costs in order to adopt any new process that may be developed under the  cost sharing agreement. In this case, units produced is not the most  reliable basis for measuring RAB shares. In order to reliably determine  RAB shares, the Commissioner measures the reasonably anticipated  benefits of USS and FP on a direct basis. USS's reasonably anticipated  benefits are its reasonably anticipated total savings in electricity  costs, less its reasonably anticipated costs of adopting the new  process. FS's reasonably anticipated benefits are its reasonably  anticipated total savings in electricity costs.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. U.S. Parent (USP) and Foreign Subsidiary (FS) enter into  a CSA to develop new anesthetic drugs. USP obtains the right to market  any resulting drugs in the United States and FS obtains the right to  market any resulting drugs in the rest of the world. USP and FS  determine RAB shares on the basis of their respective total anticipated  operating profit from all drugs under development. USP anticipates that  it will receive a much higher profit than FS per unit sold because the  price of the drugs is not regulated in the United States, whereas the  price of the drugs is regulated in many non-U.S. jurisdictions. In both  controlled participants' territories, the anticipated operating profits  are almost entirely attributable to the use of the cost shared  intangibles. In this case, the controlled participants' basis for  measuring RAB shares is the most reliable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Foreign Parent (FP) and U.S. Subsidiary (USS)  manufacture and sell fertilizers. They enter into a CSA to develop a new  pellet form of a common agricultural fertilizer that is currently  available only in powder form. Under the CSA, USS obtains the rights to  produce and sell the new form of fertilizer for the U.S. market while FP  obtains the rights to produce and sell the new form of fertilizer in the  rest of the world. The costs of developing the new form of fertilizer  are divided on the basis of the anticipated sales of fertilizer in the  controlled participants' respective markets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the research and development is successful, the pellet form  will deliver the fertilizer more efficiently to crops and less  fertilizer will be required to achieve the same effect on crop growth.  The pellet form of fertilizer can be expected to sell at a price premium  over the powder form of fertilizer based on the savings in the amount of  fertilizer that needs to be used. This price premium will be a similar  premium per dollar of sales in each territory. If the research and  development is successful, the costs of producing pellet fertilizer are  expected to be approximately the same as the costs of producing powder  fertilizer and the same for both FP and USS. Both FP and USS operate at  approximately the same market levels,   selling their fertilizers largely to independent distributors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In this case, the controlled participants' basis for measuring  RAB shares is the most reliable.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. The facts are the same as in Example 6, except that FP  distributes its fertilizers directly while USS sells to independent  distributors. In this case, sales of USS and FP are not the most  reliable basis for measuring RAB shares unless adjustments are made to  account for the difference in market levels at which the sales occur.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Foreign Parent (FP) and U.S. Subsidiary (USS) enter into  a CSA to develop materials that will be used to train all new entry- level employees. FP and USS determine that the new materials will save  approximately ten hours of training time per employee. Because their  entry-level employees are paid on differing wage scales, FP and USS  decide that they should not measure benefits based on the number of  entry-level employees hired by each. Rather, they measure benefits based  on compensation paid to the entry-level employees hired by each. In this  case, the basis used for measuring RAB shares is the most reliable  because there is a direct relationship between compensation paid to new  entry-level employees and costs saved by FP and USS from the use of the  new training materials.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. U.S. Parent (USP), Foreign Subsidiary 1 (FS1), and  Foreign Subsidiary 2 (FS2) enter into a CSA to develop computer software  that each will market and install on customers' computer systems. The  controlled participants measure benefits on the basis of projected sales  by USP, FS1, and FS2 of the software in their respective geographic  areas. However, FS1 plans not only to sell but also to license the  software to unrelated customers, and FS1's licensing income (which is a  percentage of the licensees' sales) is not counted in the projected  benefits. In this case, the basis used for measuring the benefits of  each controlled participant is not the most reliable because all of the  benefits received by controlled participants are not taken into account.  In order to reliably determine RAB shares, FS1's projected benefits from  licensing must be included in the measurement on a basis that is the  same as that used to measure its own and the other controlled  participants' projected benefits from sales (for example, all controlled  participants might measure their benefits on the basis of operating  profit).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Projections used to estimate benefits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The  reliability of an estimate of RAB shares also depends upon the  reliability of projections used in making the estimate. Projections  required for this purpose generally include a determination of the time  period between the inception of the research and development activities  under the CSA and the receipt of benefits, a projection of the time over  which benefits will be received, and a projection of the benefits  anticipated for each year in which it is anticipated that the cost  shared intangible will generate benefits. A projection of the relevant  basis for measuring anticipated benefits may require a projection of the  factors that underlie it. For example, a projection of operating profits  may require a projection of sales, cost of sales, operating expenses,  and other factors that affect operating profits. If it is anticipated  that there will be significant variation among controlled participants  in the timing of their receipt of benefits, and consequently benefit  shares are expected to vary significantly over the years in which  benefits will be received, it normally will be necessary to use the  present value of the projected benefits to reliably determine RAB  shares. See paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section for best method  considerations regarding discount rates used for this purpose. If it is  not anticipated that benefit shares will significantly change over time,  current annual benefit shares may provide a reliable projection of RAB  shares. This circumstance is most likely to occur when the CSA is a  long-term arrangement, the arrangement covers a wide variety of  intangibles, the composition of the cost shared intangibles is unlikely  to change, the cost shared intangibles are unlikely to generate unusual  profits, and each controlled participant's share of the market is  stable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (e)(2)(iii):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Foreign Parent (FP) and U.S. Subsidiary (USS) enter  into a CSA to develop a new car model. The controlled participants plan  to spend four years developing the new model and four years producing  and selling the new model. USS and FP project total sales of $4 billion  and $2 billion, respectively, over the planned four years of  exploitation of the new model. The controlled participants determine RAB  shares for each year of 66\2/3\% for USS and 33\1/3\% for FP, based on  projected total sales.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> USS typically begins producing and selling new car models a  year after FP begins producing and selling new car models.   In order to reflect USS's one-year lag in introducing new car models, a  more reliable projection of each participant's RAB share would be based  on a projection of all four years of sales for each participant,  discounted to present value.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. U.S. Parent (USP) and Foreign Subsidiary (FS) enter into  a CSA to develop new and improved household cleaning products. Both  controlled participants have sold household cleaning products for many  years and have stable worldwide market shares. The products under  development are unlikely to produce unusual profits for either  controlled participant. The controlled participants determine RAB shares  on the basis of each controlled participant's current sales of household  cleaning products. In this case, the controlled participants' RAB shares  are reliably projected by current sales of cleaning products.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that FS's  market share is rapidly expanding because of the business failure of a  competitor in its geographic area. The controlled participants' RAB  shares are not reliably projected by current sales of cleaning products.  FS's benefit projections should take into account its growth in market  share.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Foreign Parent (FP) and U.S. Subsidiary (USS) enter into  a CSA to develop synthetic fertilizers and insecticides. FP and USS  share costs on the basis of each controlled participant's current sales  of fertilizers and insecticides. The market shares of the controlled  participants have been stable for fertilizers, but FP's market share for  insecticides has been expanding. The controlled participants'  projections of RAB shares are reliable with regard to fertilizers, but  not reliable with regard to insecticides; a more reliable projection of  RAB shares would take into account the expanding market share for  insecticides.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Changes in participation under a CSA--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A change  in participation under a CSA occurs when there is either a controlled  transfer of interests or a capability variation. A change in  participation requires arm's length consideration under paragraph  (a)(3)(ii) of this section, and as more fully described in this  paragraph (f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>  shall not constitute a controlled transfer of interests if it also  constitutes a capability variation for purposes of paragraph (f)(3) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(ii)</em> of this section, a  capability variation is considered to be a controlled transfer of  interests in cost shared intangibles, in which any controlled  participant whose RAB share decreases as a result of the capability  variation is a transferor, and any controlled participant whose RAB  share thus increases is the transferee of the interests in cost shared  intangibles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> with respect to a capability variation, then  for purposes of any adjustment to be performed under paragraph  (i)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the controlled participants' projected  benefit shares referred to in paragraph (i)(2)(ii)(A) of this section  shall be considered to be the controlled participants' respective RAB  shares after the capability variation occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (f):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X, Y, and Z are the only controlled participants in a  CSA. The CSA divides interests in cost shared intangibles on a  territorial basis as described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section.  X is assigned the territories of the Americas, Y is assigned the  territory of the UK and Australia, and Z is assigned the rest of the  world. When the CSA is formed, X has a platform contribution T. Under  the PCTs for T, Y and Z are each obligated to pay X royalties equal to  five percent of their respective sales. Aside from T, there are no  platform contributions. Two years after the formation of the CSA, Y  transfers to Z its interest in cost shared intangibles relating to the  UK territory, and the associated obligations, in a controlled transfer  of interests described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. At that time  the reasonably anticipated benefits from exploiting cost shared  intangibles in the UK have a present value of $11M, the reasonably  anticipated IDCs to be borne relating to the UK territory have a present  value of $3M, and the reasonably anticipated PCT Payments to be made to  X relating to sales in the UK territory have a present value of $2M. As  arm's length consideration for the change in participation due to the  controlled transfer of interests, Z must pay Y compensation with an  anticipated present value of $11M, less $3M, less $2M, which equals $6M.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. As in Example 2 of paragraph (b)(4)(v) of this section,  companies P and S, both members of the same controlled group, enter into  a CSA to develop product Z. P and S agree to divide their interest in  product Z based on site of manufacturing. P will have exclusive and  perpetual rights in product Z manufactured in facilities owned by P. S  will have exclusive and perpetual rights to product Z manufactured in  facilities owned by S. P and S agree that neither will license  manufacturing rights in product Z to any related or unrelated party.  Both P and S maintain books and records that allow production at all  sites to be verified. Both own facilities that will manufacture product  Z and the relative capacities of these sites are known. All facilities  are currently operating at near capacity and are expected to continue to  operate at near capacity when product Z enters production so that it  will not be feasible to shift production between P's and S's facilities.  P and S have no plans to build new facilities and the lead time required  to plan and build a manufacturing facility precludes the possibility  that P or S will build a new facility during the period for which sales  of Product Z are expected. When the CSA is formed, P has a platform  contribution T. Under the PCT for T, S is obligated to pay P sales-based  royalties according to a certain formula. Aside from T, there are no  other platform contributions. Two years after the formation of the CSA,  owing to a change in plans not reasonably foreseeable at the time the  CSA was entered into, S acquires additional facilities F for the  manufacture of Product Z. Such acquisition constitutes a capability  variation described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. Under this  capability variation, S's RAB share increases from 50% to 60%.  Accordingly, there is a compensable change in participation under  paragraph (f)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> for purposes of evaluating  the arm's length amount charged in a PCT. Each method will yield a value  for the compensation obligation of each PCT Payor consistent with the  product of the combined pre-tax value to all controlled participants of  the platform contribution that is the subject of the PCT and the PCT  Payor's RAB share. Each method must yield results consistent with  measuring the value of a platform contribution by reference to the  future income anticipated to be generated by the resulting cost shared  intangibles. The methods are--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The comparable uncontrolled transaction method described in  Sec. 1.482-4(c), or the comparable uncontrolled services price method  described in Sec. 1.482-9(c), as further described in paragraph (g)(3)  of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The income method, described in paragraph (g)(4) of this  section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The acquisition price method, described in paragraph (g)(5) of  this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The market capitalization method, described in paragraph (g)(6)  of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The residual profit split method, described in paragraph (g)(7)  of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Unspecified methods, described in paragraph (g)(8) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Best method analysis applicable for evaluation of a PCT pursuant  to a CSA--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Each method must be applied in accordance with  the provisions of Sec. 1.482-1, including the best method rule of  Sec. 1.482-1(c), the comparability analysis of Sec. 1.482-1(d), and the  arm's length range of Sec. 1.482-1(e), except as those provisions are  modified in this paragraph (g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consistency with upfront contractual terms and risk  allocation--the investor model--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Although all of the  factors entering into a best method analysis described in Sec. 1.482- 1(c) and (d) must be considered, specific factors may be particularly  relevant in the context of a CSA. In particular, the relative  reliability of an application of any method depends on the degree of  consistency of the analysis with the applicable contractual terms and  allocation of risk under the CSA and this section among the controlled  participants as of the date of the PCT, unless a change in such terms or  allocation has been made in return for arm's length consideration. In  this regard, a CSA involves an upfront division of the risks as to both  reasonably anticipated obligations and reasonably anticipated benefits  over the reasonably anticipated term of the CSA Activity. Accordingly,  the relative reliability of an application of a method also depends on  the degree of consistency of the analysis with the assumption that, as  of the date of the PCT, each controlled participant's aggregate net  investment in the CSA Activity (including platform contributions,  operating contributions, as such term is defined in paragraph (j)(1)(i)  of this section, operating cost contributions, as such term is defined  in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section, and cost contributions) is  reasonably anticipated to earn a rate of return (which might be  reflected in a discount rate used in applying a method) appropriate to  the riskiness of the controlled participant's CSA Activity over the  entire period of such CSA Activity. If the cost shared intangibles  themselves are reasonably anticipated to contribute to developing other  intangibles, then the period described in the preceding sentence  includes the period, reasonably anticipated as of the date of the PCT,  of developing and exploiting such indirectly benefited intangibles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the principles of  this paragraph (g)(2)(ii):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P, a U.S. corporation, has developed a software  program, DEF, which applies certain algorithms to reconstruct complete  DNA sequences from partially-observed DNA sequences. S is a wholly-owned  foreign subsidiary of P. On the first day of Year 1, P and S enter into  a CSA to develop a new generation of genetic tests, GHI, based in part  on the use of DEF. DEF is therefore a platform contribution of P for  which compensation is due from S pursuant to a PCT. S makes no platform  contributions to the CSA. Sales of GHI are projected to commence two  years after the inception of the CSA and then to continue for eight more  years. Based on industry experience, P and S are confident that GHI will  be replaced by a new type of genetic testing based on technology  unrelated to DEF or GHI and that, at that point, GHI will have no  further value. P and S project that that replacement will occur at the  end of Year 10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of valuing the PCT for P's platform contribution  of DEF to the CSA, P and S apply a type of residual profit split method  that is not described in paragraph (g)(7) of this section and which,  accordingly, constitutes an unspecified method. See paragraph (g)(7)(i)  (last sentence) of this section. The principles of this paragraph (g)(2)  apply to any method for valuing a PCT, including the unspecified method  used by P and S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under the method employed by P and S, in each year, a portion  of the income from sales of GHI in S's territory is allocated to certain  routine contributions made by S. The residual of the profit or loss from  GHI sales in S's territory after the routine allocation step is divided  between P and S pro rata to their capital stocks allocable to S's  territory. Each controlled participant's capital stock is computed by  capitalizing, applying a capital growth factor to, and amortizing its  historical expenditures regarding DEF allocable to S's territory (in the  case of P), or its ongoing cost contributions towards   developing GHI (in the case of S). The amortization of the capital  stocks is effected on a straight-line basis over an assumed four-year  life for the relevant expenditures. The capital stocks are grown using  an assumed growth factor that P and S consider to be appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The assumption that all expenditures amortize on a straight- line basis over four years does not appropriately reflect the principle  that as of the date of the PCT regarding DEF, every contribution to the  development of GHI, including DEF, is reasonably anticipated to have  value throughout the entire period of exploitation of GHI which is  projected to continue through Year 10. Under this method as applied by P  and S, the share of the residual profit in S's territory that is  allocated to P as a PCT Payment from S will decrease every year. After  Year 4, P's capital stock in DEF will necessarily be $0, so that P will  receive none of the residual profit or loss from GHI sales in S's  territory after Year 4 as a PCT Payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> As a result of this limitation of the PCT Payments to be made by  S, the anticipated return to S's aggregate investment in the CSA, over  the whole period of S's CSA Activity, is at a rate that is significantly  higher than the appropriate rate of return for S's CSA Activity (as  determined by a reliable method). This discrepancy is not consistent  with the investor model principle that S should anticipate a rate of  return to its aggregate investment in the CSA, over the whole period of  its CSA Activity, appropriate for the riskiness of its CSA Activity. The  inconsistency of the method with the investor model materially lessens  its reliability for purposes of a best method analysis. See Sec. 1.482- 1(c)(2)(ii)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Consistency of evaluation with realistic alternatives--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In  general. The relative reliability of an application of a method also  depends on the degree of consistency of the analysis with the assumption  that uncontrolled taxpayers dealing at arm's length would have evaluated  the terms of the transaction, and only entered into such transaction, if  no alternative is preferable. This condition is not met, therefore,  where for any controlled participant the total anticipated present value  of its income attributable to its entering into the CSA, as of the date  of the PCT, is less than the total anticipated present value of its  income that could be achieved through an alternative arrangement  realistically available to that controlled participant. In principle,  this comparison is made on a post-tax basis but, in many cases, a  comparison made on a pre-tax basis will yield equivalent results. See  also paragraph (g)(2)(v)(B)(1) of this section (Discount rate variation  between realistic alternatives).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (g)(2)(iii):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P, a corporation, and S, a wholly-owned subsidiary of  P, enter into a CSA to develop a personal transportation device (the  product). Under the arrangement, P will undertake all of the R&D;, and  manufacture and market the product in Country X. S will make CST  Payments to P for its appropriate share of P's R&D; costs, and  manufacture and market the product in the rest of the world. P owns  existing patents and trade secrets that are reasonably anticipated to  contribute to the development of the product. Therefore the rights in  the patents and trade secrets are platform contributions for which  compensation is due from S as part of a PCT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> S's manufacturing and distribution activities under the CSA  will be routine in nature, and identical to the activities it would  undertake if it alternatively licensed the product from P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reasonably reliable estimates indicate that P could develop  the product without assistance from S and license the product outside of  Country X for a royalty of 20% of sales. Based on reliable financial  projections that include all future development costs and licensing  revenue that are allocable to the non-Country X market, and using a  discount rate appropriate for the riskiness of P's role as a licensor  (see paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section), the post-tax present value of  this licensing alternative to P for the non-Country X market (measured  as of the date of the PCT) would be $500 million. Thus, based on this  realistic alternative, the anticipated post-tax present value under the  CSA to P in the non-Country X market (measured as of the date of the  PCT), taking into account anticipated development costs allocable to the  non-Country X market, and anticipated CST Payments and PCT Payments from  S, and using a discount rate appropriate for the riskiness of P's role  as a participant in the CSA, should not be less than $500 million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  there are no reliable estimates of the value to P from the licensing  alternative to the CSA. Further, reasonably reliable estimates indicate  that an arm's length return for S's routine manufacturing and  distribution activities is a 10% mark-up on total costs of goods sold  plus operating expenses related to those activities. Finally, the  Commissioner determines that the respective activities undertaken by P   and S (other than licensing payments, cost contributions, and PCT  Payments) would be identical regardless of whether the arrangement was  undertaken as a CSA (cost sharing alternative) or as a long-term  licensing arrangement (licensing alternative). In particular, in both  alternatives, P would perform all research activities and S would  undertake routine manufacturing and distribution activities associated  with its territory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> P undertakes an economic analysis that derives S's cost  contributions under the CSA, based on reliable financial projections.  Based on this and further economic analysis, P determines S's PCT  Payment as a certain lump sum amount to be paid as of the date of the  PCT (Date D).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Based on reliable financial projections that include S's cost  contributions and that incorporate S's PCT Payment, as computed by P,  and using a discount rate appropriate for the riskiness of S's role as a  CSA participant (see paragraphs (g)(2)(v) and (4)(vi)(F) of this  section), the anticipated post-tax net present value to S in the cost  sharing alternative (measured as of Date D) is $800 million. Further,  based on these same reliable projections (but incorporating S's  licensing payments instead of S's cost contributions and PCT Payment),  and using a discount rate appropriate for the riskiness of S's role as a  long-term licensee, the anticipated post-tax net present value to S in  the licensing alternative (measured as of Date D) is $100 million. Thus,  S's anticipated post-tax net present value is $700 million greater in  the cost sharing alternative than in the licensing alternative. This  result suggests that P's anticipated post-tax present value must be  significantly less under the cost sharing alternative than under the  licensing alternative. This means that the reliability of P's analysis  as described in paragraph (ii) of this Example 2 is reduced, because P  would not be expected to enter into a CSA if its alternative of being a  long-term licensor is preferable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> and (ii)  of Example 2. In addition, based on reliable financial projections that  include S's cost contributions and S's PCT Payment, and using a discount  rate appropriate for the riskiness of S's role as a CSA participant, the  anticipated post-tax net present value to S under the CSA (measured as  of the date of the PCT) is $50 million. Also, instead of entering the  CSA, S has the realistic alternative of manufacturing and distributing  product Z unrelated to the personal transportation device, with the same  anticipated 10% mark-up on total costs that it would anticipate for its  routine activities in Example 2. Under its realistic alternative, at a  discount rate appropriate for the riskiness of S's role with respect to  product Z, S anticipates a present value of $100 million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because the lump sum PCT Payment made by S results in S having  a considerably lower anticipated net present value than S could achieve  through an alternative arrangement realistically available to it, the  reliability of P's calculation of the lump sum PCT Payment is reduced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Aggregation of transactions. The combined effect of multiple  contemporaneous transactions, consisting either of multiple PCTs, or of  one or more PCT and one or more other transactions in connection with a  CSA that are not governed by this section (such as transactions  involving cross operating contributions or make-or-sell rights), may  require evaluation in accordance with the principles of aggregation  described in Sec. 1.482-1(f)(2)(i). In such cases, it may be that the  multiple transactions are reasonably anticipated, as of the date of the  PCT(s), to be so interrelated that the method that provides the most  reliable measure of an arm's length charge is a method under this  section applied on an aggregate basis for the PCT(s) and other  transactions. A section 482 adjustment may be made by comparing the  aggregate arm's length charge so determined to the aggregate payments  actually made for the multiple transactions. In such a case, it  generally will not be necessary to allocate separately the aggregate  arm's length charge as between various PCTs or as between PCTs and such  other transactions. However, such an allocation may be necessary for  other purposes, such as applying paragraph (i)(6) (Periodic adjustments)  of this section. An aggregate determination of the arm's length charge  for multiple transactions will often yield a payment for a controlled  participant that is equal to the aggregate value of the platform  contributions and other resources, capabilities, and rights covered by  the multiple transactions multiplied by that controlled participant's  RAB share. Because RAB shares only include benefits from cost shared  intangibles, the reliability of an aggregate determination of payments  for multiple transactions may be reduced to the extent that it includes  transactions covering resources, capabilities, and rights for which the  controlled participants' expected benefit shares differ substantially  from their RAB shares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Discount rate--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The best method analysis in  connection with certain methods or forms of payment may depend on a rate  or rates of return used to convert projected results of transactions to  present value, or to otherwise convert monetary amounts at one or more  points in time to equivalent amounts at a different point or points in  time. For this purpose, a discount rate or rates should be used that  most reliably reflect the market-correlated risks of activities or  transactions and should be applied to the best estimates of the relevant  projected results, based on all the information potentially available at  the time for which the present value calculation is to be performed.  Depending on the particular facts and circumstances, the market- correlated risk involved and thus, the discount rate, may differ among a  company's various activities or transactions. Normally, discount rates  are most reliably determined by reference to market information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Considerations in best method analysis of discount rate--(1)  Discount rate variation between realistic alternatives. Realistic  alternatives may involve varying risk exposure and, thus, may be more  reliably evaluated using different discount rates. See paragraphs  (g)(4)(i)(F) and (vi)(F) of this section. In some circumstances, a party  may have less risk as a licensee of intangibles needed in its  operations, and so require a lower discount rate, than it would have by  entering into a CSA to develop such intangibles, which may involve the  party's assumption of additional risk in funding its cost contributions  to the IDA. Similarly, self-development of intangibles and licensing out  may be riskier for the licensor, and so require a higher discount rate,  than entering into a CSA to develop such intangibles, which would  relieve the licensor of the obligation to fund a portion of the IDCs of  the IDA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> and (g)(4)(viii), Example 8 of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Discount rate variation between forms of payment. Certain forms  of payment may involve different risks than others. For example,  ordinarily a royalty computed on a profits base would be more volatile,  and so require a higher discount rate to discount projected payments to  present value, than a royalty computed on a sales base.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(i)(G)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the principles of  this paragraph (g)(2)(v):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P and S form a CSA to develop intangible X, which will  be used in product Y. P will develop X, and S will make CST Payments as  its cost contributions. At the start of the CSA, P has a platform  contribution, for which S commits to make a PCT Payment of 5% of its  sales of product Y. As part of the evaluation of whether that PCT  Payment is arm's length, the Commissioner considers whether P had a more  favorable realistic alternative (see paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this  section). Specifically, the Commissioner compares P's anticipated post- tax discounted present value of the financial projections under the CSA  (taking into account S's PCT payment of 5% of its sale of product   Y) with P's anticipated post-tax discounted present value of the  financial projections under a reasonably available licensing alternative  that consists of developing intangible X on its own and then licensing X  to S or to an uncontrolled party similar to S. In undertaking the  analysis, the Commissioner determines that, because it would be funding  the entire development of the intangible, P undertakes greater risks in  the licensing alternative than in the cost sharing alternative (in the  cost sharing alternative P would be funding only part of the development  of the intangible).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Commissioner determines that, as between the two scenarios,  all of the components of P's anticipated financial flows are identical,  except for the CST and PCT Payments under the CSA, compared to the  licensing payments under the licensing alternative. Accordingly, the  Commissioner concludes that the differences in market-correlated risks  between the two scenarios, and therefore the differences in discount  rates between the two scenarios, relate to the differences in these  components of the financial projections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Financial projections. The reliability of an estimate of the  value of a platform or operating contribution in connection with a PCT  will often depend upon the reliability of projections used in making the  estimate. Such projections should reflect the best estimates of the  items projected (normally reflecting a probability weighted average of  possible outcomes and thus also reflecting non-market-correlated risk).  Projections necessary for this purpose may include a projection of  sales, IDCs, costs of developing operating contributions, routine  operating expenses, and costs of sales. Some method applications  directly estimate projections of items attributable to separate  development and exploitation by the controlled participants within their  respective divisions. Other method applications indirectly estimate  projections of items from the perspective of the controlled group as a  whole, rather than from the perspective of a particular participant, and  then apportion the items so estimated on some assumed basis. For  example, in some applications, sales might be directly projected by  division, but worldwide projections of other items such as operating  expenses might be apportioned among divisions in the same ratio as the  divisions' respective sales. Which approach is more reliable depends on  which provides the most reliable measure of an arm's length result,  considering the competing perspectives under the facts and circumstances  in light of the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, the  reliability of the assumptions, and the sensitivity of the results to  possible deficiencies in the data and assumptions. For these purposes,  projections that have been prepared for non-tax purposes are generally  more reliable than projections that have been prepared solely for  purposes of meeting the requirements in this paragraph (g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Accounting principles--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Allocations or other  valuations done for accounting purposes may provide a useful starting  point but will not be conclusive for purposes of the best method  analysis in evaluating the arm's length charge in a PCT, particularly  where the accounting treatment of an asset is inconsistent with its  economic value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (g)(2)(vii):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> USP, a U.S. corporation and FSub, a wholly-owned  foreign subsidiary of USP, enter into a CSA in Year 1 to develop  software programs with application in the medical field. Company X is an  uncontrolled software company located in the United States that is  engaged in developing software programs that could significantly enhance  the programs being developed by USP and FSub. Company X is still in a  startup phase, so it has no currently exploitable products or marketing  intangibles and its workforce consists of a team of software developers.  Company X has negligible liabilities and tangible property. In Year 2,  USP purchases Company X as part of an uncontrolled transaction in order  to acquire its in-process technology and workforce for purposes of the  development activities of the CSA. USP files a consolidated return that  includes Company X. For accounting purposes, $50 million of the $100  million acquisition price is allocated to the in-process technology and  workforce, and the residual $50 million is allocated to goodwill.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The in-process technology and workforce of Company X acquired  by USP are reasonably anticipated to contribute to developing cost  shared intangibles and therefore the rights in the in-process technology  and workforce of Company X are platform contributions for which FSub  must compensate USP as part of a PCT. In determining whether to apply  the acquisition price or another method for purposes of evaluating the  arm's   length charge in the PCT, relevant best method analysis considerations  must be weighed in light of the general principles of paragraph (g)(2)  of this section. The allocation for accounting purposes raises an issue  as to the reliability of using the acquisition price method in this case  because it suggests that a significant portion of the value of Company  X's nonroutine contributions to USP's business activities is allocable  to goodwill, which is often difficult to value reliably and which,  depending on the facts and circumstances, might not be attributable to  platform contributions that are to be compensated by PCTs. See paragraph  (g)(5)(iv)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Paragraph (g)(2)(vii)(A) of this section provides that  accounting treatment may be a starting point, but is not determinative  for purposes of assessing or applying methods to evaluate the arm's  length charge in a PCT. The facts here reveal that Company X has nothing  of economic value aside from its in-process technology and assembled  workforce. The $50 million of the acquisition price allocated to  goodwill for accounting purposes, therefore, is economically  attributable to either of, or both, the in-process technology and the  workforce. That moots the potential issue under the acquisition price  method of the reliability of valuation of assets not to be compensated  by PCTs, since there are no such assets. Assuming the acquisition price  method is otherwise the most reliable method, the aggregate value of  Company X's in-process technology and workforce is the full acquisition  price of $100 million. Accordingly, the aggregate value of the arm's  length PCT Payments due from FSub to USP for the platform contributions  consisting of the rights in Company X's in-process technology and  workforce will equal $100 million multiplied by FSub's RAB share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  Company X is a mature software business in the United States with a  successful current generation of software that it markets under a  recognized trademark, in addition to having the research team and new  generation software in process that could significantly enhance the  programs being developed under USP's and FSub's CSA. USP continues  Company X's existing business and integrates the research team and the  in-process technology into the efforts under its CSA with FSub. For  accounting purposes, the $100 million price for acquiring Company X is  allocated $50 million to existing software and trademark, $25 million to  in-process technology and research workforce, and the residual $25  million to goodwill and going concern value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this case an analysis of the facts indicates a likelihood  that, consistent with the allocation under the accounting treatment  (although not necessarily in the same amount), a significant amount of  the nonroutine contributions to the USP's business activities consist of  goodwill and going concern value economically attributable to the  existing U.S. software business rather than to the platform  contributions consisting of the rights in the in-process technology and  research workforce. In addition, an analysis of the facts indicates that  a significant amount of the nonroutine contributions to USP's business  activities consist of the make-or-sell rights under the existing  software and trademark, which are not platform contributions and might  be difficult to value. Accordingly, further consideration must be given  to the extent to which these circumstances reduce the relative  reliability of the acquisition price method in comparison to other  potentially applicable methods for evaluating the PCT Payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> USP, a U.S. corporation, and FSub, a wholly-owned  foreign subsidiary of USP, enter into a CSA in Year 1 to develop Product  A. Company Y is an uncontrolled corporation that owns Technology X,  which is critical to the development of Product A. Company Y currently  markets Product B, which is dependent on Technology X. USP is solely  interested in acquiring Technology X, but is only able to do so through  the acquisition of Company Y in its entirety for $200 million in an  uncontrolled transaction in Year 2. For accounting purposes, the  acquisition price is allocated as follows: $120 million to Product B and  the underlying Technology X, $30 million to trademark and other  marketing intangibles, and the residual $50 million to goodwill and  going concern value. After the acquisition of Company Y, Technology X is  used to develop Product A. No other part of Company Y is used in any  manner. Immediately after the acquisition, product B is discontinued,  and, therefore, the accompanying marketing intangibles become worthless.  None of the previous employees of Company Y is retained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Technology X of Company Y acquired by USP is reasonably  anticipated to contribute to developing cost shared intangibles and is  therefore a platform contribution for which FSub must compensate USP as  part of a PCT. Although for accounting purposes a significant portion of  the acquisition price of Company Y was allocated to items other than  Technology X, the facts demonstrate that USP had no intention of using  and therefore placed no economic value on any part of Company Y other  than Technology X. If USP was willing to pay $200 million for Company Y  solely for purposes of acquiring Technology X, then assuming the  acquisition price method is otherwise the most reliable method, the  value of Technology X is the full $200 million acquisition price.  Accordingly, the value of the arm's length PCT Payment due from FSub to  USP for the platform contribution consisting of the rights in   Technology X will equal the product of $200 million and FSub's RAB  share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Valuations of subsequent PCTs--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Date of subsequent PCT.  The date of a PCT may occur subsequent to the inception of the CSA. For  example, an intangible initially developed outside the IDA may only  subsequently become a platform contribution because that later time is  the earliest date on which it is reasonably anticipated to contribute to  developing cost shared intangibles within the IDA. In such case, the  date of the PCT, and the analysis of the arm's length amount charged in  the subsequent PCT, is as of such later time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Best method analysis for subsequent PCT. In cases where PCTs  occur on different dates, the determination of the arm's length amount  charged, respectively, in the prior and subsequent PCTs must be  coordinated in a manner that provides the most reliable measure of an  arm's length result. In some circumstances, a subsequent PCT may be  reliably evaluated independently of other PCTs, as may be possible for  example, under the acquisition price method. In other circumstances, the  results of prior and subsequent PCTs may be interrelated and so a  subsequent PCT may be most reliably evaluated under the residual profit  split method of paragraph (g)(7) of this section. In those cases, for  purposes of allocating the present value of nonroutine residual  divisional profit or loss, and so determining the present value of the  subsequent PCT Payments, in accordance with paragraph (g)(7)(iii)(C) of  this section, the PCT Payor's interest in cost shared intangibles, both  already developed and in process, are treated as additional PCT Payor  operating contributions as of the date of the subsequent PCT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Arm's length range--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The guidance in Sec. 1.482- 1(e) regarding determination of an arm's length range, as modified by  this section, applies in evaluating the arm's length amount charged in a  PCT under a transfer pricing method provided in this section (applicable  method). Section 1.482-1(e)(2)(i) provides that the arm's length range  is ordinarily determined by applying a single pricing method selected  under the best method rule to two or more uncontrolled transactions of  similar comparability and reliability although use of more than one  method may be appropriate for the purposes described in Sec. 1.482- 1(c)(2)(iii). The rules provided in Sec. 1.482-1(e) and this section for  determining an arm's length range shall not override the rules provided  in paragraph (i)(6) of this section for periodic adjustments by the  Commissioner. The provisions in paragraphs (g)(2)(ix)(C) and (D) of this  section apply only to applicable methods that are based on two or more  input parameters as described in paragraph (g)(2)(ix)(B) of this  section. For an example of how the rules of this section for determining  an arm's length range of PCT Payments are applied, see paragraph  (g)(4)(viii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Methods based on two or more input parameters. An applicable  method may determine PCT Payments based on calculations involving two or  more parameters whose values depend on the facts and circumstances of  the case (input parameters). For some input parameters (market-based  input parameters), the value is most reliably determined by reference to  data that derives from uncontrolled transactions (market data). For  example, the value of the return to a controlled participant's routine  contributions, as such term is defined in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this  section, to the CSA Activity (which value is used as an input parameter  in the income method described in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) may  in some cases be most reliably determined by reference to the profit  level of a company with rights, resources, and capabilities comparable  to those routine contributions. See Sec. 1.482-5. As another example,  the value for the discount rate that reflects the riskiness of a  controlled participant's role in the CSA (which value is used as an  input parameter in the income method described in paragraph (g)(4) of  this section) may in some cases be most reliably determined by reference  to the stock beta of a company whose overall risk is comparable to the  riskiness of the controlled participant's role in the CSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Variable input parameters. For some market-based input  parameters   (variable input parameters), the parameter's value is most reliably  determined by considering two or more observations of market data that  have, or with adjustment can be brought to, a similar reliability and  comparability, as described in Sec. 1.482-1(e)(2)(ii) (for example,  profit levels or stock betas of two or more companies). See paragraph  (g)(2)(ix)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Determination of arm's length PCT Payment. For purposes of  applying this paragraph (g)(2)(ix), each input parameter is assigned a  single most reliable value, unless it is a variable input parameter as  described in paragraph (g)(2)(ix)(C) of this section. The determination  of the arm's length payment depends on the number of variable input  parameters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No variable input parameters. If there are no variable input  parameters, the arm's length PCT Payment is a single value determined by  using the single most reliable value determined for each input  parameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(iii)(C)</em>, of the set of PCT Payment values calculated  by selecting--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Iteratively, the value of the variable input parameter that is  based on each observation as described in paragraph (g)(2)(ix)(C) of  this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The single most reliable values for each other input parameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> More than one variable input parameter. If there are two or more  variable input parameters, then under the applicable method, the arm's  length range of PCT Payments is the interquartile range, as described in  Sec. 1.482-1(e)(2)(iii)(C), of the set of PCT Payment values calculated  iteratively using every possible combination of permitted choices of  values for the input parameters. For input parameters other than a  variable input parameter, the only such permitted choice is the single  most reliable value. For variable input parameters, such permitted  choices include any value that is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Based on one of the observations described in paragraph  (g)(2)(ix)(C) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Within the interquartile range (as described in Sec. 1.482- 1(e)(2)(iii)(C)) of the set of all values so based.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Adjustments. Section 1.482-1(e)(3), applied as modified by this  paragraph (g)(2)(ix), determines when the Commissioner may make an  adjustment to a PCT Payment due to the taxpayer's results being outside  the arm's length range. Adjustment will be to the median, as defined in  Sec. 1.482-1(e)(3). Thus, the Commissioner is not required to establish  an arm's length range prior to making an allocation under section 482.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Valuation undertaken on a pre-tax basis. PCT Payments in general  may increase the PCT Payee's tax liability and decrease the PCT Payor's  tax liability. The arm's length amount of a PCT Payment determined under  the methods in this paragraph (g) is the value of the PCT Payment  itself, without regard to such tax effects. Therefore, the methods under  this section must be applied, with suitable adjustments if needed, to  determine the PCT Payments on a pre-tax basis. See paragraphs  (g)(2)(v)(B) and (4)(i)(G) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Comparable uncontrolled transaction method. The comparable  uncontrolled transaction (CUT) method described in Sec. 1.482-4(c), and  the comparable uncontrolled services price (CUSP) method described in  Sec. 1.482-9(c), may be applied to evaluate whether the amount charged  in a PCT is arm's length by reference to the amount charged in a  comparable uncontrolled transaction. Although all of the factors  entering into a best method analysis described in Sec. 1.482-1(c) and  (d) must be considered, comparability and reliability under this method  are particularly dependent on similarity of contractual terms, degree to  which allocation of risks is proportional to reasonably anticipated  benefits from exploiting the results of intangible development, similar  period of commitment as to the sharing of intangible development risks,  and similar scope, uncertainty, and profit potential of the subject  intangible development, including a similar allocation of the risks of  any existing resources, capabilities, or   rights, as well as of the risks of developing other resources,  capabilities, or rights that would be reasonably anticipated to  contribute to exploitation within the parties' divisions, that is  consistent with the actual allocation of risks between the controlled  participants as provided in the CSA in accordance with this section.  When applied in the manner described in Sec. 1.482-4(c) or 1.482-9(c),  the CUT or CUSP method will typically yield an arm's length total value  for the platform contribution that is the subject of the PCT. That value  must then be multiplied by each PCT Payor's respective RAB share in  order to determine the arm's length PCT Payment due from each PCT Payor.  The reliability of a CUT or CUSP that yields a value for the platform  contribution only in the PCT Payor's division will be reduced to the  extent that value is not consistent with the total worldwide value of  the platform contribution multiplied by the PCT Payor's RAB share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Income method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Equating cost sharing and  licensing alternatives. The income method evaluates whether the amount  charged in a PCT is arm's length by reference to a controlled  participant's best realistic alternative to entering into a CSA. Under  this method, the arm's length charge for a PCT Payment will be an amount  such that a controlled participant's present value, as of the date of  the PCT, of its cost sharing alternative of entering into a CSA equals  the present value of its best realistic alternative. In general, the  best realistic alternative of the PCT Payor to entering into the CSA  would be to license intangibles to be developed by an uncontrolled  licensor that undertakes the commitment to bear the entire risk of  intangible development that would otherwise have been shared under the  CSA. Similarly, the best realistic alternative of the PCT Payee to  entering into the CSA would be to undertake the commitment to bear the  entire risk of intangible development that would otherwise have been  shared under the CSA and license the resulting intangibles to an  uncontrolled licensee. Paragraphs (g)(4)(i)(B) through (vi) of this  section describe specific applications of the income method, but do not  exclude other possible applications of this method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Cost sharing alternative. The PCT Payor's cost sharing  alternative corresponds to the actual CSA in accordance with this  section, with the PCT Payor's obligation to make the PCT Payments to be  determined and its commitment for the duration of the IDA to bear cost  contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Licensing alternative. The licensing alternative is derived on  the basis of a functional and risk analysis of the cost sharing  alternative, but with a shift of the risk of cost contributions to the  licensor. Accordingly, the PCT Payor's licensing alternative consists of  entering into a license with an uncontrolled party, for a term extending  for what would be the duration of the CSA Activity, to license the make- or-sell rights in to-be-developed resources, capabilities, or rights of  the licensor. Under such license, the licensor would undertake the  commitment to bear the entire risk of intangible development that would  otherwise have been shared under the CSA. Apart from any difference in  the allocation of the risks of the IDA, the licensing alternative should  assume contractual provisions with regard to non-overlapping divisional  intangible interests, and with regard to allocations of other risks,  that are consistent with the actual CSA in accordance with this section.  For example, the analysis under the licensing alternative should assume  a similar allocation of the risks of any existing resources,  capabilities, or rights, as well as of the risks of developing other  resources, capabilities, or rights that would be reasonably anticipated  to contribute to exploitation within the parties' divisions, that is  consistent with the actual allocation of risks between the controlled  participants as provided in the CSA in accordance with this section.  Accordingly, the financial projections associated with the licensing and  cost sharing alternatives are necessarily the same except for the  licensing payments to be made under the licensing alternative and the  cost contributions and PCT Payments to be made under the CSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Only one controlled participant with nonroutine platform  contributions. This method involves only one of the   controlled participants providing nonroutine platform contributions as  the PCT Payee. For a method under which more than one controlled  participant may be a PCT Payee, see the application of the residual  profit method pursuant to paragraph (g)(7) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Income method payment forms. The income method may be applied to  determine PCT Payments in any form of payment (for example, lump sum,  royalty on sales, or royalty on divisional profit). For converting to  another form of payment, see generally paragraph (h) (Form of payment  rules) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em>  of this section. See, for example, Sec. 1.482-7(g)(2)(v)(B)(1) (Discount  rate variation between realistic alternatives). In circumstances where  the market-correlated risks as between the cost sharing and licensing  alternatives are not materially different, a reliable analysis may be  possible by using the same discount rate with respect to both  alternatives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> The effect of taxation on determining the arm's length amount.  (1) In principle, the present values of the cost sharing and licensing  alternatives should be determined by applying post-tax discount rates to  post-tax income (including the post-tax value to the controlled  participant of the PCT Payments). If such approach is adopted, then the  post-tax value of the PCT Payments must be appropriately adjusted in  order to determine the arm's length amount of the PCT Payments on a pre- tax basis. See paragraph (g)(2)(x) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(v)(B)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To the extent that a controlled participant's tax rate is not  materially affected by whether it enters into the cost sharing or  licensing alternative (or reliable adjustments may be made for varying  tax rates), the factor (that is, one minus the tax rate) may be  cancelled from both sides of the equation of the cost sharing and  licensing alternative present values. Accordingly, in such circumstance  it is sufficient to apply post-tax discount rates to projections of pre- tax income for the purpose of equating the cost sharing and licensing  alternatives. The specific applications of the income method described  in paragraphs (g)(4)(ii) through (iv) of this section and the examples  set forth in paragraph (g)(4)(viii) of this section assume that a  controlled participant's tax rate is not materially affected by whether  it enters into the cost sharing or licensing alternative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Evaluation of PCT Payor's cost sharing alternative. The present  value of the PCT Payor's cost sharing alternative is the present value  of the stream of the reasonably anticipated residuals over the duration  of the CSA Activity of divisional profits or losses, minus operating  cost contributions, minus cost contributions, minus PCT Payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Evaluation of PCT Payor's licensing alternative--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  Evaluation based on CUT. The present value of the PCT Payor's licensing  alternative may be determined using the comparable uncontrolled  transaction method, as described in Sec. 1.482-4(c)(1) and (2). In this  case, the present value of the PCT Payor's licensing alternative is the  present value of the stream, over what would be the duration of the CSA  Activity under the cost sharing alternative, of the reasonably  anticipated residuals of the divisional profits or losses that would be  achieved under the cost sharing alternative, minus operating cost  contributions that would be made under the cost sharing alternative,  minus the licensing payments as determined under the comparable  uncontrolled transaction method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Evaluation based on CPM. The present value of the PCT Payor's  licensing alternative may be determined using the comparable profits  method, as described in Sec. 1.482-5. In this case, the present value of  the licensing alternative is determined as in paragraph (g)(4)(iii)(A)  of this section, except that   the PCT Payor's licensing payments, as defined in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of  this section, are determined in each period to equal the reasonably  anticipated residuals of the divisional profits or losses that would be  achieved under the cost sharing alternative, minus operating cost  contributions that would be made under the cost sharing alternative,  minus market returns for routine contributions, as defined in paragraph  (j)(1)(i) of this section. However, treatment of net operating  contributions as operating cost contributions shall be coordinated with  the treatment of other routine contributions pursuant to this paragraph  so as to avoid duplicative market returns to such contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Lump sum payment form. Where the form of PCT Payment is a lump  sum as of the date of the PCT, then, based on paragraphs (g)(4)(i)  through (iii) of this section, the PCT Payment equals the difference  between--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The present value, using the discount rate appropriate for the  cost sharing alternative, of the stream of the reasonably anticipated  residuals over the duration of the CSA Activity of divisional profits or  losses, minus cost contributions and operating cost contributions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The present value of the licensing alternative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Application of income method using differential income stream.  In some cases, the present value of an arm's length PCT Payment may be  determined as the present value, discounted at the appropriate rate, of  the PCT Payor's reasonably anticipated stream of additional positive or  negative income over the duration of the CSA Activity that would result  (before PCT Payments) from undertaking the cost sharing alternative  rather than the licensing alternative (differential income stream). See  Example 9 of paragraph (g)(4)(viii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Best method analysis considerations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Coordination with  Sec. 1.482-1(c). Whether results derived from this method are the most  reliable measure of an arm's length result is determined using the  factors described under the best method rule in Sec. 1.482-1(c). Thus,  comparability and the quality of data, the reliability of the  assumptions, and the sensitivity of the results to possible deficiencies  in the data and assumptions, must be considered in determining whether  this method provides the most reliable measure of an arm's length  result.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Assumptions Concerning Tax Rates. This method will be more  reliable to the extent that the controlled participants' respective tax  rates are not materially affected by whether they enter into the cost  sharing or licensing alternative. Even if this assumption of invariant  tax rates across alternatives does not hold, this method may still be  reliable to the extent that reliable adjustments can be made to reflect  the variation in tax rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Coordination with Sec. 1.482-4(c)(2). If the licensing  alternative is evaluated using the comparable uncontrolled transactions  method, as described in paragraph (g)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, any  additional comparability and reliability considerations stated in  Sec. 1.482-4(c)(2) may apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Coordination with Sec. 1.482-5(c). If the licensing alternative  is evaluated using the comparable profits method, as described in  paragraph (g)(4)(iii)(B) of this section, any additional comparability  and reliability considerations stated in Sec. 1.482-5(c) may apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Certain Circumstances Concerning PCT Payor. This method may be  used even if the PCT Payor furnishes significant operating  contributions, or commits to assume the risk of significant operating  cost contributions, to the PCT Payor's division. However, in such a  case, any comparable uncontrolled transactions described in paragraph  (g)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, and any comparable transactions used  under Sec. 1.482-5(c) as described in paragraphs (g)(4)(iii)(B) of this  section, should be consistent with such contributions (or reliable  adjustments must be made for material differences).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Discount rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reflection of similar risk profiles of cost sharing alternative  and licensing alternative. Because the financial projections associated  with the licensing and cost sharing alternatives are the same, except  for the licensing payments to be made under the licensing alternative  and the cost contributions and PCT Payments to be made under the cost   sharing alternative, the analysis of the risk profile and financial  projections for a realistic alternative to the cost sharing alternative  must be closely associated with the risk profile and financial  projections associated with the cost sharing alternative, differing only  in the treatment of licensing payments, cost contributions, and PCT  Payments. When using discount rates in applying the income method, this  means that even if different discount rates are warranted for the two  alternatives, the risk profiles for the two discount rates are closely  related to each other because the discount rate for the licensing  alternative and the discount rate for the cost sharing alternative are  both derived from the single probability-weighted financial projections  associated with the CSA Activity. The difference, if any, in market- correlated risks between the licensing and cost sharing alternatives is  due solely to the different effects on risks of the PCT Payor making  licensing payments under the licensing alternative, on the one hand, and  the PCT Payor making cost contributions and PCT Payments under the cost  sharing alternative, on the other hand. That is, the difference in the  risk profile between the two scenarios solely reflects the incremental  risk, if any, associated with the cost contributions taken on by the PCT  Payor in developing the cost shared intangible under the cost sharing  alternative, and the difference, if any, in risk associated with the  particular payment forms of the licensing payments and the PCT Payments,  in light of the fact that the licensing payments in the licensing  alternative are partially replaced by cost contributions and partially  replaced by PCT Payments in the cost sharing alternative, each with its  own payment form. An analysis under the income method that uses a  different discount rate for the cost sharing alternative than for the  licensing alternative will be more reliable the greater the extent to  which the difference, if any, between the two discount rates reflects  solely these differences in the risk profiles of these two alternatives.  See, for example, paragraph (g)(2)(iii), Example 2 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Use of differential income stream as a consideration in  assessing the best method. An analysis under the income method that uses  a different discount rate for the cost sharing alternative than for the  licensing alternative will be more reliable the greater the extent to  which the implied discount rate for the projected present value of the  differential income stream is consistent with reliable direct evidence  of the appropriate discount rate applicable for activities reasonably  anticipated to generate an income stream with a similar risk profile to  the differential income stream. Such differential income stream is  defined as the stream of the reasonably anticipated residuals of the PCT  Payor's licensing payments to be made under the licensing alternative,  minus the PCT Payor's cost contributions to be made under the cost  sharing alternative. See Example 8 of paragraph (g)(4)(viii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Routine platform and operating contributions. For purposes of  this paragraph (g)(4), any routine contributions that are platform or  operating contributions, the valuation and PCT Payments for which are  determined and made independently of the income method, are treated  similarly to cost contributions and operating cost contributions,  respectively. Accordingly, wherever used in this paragraph (g)(4), the  term ``routine contributions'' shall not include routine platform or  operating contributions, and wherever the terms ``cost contributions''  and ``operating cost contributions'' appear in this paragraph, they  shall include net routine platform contributions and net routine  operating contributions, respectively. Net routine platform  contributions are the value of a controlled participant's total  reasonably anticipated routine platform contributions, plus its  reasonably anticipated PCT Payments to other controlled participants in  respect of their routine platform contributions, minus the reasonably  anticipated PCT Payments it is to receive from other controlled  participants in respect of its routine platform contributions. Net  routine operating contributions are the value of a controlled  participant's total reasonably anticipated routine operating  contributions, plus its reasonably anticipated   arm's length compensation to other controlled participants in respect of  their routine operating contributions, minus the reasonably anticipated  arm's length compensation it is to receive from other controlled  participants in respect of its routine operating contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Examples.

FS has a license under Company Q's copyright, but  that license expires after Year 15 and will not be renewed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In evaluating the cost sharing alternative, FS concludes that  the cost sharing alternative represents a riskier alternative for FS  than the licensing alternative because, in cost sharing, FS will take on  the additional risks associated with cost contributions. Taking this  difference into account, FS concludes that the appropriate discount rate  to apply in assessing the licensing alternative, based on discount rates  of comparable uncontrolled companies undertaking comparable licensing  transactions, would be 13% per year, whereas the appropriate discount  rate to apply in assessing the cost sharing alternative would be 15% per  year. FS determines that the arm's length rate USP would have charged an  uncontrolled licensee for a license of future versions of the software  (if USP had further developed version 1.0 on its own) is 35% of the  sales price, as determined under the CUT method in Sec. 1.482-4(c).

USP, a U.S. software company, has developed version 1.0 of a new  software application, employed to store and retrieve complex data sets  in certain types of storage media. Version 1.0 is currently being  marketed. In Year 1, USP enters into a CSA with its wholly-owned foreign  subsidiary, FS, to develop future versions of the software application.  Under the CSA, USP will have the exclusive rights to exploit the future  versions in the U.S., and FS will have the exclusive rights to exploit  them in the rest of the world. USP's rights in version 1.0, and its  development team, are reasonably anticipated to contribute to the  development of future versions of the software application and,  therefore, the rights in version 1.0 are platform contributions for  which compensation is due from FS as part of a PCT. USP also transfers  the current exploitation rights in version 1.0 to FS and the arm's  length amount of the compensation for such transfer is determined in the  aggregate with the arm's length PCT Payments in this Example 3. FS does  not furnish any platform contributions to the CSA nor does it control  any operating intangibles at the inception of the CSA that would be  relevant to the exploitation of version 1.0 or future versions of the  software. It is reasonably anticipated that FS will have gross sales of  $1000X in its territory for 5 years attributable to its exploitation of  version 1.0 and the cost shared intangibles, after which time the  software application will be rendered obsolete and unmarketable by the  obsolescence of the storage medium technology to which it relates. FS's  costs reasonably attributable to the CSA, other than cost contributions  and operating cost contributions, are anticipated to be $250X per year.  Certain operating cost contributions that will be borne by FS are  reasonably anticipated to equal $200X per annum for 5 years. In  addition, FS is reasonably anticipated to pay cost contributions of  $200X per year as a controlled participant in the CSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> FS concludes that its realistic alternative would be to license  software from an uncontrolled licensor that would undertake the  commitment to bear the entire risk of software development. Applying CPM  using the profit levels experienced by uncontrolled licensees with  contractual provisions and allocations of risk that are comparable to  those of FS's licensing alternative, FS determines that it could, as a  licensee, reasonably expect a (pre-tax) routine return equal to 14% of  gross sales or $140X per year for 5 years. The remaining net revenue  would be paid to the uncontrolled licensor as a license fee of $410X per  year. FS determines that the discount rate that would be applied to  determine the present value of income and costs   attributable to its participation in the licensing alternative would be  12.5% as compared to the 15% discount rate that would be applicable in  determining the present value of the net income attributable to its  participation in the CSA (reflecting the increased risk borne by FS in  bearing a share of the R & D costs in the cost sharing alternative). FS  also determines that the tax rate applicable to it will be the same in  the licensing alternative as in the CSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> On these facts, the present value to FS of entering into the  cost sharing alternative equals the present value of the annual  divisional profits ($1,000X minus $250X) minus operating cost  contributions ($200X) minus cost contributions ($200X) minus PCT  Payments, determined over 5 years by discounting at a discount rate of  15%. Thus, the present value of the residuals, prior to subtracting the  present value of the PCT Payments, is $1349X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> On these facts, the present value to FS of entering into the  licensing alternative would be $561X determined by discounting, over 5  years, annual divisional profits ($1,000X minus $250X) minus operating  cost contributions ($200X) and licensing payments ($410X) at a discount  rate of 12.5% per annum. The present value of the cost sharing  alternative must also equal $561X but equals $1349X prior to subtracting  the present value of the PCT Payments. Consequently, the PCT Payments  must have a present value of $788X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For simplicity of calculation in this Example 4, it is assumed that  all payments are made at the end of each year. Domestic controlled  participant USP has developed a technology, Z, that it would like to  exploit for three years in a CSA. USP enters into a CSA with its wholly- owned foreign subsidiary, FS, that provides for PCT Payments from FS to  USP with respect to USP's platform contribution to the CSA of Z in the  form of three annual installment payments due from FS to USP on the last  day of each of the first three years of the CSA. FS makes no platform  contributions to the CSA. Prior to entering into the CSA, FS considers  that it has the realistic alternative available to it of licensing Z  from USP rather than entering into a CSA with USP to further develop Z  for three years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> FS undertakes financial projections for both the licensing and  cost sharing alternatives for exploitation of Z in its territory of the  CSA. These projections are set forth in the following tables. The  example assumes that there is a reasonably anticipated effective tax  rate of 25% in each of years 1 through 3 under both the licensing and  cost sharing alternatives. FS determines that the appropriate post-tax  discount rate under the licensing alternative is 12.5%, and that the  appropriate post-tax discount rate under the cost sharing alternative is  15%.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Present value</p><p class="depth0">Licensing alternative              (12.5% DR)          Year 1            Year 2            Year 3 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) Sales...............................  ................             $1000             $1100             $1210 (2) License Fee.........................  ................               400               440               484 (3) Operating costs.....................  ................               500               550               605 (4) Operating Income....................              $261               100               110               121 (5) Tax (25%)...........................  ................                25                28                30 (6) Post-tax income.....................              $196               $75               $82               $91 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Present value</p><p class="depth0">Cost sharing alternative              (15% DR)           Year 1            Year 2            Year 3 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (7) Sales...............................  ................             $1000             $1100             $1210 (8) Cost Contributions..................  ................               200               220               242 (9) PCT Payments........................

The post-tax  present value of the licensing alternative is $196. Accordingly,  payments with a post-tax present value of $366 are required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Commissioner undertakes an audit of the PCT Payments made  by FS to USP for Z in Years 1 through 3. In correspondence to the  Commissioner, USP maintains that the arm's length PCT Payment for Z  should have a present value of $366 (D).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The Commissioner considers that if FS makes PCT Payments for Z  with a present value of $366, then the post-tax present value under the  CSA (considering the deductibility of the PCT Payments) will be $287,  substantially higher than the post-tax present value of the licensing  arrangement, $196. The Commissioner determines that, under the specific  facts and assumptions of this example, the present value of the post-tax  payments may be grossed up by a factor of (one minus the tax rate),  resulting in a present value of pre-tax payments of $488. Accordingly,  FS must make yearly PCT Payments (A, B, and C) such that the present  value of the Payments is $488 (D). (When FS's post-tax income after  these PCT Payments for Z is discounted at the appropriate rate for the  cost sharing alternative (15%), the net present value is $196 (L), which  is equal to the present value of post-tax income under the licensing  alternative.) The Commissioner concludes that the calculations that it  has made for the PCT Payments for Z are arm's length in accordance with  this paragraph (g)(4) and, accordingly, makes the appropriate  adjustments to USP's income tax return to account for the gross-up  required by paragraph (g)(2)(x) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> and (ii) of Example 4. In  addition, under paragraph (g)(4) of this section, the arm's length  charge for a PCT Payment will be an amount such that a controlled  participant's present value, as of the date of the PCT of its cost  sharing alternative of entering into a CSA equals the present value of  its best realistic alternative. This requires that ``L,'' the present  value of the post-tax income under the CSA, equals the present value of  the post-tax income under the licensing alternative, or $196.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under the specific facts and assumptions of this Example 6 (see  paragraph (g)(4)(i)(G) of this section), and using the same (post-tax)  discount rates as in Example 4, the present value of pre-tax income  under the licensing alternative (that is, the operating income) is $261,  and the present value of pre-tax income under the cost sharing  alternative (excluding PCT Payments) is $749. Accordingly, FS determines  that its PCT Payments for Z should have a present value equal to the  difference between the two, or $488 (D). Such PCT Payments for Z result  in a present value of post-tax income under the cost sharing alternative  of $196 (L), which is equal to the present value of post-tax income  under the licensing alternative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Commissioner undertakes an audit of the PCT Payments for Z  made by FS to USP in Years 1 through 3. The Commissioner concludes that  the PCT Payments for Z are arm's length in accordance with this  paragraph (g)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For simplicity of calculation in this Example 7, all  financial flows are assumed to occur at the beginning of each period.  USP's research and development team, Q, has developed a technology, Z,  for which it has several applications on the market now and several  planned for release at future dates. In Year 1, USP, enters into a CSA  with its wholly-owned subsidiary, FS, to develop future applications of  Z. Under the CSA, USP will have the rights to further develop and  exploit the future applications of Z in the United States, and FS will  have the rights to further develop and exploit the future applications  of Z in the rest of the world. Both Q and the rights to further develop  and exploit future applications of Z are reasonably anticipated to  contribute to the development of future applications of Z. Therefore,  both Q and the rights to further develop and exploit the future  applications of Z are platform contributions for which compensation is  due from FS to USP as part of a PCT. USP does not transfer the current  exploitation rights for current applications of Z to FS. FS will not  perform any research or development activities on Z and does not   furnish any platform contributions to the CSA, nor does it control any  operating intangibles at the inception of the CSA that would be relevant  to the exploitation of either current or future applications of Z.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At the outset of the CSA, FS undertakes an analysis of the PCTs  involving Q and the rights with respect to Z in order to determine the  arm's length PCT Payments owing from FS to USP under the CSA. In that  evaluation, FS concludes that the cost sharing alternative represents a  riskier alternative for FS than the licensing alternative. FS further  concludes that the appropriate discount rate to apply in assessing the  licensing alternative, based on discount rates of comparable  uncontrolled companies undertaking comparable licensing transactions,  would be 13% per annum, whereas the appropriate discount rate to apply  in assessing the cost sharing alternative would be 14% per annum. FS  undertakes financial projections and anticipates making $100 million in  sales during the first two years of the CSA in its territory with sales  in Years 3 through 8 increasing to $200 million, $400 million, $600  million, $650 million, $700 million, and $750 million, respectively.  After Year 8, FS expects its sales of all products based upon  exploitation of Z in the rest of the world to grow at 3% per annum for  the future. FS and USP do not anticipate cessation of the CSA Activity  with respect to Z at any determinable date. FS anticipates that its  manufacturing and distribution costs for exploiting Z (including its  operating cost contributions), will equal 60% of gross sales of Z from  Year 1 onwards, and anticipates its cost contributions will equal $25  million per annum for Years 1 and 2, $50 million per annum for Years 3  and 4, and 10% of gross sales per annum thereafter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Based on this analysis, FS determines that the arm's length  royalty rate that USP would have charged an uncontrolled licensee for a  license of future applications of Z if USP had further developed future  applications of Z on its own is 30% of the sales price of the Z-based  product, as determined under the comparable uncontrolled transaction  method in Sec. 1.482-4(c). In light of the expected sales growth and  anticipation that the CSA Activity will not cease as of any determinable  date, FS's determination includes a terminal value calculation. FS  further determines that under the cost sharing alternative, the present  value of FS's divisional profits, reduced by the present values of the  anticipated operating cost contributions and cost contributions, would  be $1,361 million. Under the licensing alternative, the present value of  the operating divisional profits and losses, reduced by the operating  cost contributions, would be $2,113 million, and the present value of  the licensing payments would be $1,585 million. Therefore, the total  value of the licensing alternative would be $528 million. In order for  the present value of the cost sharing alternative to equal the present  value of the licensing alternative, the present value of the PCT  Payments must equal $833 million. Accordingly, FS pays USP a lump sum  PCT Payment of $833 million in Year 1 for USP's platform contributions  of Z and Q.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The Commissioner undertakes an audit of the PCTs and concludes,  based on his own analysis, that this lump sum PCT Payment is within the  interquartile range of arm's length results for these platform  contributions.

In addition, the taxpayer determines that  the appropriate discount rate for the licensing alternative is 10%.  Accordingly, the taxpayer determines that the appropriate present value  of the PCT Payment is $146 million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Based on the best method analysis described in Example 2, the  Commissioner determines that the taxpayer's calculation of the present  value of the PCT Payments is outside of the interquartile range (as  shown in the sixth column of Example 2), and thus warrants an  adjustment. Furthermore, in evaluating the taxpayer's analysis, the  Commissioner undertakes an analysis based on the difference in the  financial projections between the cost sharing and licensing  alternatives (as shown in column 11 of Example 1). This column shows the  anticipated differential income stream of additional positive or  negative income for FS over the duration of the CSA Activity that would  result from undertaking the cost sharing alternative (before any PCT  Payments) rather than the licensing alternative. This anticipated  differential income stream thus reflects the anticipated incremental  undiscounted profits to FS from the incremental activity of undertaking  the risk of developing the cost shared intangibles and enjoying the  value of its divisional interests. Taxpayer's analysis logically implies  that the present value of this stream must be $146 million, since only  then would FS have the same anticipated value in both the cost sharing  and licensing alternatives. A present value of $146 million implies that  the discount rate applicable to this stream is 34.4%. Based on a  reliable calculation of discount rates applicable to the anticipated  income streams of uncontrolled companies whose resources, capabilities,  and rights consist primarily of software applications intangibles and  research and development teams similar to USP's platform contributions  to the CSA, and which income streams, accordingly, may be reasonably  anticipated to reflect a similar risk profile to the differential income  stream, the Commissioner concludes that an appropriate discount rate for  the anticipated income stream associated with USP's platform  contributions (that is, the additional positive or negative income over  the duration of the CSA   Activity that would result, before PCT Payments, from switching from the  licensing alternative to the cost sharing alternative) is 16%, which is  significantly less than 34.4%. This conclusion further suggests that  Taxpayer's analysis is unreliable. See paragraphs (g)(2)(v)(B)(2) and  (g)(4)(vi)(F)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Commissioner makes an adjustment of $296 million, so that  the present value of the PCT Payments is $442 million (the median  results as shown in column 6 of Example 2).</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  additional data on discount rates are available that were not available  in Example 1. The Commissioner determines the arm's length charge for  the PCT Payment by discounting at an appropriate rate the differential  income stream associated with the rights contributed by USP in the PCT  (that is, the stream of income in column (11) of Example 1). Based on an  analysis of a set of public companies whose resources, capabilities, and  rights consist primarily of resources, capabilities, and rights similar  to those contributed by USP in the PCT, the Commissioner determines that  15% to 17% is an appropriate range of discount rates to use to assess  the value of the differential income stream associated with the rights  contributed by USP in the PCT. The Commissioner determines that applying  a discount rate of 17% to the differential income stream associated with  the rights contributed by USP in the PCT yields a present value of $446  million, while applying a discount rate of 15% to the differential  income stream associated with the rights contributed by USP in the PCT  yields a present value of $510 million. Because the taxpayer's result,  $464 million, is within the interquartile range determined by the  Commissioner, no adjustments are warranted.

The acquisition price  method applies the comparable uncontrolled transaction method of  Sec. 1.482-4(c), or the comparable uncontrolled services price method  described in Sec. 1.482-9(c), to evaluate whether the amount charged in  a PCT, or group of PCTs, is arm's length by reference to the amount  charged (the acquisition price) for the stock or asset purchase of an  entire organization or portion thereof (the target) in an uncontrolled  transaction. The acquisition price method is ordinarily used where  substantially all the target's nonroutine contributions, as such term is  defined in paragraph (j)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section, made to the PCT Payee's  business activities are covered by a PCT or group of PCTs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determination of arm's length charge.

The adjusted acquisition price is  the acquisition price of the target increased by the value of the  target's liabilities on the date of the acquisition, other than  liabilities not assumed in the case of an asset purchase, and decreased  by the value of the target's tangible property on that date and by the  value on that date of any other resources, capabilities, and rights not  covered by a PCT or group of PCTs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Best method analysis considerations. The comparability and  reliability considerations stated in Sec. 1.482-4(c)(2) apply.

The following example illustrates the principles of  this paragraph (g)(5):</p><p class="depth0">Example. USP, a U.S. corporation, and its newly incorporated,  wholly-owned foreign subsidiary (FS) enter into a CSA at the start of  Year 1 to develop Group Z products. Under the CSA, USP and FS will have  the exclusive rights to exploit the Group Z products in the U.S. and the  rest of the world, respectively. At the start of Year 2, USP acquires  Company X for cash consideration worth $110 million. At this time USP's  RAB share is 60%, and FS's RAB share is 40% and is not reasonably  anticipated to change as a result of this acquisition. Company X joins  in the   filing of a U.S. consolidated income tax return with USP. Under  paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, Company X and USP are treated as  one taxpayer for purposes of this section. Accordingly, the rights in  any of Company X's resources and capabilities that are reasonably  anticipated to contribute to the development activities of the CSA will  be considered platform contributions furnished by USP. Company X's  resources and capabilities consist of its workforce, certain technology  intangibles, $15 million of tangible property and other assets and $5  million in liabilities. The technology intangibles, as well as Company  X's workforce, are reasonably anticipated to contribute to the  development of the Group Z products under the CSA and, therefore, the  rights in the technology intangibles and the workforce are platform  contributions for which FS must make a PCT Payment to USP. None of  Company X's existing intangible assets or any of its workforce are  anticipated to contribute to activities outside the CSA. For purposes of  this example, it is assumed that no additional adjustment on account of  tax liabilities is needed. Applying the acquisition price method, the  value of USP's platform contributions is the adjusted acquisition price  of $100 million ($110 million acquisition price plus $5 million  liabilities less $15 million tangible property and other assets). FS  must make a PCT Payment to USP for these platform contributions with a  reasonably anticipated present value of $40 million, which is the  product of $100 million (the value of the platform contributions) and  40% (FS's RAB share).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Market capitalization method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The market  capitalization method applies the comparable uncontrolled transaction  method of Sec. 1.482-4(c), or the comparable uncontrolled services price  method described in Sec. 1.482-9(c), to evaluate whether the amount  charged in a PCT, or group of PCTs, is arm's length by reference to the  average market capitalization of a controlled participant (PCT Payee)  whose stock is regularly traded on an established securities market. The  market capitalization method is ordinarily used where substantially all  of the PCT Payee's nonroutine contributions to the PCT Payee's business  are covered by a PCT or group of PCTs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determination of arm's length charge. Under the market  capitalization method, the arm's length charge for a PCT or group of  PCTs covering resources, capabilities, and rights of the PCT Payee is  equal to the adjusted average market capitalization, as divided among  the controlled participants according to their respective RAB shares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Average market capitalization. The average market  capitalization is the average of the daily market capitalizations of the  PCT Payee over a period of time beginning 60 days before the date of the  PCT and ending on the date of the PCT. The daily market capitalization  of the PCT Payee is calculated on each day its stock is actively traded  as the total number of shares outstanding multiplied by the adjusted  closing price of the stock on that day. The adjusted closing price is  the daily closing price of the stock, after adjustments for stock-based  transactions (dividends and stock splits) and other pending corporate  (combination and spin-off) restructuring transactions for which reliable  arm's length adjustments can be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Adjusted average market capitalization. The adjusted average  market capitalization is the average market capitalization of the PCT  Payee increased by the value of the PCT Payee's liabilities on the date  of the PCT and decreased by the value on such date of the PCT Payee's  tangible property and of any other resources, capabilities, or rights of  the PCT Payee not covered by a PCT or group of PCTs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Best method analysis considerations. The comparability and  reliability considerations stated in Sec. 1.482-4(c)(2) apply.  Consistent with those considerations, the reliability of applying the  comparable uncontrolled transaction method using the adjusted market  capitalization of a company as a measure of the arm's length charge for  the PCT Payment normally is reduced if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A substantial portion of the PCT Payee's nonroutine  contributions to its business activities is not required to be covered  by a PCT or group of PCTs, and that portion of the nonroutine  contributions cannot reliably be valued;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A substantial portion of the PCT Payee's assets consists of  tangible property that cannot reliably be valued; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Facts and circumstances demonstrate the likelihood of a material  divergence between the average market capitalization of the PCT Payee   and the value of its resources, capabilities, and rights for which  reliable adjustments cannot be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (g)(6):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> USP, a publicly traded U.S. company, and its newly  incorporated wholly-owned foreign subsidiary (FS) enter into a CSA on  Date 1 to develop software. At that time USP has in-process software but  has no software ready for the market. Under the CSA, USP and FS will  have the exclusive rights to exploit the software developed under the  CSA in the United States and the rest of the world, respectively. On  Date 1, USP's RAB share is 70% and FS's RAB share is 30%. USP's  assembled team of researchers and its in-process software are reasonably  anticipated to contribute to the development of the software under the  CSA. Therefore, the rights in the research team and in-process software  are platform contributions for which compensation is due from FS.  Further, these rights are not reasonably anticipated to contribute to  any business activity other than the CSA Activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section, is $60  million, which is the product of $200 million (the value of the platform  contributions) and 30% (FS's RAB share on Date 1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are  the same as in Example 1, except that on Date 1 USP also has existing  software ready for the market. USP separately enters into a license  agreement with FS for make-or-sell rights for all existing software  outside the United States. No marketing has occurred, and USP has no  marketing intangibles. This license of current make-or-sell rights is a  transaction governed by Sec. 1.482-4. However, after analysis, it is  determined that the arm's length PCT Payments and the arm's length  payments for the make-or-sell license may be most reliably determined in  the aggregate using the market capitalization method, under principles  described in paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section, and it is further  determined that those principles are most reliably implemented by  computing the aggregate arm's length charge as the product of the  aggregate value of the existing and in-process software and FS's RAB  share on Date 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Applying the market capitalization method, the aggregate value  of USP's platform contributions and the make-or-sell rights in its  existing software is $250 million ($255 million average market  capitalization of USP less $5 million of tangible property and other  assets). The total arm's length value of the PCT Payments and licensing  payments FS must make to USP for the platform contributions and current  make-or-sell rights, before any adjustment on account of tax liability,  if any, is $75 million, which is the product of $250 million (the value  of the platform contributions and the make-or-sell rights) and 30% (FS's  RAB share on Date 1).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Reduced reliability. The facts are the same as in Example  1 except that USP also has significant nonroutine assets that will be  used solely in a nascent business division that is unrelated to the  subject of the CSA and that cannot themselves be reliably valued. Those  nonroutine contributions are not platform contributions and accordingly  are not required to be covered by a PCT. The reliability of using the  market capitalization method to determine the value of USP's platform  contributions to the CSA is significantly reduced in this case because  that method would require adjusting USP's average market capitalization  to account for the significant nonroutine contributions that are not  required to be covered by a PCT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Residual profit split method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The residual  profit split method evaluates whether the allocation of combined  operating profit or loss attributable to one or more platform  contributions subject to a PCT is arm's length by reference to the  relative value of each controlled participant's contribution to that  combined operating profit or loss. The combined operating profit or loss  must be derived from the most narrowly identifiable business activity  (relevant business activity) of the controlled participants for which  data are available that include the CSA Activity. The residual profit  split method may not be used where only one controlled participant makes  significant nonroutine contributions (including platform or operating  contributions) to the CSA Activity. The provisions of Sec. 1.482-6 shall  apply to CSAs only to the extent provided and as modified in this  paragraph (g)(7). Any other application to a CSA of a residual profit  method not described in   paragraphs (g)(7)(ii) and (iii) of this section will constitute an  unspecified method for purposes of sections 482 and 6662(e) and the  regulations under those sections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Appropriate share of profits and losses. The relative value of  each controlled participant's contribution to the success of the  relevant business activity must be determined in a manner that reflects  the functions performed, risks assumed, and resources employed by each  participant in the relevant business activity, consistent with the best  method analysis described in Sec. 1.482-1(c) and (d). Such an allocation  is intended to correspond to the division of profit or loss that would  result from an arrangement between uncontrolled taxpayers, each  performing functions similar to those of the various controlled  participants engaged in the relevant business activity. The profit  allocated to any particular controlled participant is not necessarily  limited to the total operating profit of the group from the relevant  business activity. For example, in a given year, one controlled  participant may earn a profit while another controlled participant  incurs a loss. In addition, it may not be assumed that the combined  operating profit or loss from the relevant business activity should be  shared equally, or in any other arbitrary proportion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Profit split--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Under the residual profit split  method, the present value of each controlled participant's residual  divisional profit or loss attributable to nonroutine contributions  (nonroutine residual divisional profit or loss) is allocated between the  controlled participants that each furnish significant nonroutine  contributions (including platform or operating contributions) to the  relevant business activity in that division.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Determine nonroutine residual divisional profit or loss. The  present value of each controlled participant's nonroutine residual  divisional profit or loss must be determined to reflect the most  reliable measure of an arm's length result. The present value of  nonroutine residual divisional profit or loss equals the present value  of the stream of the reasonably anticipated residuals over the duration  of the CSA Activity of divisional profit or loss, minus market returns  for routine contributions, minus operating cost contributions, minus  cost contributions, using a discount rate appropriate to such residuals  in accordance with paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section. As used in this  paragraph (g)(7), the phrase ``market returns for routine  contributions'' includes market returns for operating cost contributions  and excludes market returns for cost contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Allocate nonroutine residual divisional profit or loss--(1) In  general. The present value of nonroutine residual divisional profit or  loss in each controlled participant's division must be allocated among  all of the controlled participants based upon the relative values,  determined as of the date of the PCTs, of the PCT Payor's as compared to  the PCT Payee's nonroutine contributions to the PCT Payor's division.  For this purpose, the PCT Payor's nonroutine contribution consists of  the sum of the PCT Payor's nonroutine operating contributions and the  PCT Payor's RAB share of the PCT Payor's nonroutine platform  contributions. For this purpose, the PCT Payee's nonroutine contribution  consists of the PCT Payor's RAB share of the PCT Payee's nonroutine  platform contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Relative value determination. The relative values of the  controlled participants' nonroutine contributions must be determined so  as to reflect the most reliable measure of an arm's length result.  Relative values may be measured by external market benchmarks that  reflect the fair market value of such nonroutine contributions.  Alternatively, the relative value of nonroutine contributions may be  estimated by the capitalized cost of developing the nonroutine  contributions and updates, as appropriately grown or discounted so that  all contributions may be valued on a comparable dollar basis as of the  same date. If the nonroutine contributions by a controlled participant  are also used in other business activities (such as the exploitation of   make-or-sell rights described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section), an  allocation of the value of the nonroutine contributions must be made on  a reasonable basis among all the business activities in which they are  used in proportion to the relative economic value that the relevant  business activity and such other business activities are anticipated to  derive over time as the result of such nonroutine contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(ii)</em>  of this section, the present value of a PCT Payor's PCT Payments under  this paragraph shall be deemed reduced to the extent of the present  value of any PCT Payments owed to it from other controlled participants  under this paragraph (g)(7). The resulting remainder may be converted to  a fixed or contingent form of payment in accordance with paragraph (h)  (Form of payment rules) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(iii)(B)</em> and (7)(iii)(B) of this section so as to avoid  duplicative market returns to such contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Best method analysis considerations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Whether  results derived from this method are the most reliable measure of the  arm's length result is determined using the factors described under the  best method rule in Sec. 1.482-1(c). Thus, comparability and quality of  data, reliability of assumptions, and sensitivity of results to possible  deficiencies in the data and assumptions, must be considered in  determining whether this method provides the most reliable measure of an  arm's length result. The application of these factors to the residual  profit split in the context of the relevant business activity of  developing and exploiting cost shared intangibles is discussed in  paragraphs (g)(7)(iv)(B) through (D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Comparability. The derivation of the present value of nonroutine  residual divisional profit or loss includes a carveout on account of  market returns for routine contributions. Thus, the comparability  considerations that are relevant for that purpose include those that are  relevant for the methods that are used to determine market returns for  the routine contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Data and assumptions. The reliability of the results derived  from the residual profit split is affected by the quality of the data  and assumptions used to apply this method. In particular, the following  factors must be considered:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The reliability of the data used and the assumptions made in  estimating the relative value of the nonroutine contributions by the  controlled participants. In particular, if capitalized costs of  development are used to estimate the relative value of nonroutine  contributions, the reliability of the results is reduced relative to the  reliability of other methods that do not require such an estimate. This  is because, in any given case, the costs of developing a nonroutine  contribution may not be related to its market value and because the  calculation of the capitalized costs of development may require the  allocation of indirect costs between the relevant business activity and  the controlled participant's other activities, which may affect the  reliability of the analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other factors affecting reliability. Like the methods described  in Secs. 1.482-3 through 1.482-5 and Sec. 1.482-9(c), the carveout on  account of market returns for routine contributions relies exclusively  on external market benchmarks. As indicated in Sec. 1.482-1(c)(2)(i), as  the degree of comparability between the controlled participants and  uncontrolled transactions increases, the relative weight accorded the  analysis under this method will increase. In addition, to the extent the  allocation of nonroutine residual divisional profit or loss is not based  on external market benchmarks, the reliability of the analysis will be  decreased in relation to an analysis under a method that relies on  market benchmarks. Finally, the reliability of the analysis under this  method may be enhanced by the fact that all the controlled participants  are evaluated under the residual profit split. However, the reliability  of the results of an analysis based on information from all the  controlled participants is affected by the reliability of the data and  the assumptions pertaining to each controlled participant. Thus, if the  data and assumptions are significantly more reliable with respect to one  of the controlled participants than with respect to the others, a  different method, focusing solely on the results of that party, may  yield more reliable results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (g)(7):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For simplicity of calculation in this Example 1, all  financial flows are assumed to occur at the beginning of each period.  USP, a U.S. electronic data storage company, has partially developed  technology for a type of extremely small compact storage devices  (nanodisks) which are expected to provide a significant increase in data  storage capacity in various types of portable devices such as cell  phones, MP3 players, laptop computers and digital cameras. At the same  time, USP's wholly-owned subsidiary, FS, has developed significant  marketing intangibles outside the United States in the form of customer  lists, ongoing relations with various OEMs, and trademarks that are well  recognized by consumers due to a long history of marketing successful  data storage devices and other hardware used in various types of  consumer electronics. At the beginning of Year 1, USP enters into a CSA  with FS to develop nanodisk technologies for eventual commercial  exploitation. Under the CSA, USP will have the right to exploit  nanodisks in the United States, while FS will have the right to exploit  nanodisks in the rest of the world. The partially developed nanodisk  technologies owned by USP are reasonably anticipated to contribute to  the development of commercially exploitable nanodisks and therefore the  rights in the nanodisk technologies constitute platform contributions of  USP for which compensation is due under PCTs. FS does not have any  platform contributions for the CSA. Due to the fact that nanodisk  technologies have yet to be incorporated into any commercially available  product, neither USP nor FS transfers rights to make or sell current  products in conjunction with the CSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because only in FS's territory do both controlled participants  make significant nonroutine contributions, USP and FS determine that  they need to determine the relative value of their respective  contributions to residual divisional profit or loss attributable to the  CSA Activity only in FS's territory. FS anticipates making no nanodisk  sales during the first year of the CSA in its territory with revenues in  Year 2 reaching $200 million. Revenues through Year 5 are reasonably  anticipated to increase by 50% per year. The annual growth rate for  revenues is then expected to decline to 30% per annum in Years 6 and 7,  20% per annum in Years 8 and 9 and 10% per annum in Year 10. Revenues  are then expected to decline 10% in Year 11 and 5% per annum,  thereafter. The routine costs (defined here as costs other than cost  contributions, routine platform and operating contributions, and  nonroutine   contributions) that are allocable to this revenue in calculating FS's  divisional profit or loss, are anticipated to equal $40 million for the  first year of the CSA and $130 for the second year and $200 and $250  million in Years 3 and 4. Total operating expenses attributable to  product exploitation (including operating cost contributions) equal 52%  of sales per year. FS undertakes routine distribution activities in its  markets that constitute routine contributions to the relevant business  activity of exploiting nanodisk technologies. USP and FS estimate that  the total market return on these routine contributions will amount to 6%  of the routine costs. FS expects its cost contributions to be $60  million in Year 1, rise to $100 million in Years 2 and 3, and then  decline again to $60 million in Year 4. Thereafter, FS's cost  contributions are expected to equal 10% of revenues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> USP and FS determine the present value of the stream of the  reasonably anticipated residuals in FS's territory over the duration of  the CSA Activity of the divisional profit or loss (revenues minus  routine costs), minus the market returns for routine contributions, the  operating cost contributions, and the cost contributions. USP and FS  determine, based on the considerations discussed in paragraph (g)(2)(v)  of this section, that the appropriate discount rate is 17.5% per annum.  Therefore, the present value of the nonroutine residual divisional  profit is $1,395 million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> After analysis, USP and FS determine that the relative value of  the nanodisk technologies contributed by USP to CSA (giving effect only  to its value in FS's territory) is roughly 150% of the value of FS's  marketing intangibles (which only have value in FS's territory).  Consequently, 60% of the nonroutine residual divisional profit is  attributable to USP's platform contribution. Therefore, FS's PCT  Payments should have an expected present value equal to $837 million (.6  x $1,395 million).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The calculations for this Example 1 are displayed in the  following table:  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Time Period (Y = Year) (TV = Terminal Value)....................

USP is a U.S. automobile manufacturing company that has completed  significant research on the development of diesel-electric hybrid  engines that, if they could be successfully manufactured, would result  in providing a significant increased fuel economy for a wide variety of  motor vehicles. Successful commercialization of the diesel-electric  hybrid engine will require the development of a new class of advanced  battery that will be light, relatively cheap to manufacture and yet  capable of holding a substantial electric charge. FS, a foreign  subsidiary of USP, has completed significant research on developing  lithium-ion batteries that appear likely to have the requisite  characteristics. At the beginning of Year 1, USP enters into a CSA with  FS to further develop diesel-electric hybrid engines and lithium-ion  battery technologies for eventual commercial exploitation. Under the  CSA, USP will have the right to exploit the diesel-electric hybrid  engine and lithium-ion battery technologies in the United States, while  FS will have the right to exploit such technologies in the rest of the  world. The partially developed diesel-electric hybrid engine and  lithium-ion battery technologies owned by USP and FS, respectively, are  reasonably anticipated to contribute to the development of commercially  exploitable automobile engines and therefore the rights in both these  technologies constitute platform contributions of USP and of FS for  which compensation is due under PCTs. At the time of inception of the  CSA, USP owns operating intangibles in the form of self-developed  marketing intangibles which have significant value in the United States,  but not in the rest of the world, and that are relevant to exploiting  the cost shared intangibles. Similarly, FS owns self-developed marketing  intangibles which have significant value in the rest of the world, but  not in the United States, and that are relevant to exploiting the cost  shared intangibles. Although the new class of diesel-electric hybrid  engine using lithium-ion batteries is not yet ready for commercial  exploitation, components based on this technology are beginning to be  incorporated in current-generation gasoline-electric hybrid engines and  the rights to make and sell such products are transferred from USP to FS  and vice-versa in conjunction with the inception of the CSA, following  the same territorial division as in the CSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> USP's estimated RAB share is 66.7%. During Year 1, it is  anticipated that sales in USP's territory will be $1000X in Year 1.  Sales in FS's territory are anticipated to be $500X. Thereafter, as  revenue from the use of components in gasoline-electric hybrids is  supplemented by revenues from the production of complete diesel-electric  hybrid engines using lithium-ion battery technology, anticipated sales  in both territories will increase rapidly at a rate of 50% per annum  through Year 4. Anticipated sales are then anticipated to increase at a  rate of 40% per annum for another 4 years. Sales are then anticipated to  increase at a rate of 30% per annum through Year 10. Thereafter, sales  are anticipated to decrease at a rate of 5% per annum for the  foreseeable future as new automotive drivetrain technologies displace  diesel-electric hybrid engines and lithium-ion batteries. Total  operating expenses attributable to product exploitation (including  operating cost contributions) equal 40% of sales per year for both USP  and FS. USP and FS estimate that the total market return on these  routine contributions to the CSA will amount to 6% of these operating  expenses. USP is expected to bear \2/3\ of the total cost contributions  for the foreseeable future. Cost contributions are expected to total  $375X in Year 1 (of which $250X are borne by USP) and increase at a rate  of 25% per annum through Year 6. In Years 7 through 10, cost  contributions are expected to increase 10% a year. Thereafter, cost  contributions are expected to decrease by 5% a year for the foreseeable  future.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> USP and FS determine the present value of the stream of FS's  reasonably anticipated residual divisional profit, which is the stream  of FS's reasonably anticipated divisional profit or loss, minus the  market returns for routine contributions, minus operating cost  contributions, minus cost contributions. USP and FS determine, based on  the considerations discussed in paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section,  that the appropriate discount rate is 12% per year. Therefore, the  present value of the nonroutine residual divisional profit in USP's  territory is $41,727X and in CFC's territory is $20,864X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> After analysis, USP and FS determine that, in the United States  the relative value of the technologies contributed by USP and FS to the  CSA and of the operating intangibles used by USP in the exploitation of  the cost shared intangibles (reported as equaling 100 in total), equals:  USP's platform contribution (59.5); FS's platform contribution (25.5);  and USP's operating intangibles (15). Consequently, the present value of  the arm's length amount of the PCT Payments that USP should pay to FS  for FS's platform contribution is $10,640X (.255 x $41,727X). Similarly,  USP and FS determine that, in the   rest of the world, the relative value of the technologies contributed by  USP and FS to the CSA and of the operating intangibles used by FS in the  exploitation of the cost shared intangibles can be divided as follows:  USP's platform contribution (63); FS's platform contribution (27); and  FS's operating intangibles (10). Consequently, the present value of the  arm's length amount of the PCT Payments that FS should pay to USP for  USP's platform contribution is $13,144X (.63 x $20,864X). Therefore, FS  is required to make a net payment to USP with a present value of $2,504X  ($13,144X - 10,640X).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The calculations for this Example 2 are displayed in the  following tables:</p><p class="depth0">Calculation of USP's PCT Payment to FS ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Time Period (Y = Year) (TV =        Y1     Y2     Y3     Y4     Y5     Y6     Y7      Y8      Y9     Y10      TV</p><p class="depth0">Terminal Value)...............

In accordance with paragraph (k)(1)(iv)(A)  of this section, a provision of a written contract described in  paragraph (k)(1) of this section, or of the additional documentation  described in paragraph (k)(2) of this section, that provides for  payments for a PCT (or group of PCTs) to be contingent on the  exploitation of cost shared intangibles will be respected as consistent  with economic substance only if the allocation between the controlled  participants of the risks attendant on such form of payment is  determinable before the outcomes of such allocation that would   have materially affected the PCT pricing are known or reasonably  knowable. A contingent payment provision must clearly and unambiguously  specify the basis on which the contingent payment obligations are to be  determined. In particular, the contingent payment provision must clearly  and unambiguously specify the events that give rise to an obligation to  make PCT Payments, the royalty base (such as sales or revenues), and the  computation used to determine the PCT Payments. The royalty base  specified must be one that permits verification of its proper use by  reference to books and records maintained by the controlled participants  in the normal course of business (for example, books and records  maintained for financial accounting or business management purposes).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (h)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A CSA provides that PCT Payments with respect to a  particular platform contribution shall be contingent payments equal to  15% of the revenues from sales of products that incorporate cost shared  intangibles. The terms further permit (but do not require) the  controlled participants to adjust such contingent payments in accordance  with a formula set forth in the arrangement so that the 15% rate is  subject to adjustment by the controlled participants at their discretion  on an after-the-fact, uncompensated basis. The Commissioner may impute  payment terms that are consistent with economic substance with respect  to the platform contribution because the contingent payment provision  does not specify the computation used to determine the PCT Payments.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Taxpayer, an automobile manufacturer, is a controlled  participant in a CSA that involves research and development to perfect  certain manufacturing techniques necessary to the actual manufacture of  a state-of-the-art, hybrid fuel injection system known as DRL337. The  arrangement involves the platform contribution of a design patent  covering DRL337. Pursuant to paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(B) of this section,  the CSA provides for PCT Payments with respect to the platform  contribution of the patent in the form of royalties contingent on sales  of automobiles that contain the DRL337 system. However, Taxpayer's  system of book- and record-keeping does not enable Taxpayer to track  which automobile sales involve automobiles that contain the DRL337  system. Because Taxpayer has not complied with paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(B)  of this section, the Commissioner may impute payment terms that are  consistent with economic substance and susceptible to verification by  the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Controlled participants A and B enter into a CSA that  provides for PCT Payments from A to B with respect to B's platform  contribution, Z, in the form of three annual installment payments due  from A to B on the last day of each of the first three years of the CSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On audit, based on all the facts and circumstances, the  Commissioner determines that the installment PCT Payments are consistent  with an arm's length charge as of the date of the PCT. Accordingly, the  Commissioner does not make an adjustment with respect to the PCT  Payments in any year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 3 except that  the CSA contains an additional term with respect to the PCT Payments.  Under this provision, A and B further agreed that, if the present value  (as of the CSA Start Date) of A's actual divisional operating profit or  loss during the three-year period is less than the present value (as of  the CSA Start Date) of the divisional operating profit or loss that the  parties projected for A upon formation of the CSA for that period, then  the third installment payment shall be subject to a compensating  adjustment in the amount necessary to reduce the present value (as of  the CSA Start Date) of the aggregate PCT Payments for those three years  to the amount that would have been calculated if the actual results had  been used for the calculation instead of the projected results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> This provision further specifies that A will pay B an  additional amount, $Q, in the first year of the CSA to compensate B for  taking on additional downside risk through the contingent payment term  described in paragraph (i) of this Example 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> During the first two years, A pays B installment payments as  agreed, as well as the additional amount, $Q. In the third year, A and B  determine that the present value (as of the CSA Start Date) of A's  actual divisional operating profit or loss during the three-year period  is less than the present value (as of the CSA Start Date) of the  divisional operating profit or loss that the parties projected for A  upon formation of the CSA for that period. A reduces the PCT Payment to  B in the third year in the amount necessary to reduce the present value  (as of the CSA Start Date) of the aggregate PCT Payments for those three  years to the amount that would have been calculated if the actual  results had been used for the calculation instead of the projected  results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> On audit, based on all the facts and circumstances, the  Commissioner determines that the installment PCT Payments agreed to be  paid by A to B were consistent with an arm's length charge as of the  date of the   PCT. The Commissioner further determines that the contingency was  sufficiently specified such that its occurrence or nonoccurrence was  unambiguous and determinable; that the projections were reliable; and  that the contingency did, in fact, occur. Finally, the Commissioner  determines, based on all the facts and circumstances, that $Q was within  the arm's length range for the additional allocation of risk to B.  Accordingly, no adjustment is made with respect to the installment PCT  Payments, or the additional PCT Payment for the contingent payment term,  in any year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 4 except that  the CSA states the amount that A will pay B for the contingent payment  term is $X, an amount that is less than $Q, and A pays B $X in the first  year of the CSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On audit, based on all the facts and circumstances, the  Commissioner determines that the installment PCT Payments agreed to be  paid by A to B were consistent with an arm's length charge as of the  date of the PCT. The Commissioner further determines that the  contingency was sufficiently specified such that its occurrence or  nonoccurrence was unambiguous and determinable; that the projections  were reliable; and that the contingency did, in fact, occur. However,  the Commissioner also determines, based on all the facts and  circumstances, that the additional PCT Payment of $X from A to B for the  contingent payment term was not an arm's length charge for the  additional allocation of risk as of the CSA Start Date in connection  with the contingent payment term. Accordingly, the Commissioner makes an  adjustment to B's results equal to the difference between $X and the  median of the arm's length range of charges for the contingent payment  term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 3 except that A  and B further agreed that, if the present value (as of the CSA Start  Date) of A's actual divisional operating profit or loss during the  three-year period is either less or greater than the present value (as  of the CSA Start Date) of the divisional operating profit or loss that  the parties projected for A upon formation of the CSA for that period,  then A may make a compensating adjustment to the third installment  payment in the amount necessary to reduce (if actual divisional  operating profit or loss is less than the projections) or increase (if  actual divisional operating profit or loss exceeds the projections) the  present value (as of the CSA Start Date) of the aggregate PCT Payments  for those three years to the amount that would have been calculated if  the actual results had been used for the calculation instead of the  projected results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On audit, the Commissioner determines that the contingent  payment term lacks economic substance under Secs. 1.482-1(d)(3)(iii)(B)  and 1.482-7(h)(2)(iii)(B). It lacks economic substance because the  allocation of the risks between A and B was indeterminate as of the CSA  Start Date due to the elective nature of the potential compensating  adjustments. Specifically, the parties agreed upfront only that A might  make compensating adjustments to the installment payments. By the terms  of the agreement, A could decide whether to make such adjustments after  the outcome of the risks was known or reasonably knowable. Even though  the contingency and potential compensating adjustments were clearly  defined in the CSA, no compensating adjustments were required by the CSA  regardless of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of the contingency. As a  result, the contingent payment terms did not clearly and unambiguously  specify the events that give rise to an obligation to make PCT Payments,  and, accordingly, the obligation to make compensating adjustments  pursuant to the contingency was indeterminate. The contingent payment  term allows the taxpayer to make adjustments that are favorable to its  overall tax position in those years where the agreement allows it to  make such adjustments, but decline to exercise its right to make any  adjustment in those years in which such an adjustment would be  unfavorable to its overall tax position. Such terms do not reflect a  substantive upfront allocation of risk. In addition, the vagueness of  the agreement makes it impossible to determine whether such contingent  payment term warrants an additional arm's length charge and, if so, how  much.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Accordingly, the Commissioner may disregard the contingent  payment term under Secs. 1.482-1(d)(3)(ii)(B)(1) and 1.482-7(k)(1)(iv)  and may impute other contractual terms in its place consistent with the  economic substance of the CSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 6 except that  the contingent payment term provides that, if the present value (as of  the CSA Start Date) of A's actual divisional operating profit or loss  during the three-year period is either less or greater than the present  value (as of the CSA Start Date) of the divisional operating profit or  loss that the parties projected for A upon formation of the CSA for that  period, then A will make a compensating adjustment to the third  installment payment. The CSA does not specify the amount of (or a  formula for) any such compensating adjustments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On audit, the Commissioner determines that the contingent  payment term lacks economic substance under Secs. 1.482-1(d)(3)(iii)(B)  and 1.482-7(h)(2)(iii)(B). It lacks economic substance because the  allocation of the risks between A and B was indeterminate as of the CSA  Start Date due to the failure to specify the amount of (or a formula  for) the compensating adjustments that must be made if a   contingency occurs. The basis on which the compensating adjustments were  to be determined was neither clear nor unambiguous. Even though the  contingency was clearly defined in the CSA and the requirement of a  compensating adjustment in the event of a contingency was clearly  specified in the CSA, the parties had no agreement regarding the amount  of such compensating adjustments. As a result, the computation used to  determine the PCT Payments was indeterminate. The parties could choose  to make a small positive compensating adjustment if the actual results  turned out to be much greater than the projections, and could choose to  make a significant negative compensating adjustment if the actual  results turned out to be less than the projections. Such terms do not  reflect a substantive upfront allocation of risk. In addition, the  vagueness of the agreement makes it impossible to determine whether such  contingent payment term warrants an additional arm's length charge and,  if so, how much.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Accordingly, the Commissioner may disregard the contingent  price term under Secs. 1.482-1(d)(3)(ii)(B)(1) and 1.482-7(k)(1)(iv) and  may impute other contractual terms in its place consistent with economic  substance of the CSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Conversion from fixed to contingent form of payment.

A method  described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section evaluates the arm's length  amount charged in a PCT in terms of a form of payment (method payment  form). For example, the method payment form for the acquisition price  method described in paragraph (g)(5) of this section, and for the market  capitalization method described in paragraph (g)(6) of this section, is  fixed payment. Applications of the income method provide different  method payment forms. See paragraphs (g)(4)(i)(E) and (iv) of this  section. The method payment form may not necessarily correspond to the  form of payment specified pursuant to paragraphs (h)(2)(iii) and  (k)(2)(ii)(l) of this section (specified payment form). The  determination under Sec. 1.482-1(c) of the method that provides the most  reliable measure of an arm's length result is to be made without regard  to whether the respective method payment forms under the competing  methods correspond to the specified payment form. If the method payment  form of the method determined under Sec. 1.482-1(c) to provide the most  reliable measure of an arm's length result differs from the specified  payment form, then the conversion from such method payment form to such  specified payment form will be made to the satisfaction of the  Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Allocations by the Commissioner in connection with a CSA--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general.

No correlative adjustments will be made  to contingent PCT Payments regardless of whether RAB shares were used as  a parameter in the valuation of those payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (i)(2)(ii):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. U.S. Parent (USP) and Foreign Subsidiary (FS) enter into  a CSA to develop new food products, dividing costs on the basis of  projected sales two years in the future. In Year 1, USP and FS project  that their sales in Year 3 will be equal, and they divide costs  accordingly. In Year 3, the Commissioner examines the controlled  participants' method for dividing costs. USP and FS actually accounted  for 42% and 58% of total sales, respectively. The Commissioner agrees  that sales two years in the future provide a reliable basis for  estimating benefit shares. Because the differences between USP's and  FS's adjusted and projected benefit shares are less than 20% of their  projected benefit shares, the projection of future benefits for Year 3  is reliable.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that in  Year 3 USP and FS actually accounted for 35% and 65% of total sales,  respectively. The divergence between USP's projected and adjusted  benefit shares is greater than 20% of USP's projected benefit share and  is not due to an extraordinary event beyond the control of the  controlled participants. The Commissioner concludes that the projected  benefit shares were unreliable, and uses adjusted benefit shares as the  basis for an adjustment to the cost shares borne by USP and FS.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. U.S. Parent (USP), a U.S. corporation, and its foreign  subsidiary (FS) enter into a CSA in Year 1. They project that they will  begin to receive benefits from cost shared intangibles in Years 4  through 6, and that USP will receive 60% of total benefits and FS 40% of  total benefits. In Years 4 through 6, USP and FS actually receive 50%  each of the total benefits. In evaluating the reliability of the  controlled participants'   projections, the Commissioner compares the adjusted benefit shares to  the projected benefit shares. Although USP's adjusted benefit share  (50%) is within 20% of its projected benefit share (60%), FS's adjusted  benefit share (50%) is not within 20% of its projected benefit share  (40%). Based on this discrepancy, the Commissioner may conclude that the  controlled participants' projections were unreliable and may use  adjusted benefit shares as the basis for an adjustment to the cost  shares borne by USP and FS.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Three controlled taxpayers, USP, FS1, and FS2 enter into  a CSA. FS1 and FS2 are foreign. USP is a domestic corporation that  controls all the stock of FS1 and FS2. The controlled participants  project that they will share the total benefits of the cost shared  intangibles in the following percentages: USP 50%; FS1 30%; and FS2 20%.  Adjusted benefit shares are as follows: USP 45%; FS1 25%; and FS2 30%.  In evaluating the reliability of the controlled participants'  projections, the Commissioner compares these adjusted benefit shares to  the projected benefit shares. For this purpose, FS1 and FS2 are treated  as a single controlled participant. The adjusted benefit share received  by USP (45%) is within 20% of its projected benefit share (50%). In  addition, the non-US controlled participant's adjusted benefit share  (55%) is also within 20% of their projected benefit share (50%).  Therefore, the Commissioner concludes that the controlled participant's  projections of future benefits were reliable, despite the fact that  FS2's adjusted benefit share (30%) is not within 20% of its projected  benefit share (20%).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in Example 4. In addition, the  Commissioner determines that FS2 has significant operating losses and  has no earnings and profits, and that FS1 is profitable and has earnings  and profits. Based on all the evidence, the Commissioner concludes that  the controlled participants arranged that FS1 would bear a larger cost  share than appropriate in order to reduce FS1's earnings and profits and  thereby reduce inclusions USP otherwise would be deemed to have on  account of FS1 under subpart F. Pursuant to paragraph (i)(2)(ii)(B) of  this section, the Commissioner may make an adjustment solely to the cost  shares borne by FS1 and FS2 because FS2's projection of future benefits  was unreliable and the variation between adjusted and projected benefits  had the effect of substantially reducing USP's U.S. income tax liability  (on account of FS1 subpart F income).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Foreign Parent (FP) and U.S. Subsidiary (USS)  enter into a CSA in 1996 to develop a new treatment for baldness. USS's  interest in any treatment developed is the right to produce and sell the  treatment in the U.S. market while FP retains rights to produce and sell  the treatment in the rest of the world. USS and FP measure their  anticipated benefits from the CSA based on their respective projected  future sales of the baldness treatment. The following sales projections  are used:</p><p class="depth0">Sales</p><p class="depth0">[In millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Year                           USS           FP ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.............................................            5           10 2.............................................           20           20 3.............................................           30           30 4.............................................           40           40 5.............................................           40           40 6.............................................           40           40 7.............................................           40           40 8.............................................           20           20 9.............................................           10           10 10............................................            5            5 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In Year 1, the first year of sales, USS is projected to have  lower sales than FP due to lags in U.S. regulatory approval for the  baldness treatment. In each subsequent year, USS and FP are projected to  have equal sales. Sales are projected to build over the first three  years of the period, level off for several years, and then decline over  the final years of the period as new and improved baldness treatments  reach the market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To account for USS's lag in sales in the Year 1, the present  discounted value of sales over the period is used as the basis for  measuring benefits. Based on the risk associated with this venture, a  discount rate of 10 percent is selected. The present discounted value of  projected sales is determined to be approximately $154.4 million for USS  and $158.9 million for FP. On this basis USS and FP are projected to  obtain approximately 49.3% and 50.7% of the benefit, respectively, and  the costs of developing the baldness treatment are shared accordingly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In Year 6, the Commissioner examines the CSA. USS and FP  have obtained the following sales results through Year 5:</p><p class="depth0">Sales</p><p class="depth0">[In millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Year                           USS           FP ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.............................................            0           17 2.............................................           17           35 3.............................................           25           35 4.............................................           38           41 5.............................................           39           41 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> USS's sales initially grew more slowly than projected while FP's  sales grew more quickly. In each of the first three years of the period,  the share of total sales of at least one of the parties diverged by over  20% from its projected share of sales. However, by Year 5 both parties'  sales had leveled off at approximately their projected values. Taking  into account this leveling off of sales and   all the facts and circumstances, the Commissioner determines that it is  appropriate to use the original projections for the remaining years of  sales. Combining the actual results through Year 5 with the projections  for subsequent years, and using a discount rate of 10%, the present  discounted value of sales is approximately $141.6 million for USS and  $187.3 million for FP. This result implies that USS and FP obtain  approximately 43.1% and 56.9%, respectively, of the anticipated benefits  from the baldness treatment. Because these adjusted benefit shares are  within 20% of the benefit shares calculated based on the original sales  projections, the Commissioner determines that, based on the difference  between adjusted and projected benefit shares, the original projections  were not unreliable. No adjustment is made based on the difference  between adjusted and projected benefit shares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 6, except that  the actual sales results through Year 5 are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Sales</p><p class="depth0">[In millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Year                           USS           FP ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.............................................            0           17 2.............................................           17           35 3.............................................           25           44 4.............................................           34           54 5.............................................           36           55 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Based on the discrepancy between the projections and the actual  results and on consideration of all the facts, the Commissioner  determines that for the remaining years the following sales projections  are more reliable than the original projections:</p><p class="depth0">Sales</p><p class="depth0">[In millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Year                           USS           FP ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 6.............................................           36           55 7.............................................           36           55 8.............................................           18           28 9.............................................            9           14 10............................................          4.5            7 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Combining the actual results through Year 5 with the  projections for subsequent years, and using a discount rate of 10%, the  present discounted value of sales is approximately $131.2 million for  USS and $229.4 million for FP. This result implies that USS and FP  obtain approximately 35.4% and 63.6%, respectively, of the anticipated  benefits from the baldness treatment. These adjusted benefit shares  diverge by greater than 20% from the benefit shares calculated based on  the original sales projections, and the Commissioner determines that,  based on the difference between adjusted and projected benefit shares,  the original projections were unreliable. The Commissioner adjusts cost  shares for each of the taxable years under examination to conform them  to the recalculated shares of anticipated benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Timing of CST allocations. If the Commissioner makes an  allocation to adjust the results of a CST, the allocation must be  reflected for tax purposes in the year in which the IDCs were incurred.  When a CST payment is owed by one controlled participant to another  controlled participant, the Commissioner may make appropriate  allocations to reflect an arm's length rate of interest for the time  value of money, consistent with the provisions of Sec. 1.482-2(a) (Loans  or advances).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> PCT allocations. The Commissioner may make allocations to adjust  the results of a PCT so that the results are consistent with an arm's  length result in accordance with the provisions of the applicable  sections of the regulations under section 482, as determined pursuant to  paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Allocations regarding changes in participation under a CSA. The  Commissioner may make allocations to adjust the results of any  controlled transaction described in paragraph (f) of this section if the  controlled participants do not reflect arm's length results in relation  to any such transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Allocations when CSTs are consistently and materially  disproportionate to RAB shares. If a controlled participant bears IDC  shares that are consistently and materially greater or lesser than its  RAB share, then the Commissioner may conclude that the economic  substance of the arrangement between the controlled participants is  inconsistent with the terms of the CSA. In such a case, the Commissioner  may disregard such terms and impute an agreement that is consistent with  the controlled participants' course of conduct, under which a controlled  participant that bore a disproportionately greater IDC share received  additional interests in the cost shared intangibles. See Secs. 1.482- 1(d)(3)(ii)(B) (Identifying contractual terms) and 1.482-4(f)(3)(ii)  (Identification of owner). Such additional interests will consist of  partial undivided interests in the other controlled participant's  interest in the cost shared intangible. Accordingly,   that controlled participant must receive arm's length consideration from  any controlled participant whose IDC share is less than its RAB share  over time, under the provisions of Secs. 1.482-1 and 1.482-4 through  1.482-6 to provide compensation for the latter controlled participants'  use of such partial undivided interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)(ii)</em> through  (vi) of this section regarding the PRRR, the AERR, and periodic  adjustments. In determining whether to make such adjustments, the  Commissioner may consider whether the outcome as adjusted more reliably  reflects an arm's length result under all the relevant facts and  circumstances, including any information known as of the Determination  Date. The Determination Date is the date of the relevant determination  by the Commissioner. The failure of the Commissioner to determine for an  earlier taxable year that a PCT Payment was not arm's length will not  preclude the Commissioner from making a periodic adjustment for a  subsequent year. A periodic adjustment under this paragraph </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(6)</em> may  be made without regard to whether the taxable year of the Trigger PCT or  any other PCT remains open for statute of limitations purposes or  whether a periodic adjustment has previously been made with respect to  any PCT Payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> PRRR. Except as provided in the next sentence, the PRRR will  consist of return ratios that are not less than .667 nor more than 1.5.  Alternatively, if the controlled participants have not substantially  complied with the documentation requirements referenced in paragraph (k)  of this section, as modified, if applicable, by paragraphs (m)(2) and  (3) of this section, the PRRR will consist of return ratios that are not  less than .8 nor more than 1.25.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> AERR--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The AERR is the present value of total  profits (PVTP) divided by the present value of investment (PVI). In  computing PVTP and PVI, present values are computed using the applicable  discount rate (ADR), and all information available as of the  Determination Date is taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> PVTP. The PVTP is the present value, as of the CSA Start Date,  as defined in section (j)(1)(i) of this section, of the PCT Payor's  actually experienced divisional profits or losses from the CSA Start  Date through the end of the Adjustment Year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> PVI. The PVI is the present value, as of the CSA Start Date, of  the PCT Payor's investment associated with the CSA Activity, defined as  the sum of its cost contributions and its PCT Payments, from the CSA  Start Date through the end of the Adjustment Year. For purposes of  computing the PVI, PCT Payments means all PCT Payments due from a PCT  Payor before netting against PCT Payments due from other controlled  participants pursuant to paragraph (j)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> ADR--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph  (i)(6)(iv)(B) of this section, the ADR is the discount rate pursuant to  paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section, subject to such adjustments as the  Commissioner determines appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Publicly traded companies. If the PCT Payor meets the conditions  of paragraph (i)(6)(iv)(C) of this section, the ADR is the PCT Payor  WACC as of the date of the Trigger PCT. However, if the Commissioner  determines, or the controlled participants establish to the satisfaction  of the Commissioner, that a discount rate other than the PCT Payor WACC  better reflects the degree of risk of the CSA Activity as of such   date, the ADR is such other discount rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Stock of the PCT Payor is publicly traded; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Stock of the PCT Payor is not publicly traded, provided the PCT  Payor is included in a group of companies for which consolidated  financial statements are prepared; and a publicly traded company in such  group owns, directly or indirectly, stock in PCT Payor. Stock of a  company is publicly traded within the meaning of this paragraph  (i)(6)(iv)(C) if such stock is regularly traded on an established United  States securities market and the company issues financial statements  prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting  principles for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> PCT Payor WACC. The PCT Payor WACC is the WACC, as defined in  paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section, of the PCT Payor or the publicly  traded company described in paragraph (i)(6)(iv)(C)(2)(ii) of this  section, as the case may be.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Generally accepted accounting principles. For purposes of  paragraph (i)(6)(iv)(C) of this section, a financial statement prepared  in accordance with a comprehensive body of generally accepted accounting  principles other than United States generally accepted accounting  principles is considered to be prepared in accordance with United States  generally accepted accounting principles provided that the amounts of  debt, equity, and interest expense are reflected in any reconciliation  between such other accounting principles and United States generally  accepted accounting principles required to be incorporated into the  financial statement by the securities laws governing companies whose  stock is regularly traded on United States securities markets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em>. A periodic adjustment may be made for a particular taxable  year without regard to whether the taxable years of the Trigger PCT or  other PCTs remain open for statute of limitation purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Periodic adjustments are determined by the following  steps:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> First, determine the present value, as of the date of the  Trigger PCT, of the PCT Payments under paragraph (g)(7)(iii)(C)(3) of  this section pursuant to the Adjusted RPSM as defined in paragraph  (i)(6)(v)(B) of this section (first step result).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(iv)</em> of this  section (Conversion from fixed to contingent form of payment). This  conversion is made based on all information known as of the  Determination Date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Third, apply the second step rate to the actual divisional  profit or loss for taxable years preceding and including the Adjustment  Year to yield a stream of contingent payments for such years, and  convert such stream to a present value as of the CSA Start Date under  the principles of paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section (third step  result). For this purpose, the second step rate applied to a loss for a  particular year will yield a negative contingent payment for that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fourth, convert any actual PCT Payments up through the  Adjustment Year to a present value as of the CSA Start Date under the  principles of paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section. Then subtract such  amount from the third step result. Determine the nominal amount in the  Adjustment Year that would have a present value as of the CSA Start Date  equal to the present value determined in the previous sentence to  determine the periodic adjustment in the Adjustment Year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Fifth, apply the second step rate to the actual divisional  profit or loss for each taxable year after the Adjustment Year up to and  including the taxable year that includes the Determination Date to yield  a stream of contingent payments for such years. For this purpose, the  second step rate applied to a loss will yield a negative contingent  payment for that year. Then subtract from each such payment any actual  PCT Payment made for the same year to determine the periodic adjustment  for such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> For each taxable year subsequent to the year that includes the  Determination Date, the periodic adjustment for such taxable year (which  is in lieu of any PCT Payment that would otherwise be payable for that  year under the taxpayer's position) equals the second step rate applied  to the actual divisional profit or loss for that year. For this purpose,  the second step rate applied to a loss for a particular year will yield  a negative contingent payment for that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> If the periodic adjustment for any taxable year is a positive  amount, then it is an additional PCT Payment owed from the PCT Payor to  the PCT Payee for such year. If the periodic adjustment for any taxable  year is a negative amount, then it is an additional PCT Payment owed by  the PCT Payee to the PCT Payor for such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Adjusted RPSM as of Determination Date. The Adjusted RPSM is the  residual profit split method pursuant to paragraph (g)(7) of this  section applied to determine the present value, as of the date of the  Trigger PCT, of the PCT Payments under paragraph (g)(7)(iii)(C)(3) of  this section, with the following modifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Actual results up through the Determination Date shall be  substituted for what otherwise were the projected results over such  period, as reasonably anticipated as of the date of the Trigger PCT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Projected results for the balance of the CSA Activity after the  Determination Date, as reasonably anticipated as of the Determination  Date, shall be substituted for what otherwise were the projected results  over such period, as reasonably anticipated as of the date of the  Trigger PCT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The requirement in paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section, that at  least two controlled participants make significant nonroutine  contributions, does not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)(A)(1)</em> through (4) of this section apply with respect to the  Trigger PCT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Transactions involving the same platform contribution as in the  Trigger PCT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The same platform contribution is furnished to an uncontrolled  taxpayer under substantially the same circumstances as those of the  relevant Trigger PCT and with a similar form of payment as the Trigger  PCT;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> This transaction serves as the basis for the application of the  comparable uncontrolled transaction method described in paragraph (g)(3)  of this section, in the first year and all subsequent years in which  substantial PCT Payments relating to the Trigger PCT were required to be  paid; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The amount of those PCT Payments in that first year was arm's  length.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Results not reasonably anticipated. The differential between the  AERR and the nearest bound of the PRRR is due to extraordinary events  beyond the control of the controlled participants that could not  reasonably have been anticipated as of the date of the Trigger PCT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reduced AERR does not cause Periodic Trigger. The Periodic  Trigger would not have occurred had the PCT Payor's divisional profits  or losses used to calculate its PVTP both taken into account expenses on  account of operating cost contributions and routine platform  contributions, and excluded those profits or losses attributable to the  PCT Payor's routine contributions to its exploitation of cost shared  intangibles, nonroutine contributions to the   CSA Activity, operating cost contributions, and routine platform  contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Increased AERR does not cause Periodic Trigger--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Periodic  Trigger would not have occurred had the divisional profits or losses of  the PCT Payor used to calculate its PVTP included its reasonably  anticipated divisional profits or losses after the Adjustment Year from  the CSA Activity, including from its routine contributions, its  operating cost contributions, and its nonroutine contributions to that  activity, and had the cost contributions and PCT Payments of the PCT  Payor used to calculate its PVI included its reasonably anticipated cost  contributions and PCT Payments after the Adjustment Year. The reasonably  anticipated amounts in the previous sentence are determined based on all  information available as of the Determination Date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (i)(6)(vi)(A)(4), the controlled  participants may, if they wish, assume that the average yearly  divisional profits or losses for all taxable years prior to and  including the Adjustment Year, in which there has been substantial  exploitation of cost shared intangibles resulting from the CSA  (exploitation years), will continue to be earned in each year over a  period of years equal to 15 minus the number of exploitation years prior  to and including the Determination Date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)(1)</em> or (2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 10-year period.

The following examples illustrate the rules of this  paragraph (i)(6):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For simplicity of calculation in this Example 1, all  financial flows are assumed to occur at the beginning of the year. At  the beginning of Year 1, USP, a publicly traded U.S. company, and FS,  its wholly-owned foreign subsidiary, enter into a CSA to develop new  technology for cell phones. USP has a platform contribution, the rights  for an in-process technology that when developed will improve the  clarity of calls, for which compensation is due from FS. FS has no  platform contributions to the CSA, no operating contributions, and no  operating cost contributions. USP and FS agree to fixed PCT payments of  $40 million in Year 1 and $10 million per year for Years 2 through 10.  At the beginning of Year 1, the weighted average cost of capital of the  controlled group that includes USP and FS is 15%. In Year 9, the  Commissioner audits Years 5 through 7 of the CSA and considers whether  any periodic adjustments should be made. USP and FS have substantially  complied with the documentation requirements of paragraph (k) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> FS experiences the results reported in the following table from  its participation in the CSA through Year 7. In the table, all present  values (PV) are reported as of the CSA Start Date, which is the same as  the date of the PCT (and reflect a 15% discount rate as discussed in  paragraph (iii) of this Example 1). Thus, in any year the present value  of the cumulative investment is PVI and of the cumulative divisional  profit or loss is PVTP. All amounts in this table and the tables that  follow are reported in millions of dollars and cost contributions are  referred to as ``CCs'' (for simplicity of calculation in this Example 1,  all financial flows are assumed to occur at the beginning of the year).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">a                    b           c           d           e           f           g           h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Divisional</p><p class="depth0">Year                 Sales      Non CC        CCs         PCT     Investment   profit or  AERR (PVTP/</p><p class="depth0">costs                 payments      (d+e)    loss (b-c)  PVI) (g/f) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1...........................           0           0          15          40          55           0 2...........................           0           0          17          10          27           0 3...........................           0           0          18          10          28           0 4...........................         705         662          20          10          30          46 5...........................         886         718          22          10          32         168</p><p class="depth0">6...........................       1,113         680          24          10          34         433 7...........................       1,179         747          27          10          37         432 PV through Year 5...........         970         846          69          69         138         124        0.90 PV through Year 6...........       1,523       1,184          81          74         155         340        2.20 PV through Year 7...........       2,033       1,507          93          78         171         526        3.09 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because USP is publicly traded in the United States and is a  member of the controlled group to which FS (the PCT Payor) belongs, for  purposes of calculating the AERR for FS, the present values of its PVTP  and PVI are determined using an ADR of 15%, the weighted average cost of  capital of the controlled group.

At a 15%  discount rate, the PVTP, calculated as of Year 1, and based on actual  profits realized by FS through Year 7 from exploiting the new cell phone  technology developed by the CSA, is $526 million. The PVI, based on FS's  cost contributions and its PCT Payments, is $171 million. The AERR for  FS is equal to its PVTP divided by its PVI, $526 million/$171 million,  or 3.09.

First, a lump sum for  the PCT Payment is determined using the adjusted residual profit split  method. Under the method, based on the considerations discussed in  paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section, the appropriate discount rate is  15% per year. The nonroutine residual divisional profit or loss  described in paragraph (g)(7)(iii)(B) of this section is $612 million.  Further, under paragraph (g)(7)(iii)(C) of this   section, the entire nonroutine residual divisional profit constitutes  the PCT Payment because only USP has nonroutine contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> In step two, the first step result ($612 million) is converted  into a level royalty rate based on the reasonably anticipated divisional  profit or losses of the CSA Activity, the PV of which is reported in the  table above (net PV of divisional profit or loss for Years 1 through 10  is $927 million). Consequently, the step two result is a level royalty  rate of 66.0% ($612/$927) of the divisional profit in Years 1 through  10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> In step three, the Commissioner calculates the PCT Payments  due through Year 6 by applying the step two royalty rate to the actual  divisional profits for each year and then determines the aggregate PV of  these PCT Payments as of the CSA Start Date ($224 million as reported in  the following table). In step four, the PCT Payments actually made  through Year 6 are similarly converted to PV as of the CSA Start Date  ($74 million) and subtracted from the amount determined in step three  ($224 million--$74 million = $150 million). That difference of $150  million, representing a net PV as of the CSA Start Date, is then  converted to a nominal amount, as of the Adjustment Year, of equivalent  present value (again using a discount rate of 15%).

At the time of the Determination Date, it is determined  that the first Adjustment Year in which a Periodic Trigger occurred was  Year 6, when the AERR of FS was determined to be 2.73. Upon further  investigation as to what may have caused the high return in FS's market,  the Commissioner learns that, in Years 4 through 6, USP's leading  competitors experienced severe, unforeseen disruptions in their supply  chains resulting in a significant increase in USP's and FS's market  share for cell phones. Further analysis determines that without this  unforeseen occurrence the Periodic Trigger would not have occurred.

None of  the foreign subsidiaries makes any platform contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In Year 6, the Commissioner audits Years 3 through 5 of the CSA  and considers whether any periodic adjustments should be made. At the  time of the Determination Date, the Commissioner determines that the  first Adjustment Year in which a Periodic Trigger occurred was Year 3,  and further determines that none of the exceptions to periodic  adjustments described in paragraph (i)(6)(vi) of this section applies.  The Commissioner exercises his discretion under paragraph (i)(6)(i) of  this section to make periodic adjustments using Year 3 as the Adjustment  Year. Therefore, the arm's length PCT Payments from FS1, FS2, and FS3 to  USP shall be determined using the adjusted residual profit split method  described in paragraphs (g)(7)(v)(B) and (i)(6)(v)(B) of this section.

Therefore,  the present values (as of the CSA Start Date) of the PCT Payments owed  are as follows: PCT Payment owed from FS1 to USP: $314 million PCT Payment owed from FS2 to USP: $159 million PCT Payment owed from FS3 to USP: $295 million Pursuant to paragraph (i)(6)(v)(A) of this section, the steps in  paragraphs (i)(6)(v)(A)(2) through (7) of this section are performed  separately for the PCT Payments that are owed to USP by each of FS1,  FS2, and FS3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> First, the steps are performed with respect to FS1. In step  two, the first step result ($314 million) is converted into a level  royalty rate based on FS1's reasonably anticipated divisional profits or  losses through Year 7 (the PV of which is $667 million). Consequently,  the step two result is a level royalty rate of 47.1% ($314/$667) of the  divisional profits in Years 1 through 7. In step three, the Commissioner  calculates the PCT Payments due through Year 3 (the Adjustment Year) by  applying the step two royalty rate (47.1%) to FS1's actual divisional  profits for each year up to and including Year 3 and then determining  the aggregate PV of these PCT Payments as of Year 3. In step four, the  PCT Payments actually made by FS1 to USP through Year 3 are similarly  converted to a PV as of Year 3 and subtracted from the amount determined  in step three. That difference is the periodic adjustment in Year 3 with  respect to the PCT Payments made for Years 1 through 3 from FS1 to USP.  Under step five, the royalties due from FS1 to USP for Year 4 (the year  after the Adjustment Year) through Year 6 (the year including the  Determination Date) are determined. The   periodic adjustment for each of these years is calculated as the product  of the step two royalty rate and the divisional profit for that year,  minus any actual PCT Payment made by FS1 to USP in that year. The  periodic adjustment for each such year is a PCT Payment due in addition  to the PCT Payment from FS1 to USP that was already made under the CSA.  Under step six, the periodic adjustment for Year 7 (the only  exploitation year after the year containing the Determination Date) will  be determined by applying the step two royalty rate to FS1's divisional  profit for that year. This periodic adjustment for Year 7 is a PCT  Payment payable from FS1 to USP and is in lieu of any PCT Payment from  FS1 to USP otherwise due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)(A)(2)</em> through (7) of  this section are performed with respect to FS2. In step two, the first  step result ($159 million) is converted into a level royalty rate based  on FS2's reasonably anticipated divisional profits or losses through  Year 7 (the PV of which is $271 million). Consequently, the step two  result is a level royalty rate of 58.7% ($159/$271) of the divisional  profits in Years 1 through 7. In step three, the Commissioner calculates  the PCT Payments due through Year 3 (the Adjustment Year) by applying  the step two royalty rate (58.7%) to FS2's actual divisional profits for  each year up to and including Year 3 and then determining the aggregate  PV of these PCT Payments as of Year 3. In step four, the PCT Payments  actually made by FS2 to USP through Year 3 are similarly converted to a  PV as of Year 3 and subtracted from the amount determined in step three.  That difference is the periodic adjustment in Year 3 with respect to the  PCT Payments made for Years 1 through 3 from FS2 to USP. Under step  five, the royalties due from FS2 to USP for Year 4 (the year after the  Adjustment Year) through Year 6 (the year including the Determination  Date) are determined. The periodic adjustment for each of these years is  calculated as the product of the step two royalty rate and the  divisional profit for that year, minus any actual PCT Payment made by  FS2 to USP in that year. The periodic adjustment for each such year is a  PCT Payment due in addition to the PCT Payment from FS2 to USP that was  already made under the CSA. Under step six, the periodic adjustment for  Year 7 (the only exploitation year after the year containing the  Determination Date) will be determined by applying the step two royalty  rate to FS2's divisional profit for that year. This periodic adjustment  for Year 7 is a PCT Payment payable from FS2 to USP and is in lieu of  any PCT Payment from FS2 to USP otherwise due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Finally, the steps in paragraphs (i)(6)(v)(A)(2) through (7) of  this section are performed with respect to FS3. In step two, the first  step result ($295 million) is converted into a level royalty rate based  on FS3's reasonably anticipated divisional profits or losses through  Year 7 (the PV of which is $592 million). Consequently, the step two  result is a level royalty rate of 49.8% ($295/$592) of the divisional  profits in Years 1 through 7. In step three, the Commissioner calculates  the PCT Payments due through Year 3 (the Adjustment Year) by applying  the step two royalty rate (49.8%) to FS3's actual divisional profits for  each year up to and including Year 3 and then determining the aggregate  PV of these PCT Payments as of Year 3. In step four, the PCT Payments  actually made by FS3 to USP through Year 3 are similarly converted to a  PV as of Year 3 and subtracted from the amount determined in step three.  That difference is the periodic adjustment in Year 3 with respect to the  PCT Payments made for Years 1 through 3 from FS3 to USP. Under step  five, the royalties due from FS3 to USP for Year 4 (the year after the  Adjustment Year) through Year 6 (the year including the Determination  Date) are determined. The periodic adjustment for each of these years is  calculated as the product of the step two royalty rate and the  divisional profit for that year, minus any actual PCT Payment made by  FS3 to USP in that year. The periodic adjustment for each such year is a  PCT Payment due in addition to the PCT Payment from FS3 to USP that was  already made under the CSA. Under step six, the periodic adjustment for  Year 7 (the only exploitation year after the year containing the  Determination Date) will be determined by applying the step two royalty  rate to FS3's divisional profit for that year. This periodic adjustment  for Year 7 is a PCT Payment payable from FS3 to USP and is in lieu of  any PCT Payment from FS3 to USP otherwise due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Definitions and special rules--(1) Definitions--(i) In general.

This resource does not, however, exist in the United States.

R+D is not assigned any rights to  exploit the intangibles. R+D's activity consists solely in carrying out  research for the group. It is reliably projected that the RAB shares of  USP and FS will be 66\2/3\% and 33\1/3\%, respectively, and the parties'  agreement provides that USP and FS will reimburse 66\2/3\% and 33\1/3\%,  respectively, of the IDCs incurred by R+D with respect to the new  intangible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> R+D does not qualify as a controlled participant within the  meaning of paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section, because it will not  derive any benefits from exploiting cost shared intangibles. Therefore,  R+D is treated as a service provider for purposes of this section and  must receive arm's length consideration for the assistance it is deemed  to provide to USP and FS, under the rules of paragraph (a)(3) of this  section and Secs. 1.482-4(f)(3)(iii) and (4), and 1.482-9, as  appropriate. Such consideration must be treated as IDCs incurred by USP  and FS in proportion to their RAB shares (that is, 66\2/3\% and 33\1/ 3\%, respectively). R+D will not be considered to bear any share of the  IDCs under the arrangement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Cost shared intangible, reasonably anticipated cost  shared intangible. U.S. Parent (USP) has developed and currently  exploits an antihistamine, XY, which is manufactured in tablet form. USP  enters into a CSA with its wholly-owned foreign subsidiary (FS) to  develop XYZ, a new improved version of XY that will be manufactured as a  nasal spray. Work under the CSA is fully devoted to developing XYZ, and  XYZ is developed. During the development period, XYZ is a reasonably  anticipated cost shared intangible under the CSA. Once developed, XYZ is  a cost shared intangible under the CSA.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Cost shared intangible. The facts are the same as in  Example 3, except that in the course of developing XYZ, the controlled  participants by accident discover ABC, a cure for disease D. ABC is a  cost shared intangible under the CSA.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Reasonably anticipated benefits. Controlled parties A and  B enter into a cost sharing arrangement to develop product and process  intangibles for an already existing Product P. Without such intangibles,  A and B would each reasonably anticipate revenue, in present value  terms, of $100M from sales of Product P until it became obsolete. With  the intangibles, A and B each reasonably anticipate selling the same  number of units each year, but reasonably anticipate that the price will  be higher. Because the particular product intangible is more highly  regarded in A's market, A reasonably anticipates an increase of $20M in  present value revenue from the product intangible, while B reasonably  anticipates only an increase of $10M. Further, A and B each reasonably  anticipate spending an extra $5M present value in production costs to  include the feature embodying the product intangible. Finally, A and B  each reasonably anticipate saving $2M present value in production costs  by using the process intangible. A and B reasonably anticipate no other  economic effects from exploiting the cost shared intangibles. A's  reasonably anticipated benefits from exploiting the cost shared  intangibles equal its reasonably anticipated increase in revenue ($20M)  plus its reasonably anticipated cost savings ($2M) minus its reasonably  anticipated increased costs ($5M), which equals $17M. Similarly, B's  reasonably anticipated benefits from exploiting the cost shared  intangibles equal its reasonably anticipated increase in revenue ($10M)  plus its reasonably anticipated cost savings ($2M) minus its reasonably  anticipated increased costs ($5M), which equals $7M. Thus A's reasonably  anticipated benefits are $17M and B's reasonably anticipated benefits  are $7M.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Consolidated group. For purposes of this  section, all members of the same consolidated group shall be treated as  one taxpayer.

CST Payments generally will be  considered   the payor's costs of developing intangibles at the location where such  development is conducted. For these purposes, IDCs borne directly by a  controlled participant that are deductible are deemed to be reduced to  the extent of any CST Payments owed to it by other controlled  participants pursuant to the CSA. Each cost sharing payment received by  a payee will be treated as coming pro rata from payments made by all  payors and will be applied pro rata against the deductions for the  taxable year that the payee is allowed in connection with the IDCs.

Based on RAB  shares, USP agrees to bear 40% and FS to bear 60% of the costs incurred  during the term of the agreement. The principal IDCs are operating costs  incurred by FS in Country Z of 100X annually, and costs incurred by USP  in the United States also of 100X annually. Of the total costs of 200X,  USP's share is 80X and FS's share is 120X so that FS must make a payment  to USP of 20X. The payment will be treated as a reimbursement of 20X of  USP's costs in the United States. Accordingly, USP's Form 1120 will  reflect an 80X deduction on account of activities performed in the  United States for purposes of allocation and apportionment of the  deduction to source. The Form 5471 ``Information Return of U.S. Persons  With Respect to Certain Foreign Corporations'' for FS will reflect a  100X deduction on account of activities performed in Country Z and a 20X  deduction on account of activities performed in the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2.

The depreciation deduction attributable to the U.S.  facility is 7X. The 20X net payment by FS to USP will first be applied  in reduction pro rata of the 5X deduction for costs and the 7X  depreciation deduction attributable to the U.S. facility.

In accordance with the best method rule of  Sec. 1.482-1(c), a method may be applied in a particular case only if  the comparability, quality of data, and reliability of assumptions under  that method make it more reliable than any other available measure of  the arm's length result. The following examples illustrate the  comparative analysis required to apply this rule. As with all of the  examples in these regulations, these examples are based on simplified  facts, are provided solely for purposes of illustrating the type of  analysis required under the relevant rule, and do not provide rules of  general application. Thus, conclusions reached in these examples as to  the relative reliability of methods are based on the assumed facts of  the examples, and are not general conclusions concerning the relative  reliability of any method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Preference for comparable uncontrolled price method.  Company A is the U.S. distribution subsidiary of Company B, a foreign  manufacturer of consumer electrical appliances. Company A purchases  toaster ovens from Company B for resale in the U.S. market. To exploit  other outlets for its toaster ovens, Company B also sells its toaster  ovens to Company C, an unrelated U.S. distributor of toaster ovens. The  products sold to Company A and Company C are identical in every respect  and there are no material differences between the transactions. In this  case application of the CUP method, using the sales of toaster ovens to  Company C, generally will provide a more reliable measure of an arm's  length result for the controlled sale of toaster ovens to Company A than  the application of any other method. See Secs. 1.482-1(c)(2)(i) and - 3(b)(2)(ii)(A).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Resale price method preferred to comparable uncontrolled  price method. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the  toaster ovens sold to Company A are of substantially higher quality than  those sold to Company C and the effect on price of such quality  differences cannot be accurately determined. In addition, in order to  round out its line of consumer appliances Company A purchases blenders  from unrelated parties for resale in the United States. The blenders are  resold to substantially the same customers as the toaster ovens, have a  similar resale value to the toaster ovens, and are purchased under  similar terms and in similar volumes. The distribution functions  performed by Company A appear to be similar for toaster ovens and  blenders. Given the product differences between the toaster ovens,  application of the resale price method using the purchases and resales  of blenders as the uncontrolled comparables is likely to provide a more  reliable measure of an arm's length result than application of the  comparable uncontrolled price method using Company B's sales of toaster  ovens to Company C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 2 except that Company A  purchases all its products from Company B and Company B makes no  uncontrolled sales into the United States. However, six uncontrolled  U.S. distributors are identified that purchase a similar line of  products from unrelated parties. The uncontrolled distributors purchase  toaster ovens from unrelated parties, but there are significant  differences in the characteristics of the toaster ovens, including the  brandnames under which they are sold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under the facts of this case, reliable adjustments for the  effect of the different brandnames cannot be made. Except for some  differences in payment terms and inventory levels, the purchases and  resales of toaster ovens by the three uncontrolled distributors are  closely similar to the controlled purchases in terms of the markets in  which they occur, the volume of the transactions, the marketing  activities undertaken by the distributor, inventory levels, warranties,  allocation of currency risk, and other relevant functions and risks.  Reliable adjustments can be made for the differences in payment terms  and inventory levels. In addition, sufficiently detailed accounting  information is available to permit adjustments to be made for  differences in accounting methods or in reporting of costs between cost  of goods sold and operating expenses. There are no other material  differences between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because reliable adjustments for the differences between the  toaster ovens, including the trademarks under which they are sold,  cannot be made, these uncontrolled transactions will not serve as  reliable measures of an arm's length result under the comparable  uncontrolled price method. There is, however, close functional  similarity between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions and  reliable adjustments have been made for material differences that would  be likely to affect gross profit. Under these circumstances, the gross  profit margins derived under the resale price method are less likely to  be susceptible to any unidentified differences than the operating profit  measures used under the comparable profits method. Therefore, given the  close functional comparability between the controlled and uncontrolled  transactions, and the high quality of the data, the resale price method  achieves a higher degree of comparability and will provide a more  reliable measure of an arm's length result. See Sec. 1.482-1(c) (Best  method rule).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Comparable profits method preferred to resale price  method. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that the  accounting information available for the uncontrolled comparables is not  sufficiently detailed to ensure consistent reporting between cost of  goods sold and operating expenses of material items such as discounts,  insurance, warranty costs, and supervisory, general and administrative  expenses. These expenses are significant in amount. Therefore, whether  these expenses are treated as costs of goods sold or operating expenses  would have a significant effect on gross margins. Because in this case  reliable adjustments can not be made for such accounting differences,  the reliability of the resale price method is significantly reduced.  There is, however, close functional similarity between the controlled  and uncontrolled transactions and reliable adjustments have been made  for all material differences other than the potential accounting  differences. Because the comparable profits method is not adversely  affected by the potential accounting differences, under these  circumstances the comparable profits method is likely to produce a more  reliable measure of an arm's length result than the resale price method.  See Sec. 1.482-1(c) (Best method rule).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> USS is a U.S. company that manufactures machine tool parts and sells  them to its foreign parent corporation, FP. Four U.S. companies are  identified that also manufacture various types of machine tool parts but  sell them to uncontrolled purchasers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Except for some differences in payment terms, the manufacture  and sales of machine tool parts by the four uncontrolled companies are  closely similar to the controlled transactions in terms of the functions  performed and risks assumed. Reliable adjustments can be made for the  differences in payment terms. In addition, sufficiently detailed  accounting information is available to permit adjustments to be made for  differences between the controlled transaction and the uncontrolled  comparables in accounting methods and in the reporting of costs between  cost of goods sold and operating expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> There is close functional similarity between the controlled  and uncontrolled transactions and reliable adjustments can be made for  material differences that would be likely to affect gross profit. Under  these circumstances, the gross profit markups derived under the cost  plus method are less likely to be susceptible to any unidentified  differences than the operating profit measures used under the comparable  profits method. Therefore, given the close functional comparability  between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions, and the high  quality of the data, the cost plus method achieves a higher degree of  comparability and will provide a more reliable measure of an arm's  length result. See Sec. 1.482-1(c) (Best method rule).</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Comparable profits method preferred to cost plus method.  The facts are the same as in Example 5, except that there are  significant differences between the controlled and uncontrolled  transactions in terms of the types of parts and components manufactured  and the complexity of the manufacturing process. The resulting  functional differences are likely to materially affect gross profit  margins, but it is not possible to identify the specific differences and  reliably adjust for their effect on gross profit. Because these  functional differences would be reflected in differences in operating  expenses, the operating profit measures used   under the comparable profits method implicitly reflect to some extent  these functional differences. Therefore, because in this case the  comparable profits method is less sensitive than the cost plus method to  the potentially significant functional differences between the  controlled and uncontrolled transactions, the comparable profits method  is likely to produce a more reliable measure of an arm's length result  than the cost plus method. See Sec. 1.482-1(c) (Best method rule).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> USpharm, a U.S. pharmaceutical company, develops a new drug  Z that is a safe and effective treatment for the disease zeezee. USpharm  has obtained patents covering drug Z in the United States and in various  foreign countries. USpharm has also obtained the regulatory  authorizations necessary to market drug Z in the United States and in  foreign countries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> USpharm licenses its subsidiary in country X, Xpharm, to  produce and sell drug Z in country X. At the same time, it licenses an  unrelated company, Ydrug, to produce and sell drug Z in country Y, a  neighboring country. Prior to licensing the drug, USpharm had obtained  patent protection and regulatory approvals in both countries and both  countries provide similar protection for intellectual property rights.  Country X and country Y are similar countries in terms of population,  per capita income and the incidence of disease zeezee. Consequently,  drug Z is expected to sell in similar quantities and at similar prices  in both countries. In addition, costs of producing drug Z in each  country are expected to be approximately the same.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> USpharm and Xpharm establish terms for the license of drug Z  that are identical in every material respect, including royalty rate, to  the terms established between USpharm and Ydrug. In this case the  district director determines that the royalty rate established in the  Ydrug license agreement is a reliable measure of the arm's length  royalty rate for the Xpharm license agreement. Given that the same  property is transferred in the controlled and uncontrolled transactions,  and that the circumstances under which the transactions occurred are  substantially the same, in this case the comparable uncontrolled  transaction method is likely to provide a more reliable measure of an  arm's length result than any other method. See Sec. 1.482-4(c)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> USC is a U.S. company that develops, manufactures and sells  communications equipment. EC is the European subsidiary of USC. EC is an  established company that carries out extensive research and development  activities and develops, manufactures and sells communications equipment  in Europe. There are extensive transactions between USC and EC. USC  licenses valuable technology it has developed to EC for use in the  European market but EC also licenses valuable technology it has  developed to USC. Each company uses components manufactured by the other  in some of its products and purchases products from the other for resale  in its own market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Detailed accounting information is available for both USC and  EC and adjustments can be made to achieve a high degree of consistency  in accounting practices between them. Relatively reliable allocations of  costs, income and assets can be made between the business activities  that are related to the controlled transactions and those that are not.  Relevant marketing and research and development expenditures can be  identified and reasonable estimates of the useful life of the related  intangibles are available so that the capitalized value of the  intangible development expenses of USC and EC can be calculated. In this  case there is no reason to believe that the relative value of these  capitalized expenses is substantially different from the relative value  of the intangible property of USC and EC. Furthermore, comparables are  identified that could be used to estimate a market return for the  routine contributions of USC and EC. Based on these facts, the residual  profit split could provide a reliable measure of an arm's length result.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> There are no uncontrolled transactions involving property that  is sufficiently comparable to much of the tangible and intangible  property transferred between USC and EC to permit use of the comparable  uncontrolled price method or the comparable uncontrolled transaction  method. Uncontrolled companies are identified in Europe and the United  States that perform somewhat similar activities to USC and EC; however,  the activities of none of these companies are as complex as those of USC  and EC and they do not use similar levels of highly valuable intangible  property that they have developed themselves. Under these circumstances,  the uncontrolled companies may be useful in determining a market return  for the routine contributions of USC and EC, but that return would not  reflect the value of the intangible property employed by USC and EC.  Thus, none of the uncontrolled companies is sufficiently similar so that  reliable results would be obtained using the resale price, cost plus, or  comparable profits methods. Moreover, no uncontrolled companies can be  identified that engaged in sufficiently similar activities and  transactions with each other to employ the comparable profit split  method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Given the difficulties in applying the other methods, the  reliability of the internal   data on USC and EC, and the fact that acceptable comparables are  available for deriving a market return for the routine contributions of  USC and EC, the residual profit split method is likely to provide the  most reliable measure of an arm's length result in this case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Company X is a large, complex U.S. company that carries out extensive  research and development activities and manufactures and markets a  variety of products. Company X has developed a new process by which  compact disks can be fabricated at a fraction of the cost previously  required. The process is expected to prove highly profitable, since  there is a large market for compact disks. Company X establishes a new  foreign subsidiary, Company Y, and licenses it the rights to use the  process to fabricate compact disks for the foreign market as well as  continuing technical support and improvements to the process. Company Y  uses the process to fabricate compact disks which it supplies to related  and unrelated parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The process licensed to Company Y is unique and highly valuable  and no uncontrolled transfers of intangible property can be found that  are sufficiently comparable to permit reliable application of the  comparable uncontrolled transaction method. Company X is a large,  complex company engaged in a variety of activities that owns unique and  highly valuable intangible property. Consequently, no uncontrolled  companies can be found that are similar to Company X. Furthermore,  application of the profit split method in this case would involve the  difficult and problematic tasks of allocating Company X's costs and  assets between the relevant business activity and other activities and  assigning a value to Company X's intangible contributions. On the other  hand, Company Y performs relatively routine manufacturing and marketing  activities and there are a number of similar uncontrolled companies.  Thus, application of the comparable profits method using Company Y as  the tested party is likely to produce a more reliable measure of an  arm's length result than a profit split in this case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> FP designs and manufactures consumer electronic devices that  incorporate advanced technology. In year 1, FP introduces Product X, an  entertainment device targeted primarily at the youth market. FP's  wholly-owned, exclusive U.S. distributor, USSub, sells Product X in the  U.S. market. USSub hires an independent marketing firm, Agency A, to  promote Product X in the U.S. market. Agency A has successfully promoted  other electronic products on behalf of other uncontrolled parties. USSub  executes a one-year, renewable contract with Agency A that requires it  to develop the market for Product X, within an annual budget set by  USSub. In years 1 through 3, Agency A develops advertising, buys media,  and sponsors events featuring Product X. Agency A receives a markup of  25% on all expenses of promoting Product X, with the exception of media  buys, which are reimbursed at cost. During year 3, sales of Product X  decrease sharply, as Product X is displaced by competitors' products. At  the end of year 3, sales of Product X are discontinued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Prior to the start of year 4, FP develops a new entertainment  device, Product Y. Like Product X, Product Y is intended for sale to the  youth market, but it is marketed under a new trademark distinct from  that used for Product X. USSub decides to perform all U.S. market  promotion for Product Y. USSub hires key Agency A staff members who  handled the successful Product X campaign. To promote Product Y, USSub  intends to use methods similar to those used successfully by Agency A to  promote Product X (print advertising, media, event sponsorship, etc.).  FP and USSub enter into a one-year, renewable agreement concerning  promotion of Product Y in the U.S. market. Under the agreement, FP  compensates USSub for promoting Product Y, based on a cost of services  plus markup of A%. Third-party media buys by USSub in connection with  Product Y are reimbursed at cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Assume that under the contractual arrangements between FP and  USSub, the arm's length consideration for Product Y and the trademark or  other intangible property may be determined reliably under one or more  transfer pricing methods. At issue in this example is the separate  evaluation of the arm's length compensation for the year 4 promotional  activities performed by USSub pursuant to its contract with FP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> USSub's accounting records contain reliable data that  separately state the costs incurred to promote Product Y. A functional  analysis indicates that USSub's activities to promote Product Y in year  4 are similar to activities performed by Agency A during years 1 through  3 under the contract with USSub. In other respects, no material  differences exist in the market conditions or the promotional activities  performed in year 4, as compared to those in years 1 through 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> It is possible to identify uncontrolled distributors or  licensees of electronic products that perform, as one component of their  business activities, promotional activities similar to those performed  by USSub. However, it is unlikely that publicly available accounting  data from these companies would allow computation of the comparable  transactional costs or total services costs associated with the  marketing or promotional activities that these entities perform, as one  component of business activities. If that   were possible, the comparable profits method for services might provide  a reliable measure of an arm's length result. The functional analysis of  the marketing activities performed by USSub in year 4 indicates that  they are similar to the activities performed by Agency A in years 1  through 3 for Product X. Because reliable information is available  concerning the markup on costs charged in a comparable uncontrolled  transaction, the most reliable measure of an arm's length price is the  cost of services plus method in Sec. 1.482-9(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> FP  manufactures furniture and accessories for residential use. FP sells its  products to retailers in Europe under the trademark, ``Moda.'' FP holds  all worldwide rights to the trademark, including in the United States.  USSub is FP's wholly-owned subsidiary in the U.S. market and the  exclusive U.S. distributor of FP's merchandise. Historically, USSub  dealt only with specialized designers in the U.S. market and advertised  in trade publications targeted to this market. Although items sold in  the U.S. and Europe are physically identical, USSub's U.S. customers  generally resell the merchandise as non-branded merchandise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> FP retains an independent firm to evaluate the feasibility of  selling FP's trademarked merchandise in the general wholesale and retail  market in the United States. The study concludes that this segment of  the U.S. market, which is not exploited by USSub, may generate  substantial profits. Based on this study, FP enters into a separate  agreement with USSub, which provides that USSub will develop this market  in the United States for the benefit of FP. USSub separately accounts  for personnel expenses, overhead, and out-of-pocket costs attributable  to the initial stage of the marketing campaign (Phase I). USSub receives  as compensation its costs, plus a markup of X%, for activities in Phase  I. At the end of Phase I, FP will evaluate the program. If success  appears likely, USSub will begin full-scale distribution of trademarked  merchandise in the new market segment, pursuant to agreements negotiated  with FP at that time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Assume that under the contractual arrangements in effect  between FP and USSub, the arm's length consideration for the merchandise  and the trademark or other intangible property may be determined  reliably under one or more transfer pricing methods. At issue in this  example is the separate evaluation of the arm's length compensation for  the marketing activities conducted by USSub in years 1 and following.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A functional analysis reveals that USSub's activities consist  primarily of modifying the promotional materials created by FP,  negotiating media buys, and arranging promotional events. FP separately  compensates USSub for all Phase I activities, and detailed accounting  information is available regarding the costs of these activities. The  Phase I activities of USSub are similar to those of uncontrolled  companies that perform, as their primary business activity, a range of  advertising and media relations activities on a contract basis for  uncontrolled parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> No information is available concerning the comparable  uncontrolled prices for services in transactions similar to those  engaged in by FP and USSub. Nor is any information available concerning  uncontrolled transactions that would allow application of the cost of  services plus method. It is possible to identify uncontrolled  distributors or licensees of home furnishings that perform, as one  component of their business activities, promotional activities similar  to those performed by USSub. However, it is unlikely that publicly  available accounting data from these companies would allow computation  of the comparable transactional costs or total services costs associated  with the marketing or promotional activities that these entities  performed, as one component of their business activities. On the other  hand, it is possible to identify uncontrolled advertising and media  relations companies, the principal business activities of which are  similar to the Phase I activities of USSub. Under these circumstances,  the most reliable measure of an arm's length price is the comparable  profits method of Sec. 1.482-9(f). The uncontrolled advertising  comparables' treatment of material items, such as classification of  items as cost of goods sold or selling, general, and administrative  expenses, may differ from that of USSub. Such inconsistencies in  accounting treatment between the uncontrolled comparables and the tested  party, or among the comparables, are less important when using the ratio  of operating profit to total services costs under the comparable profits  method for services in Sec. 1.482-9(f). Under this method, the operating  profit of USSub from the Phase I activities is compared to the operating  profit of uncontrolled parties that perform general advertising and  media relations as their primary business activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  USP is a manufacturer of athletic apparel sold under the AA trademark,  to which FP owns the worldwide rights. USP sells AA trademark apparel in  countries throughout the world, but prior to year 1, USP did not sell  its merchandise in Country X. In year 1, USP acquires an uncontrolled  Country X company which becomes its wholly-owned subsidiary, XSub. USP  enters into an exclusive distribution arrangement with XSub in Country  X. Before being acquired by USP in year 1, XSub distributed athletic  apparel purchased from uncontrolled suppliers and resold that  merchandise to retailers. After being acquired by   USP in year 1, XSub continues to distribute merchandise from  uncontrolled suppliers and also begins to distribute AA trademark  apparel. Under a separate agreement with USP, XSub uses its best efforts  to promote the AA trademark in Country X, with the goal of maximizing  sales volume and revenues from AA merchandise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Prior to year 1, USP executed long-term endorsement contracts  with several prominent professional athletes. These contracts give USP  the right to use the names and likenesses of the athletes in any country  in which AA merchandise is sold during the term of the contract. These  contracts remain in effect for five years, starting in year 1. Before  being acquired by USP, XSub renewed a long-term agreement with  SportMart, an uncontrolled company that owns a nationwide chain of  sporting goods retailers in Country X. XSub has been SportMart's primary  supplier from the time that SportMart began operations. Under the  agreement, SportMart will provide AA merchandise preferred shelf-space  and will feature AA merchandise at no charge in its print ads and  seasonal promotions. In consideration for these commitments, USP and  XSub grant SportMart advance access to new products and the right to use  the professional athletes under contract with USP in SportMart  advertisements featuring AA merchandise (subject to approval of content  by USP).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Assume that it is possible to segregate all transactions by  XSub that involve distribution of merchandise acquired from uncontrolled  distributors (non-controlled transactions). In addition, assume that,  apart from the activities undertaken by USP and XSub to promote AA  apparel in Country X, the arm's length compensation for other functions  performed by USP and XSub in the Country X market in years 1 and  following can be reliably determined. At issue in this Example 12 is the  application of the residual profit split analysis to determine the  appropriate division between USP and XSub of the balance of the  operating profits from the Country X market, that is the portion  attributable to nonroutine contributions to the marketing and  promotional activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A functional analysis of the marketing and promotional  activities conducted in the Country X market, as described in this  example, indicates that both USP and XSub made nonroutine contributions  to the business activity. USP contributed the long-term endorsement  contracts with professional athletes. XSub contributed its long-term  contractual rights with SportMart, which were made more valuable by its  successful, long-term relationship with SportMart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Based on the facts and circumstances, including the fact that  both USP and XSub made valuable nonroutine contributions to the  marketing and promotional activities and an analysis of the availability  (or lack thereof) of comparable and reliable market benchmarks, the  Commissioner determines that the most reliable measure of an arm's  length result is the residual profit split method in Sec. 1.482-9(g).  The residual profit split analysis would take into account both routine  and nonroutine contributions by USP and XSub, in order to determine an  appropriate allocation of the combined operating profits in the Country  X market from the sale of AA merchandise and from related promotional  and marketing activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> USP  develops, manufacturers, and distributes pharmaceutical products. USP  and FS, USP's wholly-owned subsidiary, enter into a CSA to develop a new  oncological drug, Oncol. Immediately prior to entering into the CSA, USP  acquires Company X, an unrelated U.S. pharmaceutical company. Company X  is solely engaged in oncological pharmaceutical research, and its only  significant resources and capabilities are its workforce and its sole  patent, which is associated with Compound X, a promising molecular  compound derived from a rare plant, which USP reasonably anticipates  will contribute to developing Oncol. All of Company X researchers will  be engaged solely in research that is reasonably anticipated to  contribute to developing Oncol as well. The rights in the Compound X and  the commitment of Company X's researchers to the development of Oncol  are platform contributions for which compensation is due from FS as part  of a PCT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this case, the acquisition price method, based on the lump  sum price paid by USP for Company X, is likely to provide a more  reliable measure of an arm's length PCT Payment due to USP than the  application of any other method. See Secs. 1.482-4(c)(2) and 1.482- 7(g)(5)(iv)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Company  X is a publicly traded U.S. company solely engaged in oncological  pharmaceutical research and its only significant resources and  capabilities are its workforce and its sole patent, which is associated  with Compound Y, a promising molecular compound derived from a rare  plant. Company X has no marketable products. Company X enters into a CSA  with FS, a newly-formed foreign subsidiary, to develop a new oncological  drug, Oncol, derived from Compound Y. Compound Y is reasonably  anticipated to contribute to developing Oncol. All of Company X  researchers will be engaged solely in research that is reasonably  anticipated to contribute to developing Oncol under the CSA. The rights  in Compound Y and the commitment of Company X's researchers are platform  contributions for which compensation is due from FS as part of a PCT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this case, given that Company X's platform contributions  covered by PCTs relate to its entire economic value, the application of  the market capitalization method, based on the market capitalization of  Company X, provides a reliable measure of an arm's length result for  Company X's PCTs to the CSA. See Secs. 1.482-4(c)(2) and 1.482- 7(g)(6)(v)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  MicroDent, Inc. (MDI) is a publicly traded company that developed a new  dental surgical microscope ScopeX-1, which drastically shortens many  surgical procedures. On January 1 of Year 1, MDI entered into a CSA with  a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary (FS) to develop ScopeX-2, the next  generation of ScopeX-1. In the CSA, divisional interests are divided on  a territorial basis. The rights associated with ScopeX-1, as well as  MDI's research capabilities are reasonably anticipated to contribute to  the development of ScopeX-2 and are therefore platform contributions for  which compensation is due from FS as part of a PCT. At the time of the  PCT, MDI's only product was the ScopeX-I microscope, although MDI was in  the process of developing ScopeX-2. Concurrent with the CSA, MDI  separately transfers exclusive and perpetual exploitation rights  associated with ScopeX-1 to FS in the same territory as assigned to FS  in the CSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Although the transactions between MDI and FS under the CSA are  distinct from the transactions between MDI and FS relating to the  exploitation rights for ScopeX-1, it is likely to be more reliable to  evaluate the combined effect of the transactions than to evaluate them  in isolation. This is because the combined transactions between MDI and  FS relate to all of the economic value of MDI (that is, the exploitation  rights and research rights associated with ScopeX-1, as well as the  research capabilities of MDI). In this case, application of the market  capitalization method, based on the enterprise value of MDI on January 1  of Year 1, is likely to provide a reliable measure of an arm's length  payment for the aggregated transactions. See Secs. 1.482-4(c)(2) and  1.482-7(g)(6)(v)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Notwithstanding that the market capitalization method provides  the most reliable measure of the aggregated transactions between MDI and  FS, see Sec. 1.482-7(g)(2)(iv) for further considerations of when  further analysis may be required to distinguish between the remuneration  to MDI associated with PCTs under the CSA (for research rights and  capabilities associated with ScopeX-1) and the remuneration to MDI for  the exploitation rights associated with ScopeX-1.</p><p class="depth0">Example 16. Income method (applied using CPM) preferred to  acquisition price method. The facts are the same as in Example 13,  except that the acquisition occurred significantly in advance of  formation of the CSA, and reliable adjustments cannot be made for this  time difference. In addition, Company X has other valuable molecular  patents and associated research capabilities, apart from Compound X,  that are not reasonably anticipated to contribute to the development of  Oncol and that cannot be reliably valued. The CSA divides divisional  interests on a territorial basis. Under the terms of the CSA, USP will  undertake all R&D; (consisting of laboratory research and clinical  testing) and manufacturing associated with Oncol, as well as the  distribution activities for its territory (the United States). FS will  distribute Oncol in its territory (the rest of the world). FS's  distribution activities are routine in nature, and the profitability  from its activities may be reliably determined from third-party  comparables. FS does not furnish any platform contributions. At the time  of the PCT, reliable (ex ante) financial projections associated with the  development of Oncol and its separate exploitation in each of USP's and  FSub's assigned geographical territories are undertaken. In this case,  application of the income method using CPM is likely to provide a more  reliable measure of an arm's length result than application of the  acquisition price method based on the price paid by USP for Company X.  See Sec. 1.482-7(g)(4)(vi) and (5)(iv)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the  same as in Example 13, except that the acquisition occurred sometime  prior to the CSA, and Company X has some areas of promising research  that are not reasonably anticipated to contribute to developing Oncol.  For purposes of this example, the CSA is assumed to divide divisional  interests on a territorial basis. In general, the Commissioner  determines that the acquisition price data is useful in informing the  arm's length price, but not necessarily determinative. Under the terms  of the CSA, USP will undertake all R&D; (consisting of laboratory  research and clinical testing) and manufacturing associated with Oncol,  as well as the distribution activities for its territory (the United  States). FS will distribute Oncol in its territory (the rest of the  world). FS's distribution activities are routine in nature, and the  profitability from its activities may be reliably determined from third- party comparables. At the time of the PCT, financial projections  associated with the development of Oncol and its separate exploitation  in each of USP's and FSub's assigned geographical territories are  undertaken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under the facts, it is possible that the acquisition price  method or the income method using CPM might reasonably be applied.  Whether the acquisition price method or the income method provides the  most reliable evidence of the arm's length price of USP's contributions  depends on a number of   factors, including the reliability of the financial projections, the  reliability of the discount rate chosen, and the extent to which the  acquisition price of Company X can be reliably adjusted to account for  changes in value over the time period between the acquisition and the  formation of the CSA and to account for the value of the in-process  research done by Company X that does not constitute platform  contributions to the CSA. See Sec. 1.482-7(g)(4)(vi) and (5)(iv)(A) and  (C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the  same as in Example 17, except that FS has a patent on Compound Y, which  the parties reasonably anticipate will be useful in mitigating potential  side effects associated with Compound X and thereby contribute to the  development of Oncol. The rights in Compound Y constitute a platform  contribution for which compensation is due from USP as part of a PCT.  The value of FS's platform contribution cannot be reliably measured by  market benchmarks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under the facts, it is possible that either the acquisition  price method and the income method together or the residual profit split  method might reasonably be applied to determine the arm's length PCT  Payments due between USP and FS. Under the first option the PCT Payment  for the platform contributions related to Company X's workforce and  Compound X would be determined using the acquisition price method  referring to the lump sum price paid by USP for Company X. Because the  value of these platform contributions can be determined by reference to  a market benchmark, they are considered routine platform contributions.  Accordingly, under this option, the platform contribution related to  Compound Y would be the only nonroutine platform contribution and the  relevant PCT Payment is determined using the income method. Under the  second option, rather than looking to the acquisition price for Company  X, all the platform contributions are considered nonroutine and the RPSM  is applied to determine the PCT Payments for each platform contribution.  Under either option, the PCT Payments will be netted against each other.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether the acquisition price method together with the income  method or the residual profit split method provides the most reliable  evidence of the arm's length price of the platform contributions of USP  and FS depends on a number of factors, including the reliability of the  determination of the relative values of the platform contributions for  purposes of the RPSM, and the extent to which the acquisition price of  Company X can be reliably adjusted to account for changes in value over  the time period between the acquisition and the formation of the CSA and  to account for the value of the rights in the in-process research done  by Company X that does not constitute platform contributions to the CSA.  In these circumstances, it is also relevant to consider whether the  results of each method are consistent with each other, or whether one or  both methods are consistent with other potential methods that could be  applied. See Sec. 1.482-7(g)(4)(vi), (5)(iv), and (7)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective/applicability date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.
