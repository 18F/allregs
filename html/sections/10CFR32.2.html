                            <p class="depth0">As used in this part:</p><p class="depth0">Committed dose for the purposes of this part means the radiation  dose that will accumulate over time as a result of retention in the body  of radioactive material. Committed dose is a generic term for internal  dose and must be calculated by summing the projected dose over the 50  years after intake for all irradiated organs or tissues multiplying the  doses to individual organs and tissues by applicable tissue weighting  factors.</p><p class="depth0">Dose commitment means the total radiation dose to a part of the body  that will result from retention in the body of radioactive material. For  purposes of estimating the dose commitment, it is assumed that from the  time of intake the period of exposure to retained material will not  exceed 50 years.</p><p class="depth0">Lot Tolerance Percent Defective means, expressed in percent  defective, the poorest quality in an individual inspection lot that  should be accepted.</p><p class="depth0">Nationally tracked source is a sealed source containing a quantity  equal to or greater than Category 1 or Category 2 levels of any  radioactive material listed in Appendix E to part 20 of this Chapter. In  this context a sealed source is defined as radioactive material that is  sealed in a capsule or closely bonded, in a solid form and which is not  exempt from regulatory control. It does not mean material encapsulated  solely for disposal, or nuclear material contained in any fuel assembly,  subassembly, fuel   rod, or fuel pellet. Category 1 nationally tracked sources are those  containing radioactive material at a quantity equal to or greater than  the Category 1 threshold. Category 2 nationally tracked sources are  those containing radioactive material at a quantity equal to or greater  than the Category 2 threshold but less than the Category 1 threshold.</p><p class="depth0">Sealed Source and Device Registry means the national registry that  contains all the registration certificates, generated by both the NRC  and the Agreement States, that summarize the radiation safety  information for the sealed sources and devices and describe the  licensing and use conditions approved for the product.
