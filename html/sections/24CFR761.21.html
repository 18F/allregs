                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirement. To receive funding under this part, each  PHDEP qualified recipient or AHDEP applicant must submit to HUD, for  Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) 2000 and each following FFY, a plan for  addressing the problem of drug-related and violent crime in and around  the housing covered by the plan. If the plan covers more than one  development, it does not have to address each development separately if  the same activities will apply to each development. The plan must  address each development separately only where program activities will  differ from one development to another. The plan must include a  description of the planned activity or activities, a description of the  role of plan partners and their contributions to carrying out the plan,  a budget and timetable for implementation of the activities, and the  funding source for each activity, identifying in particular all  activities to be funded under this part. In addition, the plan must set  measurable performance goals and interim milestones for the PHDEP- supported activities and describe the system for monitoring and  evaluating these activities. Measurable goals must be established for  each category of funded activities, including drug prevention, drug  intervention, drug treatment, tenant patrols, and physical improvements.  The plan under this section serves as the application for PHDEP funding,  and an otherwise qualified recipient that does not   submit a PHDEP plan as required will not be funded. For AHDEP funding,  NOFAs published in the Federal Register may provide additional  information on plan requirements for purposes of this section. Plans  must meet the requirements of this section before grant funds are  distributed. HUD will review the submitted plans for a determination of  whether they meet the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional requirements for consortia. In addition to meeting  the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, to receive funding  under this part, a consortium's plan must include a copy of the  consortium agreement between the PHAs which are participating in the  consortium, and a copy of the payment agreement between the consortium  and HUD.
