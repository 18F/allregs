The records must be readily available for inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If an absorber is the final unit in a system:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A temperature monitoring device and a specific gravity monitoring device for the scrubber liquid shall be installed, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An organic monitoring device shall be installed at the outlet of the absorber.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a condenser is the final unit in a system:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A temperature monitoring device shall be installed at the condenser exit (product side), or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An organic monitoring device shall be installed at the outlet of the condenser.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If a carbon adsorber is the final unit in a system, an organic monitoring device shall be installed at the outlet of the carbon bed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Owners or operators of control devices used to comply with the provisions of this subpart, except Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1)(i)(D), shall monitor these control devices to ensure that they are operated and maintained in conformance with their designs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Owners or operators using a vent system that contains valves that could divert a vent stream from a control device used to comply with the provisions of this subpart shall do one or a combination of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Install a flow indicator immediately downstream of each valve that if opened would allow a vent stream to bypass the control device and be emitted, either directly or indirectly, to the atmosphere. The flow indicator shall be capable of recording flow at least once every fifteen minutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Monitor the valves once a month, checking the position of the valves and the condition of the car seal, and identify all times when the car seals have been broken and the valve position has been changed (i.e., from opened to closed for valves in the vent piping to the control device and from closed to open for valves that allow the stream to be vented directly or indirectly to the atmosphere).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An owner or operator complying with the standards specified under Sec. 60.562-1, except Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1)(i)(D), with control devices other than an incinerator, boiler, process heater, flare, absorber, condenser, or carbon adsorber or by any other means shall provide to the Administrator information describing the operation of the control device and the process parameter(s) which would indicate proper operation and maintenance of the device. The Administrator may request further information and will specify appropriate monitoring procedures or requirements.
