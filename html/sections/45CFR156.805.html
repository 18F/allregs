                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Grounds for imposing civil money penalties. Civil money penalties may be imposed on an issuer in a Federally-facilitated Exchange by HHS if, based on credible evidence, HHS has reasonably determined that the issuer has engaged in one or more of the following actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Misconduct in the Federally-facilitated Exchange or substantial non-compliance with the Exchange standards and requirements applicable to issuers offering QHPs in the Federally-facilitated Exchange, including but not limited to issuer standards and requirements under parts 153 and 156 of this subchapter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limiting the QHP's enrollees' access to medically necessary items and services that are required to be covered

as a condition of the QHP issuer's ongoing participation in the Federally-facilitated Exchange, if the limitation has adversely affected or has a substantial likelihood of adversely affecting one or more enrollees in the QHP offered by the QHP issuer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Imposing on enrollees premiums in excess of the monthly beneficiary premiums permitted by Federal standards applicable to QHP issuers participating in the Federally-facilitated Exchange;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Engaging in any practice that would reasonably be expected to have the effect of denying or discouraging enrollment into a QHP offered by the issuer (except as permitted by this part) by qualified individuals whose medical condition or history indicates the potential for a future need for significant medical services or items;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Intentionally or recklessly misrepresenting or falsifying information that it furnishes--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To HHS; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To an individual or entity upon which HHS relies to make its certifications or evaluations of the QHP issuer's ongoing compliance with Exchange standards applicable to issuers offering QHPs in the Federally-facilitated Exchange;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Failure to remit user fees assessed under Sec. 156.50(c); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Failure to comply with the cost-sharing reductions and advance payments of the premium tax credit standards of subpart E of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Factors in determining the amount of civil money penalties assessed. In determining the amount of civil money penalties, HHS may take into account the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The QHP issuer's previous or ongoing record of compliance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The level of the violation, as determined in part by--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The frequency of the violation, taking into consideration whether any violation is an isolated occurrence, represents a pattern, or is widespread; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The magnitude of financial and other impacts on enrollees and qualified individuals; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Aggravating or mitigating circumstances, or other such factors as justice may require, including complaints about the issuer with regard to the issuer's compliance with the medical loss ratio standards required by the Affordable Care Act and as codified by applicable regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Maximum penalty. The maximum amount of penalty imposed for each violation is $100 for each day for each QHP issuer for each individual adversely affected by the QHP issuer's non-compliance; and where the number of individuals cannot be determined, HHS may estimate the number of individuals adversely affected by the violation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice of intent to issue civil money penalty. If HHS proposes to assess a civil money penalty in accordance with this part, HHS will send a written notice of this decision to--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The QHP issuer against whom the civil money penalty is being imposed, whose notice must include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of the basis for the determination;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The basis for the penalty;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The amount of the penalty;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The date the penalty is due;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> An explanation of the issuer's right to a hearing under an applicable administrative hearing process; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Information about where to file the request for hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> HHS will deliver notice under this paragraph by either hand delivery, certified mail, return receipt requested, or by overnight delivery service with signature upon delivery required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Failure to request a hearing. (1) If the QHP issuer does not request a hearing within 30 days of the issuance of the notice described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, HHS may assess the proposed civil money penalty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the QHP issuer does not request a hearing within 30 days of the issuance of the notice described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, HHS may assess the proposed civil money penalty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> HHS will notify the issuer in writing of any penalty that has been assessed under this subpart and of the means by which the QHP issuer or another responsible entity may satisfy the CMP assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The QHP issuer has no right to appeal a penalty with respect to which it has not requested a hearing in accordance with the requirements of the applicable administrative hearing process unless the QHP issuer can show good cause, as determined under Sec. 156.905(b),

for failing to timely exercise its right to a hearing.
