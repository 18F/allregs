                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)(E)</em> is  treated as new section 38 property and, therefore, is not subject to the  used property limitation in section 48(c). Section 48(g)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> and   paragraph (b) of this section define the term ``qualified rehabilitated  building.'' Section 48(g)(2) and paragraph (c) of this section define  the term ``qualified rehabilitation expenditure.'' Section 48(g)  (2)(B)(iv) and (3) and paragraph (d) of this section describe the rules  applicable to ``certified historic structures.'' Section 48(q) and  paragraph (e) of this section provide rules concerning an adjustment to  the basis of the rehabilitated building. Paragraph (f) of this section  provides guidance for coordination of these provisions with other  sections of the Code, including rules for determining when the  rehabilitation credit may be claimed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em>, this section applies to  expenditures incurred after December 31, 1981, in connection with the  rehabilitation of a qualified rehabilitated building. (See paragraph  (c)(3)(i) of this section for rules concerning the determination of when  an expenditure is incurred.) If, however, physical work on the  rehabilitation began before January 1, 1982, and the building does not  meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the rules in  Sec.  1.48-11 shall apply to the expenditures incurred after December  31, 1981, in connection with such rehabilitation. (See paragraph  (b)(6)(i) of this section for rules determining when physical work on a  rehabilitation begins.)

Except as otherwise provided in section  251(d) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and this paragraph (a)(2)(iv), the  amendments made by section 251 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 shall apply  to property placed in service after December 31, 1986, in taxable years  ending after that date, regardless of when the rehabilitation  expenditures attributable to such property were incurred. If property  attributable to qualified rehabilitation expenditures is incurred with  respect to a rehabilitation to a building placed in service in segments  or phases and some segments are placed in service before January 1,  1987, and the remaining segments are placed in service after December  31, 1986, the amendments under the Tax Reform Act would not apply to the  property placed in service before   January 1, 1987, but would apply to the segments placed in service after  December 31, 1986, unless one of the transition rules in paragraph  (a)(2)(iv) (B) or (C) of this section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> General transition rule. The amendments made by sections 251 and  201 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 shall not apply to property that  qualifies under section 251(d) (2), (3), or (4) of the Tax Reform Act of  1986. Property qualifies for the general transition rule in section  251(d)(2) of the Act if such property is placed in service before  January 1, 1994, and if such property is placed in service as part of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A rehabilitation that was completed pursuant to a written  contract that was binding on March 1, 1986, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A rehabilitation incurred in connection with property (including  any leasehold interest) acquired before March 2, 1986, or acquired on or  after such date pursuant to a written contract that was binding on March  1, 1986, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Parts 1 and 2 of the Historic Preservation Certificate  Application were filed with the Department of the Interior (or its  designee) before March 2, 1986, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The lesser of $1,000,000 or 5 percent of the cost of the  rehabilitation is incurred before March 2, 1986, or is required to be  incurred pursuant to a written contract which was binding on March 1,  1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Specific rehabilitations. See section 251(d) (3) and (4) of the  Tax Reform Act of 1986 for additional rehabilitations that are exempted  from the amendments made by sections 251 and 201 of the Tax Reform Act  of 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definition of qualified rehabilitated building--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.  The term ``qualified rehabilitated building'' means any building and its  structural components--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> That has been substantially rehabilitated (within the meaning of  paragraph (b)(2) of this section) for the taxable year,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> That was placed in service (within the meaning of Sec.  1.46- 3(d)) as a building by any person before the beginning of the  rehabilitation, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this section does not apply  to a certified historic structure. See paragraphs (b) (4) and (5) of  this section for additional requirements related to the definition of a  qualified rehabilitated building.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Substantially rehabilitated building--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Substantial  rehabilitation test. A building shall be treated as having been  substantially rehabilitated for a taxable year only if the qualified  rehabilitation expenditures (as defined in paragraph (c) of this  section) incurred during any 24-month period selected by the taxpayer  ending with or within the taxable year exceed the greater of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The adjusted basis of the building (and its structural  components), or (B) $5,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Date to determine adjusted basis of the building--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In  general. The adjusted basis of the building (and its structural  components) shall be determined as of the beginning of the first day of  the 24-month period selected by the taxpayer or the first day of the  taxpayer's holding period of the building (within the meaning of section  1250(e)), whichever is later. For purposes of determining the holding  period under section 1250(e), any reconstruction that is part of the  rehabilitation shall be disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special rules. In the event that a building is not owned by the  taxpayer, the adjusted basis of the building shall be determined as of  the date that would have been used if the owner had been the taxpayer.  The adjusted basis of a building that is being rehabilitated by a  taxpayer other than the owner shall thus be determined as of the  beginning of the first day of the 24-month period selected by the  taxpayer or the first day of the owner's holding period, whichever is  later. Therefore, if a building that is being rehabilitated by a lessee  is sold subject to the lease prior to the date that the lessee has  substantially rehabilitated the building, the lessee's adjusted basis is  determined as of the beginning of the first day of the new lessor's  holding period or the beginning of the first day of the 24-month period  selected by the lessee   (the taxpayer), whichever is later. If, therefore, the first day of the  new lessor's holding period were later than the first day of the 24- month period selected by the lessee (the taxpayer), the lessee's  adjusted basis for purposes of the substantial rehabilitation test would  be the same as the adjusted basis of the new lessor as determined under  paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section. If a building is sold after the  date that a lessee has substantially rehabilitated the building with  respect to the original lessor's adjusted basis, however, the lessee's  basis may be determined as of the first day of the 24-month period  selected by the lessee or the first day of the original lessor's holding  period, whichever is later, and the transfer of the building will not  affect the adjusted basis for purposes of the substantial rehabilitation  test. The preceding sentence shall not apply, however, if the building  is sold to the lessee or a related party within the meaning of section  267(b) or section 707(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Adjusted basis of the building--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The term  ``adjusted basis of the building'' means the aggregate adjusted basis  (within the meaning of section 1011(a)) in the building (and its  structural components) of all the parties who have an interest in the  building.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special rules. In the case of a building that is leased to one  or more tenants in whole or inpart, the adjusted basis of the building  is determined by adding the adjusted basis of the owner (lessor) in the  building to the adjusted basis of the lessee (or lessees) in the  leasehold and any leasehold improvements that are structural components  of the building. Similarly, in the case of a building that is divided  into condominium units, the adjusted basis of the building means the  aggregate adjusted basis of all of the respective condominium owners  (including the basis of any lessee in the leasehold and leasehold  improvements) in the building (and its structural components). If the  adjusted basis of a building would be determined in whole or in part by  reference to the adjusted basis of a person or persons other than the  taxpayer (e.g., a rehabilitation by a lessee) and the taxpayer is unable  to obtain the required information, the taxpayer must establish by clear  and convincing evidence that the adjusted basis of such person or  persons in the building on the date specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of  this section is an amount that is less than the amount of qualified  rehabilitation expenditures incurred by the taxpayer. If no such amount  can be so established, the adjusted basis of the building will be deemed  to be the fair market value of the building on the relevant date. For  purposes of determining the adjusted basis of a building, the portion of  the adjusted basis of a building that is allocable to an addition  (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section) to the  building that does not meet the age requirement in paragraph (b)(4)(i)  of this section shall be disregarded. (See paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this  section for the rule applicable to the determination of the adjusted  basis of a building when qualified rehabilitation expenditures are  treated as incurred by the taxpayer.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Rehabilitation. Rehabilitation includes renovation,  restoration, or reconstruction of a building, but does not include an  enlargement (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(10) of this section) of  new construction. The determination of whether expenditures are  attributable to the rehabilitation of an existing building or to new  construction shall be based upon all the facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em>  shall be met if the owner provides written plans for the rehabilitation  work to be done by the owner and a description of the rehabilitation  work that the tenants will be required to complete. The work required of  the tenants may be described in the written plans in terms of minimum  specifications (e.g., as to lighting, wiring, materials, appearance)  that must be met by such tenants. See paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this  section for the definition of physical work on a rehabilitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Treatment of expenses incurred by persons who have an interest  in the building. For purposes of the substantial rehabilitation test in  paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the taxpayer may take into account  qualified rehabilitation expenditures incurred during the same  rehabilitation process by any other person who has an interest in the  building. Thus, for example, to determine whether a building has been  substantially rehabilitated, a lessee may include the expenditures of  the lessor and of other lessees; a condominium owner may include the  expenditures incurred by other condominium owners; and an owner may  include the expenditures of the lessees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Special rules when qualified rehabilitation expenditures are  treated as incurred by the taxpayer. In the case where qualified  rehabilitation expenditures are treated as having been incurred by a  taxpayer under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the transferee  shall be treated as having incurred the expenditures incurred by the  transferor on the date that the transferor incurred the expenditures  within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. For purposes  of the substantial rehabilitation test in paragrpah (b)(2)(i) of this  section, the transferee's adjusted basis in the building shall be  determined as of the beginning of the first day of a 24-month period, or  the first day of the transferee's holding period, whichever is later, as  provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. The transferee's basis  as of the first day of the transferee's holding period for purposes of  the substantial rehabilitation test in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this  section, however, shall be considered to be equal to the transferee's  basis in the building on such date less--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount of any qualified rehabilitation expenditures incurred  (or treated as having been incurred) by the transferor during the 24- month period that are treated as having been incurred by the transferee  under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount of qualified rehabilitation expenditures incurred  before the transfer and during the 24-month period by any other person  who has an interest in the building (e.g., a lessee of the transferor).  The preceding sentence shall not apply, however, unless the transferee's  basis in the building is determined with reference to (1) the  transferee's cost of the building (including the rehabilitation  expenditures), (2) the transferor's basis in the building (where such  basis includes the amount of the expenditures), or (3) any other amount  that includes the cost of the rehabilitation expenditures. In the event  that the transferee's basis is determined with reference to an amount  not described above (e.g., transferee's basis in one building is  determined with reference to the transferee's basis in another building  under section 1031(d)), the amount of the expenditures incurred by the  transferor and treated as having been incurred by the transferee are not  deducted from the transferee's basis for purposes of the substantial  rehabilitation test. If a transferee's basis is determined under section  1014, any expenditures incurred by the decedent within the measuring   period that are treated as having been incurred by the transferee under  paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section shall decrease the transferee's  basis for purposes of the substantial rehabilitation test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Statement of adjusted basis, measuring period, and qualified  rehabilitation expenditures. In the case of any tax return filed after  August 27, 1985, on which an investment tax credit for property,  described in section 48(a)(1)(E) is claimed, the taxpayer shall indicate  by way of a marginal notation on, or a supplemental statement attached  to, Form 3468--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The beginning and ending dates for the measuring period selected  by the taxpayer under section 48(g)(1)(C)(i) and paragraph (b)(2) of  this section,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The adjusted basis of the building (within the meaning of  paragraph (b)(2) (iii) or (vii) of this section) as of the beginning of  such measuring period, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The amount of qualified rehabilitation expenditures incurred,  and treated as incurred, respectively, during such measuring period.  Furthermore, for returns filed after August 27, 1985, if the adjusted  basis of the building for purposes of the substantial rehabilitation  test is determined in whole or in part by reference to the adjusted  basis of a person, or persons, other than the taxpayer (e.g., a  rehabilitation by a lessee), the taxpayer must attach to the Form 3468  filed with the tax return on which the credit is claimed a statement  addressed to the District Director, signed by such third party, that  states the first day of the third party's holding period and the amount  of the adjusted basis of such third party in the building at the  beginning of the measuring period or the first day of the holding  period, whichever is later. If the taxpayer is unable to obtain the  required information, that fact should be indicated and the taxpayer  should state the manner in which the adjusted basis was determined and,  if different, the fair market value of the building on the relevant  date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Partnerships and S corporations. If a building is owned by a  partnership (i.e., the building is partnership property) or an S  corporation, the substantial rehabilitation test shall be determined at  the entity level. Thus, the entity shall compare the amount of qualified  rehabilitation expenditures incurred during the measuring period against  its basis in the building at the beginning of its holding period or the  beginning of its measuring period, whichever is later. (See section  1223(2) for rules concerning the determination of a partnership's  holding period in the case of a contribution of property to the  partnership meeting the requirements of section 721.) The adjusted basis  of the building to a partnership shall be determined by taking into  account any adjustments to the basis of the building made under section  743 and section 734. Any adjustments to the building's basis that are  made under section 743 or section 734 after the beginning of the  partnership's holding period, but before the end of the measuring  period, shall be deemed for purposes of the substantial rehabilitation  test to have been made on the first day of the partnership's holding  period. However, in such case, the partnership's basis in the building  shall be reduced by the amount of qualified rehabilitation expenditures  incurred by the partnership. In the case of any tax return filed after  January 9, 1989 on which a credit is claimed by a partner or a  shareholder of an S corporation for rehabilitation expenditures incurred  by a partnership or an S corporation, the partner or shareholder shall  indicate on the Form 3468 on which the credit is claimed the name,  address, and identification number of the partnership or S corporation  that incurred the rehabilitation expenditures, and the partnership or S  corporation shall, by way of a marginal notation on or a supplemental  statement attached to the entity's return, provide the information  required by paragraph (b)(2)(viii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  the substantial rehabilitation test in this paragraph (b)(2):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Assume that A, a calendar year taxpayer, purchases a  building for $140,000 on January 1, 1982, incurs qualified  rehabilitation expenditures in the amount of $48,000 (at the rate of  $4,000 per month) in 1982, $100,000 in 1983, and $20,000 (at the rate of  $2,000 per month) in the first ten months of 1984, and places the  rehabilitated building in service   on October 31, 1984. Assume that A did not have written architectural  plans and specifications describing a phased rehabilitation within the  meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section in existence prior to the  beginning of physical work on the rehabilitation. For purposes of the  substantial rehabilitation test in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, A  may select any 24-consecutive-month measuring period that ends in 1984,  the taxable year in which the rehabilitated building was placed in  service. Assume that on A's 1984 return, A selects a measuring period  beginning on February 1, 1982, and ending on January 31, 1984, and  specifies that A's basis in the building (within the meaning of section  1011(a)) was $144,000 on February 1, 1982 ($140,000+$4,000). (The $4,000  of rehabilitation expenditures incurred during January 1982 are included  in A's basis under section 1011 even though such property has not been  placed in service.) The amount of qualified rehabilitation expenditures  incurred during the measuring period was $146,000 ($44,000 from February  1 to December 31, 1982, plus $100,000 in 1983, plus $2,000 in January  1984). The building shall be treated as ``substantially rehabilitated''  within the meaning of this paragraph (b)(2) for A's 1984 taxable year  because the $146,000 of expenditures incurred by A during the measuring  period exceeded A's adjusted basis of $144,000 at the beginning of the  period. If the other requirements of section 48(g)(1) and this paragraph  are met, the building is treated as a qualified rehabilitated building,  and A can treat as qualified rehabilitation expenditures the amount of  $168,000 (i.e., $146,000 of expenditures incurred during the measuring  period, $4,000 of expenditures incurred prior to the beginning of the  measuring period as part of the rehabilitation process, and $18,000 of  expenditures incurred after the measuring period during the taxable year  within which the measuring period ends (See paragraph (c)(6) of this  section.)). The result would generally be the same if the property  attributable to the rehabilitation expenditures was placed in service as  the expenditures were incurred, but A would have $148,000 of qualified  rehabilitation expenditures for 1983 and $20,000 of qualified  rehabilitation expenditures for 1984. (See paragraph (f)(2) of this  section).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that  additional rehabilitation expenditures are incurred after the portion of  the basis of the building attributable to qualified rehabilitation  expenditures was placed in service on October 31, 1984. Such  expenditures are incurred through the end of 1984 and in 1985 when the  portion of the basis attributable to the additional expenditures is  placed in service. The fact that the building qualified as a  substantially rehabilitated building for A's 1984 taxable year has no  effect on whether the building is a qualified rehabilitated building for  property placed in service in A's 1985 taxable year. In order to  determine whether the building is a qualified rehabilitated building for  A's 1985 taxable year, A must select a measuring period that ends in  1985 and compare the expenditures incurred within that period with the  adjusted basis as of the beginning of the period. Solely for the purpose  of determining whether the building was substantially rehabilitated for  A's 1985 taxable year, expenditures incurred during 1983 and 1984, even  though considered in determining whether the building was substantially  rehabilitated in 1984, may also be used to determine whether the  building was substantially rehabilitated for A's 1985 taxable year,  provided the expenditures were incurred during any 24-month measuring  period selected by A that ends in 1985.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em> of this  section, however, C's adjusted basis for purposes of the substantial  rehabilitation test would be $100,000 if C had substantially  rehabilitated the building (i.e., incurred more than $100,000 in  rehabilitation expenditures) prior to B's sale to D.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. E owns a building with a basis of $10,000 and E incurs  $5,000 of rehabilitation expenditures. Before completing the  rehabilitation project, E sells the building to F for $30,000. Assume  that F is treated under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section as having   incurred the $5,000 of rehabilitation expenditures actually incurred by  E. Because F's basis in the building is determined under section 1011  with reference to F's $30,000 cost of the building (which includes the  property attributable to E's rehabilitation expenditures), F's basis for  purposes of the substantial rehabilitation test is $25,000 ($30,000 cost  basis less $5,000 rehabilitation expenditures treated as if incurred by  F). (See paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section.) F would thus be  required to incur more than $20,000 of rehabilitation expenditures (in  addition to the $5,000 incurred by E and treated as having been incurred  by F) during a measuring period selected by F to satisfy the substantial  rehabilitation test.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. G owns Building I with a basis of $10,000 and a fair  market value of $20,000. H owns Building II with a basis of $5,000 and a  fair market value of $20,000, with respect to which H has incurred  $1,000 of rehabilitation expenditures. G and H exchange their buildings  in a transaction that qualifies for nonrecognition treatment under  section 1031. Assume that G is treated under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of  this section as having incurred $1,000 of rehabilitation expenditures.  G's basis in Building II, computed under section 1031(d), is $10,000.  G's basis in Building II is not determined with reference to (A) the  cost of Building II, (B) H's basis in Building II (including the cost of  the rehabilitation expenditures) or (C) any other amount that includes  the cost of expenditures, but is instead determined with reference to  G's basis in other property (Building I). Therefore, G's basis in  Building II for purposes of the substantial rehabilitation test is not  reduced by the $1,000 of rehabilitation expenditures treated as if  incurred by G. (See paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section.) Accordingly,  G's basis in Building II for purposes of the substantial rehabilitation  test is $10,000, and G must incur additional rehabilitation expenditures  in excess of $9,000 within a measuring period selected by G to satisfy  the test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Retention of existing external walls and internal structural  framework--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general--(A) Property placed in service after December  31, 1986. Except in the case of property that qualifies for the  transition rules in paragraphs (a)(2)(iv) (B) and (C) of this section,  in the case of property that is placed in service after December 31,  1986, a building (other than a certified historic structure) meets the  requirement in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section only if in the  rehabilitation process--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 50 percent or more of the existing external walls of such  building are retained in place as external walls;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 75 percent or more of the existing external walls of such  building are retained in place as internal or external walls; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(iii)</em> of this section) is  retained in place.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> of this section, then the external  walls of such addition shall not be considered to be existing external  walls of the building for purposes of section 48(g)(1)(A)(iii) (as in  effect prior to enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986), and this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> of this section, the  requirement of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section is satisfied only  if in the rehabilitation process either the existing external wall  retention requirement in paragraph (b)(3)(i) (B) of this section is  satisfied, or:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 50 percent or more of the existing external walls of the  building are retained in place as external walls,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 75 percent or more of the existing external walls are retained  in place as internal or external walls, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> 75 percent or more of the existing internal structural framework  of such building is retained in place.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Area of external walls and internal structural framework. The  determinations required by paragraphs (b)(3)(i) (A), (B), and (C) of  this section shall be based upon the area of the external walls or  internal structural framework that is retained in place compared to the  total area of each prior to the rehabilitation. The area of the existing  external walls and internal structural framework of a building shall be  determined prior to any destruction, modification, or construction of  external walls or internal structural framework that is undertaken by  any party in anticipation of the rehabilitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Definition of external wall. For purposes of this paragraph  (b), a wall includes both the supporting elements of the wall and the  nonsupporting elements, (e.g., a curtain, windows or doors) of the wall.  Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(3), the term  ``external wall'' includes any wall that has one face exposed to the  weather, earth, or an abutting wall of an adjacent building. The term  ``external wall'' also includes a shared wall (i.e., a single wall  shared with an adjacent building), generally referred to as a ``party  wall,'' provided that the shared wall has no windows or doors in any  portion of the wall that does not have one face exposed to the weather,  earth, or an abutting wall. In general, the term ``external wall''  includes only those external walls that form part of the outline or  perimeter of the building or that surround an uncovered courtyard.  Therefore, the walls of an uncovered internal shaft, designed solely to  bring light or air into the center of a building, which are completely  surrounded by external walls of the building and which enclose space not  designated for occupancy or other use by people (other than for  maintenance or emergency), are not considered external walls. Thus, for  example, a wall of a light well in the center of a building is not an  external wall. However, walls surrounding an outdoor space which is  usable by people, such as a courtyard, are external walls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Definition of internal structural framework. For purposes of  this section, the term ``internal structural framework'' includes all  load-bearing internal walls and any other internal structural supports,  including the columns, girders, beams, trusses, spandrels, and all other  members that are essential to the stability of the building.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> shall also apply to determine  whether internal structural framework of the building is retained in  place.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Effect of additions. If an existing external wall is converted  into an internal wall (i.e., a wall that is not an external wall), the  wall is not retained in place as an external wall for purposes of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (b)(3) may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Taxpayer A rehabilitated a building all of the walls of  which consisted of wood siding attached to gypsum board sheets (which  covered the supporting elements of the wall, i.e., studs). A covered the  existing wood siding with aluminum siding as part of   a rehabilitation that otherwise qualified under this subparagraph. The  addition of the aluminum siding does not affect the status of the  existing external walls as external walls and they would be considered  to have been retained in place.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Taxpayer B rehabilitated a building, the external walls  of which had a masonry curtain. The masonry on the wall face was  replaced with a glass curtain. The steel beam and girders supporting the  existing masonry curtain were retained in place. The walls of the  building are considered to be retained in place as external walls,  notwithstanding the replacement of the curtain.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Taxpayer C rehabilitated a building that has two external  walls measuring 75[foot] x 20[foot] and two other external walls  measuring 100[foot] x 20[foot]. C demolished one of the larger walls,  including its supporting elements and constructed a new wall. Because  one of the larger walls represents more than 25 percent of the area of  the building's external walls, C has not satisfied the requirements that  75 percent of the existing external walls must be retained in place as  either internal or external walls. If however, C had not demolished the  wall, but had converted it into an internal wall (e.g., by building a  new external wall), the building would satisfy the external wall  requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in example 3, except that C  does not tear down any walls, but builds an addition that results in one  of the smaller walls becoming an internal wall. In addition, C enlarged  8 of the existing windows on one of the larger walls, increasing them  from a size of 3[foot] x 4[foot] to 6[foot] x 8[foot]. Since the smaller  wall accounts for less than 25 percent of the total wall area, C has  satisfied the requirement that 75 percent of the existing external walls  must be retained in place as external walls in the rehabilitation  process. The enlargement of the existing windows on the larger wall does  not affect its status as an external wall.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Taxpayer D rehabilitated a building that was in the  center of a row of three buildings. The building being rehabilitated by  D shares its side walls with the buildings on either side. The shared  walls measure 100[foot] x 20[foot] and the rear and front walls measure  75[foot] x 20[foot]. As part of a rehabilitation, D tears down and  replaces the front wall. Because the shared walls as well as the front  and back walls are considered external walls and the front wall accounts  for less than 25 percent of the total external wall area (including the  shared walls), D has satisfied the requirement that 75 percent of the  existing external walls must be retained in place as external walls in  the rehabilitation process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Age requirement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Property placed in service  after December 31, 1986. Except in the case of property that qualifies  for the transition rules in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) (B) or (C) of this  section, a building other than a certified historic structure shall not  be considered a qualified rehabilitated building unless the building was  first placed in service (within the meaning of Sec.  1.46-3(d)) before  January 1, 1936.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> or (C) of this section, a  building other than a certified historic structure is considered a  qualified rehabilitated building only if a period of at least 30 years  has elasped between the date physical work on the rehabilitation of the  building began and the date the building was first placed in service  (within the meaning of Sec.  1.46-3(d)) as a building by any person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Additions. A building that was first placed in service before  1936 in the case described in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section, or  at least 30 years before physical work on the rehabilitation began in  the case described in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section, will not  be disqualified because additions to such building have been added since  1936 in the case described in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section, or  are less than 30 years old in the case described in paragraph  (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section. Such additions, however, shall not be  treated as part of the qualified rehabilitated building. The term  ``addition'' means any construction that resulted in any portion of an  external wall becoming an internal wall, that resulted in an increase in  the height of the building, or that increased the volume of the  building.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Vacant periods. The determinations required by paragraph  (b)(4)(i) of this section include periods during which a building was  vacant or devoted to a personal use and is computed without regard to  the number of owners or the identify of owners during the period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Location at which the rehabilitation occurs. A building, other  than a certified historic structure is not a qualified rehabilitated  building unless it has been located where it is rehabilitated   since before 1936 in the case described in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of  this section. Similarly, in the case described in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B)  of this section, a building, other than a certified historic structure,  is not a qualified rehabilitation building unless it has been located  where it is rehabilitated for the thirty-year period immediately  preceding the date physical work on the rehabilitation began in the case  of a ``30-year building'' or the forty-year period immediately preceding  the date physical work on the rehabilitation began in the case of a  ``40-year building.''

For purposes of this section, ``physical work on a  rehabilitation'' begins when actual construction, or destruction in  preparation for construction, begins. The term ``physical work on a  rehabilitation,'' however, does not include preliminary activities such  as planning, designing, securing financing, exploring, researching,  developing plans and specifications, or stabilizing a building to  prevent deterioration (e.g., placing boards over broken windows).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definition of qualified rehabilitation expenditures--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(7) of this  section, the term ``qualified rehabilitation expenditure'' means any  amount that is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Properly chargeable to capital account (as described in  paragraph (c)(2) of this section),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Incurred by the taxpayer after December 31, 1981 (as described  in paragraph (c)(3) of this section),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For property for which depreciation is allowable under section  168 and which is real property described in paragraph (c)(4) of this  section, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Made in connection with the rehabilitation of a qualified  rehabilitated building (as described in paragraph (c)(5) of this  section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.

Qualified  rehabilitation expenditures are incurred by the taxpayer for purposes of  this section on the date such expenditures would be considered incurred  under an accrual method of accounting, regardless of the method of  accounting used by the taxpayer with respect to other items of income  and expense. If qualified rehabilitation expenditures are treated as  having been incurred by a taxpayer under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this  section, the taxpayer shall be treated as having incurred the  expenditures on the date such expenditures were incurred by the  transferor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii))</em> allocable to the acquired property, provided  that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The building, or the portion of the building, acquired by the  taxpayer was not used (or, if later, was not placed in service (as  defined in paragraph (f)(2) of this section)) after the rehabilitation  expenditures were incurred and prior to the date of acquisition, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No credit with respect to such qualified rehabilitation  expenditures is claimed by anyone other than the taxpayer acquiring the  property.

(See  paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section.) (See paragraph (b)(2)(vii) for  rules concerning the application of the substantial rehabilitation test  when expenditures are treated as incurred by the taxpayer.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In 1981, A, a taxpayer using the cash receipts and  disbursements method of accounting, commenced the rehabilitation of a  30-year old building. In June 1981, A signed   a contract with a plumbing contractor for replacement of the plumbing in  the building. A agreed to pay the contractor as soon as the work was  completed. The work was completed in December 1981, but A did not pay  the amount due until January 15, 1982. The expenditures for the plumbing  are not qualified rehabilitation expenditures (within the meaning of  this paragraph (c)) because they were not incurred under an accrual  method of accounting after December 31, 1981.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. B incurred qualified rehabilitation expenditures of  $300,000 with respect to an existing building between January 1, 1982,  and May 15, 1982, and then sold the building to C on June 1, 1982. The  portion of the building to which the expenditures were allocable was not  used by B or any other person during the period from January 1, 1982, to  June 1, 1982, and neither B nor any other person claimed the credit.  Consequently, C will be treated as having incurred the expenditures on  the dates that B incurred the expenditures.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. D, a taxpayer using the cash receipts and disbursements  method of accounting, begins the rehabilitation of a building on January  11, 1982. Prior to May 1, 1982, D makes rehabilitation expenditures of  $16,000. On May 3, 1982, D sells the building, the land, and the  property attributable to the rehabilitation expenditures to E for  $35,000. The purchase price is properly allocable as follows:  Land...........................................................   $5,000 Existing building..............................................   11,000 Property attributable to rehabilitation expenditures...........   19,000</p><p class="depth0">--------</p><p class="depth0">Total purchase price.....................................   35,000</p><p class="depth0">The property attributable to the rehabilitation expenditures is  placed in service by E on September 5, 1982. E may treat a portion of  the $35,000 purchase price as rehabilitation expenditures paid or  incurred by him. Since the rehabilitation expenditures paid by D  ($16,000) are less than the portion of the purchase price properly  allocable to property attributable to these expenditures ($19,000), E  may treat only $16,000 as rehabilitation expenditures paid or incurred  by him. The excess of the purchase price allocable to rehabilitation  expenditures ($19,000) over the rehabilitation expenditures paid by D  ($16,000), or $3,000, is treated as the cost of acquiring an interest in  the building and is not a qualified rehabilitation expenditure treated  as incurred by E.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in example 3, except that the  purchase price properly allocable to the property attributable to  rehabilitation expenditures is $15,000. Under these circumstances, E may  treat only $15,000 of D's $16,000 expenditures as rehabilitation  expenditures paid by D. The excess of the rehabilitation expenditures  paid by D ($16,000) over the purchase price allocable to rehabilitation  expenditures ($15,000), or $1,000, is treated as the cost of acquiring  an interest in the building and is not a qualified rehabilitation  expenditure treated as incurred by E.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Incurred for depreciable real property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Property placed in  service after December 31, 1986.

In the case of property placed  in service before January 1, 1987, and property placed in service after  December 31, 1986, that qualifies for the transition rules in paragraph  (a)(2)(iv) (B) or (C) of this section, an expenditure attributable to  such property shall be a qualified rehabilitation expenditure only if  such expenditure is incurred for property that is real property (or  additions or improvements to real property) with a recovery period  (within the meaning of section 168 as in effect prior to its amendment  by the Tax Reform Act of 1986) of 19 years (15 years for low-income  housing) and if the other requirements of this paragraph (c) are met.  For purposes of this section, an expenditure is incurred for recovery  property having a recovery period of 19 years only if the amount of the  expenditure is added to the basis of property which is 19-year real  property or 15-year real property in the case of low-income housing. For  purposes of this section,   the term ``low-income housing'' has the meaning given such term by  section 168(c)(2)(F) (as in effect prior to the amendments made by the  Tax Reform Act of 1986).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Made in connection with the rehabilitation of a qualified  rehabilitated building.

Expenditures  attributable to work done to facilities related to a building (e.g.,  sidewalk, parking lot, landscaping) are not considered made in  connection with the rehabilitation of a qualified rehabilitated  building.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> When expenditures may be incurred. An expenditure is a qualified  rehabilitation expenditure only if the building with respect to which  the expenditures are incurred is substantially rehabilitated (within the  meaning of paragraph (b)(2) of this section) for the taxable year in  which the property attributable to the expenditures is placed in service  (i.e., the building is substantially rehabilitated during a measuring  period ending with or within the taxable year in which a credit is  claimed). (See paragraph (f)(2) of this section for rules relating to  when property is placed in service.) Once the substantial rehabilitation  test is met for a taxable year, the amount of qualified rehabilitation  expenditures upon which a credit can be claimed for the taxable year is  limited to expenditures incurred:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Before the beginning of a measuring period during which the  building was substantially rehabilitated that ends with or within the  taxable year, provided that the expenditures were incurred in connection  with the rehabilitation process that resulted in the substantial  rehabilitation of the building;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Within a measuring period during which the building was  substantially rehabilitated that ends with or within the taxable year,  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> After the end of a measuring period during which the building  was substantially rehabilitated but prior to the end of the taxable year  with or within which the measuring period ends.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Certain expenditures excluded from qualified rehabilitation  expenditures.

In the case of expenditures attributable to property  placed in service before January 1, 1987, and property that qualifies  for the transition rules in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) (B) or (C) of this  section, the term ``qualified rehabilitation expenditure'' does not  include an expenditure with respect to which an election was not made  under section 168(b)(3) as in effect prior to its amendment by the Tax  Reform Act of 1986, to use the straight line method of depreciation. In  such case, the requirement that an election be made to use straight line  cost recovery applies only to the cost recovery of the portion of the  basis of a qualified rehabilitated building that is attributable to  qualified rehabilitation expenditures. See section 168(f)(1), as in  effect prior to its amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, for rules  relating to the use of different methods of cost recovery for different  components of a building. In addition, such requirement shall not apply  to any expenditure to the extent that section 168(f)(12) or (j), as in  effect prior to the amendments made by the Tax Reform Act of 1986,  applied to such expenditure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Cost of acquisition. For purposes of paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of  this section, cost of acquisition includes any interest incurred on  indebtedness the proceeds of which are attributable to the acquisition  of a building, an interest in a building, or land open which a building  exists. Interest incurred on a construction loan the proceeds of which  are used for qualified rehabilitation expenditures, however, is not  treated as a cost of acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Enlargement defined--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A building is enlarged to  the extent that the total volume of the building is increased. An  increase in floor space resulting from interior remodeling is not  considered an enlargement. The total volume of a building is generally  equal to the product of the floor area of the base of the building and  the height from the underside of the lowest floor (including the  basement) to the average height of the finished roof (as it exists or  existed). For this purpose, floor area is measured from the exterior  faces of external walls (other than shared walls that are external  walls) and from the centerline of shared walls that are external walls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rehabilitation that includes enlargement. If expenditures for  property only partially qualify as qualified rehabilitation expenditures  because some of the expenditures are attributable to the enlargement of  the building, the expenditures must be apportioned between the original  portion of the building and the enlargement. The expenditures must be  specifically allocated between the original portion of the building and  the enlargement to the extent possible. If it is not possible to make a  specific allocation of the expenditures, the expenditures must be  allocated to each portion on some reasonable basis. The determination of  a reasonable basis for an allocation depends on factors such as the type  of improvement and how the improvement relates functionally to the  building. For example, in the case of expenditures for an air- conditioning system or a roof, a reasonable basis for allocating the  expenditures among the two portions generally would be the volume of the  building, excluding the enlargement, served by the air-conditioning  system or the roof relative to the volume of the enlargement served by  the improvement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Rules applicable to rehabilitations of certified historic  structures--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definition of certified historic structure. The term  ``certified historic structure'' means any building (and its structural  components) that is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Listed in the National Register of Historic Places (``National  Register''); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> and the Department of Interior later  determines that the building is a certified historic structure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition of registered historic district.

The determination of the scope of a rehabilitation  shall be made on the basis of all the facts and circumstances  surrounding the rehabilitation and shall not be made solely on the basis  of ownership. The Secretary of the Interior shall take all of the  rehabilitation work performed as part of a single rehabilitation,  including any post-certification work, into account in determining  whether the rehabilitation complies with the Department of Interior  standards for rehabilitation and whether the certification should be  granted, revoked, or otherwise invalidated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Revoked or invalidated certification. If the Department of  Interior revokes or otherwise invalidates a certification after it has  been issued to a taxpayer, the basis attributable to rehabilitation of  the decertified property shall cease to be section 38 property described  in section 48(a)(1)(E). Such cessation shall be effective as of the date  the activity giving rise to the revocation or invalidation commenced.  See section 47 for the rules applicable to property that ceases to be  section 38 property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Special rule for certain buildings located in registered  historic districts. The exclusion in paragraph (c)(7)(iv) of this  section does not apply to a building in a registered historic district  if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such building was not a certified historic structure during the  rehabilitation process; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section. The certification  referred to in the previous sentence must be attached to the Form 3468  filed with the tax return for the year in which the credit is claimed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em>, the taxpayer must attach to the Form 3468 filed for  the taxable year in which the credit is claimed a statement that the  taxpayer in good faith did not know, or have reason to know, of an  intention to nominate the area in which the building is located as a  registered historic district.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Notice of certification--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as otherwise  provided in paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section, a taxpayer claiming  the credit for rehabilitation of a certified historic structure (within  the meaning of section 48(g)(3) and paragraph (d)(1) of this section)  must attach to the Form 3468 filed with the tax return for the taxable  year in which the credit is claimed a copy of the final certification of  completed work by the Secretary of the Interior, and for returns filed  after January 9, 1989, evidence that the building is a certified  historic structure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Late certification. If the final certification of completed  work has not been issued by the Secretary of the Interior at the time  the tax return is filed for a year in which the credit is claimed, a  copy of the first page of the Historic Preservation Certification  Application--Part 2--Description of Rehabilitation (NPS Form 10-168a),  with an indication that it has been received by the Department of the  Interior or its designate, together with proof that the building is a  certified historic structure (or that such status has been requested),  must be attached to the Form 3468 filed with the return. A notice from  the Department of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation  Officer, stating that the nomination or application has been received,  or a date-stamped nomination or application shall be sufficient  indication that the nomination or application has been received. The  building need not be either listed in the National Register or be  determined to be of historic significance to a registered historic  district at the time the return is filed for the year in which the  credit is claimed. (See paragraph (d)(1) of this section.) The taxpayer  must submit a copy of the final certification as an attachment to Form  3468 with the first income tax return filed after the receipt by the  taxpayer of the certification. If the final certification is denied by  the Department of Interior, the credit will be disallowed for any  taxable year in which it was claimed. If the taxpayer fails to receive  final certification of completed work prior to the date that is 30  months after the date that the taxpayer filed the tax return on which  the credit was claimed, the taxpayer must submit a written statement to  the District Director stating such fact prior to the last day of the  30th month, and the taxpayer shall be requested to consent to an  agreement under section   6501(c)(4) extending the period of assessment for any tax relating to  the time for which the credit was claimed. The procedure permitted by  the preceding sentence shall be used whenever the entire rehabilitation  project is not fully completed by the date that is 30 months after the  taxpayer filed the tax return upon which the credit was claimed (e.g., a  phased rehabilitation) and the Secretary of the Interior has thus not  yet certified the rehabilitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effective dates. Paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section applies  to returns for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2002. The  requirement in the fourth sentence of paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this  section applies only if the first income tax return filed after receipt  by the taxpayer of the certification is for a taxable year beginning  before January 1, 2002. For rules applicable to returns for taxable  years beginning after December 31, 2001, see paragraph (d)(7)(iv) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Returns for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of  this section and this paragraph (d)(7)(iv), a taxpayer claiming the  credit for rehabilitation of a certified historic structure (within the  meaning of section 47(c)(3) and paragraph (d)(1) of this section) for a  taxable year beginning after December 31, 2001, must provide with the  return for the taxable year in which the credit is claimed, the NPS  project number assigned by, and the date of the final certification of  completed work received from, the Secretary of the Interior. If a credit  (including a credit for a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2002)  is claimed under the late certification procedures of paragraph  (d)(7)(ii) of this section and the first income tax return filed by the  taxpayer after receipt of the certification is for a taxable year  beginning after December 31, 2001, the taxpayer must provide the NPS  project number assigned by, and the date of the final certification of  completed work received from, the Secretary of the Interior with that  return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The information  required under paragraph (d)(7)(iv)(A) of this section must be provided  on Form 3468 (or its successor) filed with the taxpayer's return. In  addition, the taxpayer must retain a copy of the final certification of  completed work for as long as its contents may become material in the  administration of any internal revenue law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Passthrough entities. In the case of a credit for qualified  rehabilitation expenditures of a partnership, S corporation, estate, or  trust, the requirements of this paragraph (d)(7)(iv) apply only to the  entity. Each partner, shareholder or beneficiary claiming a credit for  such qualified rehabilitation expenditures from a passthrough entity  must, however, provide the employer identification number of the entity  on Form 3468 (or its successor).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Adjustment to basis--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Except as otherwise  provided by this paragraph (e), if a credit is allowed with respect to  property attributable to qualified rehabilitation expenditures incurred  in connection with the rehabilitation of a qualified rehabilitated  building, the increase in the basis of the rehabilitated property that  would otherwise result from the qualified rehabilitation expenditures  must be reduced by the amount of the credit allowed. See section 48(q)  and the regulations there under for other rules concerning adjustments  to basis in the case of section 38 property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(iv)</em>  (B) or (C) of this section, and such property is attributable to  qualified rehabilitation expenditures incurred in connection with the  rehabilitation of a certified historic structure, the increase in the  basis of the rehabilitated property that would otherwise result from the  qualified rehabilitation expenditures must be reduced by one-half of the  amount of the credit allowed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Recapture of rehabilitation investment credit. If during any  taxable year there is a recapture amount determined with respect to any  credit that resulted in a basis adjustment under paragraph (e) (1) or  (2) of this section, the basis of such building (immediately   before the event resulting in such recapture) shall be increased by an  amount equal to such recapture amount. For purposes of the preceding  sentence, the term ``recapture amount'' means any increase in tax (or  adjustment in carrybacks or carryovers) determined under section  47(a)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Coordination with other provisions of the Code--(1) Credit  claimed by lessee for rehabilitation performed by lessor. A lessee may  take the credit for rehabilitation performed by the lessor if the  requirements of this section and section 48(d) are satisfied. For  purposes of applying section 48(d), the fair market value of section 38  property described in section 48(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(E)</em> shall be limited to that  portion of the lessor's basis in the qualified rehabilitated building  that is attributable to qualified rehabilitation expenditures. In the  case of a portion of a building that is divided into more than one  leasehold interest, the qualified rehabilitation expenditures  attributable to the common elements shall be allocated to the individual  leasehold interests in accordance with the principles of paragraph  (c)(10)(ii) of this section. Furthermore, a leasehold interest's share  of the common elements shall not be considered to have been placed in  service prior to the time that the particular leasehold interest is  placed in service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> in that taxable year or a  prior taxable year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the  requirement of section 48(g)(1)(A)(iii) and paragraph (b)(3) of this  section, relating to the definition of a qualified rehabilitated  building shall be deemed to be met if the taxpayer reasonably expects  that no rehabilitation work undertaken during the remainder of the  rehabilitation process will result in a failure to satisfy the  requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. If the requirements of  paragraph (b)(3) of this section, are not satisfied, however, the credit  shall be disallowed for the taxable year in which it was claimed. If a  taxpayer fails to complete physical work on the rehabilitation prior to  the date that is 30 months after the date that the taxpayer filed a tax  return on which the credit is claimed, the taxpayer must submit a  written statement to the District Director stating such fact prior to  the last day of the 30th month, and shall be requested to consent to an  agreement under section 6501(c)(4) extending the period of assessment  for any tax relating to the item for which the credit was claimed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 38 property described in section 48(a)(1)(E). In the  case of section 38 property described in section 48(a)(1)(E), the  section 38 property is not the building. Instead, the section 38  property is the portion of the basis of the building that is  attributable to qualified rehabilitation expenditures. Therefore, for  example, for purposes of the determination of when such section 38  property is placed in service, a determination must be made regarding  when property attributable to the portion of the basis of the building  attributable to qualified rehabilitation expenditures is placed in  service. The issue of when the building is placed in service is thus   not relevant. In fact, under this test, the building itself may never  have been taken out of service during the rehabilitation process. If the  building is rehabilitated over several years in stages (e.g., by  floors), section 38 property attributable to qualified rehabilitation  expenditures to a qualified rehabilitated building placed in service in  each taxable year shall, generally, be treated as a separate item of  section 38 property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The application of this paragraph (f)(2) may be  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Assume that A, a calendar year taxpayer, purchases a four- story building on January 1, 1983, for $100,000, and incurs $10,000 of  qualified rehabilitation expenditures in 1983 to rehabilitate floor one,  $50,000 of qualified rehabilitation expenditures in 1984 to rehabilitate  floor two, $70,000 of qualified rehabilitation expenditures in 1985 to  rehabilitate floor three, and $60,000 of qualified rehabilitation  expenditures in 1986 to rehabilitate floor four. Assume further that A  places the property attributable to these expenditures in service on the  last day of the year in which the respective expenditures were incurred  and that the building is never taken out of service since as each floor  is rehabilitated, the other three floors are occupied by tenants. Under  the rule in this paragraph (f)(2), the portion of the basis of the  building that is attributable to qualified rehabilitation expenditures  incurred with respect to floor one and two are deemed to be placed in  service in 1985, because that is the first year that the substantial  rehabilitation test described in paragraph (b) of this section is met  ($120,000 of expenditures incurred by A during a measuring period ending  on December 31, 1985 is greater than the $110,000 basis at the beginning  of the period). Assume that as of December 31, 1985, at least 75 percent  of the external walls of the building have been retained during the  rehabilitation process and that A has a reasonable expectation that no  work during the remainder of the rehabilitation process will result in  less than 75 percent of the external walls being retained. A may claim a  credit for A's 1985 taxable year on $130,000 of qualified rehabilitation  expenditures ($10,000 in 1983, $50,000 in 1984, and $70,000 in 1985).  (See paragraph (c)(6) of this section for rules applicable to when  qualified expenditures may be incurred. In addition, see section 46 (d)  and Sec.  1.46-5 for rules relating to qualified progress expenditures.)  The fact that the building was a qualified rehabilitated building for  A's 1985 taxable year, however, has no effect on whether the building is  a qualified rehabilitated building for A's 1986 taxable year. In order  to determine whether A is entitled to claim a credit on A's 1986 return  for the $60,000 of qualified rehabilitation expenditures incurred in  1986, A must select a measuring period ending in 1986 and must determine  whether the building is a qualified rehabilitated building for that  year. Solely for purposes of determining whether the building was  substantially rehabilitated, expenditures incurred in 1984 and 1985,  even though considered in determining whether the building was  substantially rehabilitated for A's 1985 taxable year, may be used in  addition to the expenditures incurred in 1986 to determine whether the  building was substantially rehabilitated for A's 1986 taxable year,  provided the expenditures were incurred during any measuring period  selected by A that ends in 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Coordination with section 47. If property described in section  48(a)(1)(E) is disposed of by the taxpayer, or otherwise ceases to be  ``section 38 property,'' section 47 may apply. Property will cease to be  section 38 property, and therefore section 47 may apply, in any case in  which the Department of Interior revokes or otherwise invalidates a  certification of rehabilitation after the property is placed in service  or a building (other than a certified historic structure) is moved from  the place where it is rehabilitated after the property is placed in  service. If, for example, the taxpayer made modifications to the  building inconsistent with Department of Interior standards, the  Secretary of the Interior might revoke the certification. In addition,  if all or a portion of a substantially rehabilitated building becomes  tax-exempt use property (see paragraph (c)(7)(vi) of this section) for  the first time within five years after the credit is claimed, the credit  will be recaptured under section 47 at that time as if the building or  portion of the building which becomes tax-exempt use property had then  been sold.
