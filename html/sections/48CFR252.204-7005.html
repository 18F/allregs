Reading aloud the first paragraph of Standard Form 312, Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement, in the presence of a person designated by the Contractor for this purpose, and a witness, will satisfy this requirement. Contractor employees currently cleared for access to TS, SAP, or SCI may attest orally to their security responsibilities when being briefed into a new program or during their annual refresher briefing. There is no requirement to retain a separate record of the oral attestation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an employee refuses to attest orally to security responsibilities, the Contractor shall deny the employee access to classified information and shall submit a report to the Contractor's security activity.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)
