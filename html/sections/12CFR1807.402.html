                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Acquisition with or without rehabilitation. Housing that is for Homeownership purchase must meet the affordability requirements of this subsection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The housing must be Single-family housing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The housing price does not exceed 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area as used in the HOME Program and as determined by the applicable Participating Jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The housing must be purchased by a qualifying family as set forth in Sec.  1807.400. The housing must be the principal residence of the family throughout the period described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Periods of Affordability. Housing under this subsection must meet the affordability requirements for at least 10 years at the time of purchase by the homeowner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Resale. To ensure that CMF awards are being used for qualifying families for the entire 10-year affordability period, recoupment and redeployment or resale strategies must be imposed by the Awardee. A recoupment strategy must ensure that, in the event the qualifying homeowner sells the housing before the end of the 10-year affordability period and the new homeowner does not meet the affordability qualifications set forth in Sec.  1807.400, the portion of the CMF award used to finance the Affordable Housing Activity is recouped and redeployed to a qualifying family for affordable housing homeownership in the manner set forth in Sec.  1807.402, except that the housing must meet the affordability requirements only for the remaining affordability period. The Awardee may design and implement its own recoupment strategy. Deed restrictions, covenants running with the land, or other similar mechanisms may be used as the mechanism to impose the resale strategy. The Awardee shall report to the CDFI Fund the event of resale, recoupment and redeployment of the CMF award in the manner described in the Assistance Agreement. The affordability restrictions may terminate upon occurrence of any of the following termination events: Foreclosure, transfer in lieu of foreclosure or assignment of an FHA-insured mortgage to HUD. The Awardee may use purchase options, rights of first refusal or other preemptive rights to purchase the housing before foreclosure to preserve affordability. The affordability restrictions shall be revived according to the original terms if, during the original affordability period, the owner of record before the termination event, obtains an ownership interest in the housing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rehabilitation not involving acquisition. Housing that is currently owned by a qualifying family, as set forth in Sec.  1807.400, qualifies as Affordable Housing if it meets the requirements of this subsection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The estimated value of the housing, after Rehabilitation, does not exceed 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area, as used in the HOME Program and as determined by the applicable Participating Jurisdiction; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The housing is the principal residence of a qualifying family as set forth in Sec.  1807.400, at the time that CMF funding is Committed to the housing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Housing under this subsection must meet the affordability requirements for at least 10 years after Rehabilitation is completed or meet the resale provisions of Sec.  1807.402(a)(5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ownership interest. The ownership in the housing assisted under this section must meet the definition of ``Homeownership'' as defined in Sec.  1807.104(z).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> New construction without acquisition. Newly constructed housing that is built on property currently owned by a family which will occupy the housing upon completion, qualifies as Affordable Housing if it meets the requirements under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Converting rental units to Homeownership units for existing tenants. CMF-funded rental units may be converted to Homeownership units by selling, donating, or otherwise conveying the units to the existing tenants to enable the tenants to become homeowners in accordance with the requirements of Sec.  1807.402. The Homeownership units are subject to a minimum period of affordability equal to the remaining affordability period.</p>
