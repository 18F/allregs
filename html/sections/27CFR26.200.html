Articles coming into the United States from the Virgin Islands, except as provided in Sec. 26.201, are subject to tax on the liquors contained therein at the rates imposed in the United States on like liquors of domestic production.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The excise taxes collected on distilled spirits and articles containing distilled spirits shall be deposited into the Treasury of the Virgin Islands only if at least 92 percent of the alcoholic content of such product is rum. The amount deposited into the Treasury of the Virgin Islands shall not exceed the lesser of $10.50, or the rate imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001(a)(1) (including adjustments to the effective tax rate under 26 U.S.C. 5010), on each proof gallon of

such distilled spirits or article containing distilled spirits coming into the United States. Such excise tax payments to the Treasury of the Virgin Islands will be reduced by one percent and the estimated amount of refunds or credits, and may be further reduced by certain amounts deposited to the U.S. Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. The moneys so transferred and paid over shall constitute a separate fund in the Treasury of the Virgin Islands, and may be expended as the Virgin Islands legislature may determine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except for products described in 26 U.S.C. 7652(c), no excise taxes shall be deposited into the Treasury of the Virgin Islands if an excise tax subsidy is provided by the Virgin Islands that is of a kind different from, or in an amount per value or volume of production greater than, any subsidy offered by the Virgin Islands to industries manufacturing products not subject to Federal excise tax.
