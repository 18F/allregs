Subject to the 10 percent limit described in paragraph (c) of this  section, a State may receive Federal funds at the enhanced FMAP for 4  categories of non-primary expenditures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Administrative expenditures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Outreach;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Health initiatives; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Certain other child health assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Federal payment. Federal payment will not be available based on  a State's non-primary expenditures for a fiscal year which exceed the 10  percent limit of the total of expenditures under the plan, as specified  in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> 10 Percent Limit. The 10 percent limit is--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applied on an annual fiscal year basis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Calculated based on the total computable expenditures claimed by  the State on quarterly expenditure reports submitted for a fiscal year.  Expenditures claimed on a quarterly report for a different fiscal year  may not be used in the calculation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Calculated using the following formula:  L10% = (a1 + u2 + u3)/9;  L10% = 10 Percent Limit for a fiscal year a1 = Total computable amount of expenditures for the fiscal year under</p><p class="depth3">section 2105(a)(1) of the Act for which Federal payments are</p><p class="depth3">available at the enhanced FMAP described in Section 2105(b) of</p><p class="depth3">the Act; u2 = Total computable expenditures for medical assistance for which</p><p class="depth3">Federal payments are made during the fiscal year based on the</p><p class="depth3">enhanced FMAP described in sections 1905(b) and 2105(b) of the</p><p class="depth3">Act for individuals described in section 1905(u)(2) of the</p><p class="depth3">Act; and u3 = Total computable expenditures for medical assistance for which</p><p class="depth3">Federal payments are made during the fiscal year based on the</p><p class="depth3">enhanced FMAP described in sections 1905(b) and 2105(b) of the</p><p class="depth3">Act for individuals described in section 1905(u)(3) of the</p><p class="depth3">Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The expenditures under section 2105(a)(2) of the Act that are  subject to the 10 percent limit are applied--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On an annual fiscal year basis; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Against the 10 percent limit in the fiscal year for which the  State submitted a quarterly expenditure report including the  expenditures. Expenditures claimed on a quarterly report for one fiscal  year may not be applied against the 10 percent limit for any other  fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The 10 percent limit for a fiscal year, as calculated under  paragraph (c)(3) of this section, may be no greater than 10 percent of  the total computable amount (determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this  section) of the State allotment or allotments available in that fiscal  year. Therefore, the 10 percent limit is the lower of the amount  calculated under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and 10 percent of the  total computable amount of the State allotment available in that fiscal  year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As used in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the total  computable amount of a State's allotment for a fiscal year is determined  by dividing the State's allotment for the fiscal year by the State's  enhanced FMAP for the year. For example, if a State allotment for a  fiscal year is $65 million and the enhanced FMAP rate for the fiscal  year is 65 percent, the total computable amount of the allotment for the  fiscal year is $100 million ($65 million/.65). In this example, the 10  percent limit may be no greater than a total computable amount of $10  million (10 percent of $100 million).
