The  Commissioner will publish in this part all known prior sanctions. Any  interested person may submit to the Commissioner a request for  publication of a prior sanction, supported by evidence to show that it  falls within section 201(s)(4) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Based upon scientific data or information that shows that use of  a prior-sanctioned food ingredient may be injurious to health, and thus  in violation of section 402 of the Act, the Commissioner will establish  or amend an applicable prior sanction regulation to impose whatever  limitations or conditions are necessary for the safe use of the  ingredient, or to prohibit use of the ingredient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where appropriate, an emergency action level may be issued for a  prior-sanctioned substance, pending the issuance of a final regulation  in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Such an action level  shall be issued pursuant to section 402(a) of the Act to identify, based  upon available data, conditions of use of the substance that may be  injurious to health. Such an action level shall be issued in a notice  published in the Federal Register and shall be followed as soon as  practicable by a proposed regulation in accordance with paragraph (b) of  this section. Where the available data demonstrate that the substance  may be injurious at any level, use of the substance may be prohibited.  The identification of a prohibited substance may be made in part 189 of  this chapter when appropriate.
