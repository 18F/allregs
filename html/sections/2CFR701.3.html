                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> It is USAID policy that USAID may determine that a particular award is subject to vetting in the interest of national security. In that case, USAID may require vetting of the key individuals of applicants, including key personnel, whether or not they are employees of the applicant, first tier subrecipients, contractors, and any other class of subawards and procurements as identified in the assistance solicitation and resulting award. When USAID conducts partner vetting, it will not award to any applicant who determined ineligible by the vetting process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> When USAID determines an award to be subject to vetting, the agreement officer determines the appropriate stage of the award cycle to require applicants to submit the completed USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13, to the vetting official identified in the assistance solicitation. The agreement officer must specify in the assistance solicitation the stage at which the applicants will be required to submit the USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13. As a general matter those applicants who will be vetted will be typically the applicants that have been determined to be apparently successful.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Selection of the successful applicant proceeds separately from vetting. The agreement officer makes the selection determination separately from the vetting process and without knowledge of vetting-related information other than that, based on the vetting results, the apparently successful applicant is eligible or ineligible for an award. However, no applicants will be excluded from an award until after vetting has been completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> For those awards the agency has determined are subject to vetting, the agreement officer may only award to an applicant that has been determined to be eligible after completion of the vetting process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(1)</em> For those awards the agency has determined are subject to vetting, the recipient must submit the completed USAID Partner Information Form any time it changes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For those awards the agency has determined are subject to vetting, the recipient must submit the completed USAID Partner Information Form any time it changes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Key individuals; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Subrecipients and contractors for which vetting is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The recipient must submit the completed Partner Information Form within 15 days of the change in either paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> USAID may vet key individuals of the recipient, subrecipients and contractors periodically during program implementation using information already submitted on the Form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> When the prime recipient is subject to vetting, vetting may be required for key individuals of subawards when the prime recipient requests prior approval in accordance with 2 CFR 200.308(c)(6) for the subaward, transfer, or contracting out of any work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> When the prime recipient is subject to vetting, vetting may be required for key individuals of contractors of certain services. The agreement officer must identify these services in the assistance solicitation and any resulting award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When vetting of subawards is required, the agreement officer must not approve the subaward, transfer, or contracting out, or the procurement of certain classes of items until the organization subject to vetting has been determined eligible. When vetting of contractors is required, the recipient may not procure the identified services until the contractor has been determined to be eligible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> The recipient may instruct prospective subrecipients or, when applicable contractors who are subject to vetting to submit the USAID Partner Information Form to the vetting official as soon as the recipient submits the USAID Partner Information Form for its key individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Pre-award provision and award term.

Sec. Appendix B to Part 701--Partner Vetting Pre-Award Requirements and</p><p class="depth0">Award Term</p><p class="depth0">Partner Vetting Pre-Award Requirements</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> USAID has determined that any award resulting from this assistance solicitation is subject to vetting. An applicant that has not passed vetting is ineligible for award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The following are the vetting procedures for this solicitation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prospective applicants review the attached USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13, and submit any questions about the USAID Partner Information Form or these procedures to the agreement officer by the deadline in the solicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The agreement officer notifies the applicant when to submit the USAID Partner Information Form. For this solicitation, USAID will vet [insert in the provision the applicable stage of the selection process at which the Agreement Officer will notify the applicant(s) who must be vetted]. Within the timeframe set by the agreement officer in the notification, the applicant must complete and submit the USAID Partner Information Form to the vetting official. The designated vetting official is:
Vetting official:_______________________________________________________
Address:________________________________________________________________
Email:__________________________________________________________________(for inquiries only).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The applicants must notify proposed subrecipients and contractors of this requirement when the subrecipients or contractors are subject to vetting.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Applicants who submit using non-secure methods of transmission do so at their own risk.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Selection proceeds separately from vetting. Vetting is conducted independently from any discussions the agreement officer may have with an applicant. The applicant and any proposed subrecipient or contractor subject to vetting must not provide vetting information to anyone other than the vetting official. The applicant and any proposed subrecipient or contractor subject to vetting will communicate only with the vetting official regarding their vetting submission(s) and not with any other USAID or USG personnel, including the agreement officer or the agreement officer's representatives. The agreement officer designates the vetting official as the only individual authorized to clarify the applicant's and proposed subrecipient's and contractor's vetting information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(1)</em> The vetting official notifies the applicant that it: (i) Is eligible based on the vetting results, (ii) is ineligible based on the vetting results, or (iii) must provide additional information, and resubmit the USAID

Partner Information Form with the additional information within the number of days the vetting official specified in the notification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The vetting official notifies the applicant that it: (i) Is eligible based on the vetting results, (ii) is ineligible based on the vetting results, or (iii) must provide additional information, and resubmit the USAID

Partner Information Form with the additional information within the number of days the vetting official specified in the notification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The vetting official will coordinate with the agency that provided the data being used for vetting prior to notifying the applicant or releasing any information. In any determination for release of information, the classification and sensitivity of the information, the need to protect sources and methods, and the status of ongoing law enforcement and intelligence community investigations or operations will be taken into consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Reconsideration: (1) Within 7 calendar days after the date of the vetting official's notification, an applicant that vetting has determined to be ineligible may request in writing to the vetting official that the Agency reconsider the vetting determination. The request should include any written explanation, legal documentation and any other relevant written material for reconsideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Within 7 calendar days after the vetting official receives the request for reconsideration, the Agency will determine whether the applicant's additional information merits a revised decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Agency's determination of whether reconsideration is warranted is final.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Revisions to vetting information: (1) Applicants who change key individuals, whether the applicant has previously been determined eligible or not, must submit a revised USAID Partner Information Form to the vetting official. This includes changes to key personnel resulting from revisions to the technical portion of the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The vetting official will follow the vetting process of this provision for any revision of the applicant's Form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Award. At the time of award, the agreement officer will confirm with the vetting official that the apparently successful applicant is eligible after vetting. The agreement officer may award only to an apparently successful applicant that is eligible after vetting.</p><p class="depth0">Partner Vetting</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The recipient must comply with the vetting requirements for key individuals under this award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions: As used in this provision, ``key individual,'' ``key personnel,'' and ``vetting official'' have the meaning contained in 22 CFR 701.1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The Recipient must submit within 15 days a USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13, to the vetting official identified below when the Recipient replaces key individuals with individuals who have not been previously vetted for this award. Note: USAID will not approve any key personnel who are not eligible for approval after vetting. The designated vetting official is:
Vetting official:_______________________________________________________
Address:________________________________________________________________
Email:__________________________________________________________________(for inquiries only).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(1)</em> The vetting official will notify the Recipient that it--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The vetting official will notify the Recipient that it--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is eligible based on the vetting results,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is ineligible based on the vetting results, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Must provide additional information, and resubmit the USAID Partner Information Form with the additional information within the number of days the vetting official specifies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The vetting official will include information that USAID determines releasable. USAID will determine what information may be released consistent with applicable law and Executive Orders, and with the concurrence of relevant agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The inability to be deemed eligible as described in this award term may be determined to be a material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award and may subject the recipient to suspension or termination as specified in the subpart ``Remedies for Noncompliance'' at 2 CFR part 200.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Reconsideration: (1) Within 7 calendar days after the date of the vetting official's notification, the recipient or prospective subrecipient or contractor that has not passed vetting may request in writing to the vetting official that the Agency reconsider the vetting determination. The request should include any written explanation, legal documentation and any other relevant written material for reconsideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Within 7 calendar days after the vetting official receives the request for reconsideration, the Agency will determine whether the recipient's additional information merits a revised decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Agency's determination of whether reconsideration is warranted is final.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> A notification that the Recipient has passed vetting does not constitute any other approval under this award.</p><p class="depth0">Alternate I. When subrecipients will be subject to vetting, add the following paragraphs to the basic award term:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> When the prime recipient anticipates that it will require prior approval for a subaward in accordance with 2 CFR 200.308(c)(6) the subaward is subject to vetting. The prospective subrecipient must submit a USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13, to the vetting official identified in paragraph (c) of this provision. The agreement officer must not approve a subaward to any organization that has not passed vetting when required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The recipient agrees to incorporate the substance of paragraphs (a) through (i) of this award term in all first tier subawards under this award.</p><p class="depth0">Alternate II. When specific classes of services are subject to vetting, add the following paragraph:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Prospective contractors at any tier providing the following classes of services________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________must pass vetting. Recipients must not procure these services until they receive confirmation from the vetting official that the prospective contractor has passed vetting.
