                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Interest. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Presidio Trust will assess interest on all  delinquent debts unless prohibited by statute, regulation or contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interest begins to accrue on all debts from the date the debt  becomes delinquent. The Presidio Trust will waive collection of interest  on that portion of the debt that is paid within   30 days after the date on which interest begins to accrue. The Presidio  Trust will assess interest at the rate established by the Treasury  Department under 31 U.S.C. 3717, unless a different rate is established  by a contract, repayment agreement or statute. The Presidio Trust will  notify the debtor of the basis for the interest rate assessed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Penalty. The Presidio Trust will assess a penalty of not more  than 6% a year, or such other higher rate as authorized by law, on any  portion of a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Administrative costs. The Presidio Trust will assess charges to  cover administrative costs incurred as a result of the debtor's failure  to pay a debt. The Presidio Trust will waive collection of  administrative costs on that portion of the debt that is paid within 30  days after the date on which the administrative costs begin to accrue.  Administrative costs include the costs of processing and handling a  debt, obtaining a credit report, using a private collection contractor,  costs of a hearing including, the costs of a hearing officer, and  service fees charged by a Federal agency for collection activities  undertaken on behalf of the Presidio Trust.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Allocation of payments. A partial or installment payment by a  debtor will be applied first to outstanding penalty assessments, second  to administrative costs, third to accrued interest, and fourth to  outstanding debt principal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Additional authority. The Presidio Trust may have additional  policies, guidelines and procedures regarding how interest, penalties  and administrative costs are assessed on particular types of debts. The  Presidio Trust will explain in the notice to the debtor described in  Sec. 1011.4 of this part how interest, penalties, administrative costs  and other charges are assessed, unless the requirements are included in  a contract or repayment agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Waiver. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Presidio Trust may waive collection of all or  part of accrued interest, penalties and administrative costs when it  would be against equity and good conscience or not in the Presidio  Trust's best interest to collect such charges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A decision to waive interest, penalties or administrative costs  may be made at any time before a debt is paid. However, unless otherwise  provided in these regulations, when these charges have been collected  before the waiver decision, they will not be refunded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Accrual during suspension of debt collection. In most cases,  interest, penalties and administrative costs will continue to accrue  during any period when collection has been suspended for any reason (for  example, when the debtor has requested a hearing). The Presidio Trust  may suspend accrual of any or all of these charges when accrual would be  against equity and good conscience or not in the Presidio Trust's best  interest.
