If the requested right-of-way will not adversely affect the United States' interest, the Regional Director may issue a letter stating that the interest of the United States to the right-of-way easement would not be affected provided there would be no objection to a right-of-way by the fee owner. If the interest of the United States will be affected, application for the right-of-way must be submitted in accordance with procedures set out in Sec.  29.21-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other lands outside the National Wildlife Refuge System.
