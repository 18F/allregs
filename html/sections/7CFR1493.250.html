                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Final application. An exporter who has received a letter of preliminary commitment may, within six months of the date of such letter, submit a final application to CCC for a facility payment guarantee which shall include the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A cover sheet with the title: ``Application for a Facility Payment Guarantee--Final Commitment.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A letterhead statement from the importer's bank or other documentation confirming the importer has the financial ability to comply with the initial payment requirement in Sec. 1493.230(c);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Written evidence of a firm sale signed by the exporter and the importer, specifying at minimum, the following information: Goods or services to be exported, quantities of such items, delivery terms (e.g., FOB, CFR, CIF), delivery period(s), contract value, payment terms, and date of sale. A sales contract may be contingent upon obtaining a facility payment guarantee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of any changes in the information submitted in the preliminary application; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The exporter's signature;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional information. CCC shall have the right to request the exporter to furnish any other information and documentation it deems pertinent to the evaluation of the exporter's final application for a final commitment.

CCC may request from the exporter an independent engineering study or economic feasibility study relating to the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Final commitment letter. After making a favorable determination on the exporter's submissions, CCC will issue a final commitment letter indicating the applicable exposure fee rate and stating that CCC is prepared to issue a facility payment guarantee upon receiving full payment of the exposure fee within an allotted time. The letter will also indicate the key terms and coverage of the guarantee to be issued. CCC will also inform exporters in writing when it denies their request for a facility payment guarantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exposure fee. The exposure fee is calculated by multiplying the requested guaranteed value (up to the maximum established by CCC's final commitment letter) by the exposure fee rate. Once the facility payment guarantee is issued to the exporter, CCC will ordinarily not refund the exposure fee. If CCC does not issue a facility payment guarantee, or issues a guarantee for only part of the coverage requested, CCC will make a full or pro rata refund of the exposure fee, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Issuance of the facility payment guarantee. Upon receipt of the exposure fee, CCC will issue a facility payment guarantee.</p>
