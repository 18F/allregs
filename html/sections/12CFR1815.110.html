                            <p class="depth0">The CEQ regulations provide for the categorical exclusion of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment (40 CFR 1508.4). Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an EIS is required for such actions. An action which falls into one of the categories below may still require the preparation of an EIS or environmental assessment if the designated Fund official determines it meets the criteria stated in Sec. 1815.109 or involves extraordinary circumstances that may have a significant environmental effect. The Fund has determined the following categorical exclusions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Actions directly related to the administration or operation of the Fund (e.g. personnel actions, including, but not limited to, staff recruitment and training; purchase of goods and services for the Fund, including, but not limited to, furnishings, equipment, supplies and services; space acquisition; property management; and security);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Actions directly related to and implementing proposals for which an environmental assessment or an environmental assessment and EIS have been prepared;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Actions directly related to the granting or receipt of Bank Enterprise Act awards pursuant to part 1806 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Actions directly related to training and/or technical assistance;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Projects for the acquisition, disposition, rehabilitation and/or modernization of 500 existing housing units or less when all the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unit density is not increased more than 20 percent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Project does not involve changes in land use from nonresidential to residential;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The estimated cost of rehabilitation is less than 75 percent of the total estimated cost of replacement after rehabilitation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Project does not involve the demolition of one or more buildings containing the primary use served by the project that, together, have more than 20 percent of the square footage of the Project;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Projects for the construction of 200 housing units or less when all the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Project does not involve changes in existing land use from nonresidential to residential; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Project does not involve the demolition of one or more buildings containing the primary use served by the project that, together, have more than 20 percent of the square footage of the Project;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Projects for the acquisition, disposition, rehabilitation and/or modernization of 200,000 square feet or less of existing commercial space when all the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Project does not involve changes in existing land use from residential to nonresidential;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The estimated cost of rehabilitation is less than 75 percent of the total estimated cost of replacement after rehabilitation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Project does not involve the demolition of more than 10,000 square feet of commercial space containing the primary use served by the Project;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Projects for the construction of 100,000 square feet or less of commercial space when all the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Project does not involve changes in existing land use from residential to nonresidential: and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Project does not involve the demolition of more than 10,000 square feet of commercial space containing the primary use served by the Project;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Projects for the acquisition of an existing structure, provided that the property to be acquired is in place and will be retained in the same use;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Projects involving Fund financial assistance of $1,000,000 or less;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Actions directly related to the provision of residential tenant-based rental assistance, Consumer Loans, health care, child care, educational, cultural and/or social services;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Actions involving Fund financial assistance that is used to increase the permanent capital and/or liquidity of an applicant;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Actions where no use of Federal funds is involved in the activity or Project; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Actions directly related to the provision of working capital, the acquisition of machinery and equipment or the purchase of inventory, raw materials or supplies.</p>
