If  reconsideration is granted, the case is reopened and the case is  reviewed on its merits (see Sec. 10.609).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)</em>, or where the request is  untimely and fails to present any clear evidence of error, OWCP will  deny the application for reconsideration without reopening the case for  a review on the merits. A decision denying an application for  reconsideration cannot be the subject of another application for  reconsideration. The only review for this type of non-merit decision is  an appeal to the ECAB (see Sec. 10.625), and OWCP will not entertain a  request for reconsideration or a hearing on this decision denying  reconsideration.</p>
