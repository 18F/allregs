                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any transfer of the property prior to an applicant's acceptance  into the program will void the offer of enrollment, unless at the option  of the State Conservationist or State Executive Director, as  appropriate, an offer is extended to the new landowner and the new  landowner agrees to the same easement or rental contract terms and  conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After acreage is accepted in the program, for easements with  multiple payments, any remaining easement payments will be made to the  original participant unless NRCS receives an assignment of proceeds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Future annual rental payments will be made to the successor  participant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The new landowner is responsible for complying with the terms of  the recorded easement, and the contract successor is responsible for  complying with the terms of the rental contract and for assuring  completion of all activities and practices required by any associated  restoration agreement. Eligible cost-share payments will be made to the  new participant upon presentation that the successor assumed the costs  of establishing the practices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> With respect to any and all payments owed to participants, the  United States bears no responsibility for any full payments or partial  distributions of funds between the original participant and the  participant's successor. In the event of a dispute or claim on the  distribution of cost-share payments, USDA may withhold payments, without  the accrual of interest, pending an agreement or adjudication on the  rights to the funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The rights granted to the United States in an easement will  apply to any of its agents or assigns. All obligations of the  participant under the GRP conservation easement deed also bind the  participant's heirs, successors, agents, assigns, lessees, and any other  person claiming under them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Rental contracts may be transferred to another landowner,  operator, or tenant that acquires an interest in the land enrolled in  GRP. The successor must be determined by FSA to be eligible to  participate in GRP and must assume full responsibility under the  contract. FSA may require a participant to refund all or a portion of  any financial assistance awarded under GRP, plus interest, if the  participant sells or loses control of the land under a GRP rental  contract, and the new landowner, operator, or tenant is not eligible to  participate in the program or declines to assume responsibility under  the contract.</p>
