                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In 1970, the Secretary of the Interior developed a policy  statement on intergovernmental cooperation in the preservation, use and  management of fish and wildlife resources. The purpose of the policy (36  FR 21034, Nov. 3, 1971) was to strengthen and support the missions of  the several States and the Department of the Interior respecting fish  and wildlife. Since development of the policy, a number of Congressional  enactments and court decisions have addressed State and Federal  responsibilities for fish and wildlife with the general effect of  expanding Federal jurisdiction over certain species and uses of fish and  wildlife traditionally managed by the States. In some cases, this  expansion of jurisdiction has established overlapping authorities,  clouded agency jurisdictions and, due to differing agency  interpretations and accountabilities, has contributed to confusion and  delays in the implementation of management programs. Nevertheless,  Federal authority exists for specified purposes while State authority  regarding fish and resident wildlife remains the comprehensive backdrop  applicable in the absence of specific, overriding Federal law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Secretary of the Interior reaffirms that fish and wildlife  must be maintained for their ecological, cultural, educational,  historical, aesthetic, scientific, recreational, economic, and social  values to the people of the United States, and that these resources are  held in public trust by the Federal and State governments for the  benefit of present and future generations of Americans. Because fish and  wildlife are fundamentally dependent upon habitats on private and public  lands managed or subject to administration by many Federal and State  agencies, and because provisions for the protection, maintenance and  enhancement of fish and wildlife and the regulation for their use are  established in many laws and regulations involving a multitude of  Federal and State administrative structures, the effective stewardship  of fish and wildlife requires the cooperation of the several States and  the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It is the intent of the Secretary to strengthen and support, to  the maximum legal extent possible, the missions of the States \1\ and  the Department of the Interior to conserve and manage effectively the  nation's fish and wildlife. It is, therefore, important that a  Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Policy be implemented to  coordinate and facilitate the efforts of   Federal and State agencies in the attainment of this objective. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\``States'' refers to all of the several States, the District of  Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Virgin  Islands, Guam, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, the  Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands and other territorial  possessions, and the constituent units of government upon which these  entities may have conferred authorities related to fish and wildlife  matters. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
