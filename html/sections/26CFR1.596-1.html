                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Example. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth2">Example. X Corporation, a domestic building and loan association,  determines the addition to its reserve for losses on qualifying real  property loans under section 593(b)(2) for its taxable year beginning in  1971. During that taxable year, X Corporation received a total of  $100,000 as dividends from domestic corporations subject to tax under  chapter 1 of the Code. X Corporation received no other dividends during  the taxable year. Under part VIII, subchapter B, chapter 1, subtitle A  of the Code, a deduction, determined without regard to section 596 and  this section, of $85,000 would be allowed with respect to the dividends.  For the taxable year, the applicable percentage, determined under  subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 593(b)(2), is 54 percent. Under  section 596 and this section, the amount allowed as a deduction under  section 243 and the regulations thereunder is reduced by $45,900 (54  percent of $85,000) to $39,100 ($85,000 less $45,900).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> applies to taxable years ending on or after  August 30, 1975.
