                                Sec. 15.1-1  Elections to deduct.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> is made by amended return shall apply  the recapture provisions of subsections (b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(B)</em>, (c), and (d) of  section 617.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Election to deduct under section 615--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General rule. The  election to deduct exploration expenditures under section 615 shall be  made in a statement filed with the district director, or director of the  regional service center, with whom the taxpayer's income tax return is  required to be filed. If the election is made within the time period  prescribed for filing an income tax return (including extensions  thereof) for the first taxable year ending after September 12, 1966,  during which the taxpayer pays or incurs expenditures which are within  the scope of section 615 and which are paid or incurred by him after  September 12, 1966, this statement shall be attached to the taxpayer's  income tax return for such taxable year. If the election is made after  the time prescribed for filing such return but before the expiration of  the period (described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) for making  the election under section 615(e), the statement must be signed by the  taxpayer or his authorized representative. The statement shall be filed  even though the taxpayer charges to capital account all such  expenditures paid or incurred by him during such taxable year after such  date. The statement shall clearly indicate that the taxpayer elects to  have section 615 apply to all amounts deducted by him with respect to  mining exploration expenditures paid or incurred after September 12,  1966. If the taxpayer desires, he may file this statement by attaching  it to his return for a taxable year prior to the first taxable year  ending after September 12, 1966, in which he pays or incurs mining  exploration expenditures. Except as provided, in subdivision (ii) of  this subparagraph, if the taxpayer does not file such a statement within  the period prescribed by section 615(e) and paragraph (d)(1) of this  section, any amounts deducted by him with respect to exploration  expenditures paid or incurred by him after September 12, 1966, will be  deemed to have been deducted pursuant to an election under section  617(a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exception. The last sentence of subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph shall not apply if all mining exploration expenditures  which are paid or incurred by the taxpayer after September 12, 1966, and  which are deducted by him in his income tax return for the first taxable  year ending after September 12, 1966, during which he pays or incurs  such expenditures are outside the scope of section 617(a). For example,  assume that, in his return for his first taxable year ending after  September 12, 1966, a taxpayer deducts mining exploration expenditures  paid or incurred after September 12, 1966, and does not attach to his  return the statement described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.  However, all of the exploration expenditures paid or incurred by the  taxpayer after September 12, 1966, and before the end of the taxable  year were paid or incurred with respect to minerals located neither in  the United States nor on the Outer Continental Shelf. The taxpayer will  be deemed to have made an election under section 615(e) by deducting all  or part of those expenditures as expenses in his income tax return.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, (c), and (d) and the rules of  section 615(g) (relating to effect of transfer of mineral property).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of election. A taxpayer who has made an election under  section 615(e) may never make an election under section 617(a) unless,  within the period set forth in section 615(e) and paragraph (b)(1) of  Sec. 15.1-2, he revokes his election under section 615(e). A taxpayer  who has made an election under section 617(a) may never make an election  under section 615(e) unless, within the period set forth in section  615(e) and paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 15.1-2, he revokes his election  under section 617(a). A taxpayer who has made, and has not revoked, an  election under section 617(a) may not, in his return for the taxable  year for which the election is made or for any subsequent taxable year,  charge to capital account any expenditures which are within the scope of  section 617(a), and he must deduct all such expenditures as expenses.  Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.615-2 of this chapter  (Income Tax Regulations), a taxpayer who makes an election under 615(e)  may not change his treatment of exploration expenditures deducted,  deferred, or capitalized pursuant to such election unless he revokes the  election made under section 615(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time for making election--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Election under section 615(e). A  taxpayer may not make an election under section 615(e) after the  expiration of the 3-year period beginning with the date prescribed by  section 6072 or other provision of law for filing the taxpayer's income  tax return for the first taxable year ending after September 12, 1966,  in which the taxpayer pays or incurs expenditures to which section  615(a) would apply if an election were made under section 615(e). This  3-year period shall be determined without regard to any extension of  time for filing the taxpayer's income tax return. An election under  section 615(e) may not be made after the expiration of the 3-year period  even though the taxpayer charged to capital account, or erroneously  deducted as development expenditures under section 616, all mine  exploration expenditures paid or incurred by him after September 12,  1966, and before the end of his first taxable year ending after  September 12, 1966, in which he paid or incurred such expenditures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Election under section 617(a). The election under section 617(a)  may be made at any time before the expiration of the period prescribed  for filing a claim for credit or refund of the tax imposed by chapter 1  for the first taxable year for which the taxpayer desires to deduct  exploration expenditures under section 617.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Timely mailing treated as timely filing. Section 7502 (relating  to timely mailing treated as timely filing) shall apply in determining  the date when an election under either section 615(e) or section 617(a)  is made.</p>
