                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Bioavailability may be measured or bioequivalence may be  demonstrated by several in vivo and in vitro methods. FDA may require in  vivo or in vitro testing, or both, to measure the bioavailability of a  drug product or establish the bioequivalence of specific drug products.  Information on bioequivalence requirements for specific products is  included in the current edition of FDA's publication ``Approved Drug  Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations'' and any current  supplement to the publication. The selection of the method used to meet  an in vivo or in vitro testing requirement depends upon the purpose of  the study, the analytical methods available, and the nature of the drug  product. Applicants shall conduct bioavailability and bioequivalence  testing using the most accurate, sensitive, and reproducible approach  available among those set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The  method used must be capable of measuring bioavailability or establishing  bioequivalence, as appropriate, for the product being tested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following in vivo and in vitro approaches, in descending  order of accuracy, sensitivity, and reproducibility, are acceptable for  determining the bioavailability or bioequivalence of a drug product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An in vivo test in humans in which the concentration of the  active ingredient or active moiety, and, when appropriate, its active  metabolite(s), in whole blood, plasma, serum, or other appropriate  biological fluid is measured as a function of time. This approach is  particularly applicable to dosage forms intended to deliver the active  moiety to the bloodstream for systemic distribution within the body; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An in vitro test that has been correlated with and is  predictive of human in vivo bioavailability data; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An in vivo test in humans in which the urinary excretion of the  active moiety, and, when appropriate, its active metabolite(s), are  measured as a function of time. The intervals at which measurements are  taken should ordinarily be as short as possible so that the measure of  the rate of elimination is as accurate as possible. Depending on the  nature of the drug product, this approach may be applicable to the  category of dosage forms described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this  section. This method is not appropriate where urinary excretion is not a  significant mechanism of elimination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An in vivo test in humans in which an appropriate acute  pharmacological effect of the active moiety, and, when appropriate, its  active metabolite(s), are measured as a function of time if such effect  can be measured with sufficient accuracy, sensitivity, and  reproducibility. This approach is applicable to the category of dosage  forms described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section only when  appropriate methods are not available for measurement of the  concentration of the moiety, and, when appropriate, its active  metabolite(s), in biological fluids or excretory products but a method  is available for the measurement of an appropriate acute pharmacological  effect. This approach may be particularly applicable to dosage forms  that are not intended to deliver the active moiety to the bloodstream  for systemic distribution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Well-controlled clinical trials that establish the safety and  effectiveness of the drug product, for purposes of measuring  bioavailability, or appropriately designed comparative clinical trials,  for purposes of demonstrating bioequivalence. This approach is the least  accurate, sensitive, and reproducible of the general approaches for  measuring bioavailability or demonstrating bioequivalence. For dosage  forms intended to deliver the active moiety to the bloodstream for  systemic distribution, this approach may be considered acceptable only  when analytical methods cannot be developed to permit use of one of the  approaches outlined in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(2) of this section,  when the approaches described in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(iii), and  (b)(3) of this section are not available. This approach may also be  considered sufficiently accurate for measuring bioavailability or  demonstrating bioequivalence of dosage forms intended to deliver the  active moiety locally, e.g., topical preparations for the skin, eye, and  mucous membranes; oral dosage forms not intended to be absorbed, e.g.,  an antacid or radiopaque medium; and bronchodilators administered by  inhalation if the onset and duration of pharmacological activity are  defined.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A currently available in vitro test acceptable to FDA (usually a  dissolution rate test) that ensures human in vivo bioavailability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any other approach deemed adequate by FDA to measure  bioavailability or establish bioequivalence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> FDA may, notwithstanding prior requirements for measuring  bioavailability or establishing bioequivalence, require in vivo testing  in humans of a product at any time if the agency has evidence that the  product:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> May not produce therapeutic effects comparable to a  pharmaceutical equivalent or alternative with which it is intended to be  used interchangeably;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> May not be bioequivalent to a pharmaceutical equivalent or  alternative with which it is intended to be used interchangeably; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has greater than anticipated potential toxicity related to  pharmacokinetic or other characteristics.
