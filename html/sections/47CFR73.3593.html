If, however, the issue to be resolved is limited to the mutual exclusivity of applications for initial authorizations or for major changes to existing stations, that mutual exclusivity shall be resolved pursuant to competitive bidding procedures identified in subpart I (unreserved channels) or point system procedures identified in subpart K (reserved channels).
