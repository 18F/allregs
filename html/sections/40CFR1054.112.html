                            <p class="depth0">The evaporative emission requirements of this section apply starting in the 2011 model year for equipment using Class II engines and in the 2012 model year for equipment using Class I engines over a useful life of five years. See Sec.  1054.110 for requirements that apply for nonhandheld equipment using engines at or below 80 cc.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Fuel line permeation. Nonmetal fuel lines must meet the permeation requirements for EPA Nonroad Fuel Lines as specified in 40 CFR 1060.102.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Tank permeation. Fuel tanks must meet the permeation requirements specified in 40 CFR 1060.103. Equipment manufacturers may generate or use emission credits to show compliance with the requirements of this paragraph (b) under the averaging, banking, and trading program as described in subpart H of this part. Starting in the 2014 model year for Class II equipment and in the 2015 model year for Class I equipment, the following FEL caps represent the maximum values for family emission limits that you may use for your fuel tanks:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) of this section, you may not use fuel tanks with a family emission limit that exceeds 5.0 g/m\2\/day for testing at a nominal temperature of 28 [deg]C, or 8.3

g/m\2\/day for testing at a nominal temperature of 40 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For small-volume emission families, you may not use fuel tanks with a family emission limit that exceeds 8.0 g/m\2\/day for testing at a nominal temperature of 28 [deg]C, or 13.3 g/m\2\/day for testing at a nominal temperature of 40 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> FEL caps do not apply to fuel caps that are certified separately to meet permeation standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Running loss. Running loss requirements apply as specified in 40 CFR 1060.104.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Diurnal emissions. Nonhandheld equipment may optionally be certified to the diurnal emission standards specified in 40 CFR 1060.105, in which case the permeation standards specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section do not apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Other requirements. The provisions of 40 CFR 1060.101(e) and (f) include general requirements that apply to all nonroad equipment subject to evaporative emission standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Engine manufacturers. To the extent that engine manufacturers produce engines with fuel lines or fuel tanks, those fuel-system components must meet the requirements specified in this section. The timing of new standards is based on the date of manufacture of the engine.
