Information relating  solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Matters exempt from disclosure by statute. Information  specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than 5 U.S.C.  552b), if the statute (1) requires that the matters be withheld from the  public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (2)  establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular  types of matters to be withheld.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Privileged or confidential information. Trade secrets and  commercial or financial information obtained from any person which is  privileged or confidential.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Certain inter-agency or intra-agency correspondence. Inter- agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not be available  by law to a private party in litigation with the agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Material involving personal privacy. Personnel and medical files  and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly  unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Certain investigatory records. Records or information compiled  for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production  of such enforcement records or information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement  proceedings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an  impartial adjudication;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted  invasion of personal privacy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a  confidential source, including a State, local or foreign agency or  authority or any private institution which furnished information on a  confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled  by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal  investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security  intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential  source;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Would disclose techniques for law enforcement investigations or  prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement  investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be  expected to risk circumvention of the law; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical  safety of any individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Certain pending criminal investigations. Whenever a request is  made which involves access to records described in paragraph (g)(1) of  this section and)--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of  criminal law; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is reason to believe that the subject of the investigation  or proceeding is not aware of its pendency, and disclosure of the  existence of the records could reasonably be expected to interfere with  enforcement proceedings, Customs may, during only such times as that  circumstance continues, treat the records as not subject to the  requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Certain informant records. Whenever informant records maintained  by Customs under an informant's name or personal identifier are  requested by a third party according to the informant's name or personal  identifier, Customs may treat the records as not subject to the  requirements of this part unless the informant's status as an informant  has been officially confirmed.
