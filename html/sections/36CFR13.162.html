                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In making a decision on a permit application, the Superintendent shall consider whether the use by local rural residents of a cabin or other structure for subsistence purposes is customary and traditional in that park area and shall determine whether the use and occupancy of a new or existing cabin or structure is ``necessary to reasonably accommodate'' the applicant's subsistence uses. In making this determination, the Superintendent shall examine the applicant's particular circumstances, including but not limited to his or her past patterns of subsistence uses and his or her future subsistence use plans, reasonable subsistence use alternatives, the specific nature of the subsistence uses to be accommodated by the cabin or structure, the impacts of the cabin or structure on other local rural residents who depend on subsistence uses and the impacts of the proposed structure and activities on the values and purposes for which the park area was established.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Superintendent may permit the construction of a new cabin or other new structure for subsistence purposes only if a tent or other temporary facility would not adequately and reasonably accommodate the applicant's subsistence uses without significant hardship and the use of no other type of cabin or other structure provided for in this subpart can adequately and reasonably accommodate the applicant's subsistence uses with a lesser impact on the values and purposes for which the park area was established.</p>
