                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sorbitol is the chemical 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexanehexol  (C6H14O6), a hexahydric alcohol,  differing from mannitol principally by having a different optical  rotation. Sorbitol is produced by the electrolytic reduction, or the  transition metal catalytic hydrogenation of sugar solutions containing  glucose or fructose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ingredient meets the specifications of the ``Food Chemicals  Codex,'' 3d Ed. (1981), p. 308, which is incorporated by reference.  Copies may be obtained from the National Academy Press, 2101  Constitution Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20418, or may be examined at the  National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on  the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:  http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ ibr_locations.html.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The ingredient is used as an anticaking agent and free-flow  agent as defined in Sec. 170.3(o)(1) of this chapter, curing and  pickling agent as defined in Sec. 170.3(o)(5) of this chapter, drying  agent as defined in Sec. 170.3(o)(7) of this chapter, emulsifier and  emulsifier salt as defined in Sec. 170.3(o)(8) of this chapter, firming  agent as defined in Sec. 170.3(o)(10) of this chapter, flavoring agent  and adjuvant as defined in Sec. 170.3(o)(12) of this chapter,  formulation aid as defined in Sec. 170.3(o)(14) of this chapter,  humectant as defined in Sec. 170.3(o)(16) of this chapter, lubricant and  release agent as defined in Sec. 170.3(o)(18) of this chapter, nutritive  sweetener as defined in Sec. 170.3(o)(21) of this chapter, sequestrant  as defined in Sec. 170.3(o)(26) of this chapter, stabilizer and  thickener as defined in Sec. 170.3(o)(28) of this chapter, surface- finishing agent as defined in Sec. 170.3(o)(30) of this chapter, and  texturizer as defined in Sec. 170.3(o)(32) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The ingredient is used in food at levels not to exceed good  manufacturing practices. Current good manufacturing practice in the use  of sorbitol results in a maximum level of 99 percent in hard candy and  cough drops as defined in Sec. 170.3(n)(25) of this chapter, 75 percent  in chewing gum as defined in Sec. 170.3(n)(6) of this chapter, 98  percent in soft candy as defined in Sec. 170.3(n)(38) of this chapter,  30 percent in nonstandardized jams and jellies, commercial, as defined  in Sec. 170.3(n)(28) of this chapter, 30 percent in baked goods and  baking mixes as defined in Sec. 170.3(n)(1) of this chapter, 17 percent  in frozen dairy desserts and mixes as defined in Sec. 170.3(n)(20) of  this chapter, and 12 percent in all other foods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The label and labeling of food whose reasonably foreseeable  consumption may result in a daily ingestion of 50 grams of sorbitol  shall bear the statement: ``Excess consumption may have a laxative  effect.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Prior sanctions for this ingredient different from the uses  established in this regulation do not exist or have been waived.  [42 FR 14653, Mar. 15, 1977, as amended at 49 FR 5613, Feb. 14, 1984]</p>
