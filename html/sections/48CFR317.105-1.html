cancellation ceiling does not exceed 20 percent of the total contract value over the multi-year term or $11.5 million, whichever is less. Cancellation ceiling provisions shall conform to the requirements of FAR 17.106-1(c). The determination is not delegable and shall address the issues in FAR 17.105-1(a) and the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount of, and basis for, the estimated cancellation ceiling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identification and assignment of a Contracting Officer holding a FAC-C Level III certification or, alternatively, one familiar with the application of this contracting method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Availability of appropriations to fund the obligation of total contract costs for the first year of performance plus the estimated amount of the full cancellation ceiling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reasonable expectation that, throughout the contemplated contract performance period, the OPDIV, through its annual budget request, will seek funding for the contract at the level necessary to avoid contract cancellation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Program requirements are reasonably stable and the associated technical risks are not excessive--i.e., not of the nature or level to jeopardize contract completion or result in its cancellation.</p><p class="depth3">Upon SPE request, the HCA shall provide a copy of each determination (other than those specified in 317.105-1(b) below).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> SPE approval is required for any--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> SPE approval is required for any--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Individual determination to use multi-year contracting with a cancellation ceiling in excess of the limits in 317.105-1(a); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Class determination (see FAR Subpart 1.7).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A determination involving a cancellation ceiling in excess of the limits in 317.105-1(a) shall present a compelling justification for the estimated cancellation ceiling.
