If a facility manager's or facility owner's scheduled rent is equal to the highest rent charged a tenant in the facility or facilities, then the facility manager's or facility owner's use determines the dollar amount of the base rent. Otherwise, the facility owner's, facility manager's, customer's, or tenant's use with the highest value, and which is not otherwise excluded from rent, determines the base rent.</p><p class="depth2">Casual use means activities ordinarily resulting in no or negligible disturbance of the public lands, resources, or improvements.

The holder's use may not otherwise be subject to rent charges under BLM's rental provisions.</p><p class="depth2">Communication use rent schedule is a schedule of rents for the following types of communication uses, including related technologies, located in a facility associated with a particular grant or lease. All use categories include ancillary communications equipment, such as internal microwave or internal one-or two-way radio, that are directly related to operating, maintaining, and monitoring the primary uses listed below. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) may or may not license the primary uses. The type of use and community served, identified on an FCC license, if one has been issued, do not supersede either the definitions in this subpart or the procedures in Sec. 2806.30 of this part for calculating rent for communication facilities and uses located on public land:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> Television broadcast means a use that broadcasts UHF and VHF audio and video signals for general public reception.
