                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The shoulder (175-3000) is part of the body assembly shown in  drawing 175-0000. When subjected to impact tests specified in paragraph  (b) of this section, the shoulder assembly shall meet performance  requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Test procedure. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Soak the dummy assembly, without suit and  shoulder foam pad (175-3010), in a test environment as specified in  Sec. 572.189(n);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The dummy is seated, as shown in Figure U3 in appendix A to this  subpart, on a flat, horizontal, rigid surface covered by two overlaid 2  mm thick Teflon sheets and with no back support of the dummy's torso.  The dummy's torso spine backplate is vertical within 2 degrees and the midsagittal plane of the thorax is  positioned perpendicular to the direction of the plane of motion of the  impactor at contact with the shoulder. The arms are oriented forward at  502 degrees from the horizontal, pointing  downward. The dummy's legs are horizontal and symmetrical about the  midsaggital plane with the distance between the innermost point on the  opposite ankle at 100 5 mm. The length of the  elastic shoulder cord (175-3015) shall be adjusted so that a force  between and including 27.5 and 32.5 N applied in a forward direction at  4 1 mm from the outer edge of the clavicle in the  same plane as the clavicle movement, is required to initiate a forward  motion of 1 to 5 mm;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The impactor is the same as defined in Sec. 572.189(a);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The impactor is guided, if needed, so that at contact with the  shoulder, its longitudinal axis is within 0.5  degrees of a horizontal plane and perpendicular (0.5 degrees) to the midsagittal plane of the dummy and  the centerpoint on the impactor's face is within 5 mm of the center of  the upper arm pivot bolt (5000040) at contact with the test dummy, as  shown in Figure U3 in appendix A to this subpart;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The impactor impacts the dummy's shoulder at 4.30.1 m/s.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Performance criteria. The peak acceleration of the impactor is  between 7.5 g's and 10.5 g's during the pendulum's contact with the  dummy.</p>
