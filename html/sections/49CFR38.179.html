                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> New and used trams consisting of a tractor unit, with or without  passenger accommodations, and one or more passenger trailer units,  including but not limited to vehicles providing shuttle service to  remote parking areas, between hotels and other public accommodations,  and between and within amusement parks and other recreation areas, shall  comply with this section. For purposes of determining applicability of  49 CFR 37.101, 37.103, or 37.105 the capacity of such a vehicle or  ``train'' shall consist of the total combined seating capacity of all  units, plus the driver, prior to any modification for accessibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> or (c) and  shall provide at least one space for wheelchair or mobility aid users  complying with Sec. 38.23(d) of this part unless the complete operating  unit consisting of tractor and one or more trailers can already  accommodate at least two wheelchair or mobility aid users.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Figures to Part 38 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28SE98.000     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC02FE91.194     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC02FE91.195     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC02FE91.196   [56 FR 45756, Sept. 6, 1991, as amended at 63 FR 51700, 51703, Sept. 28,  1998]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix to Part 38--Guidance Material</p><p class="depth0">This appendix contains materials of an advisory nature and provides  additional information that should help the reader to understand the  minimum requirements of the standards or to design vehicles for greater  accessibility. Each entry is applicable to all subparts of this part  except where noted. Nothing in this appendix shall in any way obviate  any obligation to comply with the requirements of the standards  themselves.  I. Slip Resistant Surface--Aisles, Steps, Floor Areas Where People Walk,</p><p class="depth0">Floor Areas in Securement Locations, Lift Platforms, Ramps</p><p class="depth0">Slip resistance is based on the frictional force necessary to keep a  shoe heel or crutch tip from slipping on a walking surface under  conditions likely to be found on the surface. While the dynamic  coefficient of friction during walking varies in a complex and non- uniform way, the static coefficient of friction, which can be measured  in several ways, provides a close approximation of the slip resistance  of a surface. Contrary to popular belief, some slippage is necessary to  walking,   especially for persons with restricted gaits; a truly ``non-slip''  surface could not be negotiated.</p><p class="depth0">The Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends that  walking surfaces have a static coefficient of friction of 0.5. A  research project sponsored by the Architectural and Transportation  Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) conducted tests with persons  with disabilities and concluded that a higher coefficient of friction  was needed by such persons. A static coefficient of friction of 0.6 is  recommended for steps, floors, and lift platforms and 0.8 for ramps.</p><p class="depth0">It is recognized that the coefficient of friction varies  considerably due to the presence of contaminants, water, floor finishes,  and other factors not under the control of transit providers and may be  difficult to measure. Nevertheless, many common materials suitable for  flooring are now labeled with information on the static coefficient of  friction. While it may not be possible to compare one product directly  with another, or to guarantee a constant measure, transit operators or  vehicle designers and manufacturers are encouraged to specify materials  with appropriate values. As more products include information on slip  resistance, improved uniformity in measurement and specification is  likely. The Access Board's advisory guidelines on Slip Resistant  Surfaces provides additional information on this subject.</p><p class="depth0">II. Color Contrast--Step Edges, Lift Platform Edges</p><p class="depth0">The material used to provide contrast should contrast by at least  70%. Contrast in percent is determined by:  Contrast=[B-B)/B] x 100  Where B = light reflectance value (LRV) of the lighter area and B = light reflectance value (LRV) of the darker area.  Note that in any application both white and black are never absolute;  thus, B never equals 100 and B is always greater than 0.</p><p class="depth0">III. Handrails and Stanchions</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the requirements for handrails and stanchions for  rapid, light, and commuter rail vehicles, consideration should be given  to the proximity of handrails or stanchions to the area in which  wheelchair or mobility aid users may position themselves. When  identifying the clear floor space where a wheelchair or mobility aid  user can be accommodated, it is suggested that at least one such area be  adjacent or in close proximity to a handrail or stanchion. Of course,  such a handrail or stanchion cannot encroach upon the required 32 inch  width required for the doorway or the route leading to the clear floor  space which must be at least 30 by 48 inches in size.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Priority Seating Signs and Other Signage</p><p class="depth0">A. Finish and Contrast. The characters and background of signs  should be eggshell, matte, or other non-glare finish. An eggshell finish  (11 to 19 degree gloss on 60 degree glossimeter) is recommended.  Characters and symbols shall contrast with their background--either  light characters on a dark background or dark characters on a light  background. Research indicates that signs are more legible for persons  with low vision when characters contrast with their background by at  least 70 percent. Contrast in percent shall be determined by:  Contrast=[B-B)/B] x 100  Where B = light reflectance value (LRV) of the lighter area and B = light reflectance value (LRV) of the darker area.  Note that in any application both white and black are never absolute;  thus, B never equals 100 and B is always greater than 0.</p><p class="depth0">The greatest readability is usually achieved through the use of  light-colored characters or symbols on a dark background.</p><p class="depth0">B. Destination and Route Signs. (The following specifications, which  are required for buses (Sec. 38.39), are recommended for other types of  vehicles, particularly light rail vehicles, were appropriate.)</p><p class="depth0">1. Where destination or route information is displayed on the  exterior of a vehicle, each vehicle shall have illuminated signs on the  front and boarding side of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0">2. Characters on signs required by paragraph IV.B.1 of this appendix  shall have a width-to-height ratio between 3:5 and 1:1 and a stroke  width-to-height ratio between 1:5 and 1:10, with a minimum character  height (using an upper case ``X'') of 1 inch for signs on the boarding  side and a minimum character height of 2 inches for front ``headsigns,''  with ``wide'' spacing (generally, the space between letters shall be \1/ 16\ the height of upper case letters), and shall contrast with the  background, either dark-on-light or light-on-dark, or as recommended  above.</p><p class="depth0">C. Designation of Accessible Vehicles. The International Symbol of  Accessibility should be displayed as shown in Figure 6.</p><p class="depth0">V. Public Information Systems</p><p class="depth0">Entities are encouraged to employ any available services, signage,  or alternative systems or devices that are capable of providing the same  or equivalent information to persons with hearing loss. Two possible  types of devices are visual display systems and listening systems.  However, it should be noted that while visual display systems  accommodate persons who are deaf or are hearing impaired, assistive  listening systems aid only those with a partial loss of hearing.</p><p class="depth0">A. Visual Display Systems. Announcements may be provided in a visual  format by the use of electronic message boards or video monitors.</p><p class="depth0">Electronic message boards using a light emitting diode (LED) or  ``flip-dot'' display are currently provided in some transit stations and  terminals and may be usable in vehicles. These devices may be used to  provide real time or pre-programmed messages; however, real time message  displays require the availability of an employee for keyboard entry of  the information to be announced.</p><p class="depth0">Video monitor systems, such as visual paging systems provided in  some airports (e.g., Baltimore-Washington International Airport), are  another alternative. The Architectural and Transportation Barriers  Compliance Board (Access Board) can provide technical assistance and  information on these systems (``Airport TDD Access: Two Case Studies,''  (1990)).</p><p class="depth0">B. Assistive Listening Systems. Assistive listening systems (ALS)  are intended to augment standard public address and audio systems by  providing signals which can be received directly by persons with special  receivers or their own hearing aids and which eliminate or filter  background noise. Magnetic induction loops, infra-red and radio  frequency systems are types of listening systems which are appropriate  for various applications.</p><p class="depth0">An assistive listening system appropriate for transit vehicles,  where a group of persons or where the specific individuals are not known  in advance, may be different from the system appropriate for a  particular individual provided as an auxiliary aid or as part of a  reasonable accommodation. The appropriate device for an individual is  the type that individual can use, whereas the appropriate system for a  station or vehicle will necessarily be geared toward the ``average'' or  aggregate needs of various individuals. Earphone jacks with variable  volume controls can benefit only people who have slight hearing loss and  do not help people who use hearing aids. At the present time, magnetic  induction loops are the most feasible type of listening system for  people who use hearing aids equipped with ``T-coils'', but people  without hearing aids or those with hearing aids not equipped with  inductive pick-ups cannot use them without special receivers. Radio  frequency systems can be extremely effective and inexpensive. People  without hearing aids can use them, but people with hearing aids need a  special receiver to use them as they are presently designed. If hearing  aids had a jack to allow a by-pass of microphones, then radio frequency  systems would be suitable for people with and without hearing aids. Some  listening systems may be subject to interference from other equipment  and feedback from hearing aids of people who are using the systems. Such  interference can be controlled by careful engineering design that  anticipates feedback sources in the surrounding area.</p><p class="depth0">The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board  (Access Board) has published a pamphlet on Assistive Listening Systems  which lists demonstration centers across the country where technical  assistance can be obtained in selecting and installing appropriate  systems. The State of New York has also adopted a detailed technical  specification which may be useful.</p><p class="depth0">VI. Over-the-Road Buses</p><p class="depth0">A. Door Width. Achieving a 30 inch wide front door on an over-the- road bus is considered not feasible if doing so would necessitate  reduction of the bus approach angle, relocating the front axle rearward,  or increasing the bus overall length.</p><p class="depth0">B. Restrooms. The following is provided to assist manufacturers and  designers to create restrooms which can be used by people with  disabilities. These specifications are derived from requirements for  rail vehicles and represent compromises between space needed for use and  constraints imposed by vehicle dimensions. As a result, some persons  with disabilities cannot use a restroom which meets these specifications  and operators who do provide such restrooms should provide passengers  with disabilities sufficient advance information about design so that  those passengers can assess their ability to use them. Designers should  provide additional space beyond these minimum specifications whenever  possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(a)</em> through (e) of section  VI.B of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The minimum clear floor area should be 35 inches (890 mm) by 60  inches (1525 mm). Permanently installed fixtures may overlap this area a  maximum of 6 inches (150 mm), if the lowest portion of the fixture is a  minimum of 9 inches (230 mm) above the floor, and may overlap a maximum  of 19 inches (485 mm), if the lowest portion of the fixture is a minimum  of 29 inches (740 mm) above the floor, provided such fixtures do not  interfere with access to the water closet. Fold-down or retractable  seats or shelves may overlap the clear floor space at a lower height  provided they can be easily folded up or moved out of the way.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The height of the water closet should be 17 inches (430 mm) to  19 inches (485 mm) measured to the top of the toilet seat. Seats should  not be sprung to return to a lifted position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A grab bar at least 24 inches (610 mm) long should be mounted  behind the water closet, and a horizontal grab bar at least 40 inches  (1015 mm) long should be mounted on   at least one side wall, with one end not more than 12 inches (305 mm)  from the back wall, at a height between 33 inches (840 mm) and 36 inches  (915 mm) above the floor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Faucets and flush controls should be operable with one hand and  should not require tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist.  The force required to activate controls should be no greater than 5 lbs  (22.2 N). Controls for flush valves should be mounted no more than 44  inches (1120 mm) above the floor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Doorways on the end of the enclosure, opposite the water closet,  should have a minimum clear opening width of 32 inches (815 mm). Door  latches and hardware should be operable with one hand and should not  require tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Accessible restrooms should be in close proximity to at least  one seating location for persons using mobility aids and should be  connected to such a space by an unobstructed path having a minimum width  of 32 inches (815 mm).</p><p class="depth0">C. Visibility Through a Window. Care should be taken so that the  lift does not obscure the vision of the person occupying the securement  position.
