                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Council encourages maximum public participation in the process established by these regulations. Particularly important, with respect to the UDAG program, is participation by the citizens of neighborhoods directly or indirectly affected by projects, and by groups concerned with historic and cultural preservation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The applicant, in preparing and following its citizen participation plan called for by 24 CFR 570.456(c)(11)(i)(A), should ensure that adequate provision is made for participation by citizens and organizations having interests in historic preservation and in the historic and cultural values represented in affected neighborhoods. 24 CFR 570.431(c) sets forth criteria for citizen participation plans. These should be carefully considered with specific reference to ensuring that local concerns relevant to historic preservation are fully identified, and that citizens are provided with full and accurate information about each project and its effects on historic properties. The applicant should ensure that potentially concerned citizens and organizations are fully involved in the identification of properties which may meet the National Register Criteria, and that they are fully informed, in a timely manner, of determinations of No Effect, No Adverse Effect, and Adverse Effect, and of the progress of the consultation process. Applicants are referred to 36 CFR 800.15 for Council guidelines for public participation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Council welcomes the views of the public, especially those groups which may be affected by the proposed project, during its evaluation of the applicant's determination of effect, and will solicit the participation of the public in Council and panel meetings held to consider projects.</p><p class="depth2">Sec. Appendix 1 to Part 801--Identification of Properties: General</p><p class="depth2">A. Introduction</p><p class="depth2">Because of the high probability of locating properties which are listed in the National Register or which meet the Criteria for listing in many older city downtowns, this appendix is designed to serve as guidance for UDAG applicants in identifying such properties. This appendix sets forth guidance for applicants and does not set a fixed or inflexible standard for identification efforts.</p><p class="depth2">B. Role of the State Historic Preservation Officer</p><p class="depth2">In any effort to locate National Register properties or properties which meet the Criteria, the State Historic Preservation Officer is a key source of information and advice. The State Historic Preservation Officer will be of vital assistance to the applicant. The State Historic Preservation Officer can provide information on known properties and on studies which have taken place in and around the project area. Early contact should be made with the State Historic Preservation Officer for recommendations about how to identify historic properties. For UDAG projects, identification of National Register properties and properties which meet the Criteria is the responsibility of the applicant. The extent of the identification effort should be made with the advice of the State Historic Preservation Officer. The State Historic Preservation Officer can be a knowledgeable source of information regarding cases wherein the need for a survey of historic properties is appropriate, recommended type and method of a survey and the boundaries of any such survey. Due consideration should be given to the nature of the project and its impacts, the likelihood of historic properties being affected and the state of existing knowledge regarding historic properties in the area of the project's potential environmental impact.</p><p class="depth2">C. Levels of Identification</p><p class="depth2">1. The area of the project's potential environmental impact consists of two distinct subareas: that which will be disturbed directly (generally the construction site and its immediate environs) and that which will experience indirect effects. Within the area of indirect impact, impacts will be induced as a result of carrying the project out. Historic and cultural properties subject to effect must be identified in both subareas, and the level of effort necessary in each may vary. The level of effort needed is also affected by the stage of planning and the quality of pre-existing information. Obviously, if the area of potential environmental impact has already been fully and intensively studied before project planning begins, there is no need to duplicate this effort. The State Historic Preservation Officer should be contacted for information on previous studies. If the area has not been previously intensively studied, identification efforts generally fall into three levels:</p><p class="depth2">a. Overview Study: This level of study is normally conducted as a part of general planning and is useful at an early stage in project formulation. It is designed to obtain a general understanding of an area's historic and cultural properties in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer, by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> Assessing the extent to which the area has been previously subjected to study;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> Locating properties previously recorded;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(3)</em> Assessing the probability that properties eligible for the National Register will be found if the area is closely inspected, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(4)</em> Determining the need, if any, for further investigation.



An overview study includes study of pertinent records (local histories, building inventories, architectural reports, archeological survey reports, etc.), and usually some minor on-the-ground inspection.</p><p class="depth4">b. Identification Study: An identification study attempts to specifically identify and record all properties in an area that may meet the criteria for listing in the National Register. In conducting the study, the applicant should seek the advice of the State Historic Preservation Officer regarding pertinent background data. A thorough on-the-ground inspection of the subject area by qualified personnel should be undertaken. For very large areas, or areas with uncertain boundaries, such a study may focus on representative sample areas, from which generalizations may be made about the whole.</p><p class="depth4">c. Definition and Evaluation Study: If an overview and/or an identification study have indicated the presence or probable presence of properties that may meet the National Register Criteria but has not documented them sufficiently to allow a determination to be made about their eligibility, a definition and evaluation study is necessary. Such a study is directed at specific potentially eligible properties or at areas known or suspected to contain such properties. It includes an intensive on-the-ground inspection and related studies as necessary, conducted by qualified personnel, and provides sufficient information to apply the National Register's ``Criteria for Evaluation'' (36 CFR 60.6).</p><p class="depth4">2. An overview study will normally be needed to provide basic information for planning in the area of potential environmental impact. Unless this study indicates clearly that no further identification efforts are needed (e.g., by demonstrating that the entire area has already been intensively inspected with negative results, or by demonstrating that no potentially significant buildings have ever been built there and there is virtually no potential for archeological resources), and identification study will probably be needed within the area of potential environmental impact. This study may show that there are no potentially eligible properties within the area, or may show that only a few such properties exist and document them sufficiently to permit a determination of eligibility to be made in accordance with 36 CFR part 60. Alternatively, the study may indicate that potentially eligible properties exist in the area, but may not document them to the standards of 36 CFR part 60. Should this occur, a definition and evaluation study is necessary for those properties falling within the project's area of direct effect and for those properties subject to indirect effects. If a property falls within the general area of indirect effect, but no indirect effects are actually anticipated on the property in question, a definition and evaluation study will normally be superfluous.</p><p class="depth4">Sec. Appendix 2 to Part 801--Special Procedures for Identification and</p><p class="depth4">Consideration of Archeological Properties in an Urban Context</p><p class="depth4">A. Archeological sites in urban contexts are often difficult to identify and evaluate in advance of construction because they are sealed beneath modern buildings and structures. Prehistoric and historic sites within cities may be important both to science and to an understanding of each city's history, however, and should be considered in project planning. Special methods can be used to ensure effective and efficient consideration and treatment of archeological sites in UDAG projects.</p><p class="depth4">1. If it is not practical to physically determine the existence or nonexistence of archeological sites in the project area, the probability or improbability of their existence can be determined, in most cases, through study of:</p><p class="depth4">a. Information on the pre-urban natural environment, which would have had an effect on the location of prehistoric sites;</p><p class="depth4">b. Information from surrounding areas and general literature concerning the location of prehistoric sites;</p><p class="depth4">c. State and local historic property registers or inventories;</p><p class="depth4">d. Archeological survey reports;</p><p class="depth4">e. Historic maps, atlases, tax records, photographs, and other sources of information on the locations of earlier structures;</p><p class="depth4">f. Information on discoveries of prehistoric or historic material during previous construction, land levelling, or excavation, and</p><p class="depth4">g. Some minor on-the-ground inspection.</p><p class="depth4">2. Should the study of sources such as those listed in section (1)(a) above reveal that the following conditions exist, it should be concluded that a significant likelihood exists that archeological sites which meet the National Register Criteria exist on the project site:</p><p class="depth4">a. Discoveries of prehistoric or historic material remains have been reliably reported on or immediately adjacent to the project site, and these are determined by the State Historic Preservation Officer or other archeological authority to meet the Criteria for the National Register because of their potential value for public interpretation or the study of significant scientific or historical research problems; or</p><p class="depth4">b. Historical or ethnographic data, or discoveries of material, indicate that a property of potential cultural value to the community or some segment of the community (e.g., a cemetery) lies or lay within the project site; or</p><p class="depth4">c. The pre-urbanization environment of the project site would have been conducive to prehistoric occupation, or historic buildings or occupation sites are documented to have existed within the project site in earlier

times, and such sites or buildings are determined by the State Historic Preservation Officer or other archeological authority to meet the Criteria of the National Register because of their potential value for public interpretation or the study of significant scientific or historical research questions, and</p><p class="depth4">d. The recent history of the project site has not included extensive and intensive ground disturbance (grading, blasting, cellar digging, etc.) in the location, or extending to the depth at which the remains of significant sites, buildings, or other features would be expected.</p><p class="depth4">B. Where review of sources of information such as those listed in section (1)(a) above reveals no significant likelihood that archeological resources which meet the National Register Criteria exist on the project site, no further review is required with respect to archeology provided the State Historic Preservation Officer concurs.</p><p class="depth4">C. Where review of sources of information such as those listed in section (1)(a) above, reveals that archeological resources which meet the National Register Criteria are likely to exist on the project site, but these resources are so deeply buried that the project will not intrude upon them, or they are in a portion of the project site that will not be disturbed, a determination of ``No Effect'' is appropriate in accordance with Sec. 801.3(c)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth4">D. Where review of sources of information such as those listed in section (1)(a) above, reveals that archeological resources which meet the Criteria exist or are likely to exist on the project site, and that the project is likely to disturb them, a determination of ``No Adverse Effect'' may be made in accordance with Sec. 801.3(c)(2)(ii) if:</p><p class="depth4">1. The applicant and/or developer is committed to fund a professionally supervised and planned pre-construction testing program, and to modification of the project in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer to protect or incorporate within the project the archeological resources discovered with a minimum of damage to them, or if:</p><p class="depth4">2. The applicant and/or developer is committed to fund a professionally supervised and planned archeological salvage program, coordinated with site clearing and construction, following the standards of the Secretary of the Interior issued pursuant to the Archeological and Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 469) and the applicant finds that this program negates the adverse effect, in accordance with the standards set forth in section X of the Council's ``Supplementary Guidance for Review of Proposals for Treatment of Archeological Properties'' (45 FR 78808).</p><p class="depth4">E. When archeological sites included in the National Register or which meet the Criteria are found to exist on the project site or in the area of the project's environmental impact, and where the project is likely to disturb such resources, and where the adverse effect of such disturbance cannot be negated by archeological salvage, a determination of ``Adverse Effect'' is appropriate in accordance with Sec. 801.3(a)(2)(iii).</p>
