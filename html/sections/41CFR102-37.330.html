                            <p class="depth0">The parties to a cooperative agreement must decide among themselves  the extent to which the costs of the services they provide must be  reimbursed. Their decision should be reflected in the cooperative  agreement itself. As a general rule, the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535)  would require a Federal agency receiving services from a SASP to  reimburse the SASP for those services. Since SASPs are not Federal  agencies, the Economy Act would not require them to reimburse Federal  agencies for services provided by such agencies. In this situation, the  Federal agencies would have to determine whether or not their own  authorities would permit them to provide services to SASPs without  reimbursement. If a Federal agency is reimbursed by a SASP for services  provided under a cooperative agreement, it must credit that payment to  the fund or appropriation that incurred the related costs.</p>
