Any finding that the price is unreasonable must be supported by a statement of the facts and approved at a level above the contracting officer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There was a reasonable expectation, based on market research or other assessment, that two or more responsible offerors, competing independently, would submit priced offers in response to the solicitation's expressed requirement, even though only one offer is received from a responsible offeror and if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Based on the offer received, the contracting officer can reasonably conclude that the offer was submitted with the expectation of competition, e.g., circumstances indicate that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The offeror believed that at least one other offeror was capable of submitting a meaningful offer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The offeror had no reason to believe that other potential offerors did not intend to submit an offer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The determination that the proposed price is based on adequate price competition and is reasonable has been approved at a level above the contracting officer; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Price analysis clearly demonstrates that the proposed price is reasonable in comparison with current or recent prices for the same or similar items, adjusted to reflect changes in market conditions, economic conditions, quantities, or terms and conditions under contracts that resulted from adequate price competition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prices set by law or regulation.

The head of the contracting activity (HCA) may, without power of delegation, waive the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data in exceptional cases. The authorization for the waiver and the supporting rationale shall be in writing. The HCA may consider waiving the requirement if the price can be determined to be fair and reasonable without submission of certified cost or pricing data. For example, if certified cost or pricing data were furnished on previous production buys and the contracting officer determines such data are sufficient, when combined with updated data, a waiver may be granted. If the HCA has waived the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data, the contractor or higher-tier

subcontractor to whom the waiver relates shall be considered as having been required to provide certified cost or pricing data. Consequently, award of any lower-tier subcontract expected to exceed the certified cost or pricing data threshold requires the submission of certified cost or pricing data unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An exception otherwise applies to the subcontract; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The waiver specifically includes the subcontract and the rationale supporting the waiver for that subcontract.
