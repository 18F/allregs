Figure 3 illustrates a test site which is larger than a standard test site and is based upon a 60-foot (18.3 m) distance between the microphone location point and the microphone target point. (See Sec. 325.79(b)(1) for an example of the application of the correction factor to a sound level reading obtained at such a site.) Figure 4 illustrates a test site which is smaller than a standard test site and is based upon a 35-foot (10.7 m) distance between the microphone location point and the microphone target point. (See Sec. 325.79(b)(2) for an example of the application of the correction factor to a sound level reading obtained at such a site.)[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP91.012
