                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority. The Chief of Engineers is authorized to provide emergency supplies of clean water to any locality confronted with a source of contaminated water causing, or likely to cause, a substantial threat to the public health and welfare of the inhabitants of the locality.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Policies. (1) Any locality faced with a threat to public health and welfare from a contaminated source of drinking water is eligible for assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any locality faced with a threat to public health and welfare from a contaminated source of drinking water is eligible for assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Eligibility for assistance will be based on one or more of the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The maximum contaminant level or treatment technique for a contaminant, as established by the Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act (see 40 CFR 141), is exceeded.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The water supply has been identified as a source of illness by a tribal, State, or Federal public health official. The specific contaminant does not have to be identified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An emergency (e.g., a flood or chemical spill) has occurred that has resulted in either: one or more contaminants entering the source on a sufficient scale to endanger health; or, the emergency has made inoperable the equipment necessary to remove known contaminants.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The presence of a contaminant is indicated on the basis of other information available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Corps assistance will be directed toward the provision of the minimum amount of water required to maintain the health and welfare requirements of the affected population. The quantity of water and the means of distribution will be at the discretion of the responsible Corps official, who will consider the needs of the individual situation, the needs of the affected community, and the cost effectiveness of providing water by various methods.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a locality has multiple sources of water, assistance will be furnished only to the extent that the remaining sources, with reasonable conservation measures, cannot provide adequate supplies of drinking water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Loss of water supply is not a basis for assistance under this authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Water will not be furnished for commercial processes, except as incidental to the use of existing distribution systems. This does not prohibit the furnishing of water for drinking by employees and on-site customers. Water for preparing retail meals and similar personal needs may be provided to the extent it would be furnished to individuals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The permanent restoration of a safe supply of drinking water is the responsibility of local interests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Corps assistance is limited to 30 days, and requires the local interests to provide assurances of cooperation in a CA. (See subpart G of this part.) Extension of this 30-day period requires agreement (as an amendment to the previously signed CA) between the

State and the Corps. This agreement must cover specified services and responsibilities of each party, and provision of a firm schedule for local interests to provide normal supplies of water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> State, tribal, and local governments must make full use of their own resources, including National Guard capabilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Governor's request. A letter signed by the Governor, or his or her authorized representative, requesting Corps assistance and addressing the State's commitments and capabilities in response to the emergency situation, is required. All requests should identify the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Describe the local and State efforts undertaken. Verify that all reasonably available resources have been committed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify the specific needs of the State, and the required Corps assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identify additional commitments to be accomplished by the State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Identify the project sponsor(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Non-Federal responsibilities. Non-Federal interests are responsible for restoration of the routine supply of clean drinking water, including correcting any situations that cause contamination. If assistance is furnished by the Corps, local interests must furnish the basic requirements of local cooperation as detailed in the Cooperation Agreement. In all cases, reasonable water conservation measures must be implemented. Local interests will be required to operate and maintain any loaned equipment, and to remove and return such equipment to Federal interests, in a fully maintained condition, after the situation is resolved.</p>
