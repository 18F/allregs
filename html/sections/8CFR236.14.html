                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A Form I-817, Application for Family Unity Benefits,  must be filed with the correct fee required in Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this  chapter and the required supporting documentation. A separate  application with appropriate fee and documentation must be filed for  each person claiming eligibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Decision. The service center director has sole jurisdiction to  adjudicate an application for benefits under the   Family Unity Program. The director will provide the applicant with  specific reasons for any decision to deny an application. Denial of an  application may not be appealed. An applicant who believes that the  grounds for denial have been overcome may submit another application  with the appropriate fee and documentation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Referral of denied cases for consideration of issuance of notice  to appear. If an application is denied, the case will be referred to the  district director with jurisdiction over the alien's place of residence  for consideration of whether to issue a notice to appear. After an  initial denial, an applicant's case will not be referred for issuance of  a notice to appear until 90 days from the date of the initial denial, to  allow the alien the opportunity to file a new Form I-817 application in  order to attempt to overcome the basis of the denial. However, if the  applicant is found not to be eligible for benefits under Sec.  236.13(b), the Service reserves the right to issue a notice to appear at  any time after the initial denial.
