                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Effect of other Federal provisions. The obligations imposed by  this part are independent of, and do not alter, obligations not to  discriminate on the basis of sex imposed by Executive Order 11246, as  amended; title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et  seq.); the Equal Pay Act (29 U.S.C. 206 and 206(d); and any other act of  Congress or Federal regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effect of State or local law or other requirements. The  obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated by any  State or local law or other requirement which would render any applicant  or student ineligible, or limit the eligibility of any applicant or  student, on the basis of sex to practice any occupation or profession.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of rules or regulations of private organizations. The  obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated by any  rule or regulation of any organization, club, athletic or other league,  or association which would render any applicant or student ineligible to  participate or limit the eligibility or participation of any applicant  or student, on the basis of sex, in any education program or activity  operated by a recipient and which receives or benefits from Federal  financial assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effect of compliance with HEW regulations. If a recipient is  covered by the title IX regulations issued by HEW, 45 CFR part 86, and  has already complied with the HEW requirements corresponding to  Sec. Sec. 15a.3(c), 15a.4(a), 15a.7 (a) and (b), and 15a.8 (a) and (b),  then the requirements of those sections need not be duplicated in order  to comply with this part. However, if the requirements have not been  applied to all programs funded by this Department, then   the requirements will have to be met as to those programs.</p>
