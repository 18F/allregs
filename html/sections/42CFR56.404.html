In evaluating the relative capability of the applicant to provide such services directly, the Secretary shall

take into consideration whether the direct provision of services is inappropriate because:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provision of such services through contract or other arrangement would be more cost-effective;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provision of such services directly would unnecessarily duplicate existing resources; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provision of the services other than directly would enhance the accessibility or acceptability of the services to the population served.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The extent to which community resources will be utilized by the project; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Consistent with the other requirements of this part, the degree to which and the manner in which the applicant provides specific health services which the Secretary has, through publication of a notice in the Federal Register, established as services which should receive emphasis by applicants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Secretary shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Make no more than two grants for the same entity under section 319(d)(1)(B) of the Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Not make any grant under section 319(d)(1)(B) to an entity which, for the same project, has been awarded more than one grant under section 319(c) of the Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Not make a grant under section 319(d)(1)(B) to an entity which has been awarded a grant under section 319(d)(1)(A) of the Act.</p>
