Voluntary relinquishment by the borrower of control of  security or EO property without providing for its care.</p><p class="depth0">Acquired chattel property. Former security or EO property of which  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 has become the  owner (See Sec. 1955.20 of Subpart A of Part 1955 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0">Basic security.

It also  consists of real estate and all foundation herds and flocks, including  replacements, which serve as a basis for the farming operation outlined  in the Farm and Home Plan or yearly budget which serve as security for  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loans. With  respect to livestock herds and flocks, animals that are sold as a result  of the normal culling process are basic security unless the borrower has  replacements that will keep numbers and production up to planned levels.  However, if a borrower plans to make a significant reduction in his  basic livestock herd or flocks, the animals or birds that are sold in  making this reduction will be considered basic security.</p><p class="depth0">Borrower.
