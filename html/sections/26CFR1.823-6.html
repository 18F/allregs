Section  823(a) </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> defines the term ``statutory underwriting income'' for  purposes of part II of subchapter L of the Code. Subject to the  modifications provided by section 823(b) and paragraph (c) of this  section, statutory underwriting income is defined as the amount by  which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The gross income which would be taken into account in computing  taxable income under section 832 if the taxpayer were subject to the tax  imposed by section 831, reduced by the gross investment income (as  determined under section 822(b)), exceeds</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The deductions which would be taken into account in computing  taxable income if the taxpayer were subject to the tax imposed by  section 831, reduced by the deductions provided in section 822(c)  (relating to deductions allowed in computing taxable investment income),  plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> and paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> as the amount by which the amount  determined under section 823(a)(1)(B) and subparagraph (1)(ii) of this  paragraph exceeds the amount determined under section 823(a)(1)(A) and  subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Modifications--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Net operating losses. In applying section 832  for purposes of determining statutory underwriting income or loss under  section 823(a) and paragraph (b) of this section, the deduction for net  operating losses provided by section 172 is not allowed. However, see  section 825(a) and Sec. 1.825-1 for unused loss deduction allowed  companies taxable under section 821(a) in computing mutual insurance  company taxable income under section 821(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interinsurers and reciprocal underwriters--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  Section 823(b)(2) provides that in computing the statutory underwriting  income or loss of a mutual insurance company which is an interinsurer or  reciprocal underwriter, there shall be allowed as a deduction the  increase for the taxable year in savings credited to subscriber  accounts, or there shall be included as an item of gross income the  decrease for the taxable year in savings credited to subscriber  accounts. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term ``savings credited  to subscriber accounts'' means such portion of the surplus for the  taxable year as is credited to the individual accounts of subscribers  before the 16th day of the third month following the close of the  taxable year, but only if the company would be obligated to pay such  amount promptly to such subscriber if he terminated his contract at the  close of the company's taxable year, and only if the company mails  notification to such subscriber of the amount credited to his individual  account in the manner provided by subdivision (v) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of Sec. 1.809-4) which the company would be  obligated to pay to any subscriber terminating his contract at the close  of the company's taxable year are not savings credited to subscriber  accounts within the meaning of section 823(b)(2) and subdivision (i) of  this subparagraph. The deduction for savings credited to individual  subscriber accounts is allowed only in the case of reciprocal  underwriters or interinsurers where the subscriber or policyholder has  not only a legally enforceable right to receive the amount so credited  if he withdraws from the exchange, but where the amounts credited, as a  matter of actual practice, are paid to subscribers or policyholders who  terminate their contracts. Thus, no deduction shall be allowed for  savings credited to subscriber accounts if such savings are not in fact  promptly returned to subscribers when they terminate their contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Computation of increase or decrease in savings credited to  subscriber accounts. For purposes of determining the increase or  decrease for the taxable year in savings credited to subscriber  accounts, every reciprocal underwriter or interinsurer claiming a  deduction under section 823(b)(2) and this section shall establish and  maintain an account for savings credited to subscriber accounts. The  opening balance in such account for the first taxable year for which a  deduction is claimed under section 823(b)(2) and this section shall be  zero. In each taxable year there shall be added to such account the  total amount of savings credited to subscriber accounts for the taxable  year, and there shall be subtracted from such account the total amount  of savings subtracted from subscriber accounts for the taxable year.  However, in no case may the amount added to the account exceed the total  amount of savings to subscribers for the taxable year, irrespective of  the amount of savings credited to subscriber accounts for the taxable  year. Credits made to subscriber accounts after the close of the taxable  year and before the 16th day of the third month following the close of   the taxable year will be taken into account as if such amounts had been  credited on the last day of the taxable year to the extent such amounts  would have become fixed and determinable legal obligations due  subscribers if such subscribers had terminated their contracts on the  last day of the company's taxable year unless, at the time the amounts  are credited, the company specifically designates such amounts as being  from surplus for the taxable year in which the amounts were actually  credited. Such a designation, once made, shall be irrevocable. However,  if a company credited savings to subscriber accounts after December 31,  1962, and before March 16, 1963, and failed to designate such credits as  being from surplus for the taxable year 1963, such company may designate  such credits as being from surplus for the taxable year 1963 for  purposes of determining the total amount of credits to subscriber  accounts for such year. In determining the total amount of savings  subtracted from subscriber accounts for the taxable year, only amounts  subtracted from savings credited for taxable years beginning with the  first taxable year for which a deduction was claimed under section  823(b)(2) and this subparagraph will be taken into account. The method  of accounting regularly employed by the taxpayer in keeping its books of  account will be used for purposes of determining whether the amounts  subtracted from the subscriber accounts are from savings for taxable  years beginning before the first taxable year for which a deduction is  claimed under section 823(b)(2) and this subparagraph, or from savings  for taxable years beginning with such first taxable year. Where the  method of accounting regularly employed by the taxpayer in keeping its  books of account does not clearly indicate whether an amount was  subtracted from savings credited to subscriber accounts for taxable  years beginning before the first taxable year for which a deduction is  claimed under section 823(b)(2) and this subparagraph, or from savings  credited for such first taxable year and subsequent taxable years, the  amount subtracted will be deemed to have come from savings credited to  subscriber accounts for all taxable years, on a pro rata basis. Where an  amount is subtracted from a subscriber's account for record purposes,  but such subtraction does not reflect the discharge of the company's  legal obligation to pay the amount subtracted promptly to the subscriber  if he terminates his contract, then such subtraction shall not be taken  into account for purposes of section 823(b)(2) and this subparagraph. On  the other hand, where the company ceases to be under a legal obligation  to pay promptly to any subscriber the amount credited to his individual  account, then such amount shall be considered as having been subtracted  from such subscriber's account at the time such obligation ceased to  exist. For purposes of section 823(b)(2) and this subparagraph, the  increase (if any) for the taxable year in savings credited to subscriber  accounts shall be the amount by which the balance in the account for  savings credited to subscriber accounts as of the close of the taxable  year exceeds the balance in such account as of the close of the  preceding taxable year; and the decrease (if any) for the taxable year  in savings credited to subscriber accounts shall be the amount by which  the balance in the account for savings credited to subscriber accounts  as of the close of the preceding taxable year exceeds the balance in  such account as of the close of the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Legal obligation. For purposes of this subparagraph, the  existence of a legal obligation on the part of the company to pay to the  subscriber the savings credited to him will be determined under the  insurance contract pursuant to which the credits are made. Where it  appears that the company is otherwise legally obligated to pay amounts  credited to its subscribers, the requisite legal obligation will not be  considered absent merely because a subscriber's credits remain subject  to absorption by future losses incurred if left on deposit with the  company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Notification to subscribers. Every reciprocal underwriter or  interinsurer claiming a deduction under section 823(b)(2) and this  subparagraph for amounts credited to the individual accounts of its  subscribers must mail to   each such subscriber written notification of the amount credited to the  subscriber's account for the taxable year, the date on which such amount  was credited, and the date on which the subscriber's right to such  amount first would have become fixed if such subscriber had terminated  his contract at the close of the company's taxable year. As an  alternative to providing each subscriber with specific information  relating to the amount of savings credited to his individual account,  the notification required by this subdivision may be provided in the  form of a table or formula mailed to the subscribers. However, a table  or formula may not be used in lieu of the specific notification required  by this subdivision unless such table or formula has been approved by  the Commissioner. Generally, a table or formula will be approved if it  enables the subscriber to simply and readily ascertain the amount of  savings credited to his individual account for the taxable year, the  date on which such amount was credited, and the date on which his right  to such amount first would have become fixed if he had terminated his  contract at the close of the company's taxable year. A reciprocal  underwriter or interinsurer which desires to use such a table or formula  should direct a written request for approval of such table or formula to  the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Attention: T:R, Washington, DC,  20224. Such request must set forth a copy of the table or formula  proposed to be used, together with sufficient information to permit the  Commissioner to determine the basis upon which such table or formula was  prepared and the manner in which the subscribers will use such table or  formula in determining the amounts credited to their individual  accounts. Once a table or formula has been approved, the use of such  table or formula with respect to savings credited for subsequent taxable  years will not require further approval unless the basis upon which such  table or formula was prepared, or the manner in which such table or  formula is to be applied, is substantially changed. The table or formula  method of notification may be used with respect to all or less than all  of the company's subscribers. For example, the company might provide the  notification required by this subdivision to one class of subscribers in  the form of a table or formula mailed to the individual subscribers,  while providing another class of subscribers with specific statements of  the amounts credited to their individual accounts. The notification  required by this subdivision must be mailed before the 16th day of the  third month following the close of the reciprocal's taxable year for  which the account was credited. Where for any taxable year a reciprocal  underwriter or interinsurer claims a deduction under section 823(b) and  this subparagraph and fails to give notice as required by this  subdivision, such deduction shall not be allowed unless the reciprocal  establishes to the satisfaction of the district director that the  failure to mail such notice within the prescribed period was due to  reasonable cause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Special deduction for small company having gross amount of less  than $1,100,000--(1) In general. In the case of a taxpayer subject to  the tax imposed by section 821(a), section 823(c) provides that if the  gross amount received during the taxable year from the items described  in section 822(b) (other than paragraph </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(D)</em> thereof) and premiums  (including deposits and assessments) is less than $1,100,000, then,  subject to the limitation provided in section 823(c)(2) and subparagraph  (2) of this paragraph, there shall be allowed an additional deduction  for purposes of determining statutory underwriting income or loss under  section 823(a) for the taxable year. The amount of the additional  deduction is $6,000; except that if the gross amount received for the  taxable year exceeds $500,000, the additional deduction is limited to an  amount equal to 1 percent of the amount by which $1,100,000 exceeds such  gross amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitation. The amount of the deduction provided by section  823(c)(1) may not exceed the statutory underwriting income for the  taxable year, computed without regard to the deduction allowed under  section 823(c)(1) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, and the  deduction allowed under section 824(a) (relating to deduction for  protection against losses).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Example. The application of section 823(c) and this paragraph  may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. M, a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by  section 821(a), has the following items for the taxable year 1963:  Gross amount for purposes of section 823(c)(1)..............    $800,000 Gross investment income (including capital gains)...........     150,000 Capital gains...............................................     100,000 Gross income under section 832..............................     900,000 Deductions under section 822(c).............................      22,000 Deductions under section 832 (as modified by section             746,000</p><p class="depth0">823(b)(2)).................................................</p><p class="depth0">Under the provisions of section 823(c), M's special small company  deduction for the taxable year 1963 would be $3,000, computed as  follows:  (1) Gross amount for purposes of section 823(c)(1)..........    $800,000 (2) Amount by which $1,100,000 exceeds item (1) ($1,100,000      300,000</p><p class="depth0">minus $800,000)............................................
