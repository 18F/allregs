                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A training organization or learning institution that provides  training services for safety-related railroad employees, including  providing such training services to independent students who enroll with  such training organization or learning institution and who will rely on  the training services provided to qualify to become safety-related  railroad employees, must submit its program to FRA for review and  approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A training organization or learning institution that has  provided training services to employers covered by this part prior to  January 1, 2017 may continue to offer such training services without FRA  approval until January 1, 2018. The Associate Administrator may extend  this period at any time based on a written request. Such written  requests for an extension of time to submit a program should contain any  factors the training organization or learning institution wants the  Associate Administrator to consider prior to approving or disapproving  the extension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A program submitted by a training organization or learning  institution must include all information required for an employer's  program in accordance with this part, unless the requirement could only  apply to an employer's program. The submitted program for a training  organization or learning institution must also include the following  information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The full corporate or business name of the training organization  or learning institution;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The training organization or learning institution's primary  business and email address;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The training organization or learning institution's primary  telephone number and point of contact;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A listing of the training organization or learning institution's  designated instructors;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A resume for each designated instructor, showing how the  instructor achieved the subject-matter and training expertise necessary  to develop and deliver training to safety-related railroad employees,  unless the designated instructors are currently employed by a railroad;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A list of references of employer customers the learning  organization or training institution has provided services to in the  past; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A brief summary statement indicating how the training  organization or learning institution determined the knowledge, skills,  and abilities necessary to develop the training courses it provides to  employers and independent students who enroll with such training  organization or learning institution in order to become safety-related  railroad employees. This brief summary should be of sufficient detail so  that FRA can ascertain the methodologies the training organization or  learning institution used during training development.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, prior  approval by the Associate Administrator is required before FRA will  accept such training as sufficient to meet the requirements of this  part. The Associate Administrator will advise the training organization  or learning institution in writing whether FRA has approved the program.  If all or part of the program is not approved by FRA, the Associate  Administrator will inform the training organization or learning  institution of specific deficiencies. At the time that the Associate  Administrator informs of any deficiencies, the Associate Administrator  will clarify whether any particular training courses shall be considered  approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Previously approved programs require an informational filing  when modified. The training organization or learning institution shall  review its previously approved training program and modify it  accordingly when new safety-related Federal railroad laws, regulations,  or orders are issued, or new safety-related technologies, procedures, or  equipment are introduced into the workplace and result in new knowledge  requirements, safety-related tasks, or in modifications of existing  safety-related duties. A training organization or learning institution  that modifies its training program for these described reasons shall  submit an informational filing to the Associate Administrator not later  than 30 days after the end of the calendar year in which the  modification occurred, unless FRA advises otherwise. Programs modified  in accordance with this paragraph are considered approved upon  modification and may be implemented immediately. Any program  deficiencies noted by the Associate Administrator shall be addressed as  specified in this section. The filing shall contain a summary  description of sufficient detail so that FRA can associate the changes  with the training organization's or learning institution's previously  approved program, and shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Descriptions of all new or refresher training courses developed  after the previous FRA approval, using the same criteria required for an  initial filing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Explanations whenever OJT or arranged practice is added to, or  discontinued from, a program; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Explanations as to how the methods of delivering training, or  qualifying employees has changed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> New portions or revisions to an approved program: Substantial  additions or revisions to a previously approved program, that are not  described as informational filings in accordance with paragraph (e) of  this section, shall require prior approval by the Associate  Administrator before FRA will accept such training as sufficient to meet  the requirements of this part. The Associate Administrator will advise  the training organization or learning institution in writing whether FRA  has approved the new or revised program. If all or part of the program  is not approved by FRA, the Associate Administrator will inform the  training organization or learning institution of specific deficiencies.  At the time that the Associate Administrator informs the   training organization or learning institution of any deficiencies, the  Associate Administrator will clarify whether any particular new or  revised training courses shall be considered approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Training organizations and learning institutions subject to this  part are required to maintain records for each safety-related railroad  employee that attends the training, in accordance with the recordkeeping  requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Training organizations and learning institutions subject to this  part shall provide a student's training transcript or training record to  any employer upon request by the student.</p>
