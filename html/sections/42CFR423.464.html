                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. A Part D plan must permit SPAPs (described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) and entities providing other prescription drug coverage (described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section) to coordinate benefits with such plan. A Part D plan must comply with all administrative processes and requirements established by CMS to ensure effective exchange of information and coordination between such plan and SPAPs and entities providing other prescription drug coverage for--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Payment of premiums and coverage; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Payment for supplemental prescription drug benefits as described in Sec. 423.104(f)(1)(ii)(including payment to a Part D plan on a lump sum per capita basis) for Part D eligible individuals enrolled in the Part D plan and the SPAP or entity providing other prescription drug coverage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Retroactive claims adjustments, underpayment reimbursements, and overpayment recoveries as described in paragraph (g) of this section and Sec. 423.466(a) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Medicare as primary payer. The requirements of this subpart do not change or affect the primary or secondary payer status of a Part D plan and a SPAP or other prescription drug coverage. A Part D plan is always the primary payer relative to a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> User fees. CMS may impose user fees on Part D plans for the transmittal of information necessary for benefit coordination in accordance with administrative processes and requirements established by CMS to ensure effective exchange of information and coordination between a Part D plan and SPAPs and entities providing other prescription drug coverage in a manner similar to the manner in which user fees are imposed under section 1842(h)(3)(B) of the Act, except that CMS may retain a portion of user fees to defray its costs in carrying out such procedures. CMS will not impose user fees under this subpart on a SPAP or entities providing other prescription drug coverage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cost management tools. The requirements of this subpart do not prevent a Part D sponsor from using cost management tools (including differential payments) under all methods of operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Coordination with State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs--(1) Requirements to be a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program (SPAP). A State program is considered to be a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program for purposes of this part if it-</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requirements to be a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program (SPAP).

A card that is issued under Sec. 423.120(c) for use under a Part D plan may also be used in connection with coverage of benefits provided under a SPAP and, in such a case, may contain an emblem or symbol indicating such connection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Construction. Nothing in this subpart requires a SPAP to coordinate with, or provide financial assistance to enrollees in, any Part D plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Coordination with other prescription drug coverage--(1) Definition of other prescription drug coverage. Entities that provide other prescription drug coverage include any of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition of other prescription drug coverage. Entities that provide other prescription drug coverage include any of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Medicaid programs. A State plan under title XIX of the Act, including such a plan operating under a waiver under section 1115 of the Act, if it meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Group health plans.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> FEHBP. The Federal Employee Health Benefits Program under chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Military coverage (including TRICARE). Coverage under chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Indian Health Service. Coverage under Chapter 18 of title 28 of the United States Code.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Federally qualified health centers. Federally qualified health centers as defined under section 1861(aa)(4) of the Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Rural health clinics. Rural health clinics as defined under section 1861(aa)(2) of the Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Other Part D plans.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Other prescription drug coverage. Other health benefit plans or programs that provide coverage or financial assistance for the purchase or provision of Part D drugs on behalf of Part D eligible individuals as CMS may specify.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Treatment under out-of-pocket rule. (i) For purposes of determining whether a Part D plan enrollee has satisfied the out-of-pocket threshold provided under Sec. 423.104(d)(5)(iii), a Part D plan must do all of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of determining whether a Part D plan enrollee has satisfied the out-of-pocket threshold provided under Sec. 423.104(d)(5)(iii), a Part D plan must do all of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Include the enrollee's incurred costs (as defined in Sec. 423.100).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Report, accept and apply benefit accumulator data in a timeframe and manner determined by CMS.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Exclude expenditures for covered Part D drugs made by insurance or otherwise, a group health plan, or other third party payment arrangements, including expenditures by plans offering other prescription drug coverage.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A Part D enrollee must disclose all these expenditures to a Part D plan in accordance with requirements under Sec. 423.32(b)(ii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Imposition of fees. A Part D sponsor may not impose fees on SPAPs and entities offering other prescription drug coverage that are unrelated to the cost of the coordination of benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Authority to recover expenditures due to incorrect information on true out-of-pocket costs. In the event that a Part D plan learns that it has made an erroneous payment due to inaccurate or incomplete information on the satisfaction of the out-of-pocket threshold under Sec. 423.104(d)(5)(iii), that plan is authorized to recover such costs directly from the Part D enrollee on whose behalf the costs were incurred. A Part D enrollee must reimburse the Part D plan for payment made for these costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Plan-to-plan liability. In the process of coordinating benefits between Part D plans when a Part D plan from which a beneficiary has transferred has incorrectly made payment for covered prescription drug costs incurred after the effective date of the Part D enrollee's enrollment in the new Part D plan of record, the new Part D plan of record must make the reconciling payments based on amounts reported to it by CMS without regard to the Part D plan's own formulary or drug utilization review edits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Use of other reconciliation processes. In the process of coordinating benefits between the correct Part D plan of record and another entity providing prescription drug coverage when that entity has incorrectly paid as primary payer for a covered Part D drug on behalf of a Part D enrollee, the correct Part D plan of record must achieve timely reconciliation through working directly with the other entity that incorrectly paid as primary payer, unless CMS has established reconciliation processes for payment reconciliation, rather than requesting pharmacy claims reversal and re-adjudication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Responsibility to account for other providers of prescription drug coverage when a retroactive claims adjustment creates an overpayment or underpayment. When a Part D sponsor makes a retroactive claims adjustment, the sponsor has the responsibility to account for SPAPs and other entities providing prescription drug coverage in reconciling the claims adjustments that create overpayments or underpayments. In carrying out these reimbursements and recoveries, Part D sponsors must also account for payments made and for amounts being held for payment by other individuals or entities. Part D sponsors must have systems to track and report adjustment transactions and to support all of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adjustments involving payments by other plans and programs providing prescription drug coverage have been made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reimbursements for excess cost-sharing and premiums for low-income subsidy eligible individuals have been processed in accordance with the requirements in Sec. 423.800(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Recoveries of erroneous payments for enrollees as specified in Sec. 423.464(f)(4) have been sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Reporting requirements. A Part D sponsor must report credible new or changed supplemental prescription drug coverage information to the CMS Coordination of Benefits Contractor in accordance with the processes and timeframes specified by CMS.
