                                Sec. 230.701  Exemption for offers and sales of securities pursuant to
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Preliminary Notes: 1. This section relates to transactions exempted  from the registration requirements of section 5 of the Act (15 U.S.C.  77e). These transactions are not exempt from the antifraud, civil  liability, or other provisions of the federal securities laws. Issuers  and persons acting on their behalf have an obligation to provide  investors with disclosure adequate to satisfy the antifraud provisions  of the federal securities laws.</p><p class="depth0">2. In addition to complying with this section, the issuer also must  comply with any applicable state law relating to the offer and sale of  securities.</p><p class="depth0">3. An issuer that attempts to comply with this section, but fails to  do so, may claim any other exemption that is available.</p><p class="depth0">4. This section is available only to the issuer of the securities.  Affiliates of the issuer may not use this section to offer or sell  securities. This section also does not cover resales of securities by  any person. This section provides an exemption only for the transactions  in which the securities are offered or sold by the issuer, not for the  securities themselves.</p><p class="depth0">5. The purpose of this section is to provide an exemption from the  registration requirements of the Act for securities issued in  compensatory circumstances. This section is not available for plans or  schemes to circumvent this purpose, such as to raise capital. This  section also is not available to exempt any transaction that is in  technical compliance with this section but is part of a plan or scheme  to evade the registration provisions of the Act. In any of these cases,  registration under the Act is required unless another exemption is  available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exemption. Offers and sales made in compliance with all of the  conditions of this section are exempt from section 5 of the Act (15  U.S.C. 77e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Issuers eligible to use this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. This section  is available to any issuer that is not subject to the reporting  requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of  1934 (the ``Exchange Act'') (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d)) and is not an  investment company registered or required to be registered under the  Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Issuers that become subject to reporting. If an issuer becomes  subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the  Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d)) after it has made offers  complying with this section, the issuer may nevertheless rely on this  section to sell the securities previously offered to the persons to whom  those offers were made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Guarantees by reporting companies. An issuer subject to the  reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15  U.S.C. 78m, 78o(d)) may rely on this section if it is merely  guaranteeing the payment of a subsidiary's securities that are sold  under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transactions exempted by this section. This section exempts  offers and sales of securities (including plan interests and guarantees  pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section) under a written  compensatory benefit plan (or written compensation contract) established  by the issuer, its parents, its majority-owned subsidiaries or majority- owned subsidiaries of the issuer's parent, for the participation of  their employees, directors, general partners, trustees (where the issuer  is a business trust), officers, or consultants and advisors, and their  family members who acquire such securities from such persons through  gifts or domestic relations orders. This section exempts offers and  sales to former employees, directors, general partners, trustees,  officers, consultants and advisors only if such persons were employed by  or providing services to the issuer at the time the securities were  offered. In addition, the term ``employee'' includes insurance agents  who are exclusive agents of the issuer, its subsidiaries or parents, or  derive more than 50% of their annual income from those entities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Special requirements for consultants and advisors. This section  is available to consultants and advisors only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> They are natural persons;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> They provide bona fide services to the issuer, its parents, its  majority-owned subsidiaries or majority-owned subsidiaries of the  issuer's parent; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The services are not in connection with the offer or sale of  securities in a capital-raising transaction, and do not directly or  indirectly promote or maintain a market for the issuer's securities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Definition of ``compensatory benefit plan.'' For purposes of  this section, a compensatory benefit plan is any purchase, savings,  option, bonus, stock appreciation, profit sharing, thrift, incentive,  deferred compensation, pension or similar plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Definition of ``family member.'' For purposes of this section,  family member includes any child, stepchild, grandchild, parent,  stepparent, grandparent, spouse, former spouse, sibling, niece, nephew,  mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in- law, or sister-in-law, including adoptive relationships, any person  sharing the employee's household (other than a tenant or employee), a  trust in which these persons have more than fifty percent of the  beneficial interest, a foundation in which these persons (or the  employee) control the management of assets, and any other entity in  which these persons (or the employee) own more than fifty percent of the  voting interests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Amounts that may be sold--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Offers. Any amount of securities  may be offered in reliance on this section. However, for purposes of  this section,   sales of securities underlying options must be counted as sales on the  date of the option grant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sales. The aggregate sales price or amount of securities sold in  reliance on this section during any consecutive 12-month period must not  exceed the greatest of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> $1,000,000;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 15% of the total assets of the issuer (or of the issuer's  parent if the issuer is a wholly-owned subsidiary and the securities  represent obligations that the parent fully and unconditionally  guarantees), measured at the issuer's most recent balance sheet date (if  no older than its last fiscal year end); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> 15% of the outstanding amount of the class of securities being  offered and sold in reliance on this section, measured at the issuer's  most recent balance sheet date (if no older than its last fiscal year  end).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rules for calculating prices and amounts--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Aggregate sales  price. The term aggregate sales price means the sum of all cash,  property, notes, cancellation of debt or other consideration received or  to be received by the issuer for the sale of the securities. Non-cash  consideration must be valued by reference to bona fide sales of that  consideration made within a reasonable time or, in the absence of such  sales, on the fair value as determined by an accepted standard. The  value of services exchanged for securities issued must be measured by  reference to the value of the securities issued. Options must be valued  based on the exercise price of the option.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Time of the calculation. With respect to options to purchase  securities, the aggregate sales price is determined when an option grant  is made (without regard to when the option becomes exercisable). With  respect to other securities, the calculation is made on the date of  sale. With respect to deferred compensation or similar plans, the  calculation is made when the irrevocable election to defer is made.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> of this section, treat the  securities underlying all currently exercisable or convertible options,  warrants, rights or other securities, other than those issued under this  exemption, as outstanding. In calculating the amount of securities sold  for other purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, count the amount  of securities that would be acquired upon exercise or conversion in  connection with sales of options, warrants, rights or other exercisable  or convertible securities, including those to be issued under this  exemption.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Other exemptions. Amounts of securities sold in reliance on  this section do not affect ``aggregate offering prices'' in other  exemptions, and amounts of securities sold in reliance on other  exemptions do not affect the amount that may be sold in reliance on this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Disclosure that must be provided. The issuer must deliver to  investors a copy of the compensatory benefit plan or the contract, as  applicable. In addition, if the aggregate sales price or amount of  securities sold during any consecutive 12-month period exceeds $5  million, the issuer must deliver the following disclosure to investors a  reasonable period of time before the date of sale:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income  Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA'') (29 U.S.C. 1104-1107), a copy of the  summary plan description required by ERISA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the plan is not subject to ERISA, a summary of the material  terms of the plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information about the risks associated with investment in the  securities sold pursuant to the compensatory benefit plan or  compensation contract; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Financial statements required to be furnished by Part F/S of  Form 1-A (Regulation A Offering Statement) (Sec. 239.90 of this  chapter) under Regulation A (Sec. Sec. 230.251 through 230.263).  Foreign private issuers as defined in Rule 405 must provide a  reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles in the United  States (U.S. GAAP) if their financial statements are not prepared in  accordance with U.S. GAAP or International Financial Reporting Standards  as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (Item 17 of  Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f   of this chapter)). The financial statements required by this section  must be as of a date no more than 180 days before the sale of securities  in reliance on this exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the issuer is relying on paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section  to use its parent's total assets to determine the amount of securities  that may be sold, the parent's financial statements must be delivered.  If the parent is subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or  15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d)), the financial  statements of the parent required by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X (Sec.  210.10-01 of this chapter) and Item 310 of Regulation D-B (Sec. 228.310  of this chapter), as applicable, must be delivered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the sale involves a stock option or other derivative  security, the issuer must deliver disclosure a reasonable period of time  before the date of exercise or conversion. For deferred compensation or  similar plans, the issuer must deliver disclosure to investors a  reasonable period of time before the date the irrevocable election to  defer is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> No integration with other offerings. Offers and sales exempt  under this section are deemed to be a part of a single, discrete  offering and are not subject to integration with any other offers or  sales, whether registered under the Act or otherwise exempt from the  registration requirements of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Resale limitations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Securities issued under this section are  deemed to be ``restricted securities'' as defined in Sec. 230.144.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Resales of securities issued pursuant to this section must be in  compliance with the registration requirements of the Act or an exemption  from those requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ninety days after the issuer becomes subject to the reporting  requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m  or 78o(d)), securities issued under this section may be resold by  persons who are not affiliates (as defined in Sec. 230.144) in reliance  on Sec. 230.144, without compliance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of  Sec. 230.144, and by affiliates without compliance with paragraph (d)  of Sec. 230.144.  [64 FR 11101, Mar. 8, 1999, as amended at 64 FR 61498, Nov. 12, 1999; 72  FR 71571, Dec. 17, 2007; 73 FR 1009, Jan. 4, 2008]    Sec. Sec. 230.702(T)-230.703(T)  [Reserved]</p><p class="depth3">Exemptions for Cross-Border Rights Offerings, Exchange Offers and</p><p class="depth3">Business Combinations</p><p class="depth3">Source: Sections 230.800 through 230.802 appear at 64 FR 61400, Nov.  10, 1999, unless otherwise noted.</p><p class="depth3">General Notes to Sec. Sec. 230.800, 230.801 and 230.802</p><p class="depth3">1. Sections 230.801 and 230.802 relate only to the applicability of  the registration provisions of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77e) and not to the  applicability of the anti-fraud, civil liability or other provisions of  the federal securities laws.</p><p class="depth3">2. The exemptions provided by Sec. 230.801 and Sec. 230.802 are  not available for any securities transaction or series of transactions  that technically complies with Sec. 230.801 and Sec. 230.802 but are  part of a plan or scheme to evade the registration provisions of the  Act.</p><p class="depth3">3. An issuer who relies on Sec. 230.801 or an offeror who relies on  Sec. 230.802 must still comply with the securities registration or  broker-dealer registration requirements of the Securities Exchange Act  of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) and any other applicable provisions of  the federal securities laws.</p><p class="depth3">4. An issuer who relies on Sec. 230.801 or an offeror who relies on  Sec. 230.802 must still comply with any applicable state laws relating  to the offer and sale of securities.</p><p class="depth3">5. Attempted compliance with Sec. 230.801 or Sec. 230.802 does not  act as an exclusive election; an issuer making an offer or sale of  securities in reliance on Sec. 230.801 or Sec. 230.802 may also rely  on any other applicable exemption from the registration requirements of  the Act.</p><p class="depth3">6. Section 230.801 and Sec. 230.802 provide exemptions only for the  issuer of the securities and not for any affiliate of that issuer or for  any other person for resales of the issuer's securities. These sections  provide exemptions only for the transaction in which the issuer or other  person offers or sells the securities, not for the securities  themselves. Securities acquired in a Sec. 230.801 or Sec. 230.802  transaction may be resold in the United States only if they are  registered under the Act or an exemption from registration is available.</p><p class="depth3">7. Unregistered offers and sales made outside the United States will  not affect contemporaneous offers and sales made in compliance with  Sec. 230.801 or Sec. 230.802. A transaction that complies with Sec.  230.801 or Sec. 230.802 will not be integrated with offerings exempt  under other provisions of the Act, even if both transactions occur at  the same time.</p><p class="depth3">8. Securities acquired in a rights offering under Sec. 230.801 are  ``restricted securities'' within the meaning of Sec. 230.144(a)(3) to  the same extent and proportion that the securities held by the security  holder as of the record date for the rights offering were restricted  securities. Likewise, securities acquired in an exchange offer or  business combination subject to Sec. 230.802 are ``restricted  securities'' within the meaning of Sec. 230.144(a)(3) to the same  extent and proportion that the securities tendered or exchanged by the  security holder in that transaction were restricted securities.</p><p class="depth3">9. Section 230.801 does not apply to a rights offering by an  investment company registered or required to be registered under the  Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.), other than a  registered closed-end investment company. Section 230.802 does not apply  to exchange offers or business combinations by an investment company  registered or required to be registered under the Investment Company Act  of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.), other than a registered closed-end  investment company.</p>
