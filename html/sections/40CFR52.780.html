The Indiana 326 IAC regulations do not include a definition of ``federally enforceable''. On July 13, 1994, Pamela Carter, Attorney General of the State of Indiana, sent a letter to USEPA clarifying Indiana's interpretation of the definition of federally enforceable. The letter states that federally enforceable, e.g. as used in 326 IAC 2-3-1, should be interpreted in accordance with the federal definition at 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(xiv). The USEPA took

the opportunity of rulemaking on the State's submittal to recodify the permitting SIP to conform to Title 326 the Indiana Administrative Code.
