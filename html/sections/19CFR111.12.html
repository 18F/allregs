                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Submission of application and fee. An application for a broker's license must be submitted in duplicate to the director of the port where the applicant intends to do business. The application must be under oath and executed on Customs Form 3124. The application must be accompanied by the $200 application fee prescribed in Sec. 111.96(a) and one copy of the appropriate attachment required by the application form (Articles of Agreement or an affidavit signed by all partners, Articles of Agreement of the association, or the Articles of Incorporation). If the applicant proposes to operate under a trade or fictitious name in one or more States, evidence of the applicant's authority to use the name in each of those States must accompany the application. An application for an individual license must be submitted within the 3-year period after the applicant took and passed the written examination referred to in Sec. Sec. 111.11(a)(4) and 111.13. The port director may require an individual applicant to provide a copy of the notification that he passed the written examination (see Sec. 111.13(e)) and will require the applicant to submit fingerprints on form FD 258 or electronically at the time of filing the application. The port director may reject an application as improperly filed if the application, on its face, demonstrates that one or more of the basic requirements set forth in Sec. 111.11 have not been met at the time of filing, in which case the application and fee will be returned to the filer without further action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Posting notice of application. Following receipt of the application, the port director will post a notice that the application has been filed. The notice will be posted conspicuously for at least 2 consecutive weeks in the customhouse at the port and similarly at

any other port where the applicant also proposes to maintain an office. The notice also will be posted by appropriate electronic means. The notice will give the name and address of the applicant and, if the applicant is a partnership, association, or corporation, will state the names of all members or officers who are licensed as brokers. The notice will invite written comments or information regarding the issuance of the license.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Withdrawal of application. An applicant for a broker's license may withdraw the application at any time prior to issuance of the license by providing written notice of the withdrawal to the port director. However, withdrawal of the application does not entitle the applicant to a refund of the $200 application fee.
