Multi-fueled vehicles (including dual-fueled and flexible-fueled vehicles) shall comply with all requirements established for each consumed fuel (or blend of fuels in the case of flexible fueled vehicles). The standards of this subpart apply to both certification and in-use vehicles unless otherwise indicated.

Other than these exceptions, such strategies which are invoked based on manifold pressure, engine speed, throttle position, or other engine parameters must use the same engine parameter criteria for the invoking of this air-fuel enrichment strategy and the same degree of enrichment regardless of whether the A/C is on or off. ``Open-loop'' or ``commanded'' air-fuel enrichment strategy is defined as enrichment of the air to fuel ratio beyond stoichiometry for the purposes of increasing engine power output and the protection of engine or emissions control hardware. However, ``closed-loop biasing,'' defined as small changes in the air-fuel ratio for the

purposes of optimizing vehicle emissions or driveability, must not be considered an ``open-loop'' or ``commanded'' air-fuel enrichment strategy. In addition, ``transient'' air-fuel enrichment strategy (or ``tip-in'' and ``tip-out'' enrichment), defined as the temporary use of an air-fuel ratio rich of stoichiometry at the beginning or duration of rapid throttle motion, must not be considered an ``open-loop'' or ``commanded'' air-fuel enrichment strategy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> ``Lean-on-cruise'' calibration strategies. (i) For Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 vehicles, the manufacturer must state in the Application for Certification whether any ``lean-on-cruise'' strategies are incorporated into the vehicle design. A ``lean-on-cruise'' air-fuel calibration strategy is defined as the use of an air-fuel ratio significantly greater than stoichiometry, during non-deceleration conditions at speeds above 40 mph. ``Lean-on-cruise'' air-fuel calibration strategies must not be employed during vehicle operation in normal driving conditions, including A/C usage, unless at least one of the following conditions is met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 vehicles, the manufacturer must state in the Application for Certification whether any ``lean-on-cruise'' strategies are incorporated into the vehicle design.

The spitback standard also applies to newly assembled vehicles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For certification testing only, manufacturers may conduct testing to quantify a level of non-fuel background emissions for an individual test vehicle. Such a demonstration must include a description of the source(s) of emissions and an estimated decay rate. The demonstrated level of non-fuel background emissions may be subtracted from evaporative emission test results from certification vehicles if approved in advance by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All fuel vapor generated in a gasoline- or methanol-fueled light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, or complete heavy-duty vehicle during in-use operation shall be routed exclusively to the evaporative control system (e.g., either canister or engine purge.) The only exception to this requirement shall be for emergencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For certification purposes, where the applicable California evaporative emission standard is as stringent or more stringent than the applicable federal evaporative emission standard, the Administrator may accept California certification test data indicating compliance with the California standard to demonstrate compliance with the appropriate federal certification evaporative emission standard. The Administrator may require the manufacturer to provide comparative test data which clearly demonstrates that a vehicle meeting the California evaporative standard (when tested under California test conditions/test procedures) will also meet the appropriate federal evaporative emission standard when tested under federal test conditions/test procedures described in this part 86.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Refueling emissions general provisions--(1) Implementation schedules.

Vehicles waived from the emission standards under the provisions of paragraphs (m) and (n) of

this section shall not be counted in the calculation of the percentage of compliance.
