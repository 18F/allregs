If you own or operate a non-operational stationary RICE that is subject to performance testing, you do not need to start up the engine solely to conduct the performance test. Owners and operators of a non-operational engine can conduct the performance test when the engine is started up again. The test must be conducted at any load condition within plus or minus 10 percent of 100 percent load for the stationary RICE listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Non-emergency 4SRB stationary RICE with a site rating of greater than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> New non-emergency 4SLB stationary RICE with a site rating of greater than or equal to 250 brake HP

located at a major source of HAP emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> New non-emergency 2SLB stationary RICE with a site rating of greater than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> New non-emergency CI stationary RICE with a site rating of greater than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must conduct three separate test runs for each performance test required in this section, as specified in Sec. 63.7(e)(3).

If pollutant concentrations are to be corrected to 15 percent oxygen and CO2 concentration is measured in lieu of oxygen concentration measurement, a CO2 correction factor is needed. Calculate the CO2 correction factor as described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Calculate the fuel-specific Fo value for the fuel burned during the test using values obtained from Method 19, Section 5.2, and the following equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30JA13.008

You must not conduct the initial performance test until after the petition has been approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If you petition the Administrator for approval of operating limitations, your petition must include the information described in paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification of the specific parameters you propose to use as operating limitations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A discussion of the relationship between these parameters and HAP emissions, identifying how HAP emissions change with changes in these parameters, and how limitations on these parameters will serve to limit HAP emissions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A discussion of how you will establish the upper and/or lower values for these parameters which will establish the limits on these parameters in the operating limitations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A discussion identifying the methods you will use to measure and the instruments you will use to monitor these parameters, as well as the relative accuracy and precision of these methods and instruments; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A discussion identifying the frequency and methods for recalibrating the instruments you will use for monitoring these parameters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If you petition the Administrator for approval of no operating limitations, your petition must include the information described in paragraphs (h)(1) through (7) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification of the parameters associated with operation of the stationary RICE and any emission control device which could change intentionally (e.g., operator adjustment, automatic controller adjustment, etc.) or unintentionally (e.g., wear and tear, error, etc.) on a routine basis or over time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A discussion of the relationship, if any, between changes in the parameters and changes in HAP emissions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For the parameters which could change in such a way as to increase HAP emissions, a discussion of whether establishing limitations on the parameters would serve to limit HAP emissions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For the parameters which could change in such a way as to increase HAP emissions, a discussion of how you could establish upper and/or lower values for the parameters which would establish limits on the parameters in operating limitations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For the parameters, a discussion identifying the methods you could use to measure them and the instruments you could use to monitor them, as well as the relative accuracy and precision of the methods and instruments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For the parameters, a discussion identifying the frequency and methods for recalibrating the instruments you could use to monitor them; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A discussion of why, from your point of view, it is infeasible or unreasonable to adopt the parameters as operating limitations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The engine percent load during a performance test must be determined by documenting the calculations, assumptions, and measurement devices

used to measure or estimate the percent load in a specific application. A written report of the average percent load determination must be included in the notification of compliance status. The following information must be included in the written report: the engine model number, the engine manufacturer, the year of purchase, the manufacturer's site-rated brake horsepower, the ambient temperature, pressure, and humidity during the performance test, and all assumptions that were made to estimate or calculate percent load during the performance test must be clearly explained. If measurement devices such as flow meters, kilowatt meters, beta analyzers, stain gauges, etc. are used, the model number of the measurement device, and an estimate of its accurate in percentage of true value must be provided.
