                            <p class="depth0">Persons actually or potentially affected by the Act or regulations  in this Part may request an interpretation of the Act or regulations by  writing to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Office, Suite 2110,  Department of the Treasury, 1425 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20220,  giving a detailed explanation of the facts and circumstances and the  reason why an interpretation is needed. A requester should segregate and  mark any confidential business or trade secret information clearly.  Treasury in its discretion will provide written responses to requests  for interpretation. Treasury reserves the right to decline to provide a  response in any case. Except in the case of any confidential business or  trade secret information, Treasury will make written requests for  interpretations and responses publicly available at the Treasury  Department Library, on the Treasury Web site, or through other means as  soon as practicable after the response has been provided. Treasury will  handle any subsequent request for information that had been designated  by a requester as confidential business or trade secret information in  accordance with Treasury's Freedom of Information Act regulations at 31  CFR Part 1.
