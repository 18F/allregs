The present value of the smelter's  future net cash flow (during and after investment in constant control  technology) is more than book value of the smelter's net investment in  constant dollars.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The profit protection test. The constant control technology  expenditure reduces the present value of the smelter's forecast pretax  profits by less than 50%.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When applying for an NSO, a smelter must establish, for purposes  of applying the financial eligibility tests, which adequately  demonstrated constant control technology applicable to that smelter is  the most economically feasible for use at that smelter.
