                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> On November 9, 1999, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a request for delegation of authority to implement and enforce the Federal Plan (40 CFR part 62, subpart FFF) for Large Municipal Waste Combustors (MWC).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Identification of sources: The Federal Plan applies to existing facilities with a MWC unit capacity greater than 250 tons per day of municipal solid waste.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> On January 17, 2001, EPA prepared and signed a Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) between the EPA and the NJDEP that defines the policies, responsibilities, and procedures pursuant to 40 CFR part 62, subpart FFF and 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cb, by which the Federal Plan for large MWCs will be administered by both the NJDEP and EPA. On January 24, 2001, Robert C. Shinn, Commissioner NJDEP, signed the MOA, therefore agreeing to the terms and conditions of the MOA and accepting responsibility to enforce and implement the policies, responsibilities, and procedures of the Federal Plan for large MWCs.
