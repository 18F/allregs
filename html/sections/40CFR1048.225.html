                            <p class="depth0">Before we issue you a certificate of conformity, you may amend your  application to include new or modified engine configurations, subject to  the provisions of this section. After we have issued your certificate of  conformity, you may send us an amended application requesting that we  include new or modified engine configurations   within the scope of the certificate, subject to the provisions of this  section. You must amend your application if any changes occur with  respect to any information included in your application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must amend your application before you take any of the  following actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Add an engine configuration to an engine family. In this case,  the engine configuration added must be consistent with other engine  configurations in the engine family with respect to the criteria listed  in Sec.  1048.230.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Change an engine configuration already included in an engine  family in a way that may affect emissions, or change any of the  components you described in your application for certification. This  includes production and design changes that may affect emissions any  time during the engine's lifetime.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To amend your application for certification, send the Designated  Compliance Officer the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Describe in detail the addition or change in the engine model or  configuration you intend to make.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include engineering evaluations or data showing that the amended  engine family complies with all applicable requirements. You may do this  by showing that the original emission-data engine is still appropriate  for showing that the amended family complies with all applicable  requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the original emission-data engine for the engine family is  not appropriate to show compliance for the new or modified engine  configuration, include new test data showing that the new or modified  engine configuration meets the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We may ask for more test data or engineering evaluations. You  must give us these within 30 days after we request them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For engine families already covered by a certificate of  conformity, we will determine whether the existing certificate of  conformity covers your newly added or modified engine. You may ask for a  hearing if we deny your request (see Sec.  1048.820).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> is deemed to be  consent to recall all engines that we determine do not meet applicable  emission standards or other requirements and to remedy the nonconformity  at no expense to the owner. If you do not provide information required  under paragraph (c) of this section within 30 days after we request it,  you must stop producing the new or modified engines.
