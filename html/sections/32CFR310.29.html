                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use of specific exemptions. The specific exemption established  by 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) of the Privacy Act may be claimed to protect records  that meet the following criteria (parenthetical references are to the  appropriate subsection of the Act:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, (DoD 5200.1- R) (see also paragraph (c) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>. Investigatory information compiled for law-enforcement  purposes, other than information that is covered by the general  exemption (see Sec. 310.28). If an individual is denied any right,  privilege or benefit he or she is otherwise entitled by Federal law or  for which he or she would otherwise be eligible as a result of the  maintenance of the information, the individual shall be provided access  to the information except to the extent that disclosure would reveal the  identity of a confidential source. This exemption provides limited  protection of investigative reports maintained in a system of records  used in personnel or administrative actions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The information must be compiled for some investigative law  enforcement purpose, such as a criminal investigation by a DoD office,  whose principal function is not law enforcement, or a civil  investigation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The exemption does not apply to investigations conducted solely  for the purpose of a routine background investigation (see paragraph  (a)(5) of this section), but will apply if the investigation is for the  purpose of investigating DoD personnel who are suspected of violating  statutory or regulatory authority.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The exemption can continue to be claimed even after the  investigation has concluded and there is no future likelihood of further  enforcement proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>. Records maintained in connection with providing  protective services to the President and other individuals under 18  U.S.C. 3056, ``Powers, Authorities, and Duties of United States Secret  Service.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em>. Records maintained solely for statistical research or  program evaluation purposes and that are not used to make decisions on  the rights, benefits, or entitlement of an individual except for census  records that may be disclosed under 13 U.S.C. 6, ``Information for other  Federal Departments and Agencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em>. Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose  of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal  civilian employment, military service, Federal contracts, or access to  classified information, but only to the extent such material would  reveal the identity of a confidential source.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> This exemption permits protection of confidential sources used  in background investigations, employment inquiries, and similar  inquiries that are for personnel screening to determine suitability,  eligibility, or qualifications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> This exemption is applicable not only to investigations  conducted prior to the hiring of an employee, but it also applies to  investigations conducted to determine continued employment suitability  or eligibility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em>. Testing or examination material used solely to determine  individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal or  military service, if the disclosure would compromise the objectivity or  fairness of the test or examination process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em>. Evaluation material used to determine potential for  promotion in the Military Services, but only to the extent that the  disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a confidential  source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Promises of confidentiality. (1) Only the identity of sources  that have been given an express promise of confidentiality may be  protected from disclosure under paragraphs (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, (5), and (7) of this  section. However, the identity of sources who were given implied  promises of confidentiality in inquiries conducted before September 27,  1975, also may be protected from disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ensure promises of confidentiality are not automatically given  but are used sparingly. Establish appropriate procedures and identify  fully categories of individuals who may make such promises. Promises of  confidentiality shall be made only when they are essential to obtain the  information sought (see 5 CFR part 736).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Access to records for which specific exemptions are claimed.  Deny the individual access only to those portions of the records for  which the claimed exemption applies.</p>
