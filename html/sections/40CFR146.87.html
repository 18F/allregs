                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> During the drilling and construction of a Class VI injection  well, the owner or operator must run appropriate logs, surveys and tests  to determine or verify the depth, thickness, porosity, permeability, and  lithology of, and the salinity of any formation fluids in all relevant  geologic formations to ensure conformance with the injection well  construction requirements under Sec.  146.86 and to establish accurate  baseline data against which future measurements may be compared. The  owner or operator must submit to the Director a descriptive report  prepared by a knowledgeable log analyst that includes an interpretation  of the results of such logs and tests. At a minimum, such logs and tests  must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Deviation checks during drilling on all holes constructed by  drilling a pilot hole which is enlarged by reaming or another method.  Such checks must be at sufficiently frequent intervals to determine the  location of the borehole and to ensure that vertical avenues for   fluid movement in the form of diverging holes are not created during  drilling; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before and upon installation of the surface casing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Resistivity, spontaneous potential, and caliper logs before the  casing is installed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A cement bond and variable density log to evaluate cement  quality radially, and a temperature log after the casing is set and  cemented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Before and upon installation of the long string casing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Resistivity, spontaneous potential, porosity, caliper, gamma  ray, fracture finder logs, and any other logs the Director requires for  the given geology before the casing is installed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A cement bond and variable density log, and a temperature log  after the casing is set and cemented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A series of tests designed to demonstrate the internal and  external mechanical integrity of injection wells, which may include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A pressure test with liquid or gas;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A tracer survey such as oxygen-activation logging;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A temperature or noise log;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A casing inspection log; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any alternative methods that provide equivalent or better  information and that are required by and/or approved of by the Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The owner or operator must take whole cores or sidewall cores of  the injection zone and confining system and formation fluid samples from  the injection zone(s), and must submit to the Director a detailed report  prepared by a log analyst that includes: Well log analyses (including  well logs), core analyses, and formation fluid sample information. The  Director may accept information on cores from nearby wells if the owner  or operator can demonstrate that core retrieval is not possible and that  such cores are representative of conditions at the well. The Director  may require the owner or operator to core other formations in the  borehole.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The owner or operator must record the fluid temperature, pH,  conductivity, reservoir pressure, and static fluid level of the  injection zone(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> At a minimum, the owner or operator must determine or calculate  the following information concerning the injection and confining  zone(s):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fracture pressure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other physical and chemical characteristics of the injection and  confining zone(s); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Physical and chemical characteristics of the formation fluids in  the injection zone(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Upon completion, but prior to operation, the owner or operator  must conduct the following tests to verify hydrogeologic characteristics  of the injection zone(s):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A pressure fall-off test; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A pump test; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Injectivity tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The owner or operator must provide the Director with the  opportunity to witness all logging and testing by this subpart. The  owner or operator must submit a schedule of such activities to the  Director 30 days prior to conducting the first test and submit any  changes to the schedule 30 days prior to the next scheduled test.</p>
