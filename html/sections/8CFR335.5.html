                            <p class="depth0">In the event that USCIS receives derogatory information concerning  an applicant whose application has already been granted as provided in  Sec. 335.3(a) of this chapter, but who has not yet taken the oath of  allegiance as provided in part 337 of this chapter, USCIS shall remove  the applicant's name from any list of granted applications or of  applicants scheduled for administration of the oath of allegiance, until  such time as the matter can be resolved. USCIS shall notify the  applicant in writing of the receipt of the specific derogatory  information, with a motion to reopen the previously adjudicated  application, giving the applicant 15 days to respond. If the applicant  overcomes the derogatory information, the application will be granted  and the applicant will be scheduled for administration of the oath of  allegiance. Otherwise the motion to reopen will be granted and the  application will   be denied pursuant to Sec. 336.1 of this chapter.
