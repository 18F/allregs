The use of non- radioactive substitute contents is encouraged provided that the results  of the testing take into account the radioactive characteristics of the  contents for which the package is being tested;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reference to a previous, satisfactory demonstration of  compliance of a sufficiently similar nature;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Performance of tests with models of appropriate scale  incorporating those features that are significant with respect to the  item under investigation, when engineering experience has shown results  of those tests to be suitable for design purposes. When a scale model is  used, the need for adjusting certain test parameters, such as the  penetrator diameter or the compressive load, must be taken into account;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Calculations or reasoned evaluation, using reliable and  conservative procedures and parameters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> With respect to the initial conditions for the tests under  Secs. 173.465 through 173.469, except for the water immersion tests,  compliance must be based upon the assumption that the package is in  equilibrium at an ambient temperature of 38 C (100 F).
