Federal awarding agencies must not impose additional or inconsistent requirements, except as provided in Secs. 200.102 Exceptions and 200.210 Information contained in a Federal award, or unless specifically required by Federal statute, regulation, or Executive Order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This part provides the basis for a systematic and periodic collection and uniform submission by Federal agencies of information on all Federal financial assistance programs to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

Subparts B through D of this part set forth the uniform administrative requirements for grant and cooperative agreements, including the requirements for Federal awarding agency management of Federal grant programs before the

These provisions also provide the policies and procedures for Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities when using the results of these audits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For OMB guidance to Federal awarding agencies on Challenges and Prizes, please see M-10-11 Guidance on the Use of Challenges and Prizes to Promote Open Government, issued March 8, 2010, or its successor.</p>
