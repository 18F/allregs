An investigation to  which this subpart B relates will be instituted promptly after the  receipt from the President of a request for the views of the Commission  with regard to the matters indicated in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Public hearings. If, in the judgment of the Commission, there is  good and sufficient reason therefor, the Commission, in the course of  its investigation, will hold a public hearing and afford interested  parties opportunity to appear and be heard at such hearing. If no notice  of public hearing issues concurrently with a notice of investigation,  any interested party who believes that a public hearing should be held  may, within thirty (30) days after the date of publication in the  Federal Register of the notice of investigation, submit a request in  writing to the Secretary of the Commission that a public hearing be  held, stating the reasons for such request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Written statements.

If a public hearing is held in the  investigation, a statement may be received in lieu of or in addition to  appearance at the hearing.
