                                Sec. 1412.71  Election of ARC or PLC.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All of the current producers on a farm must make a one-time  election that is both:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unanimous, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Irrevocable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The election by current producers is to obtain--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Either PLC or ARC-CO on a covered commodity-by-covered-commodity  basis on the farm; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ARC-IC for all covered commodities on the farm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The election will be based on the 2014 farm structure (including  any reconstitutions of farms that were initiated by August 1, 2014).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Valid elections specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this  section by current producers will apply to the 2014 farm structure and  2014 producers on the farm. The valid election will also apply to any  subsequent year parent to the farm reconstitution as well as farms  resulting from the parent farm as specified in Sec. 1412.73. Neither  the requesting of a farm reconstitution nor the reconstitution of any  farm will impact either the requirement that all current producers on a  farm must make the unanimous irrevocable election in the defined  election period or the valid election that was previously made by those  current producers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> FSA will process elections from current producers on a farm  based on the election as submitted. For example, if the current  producers of a farm attest that they are all or the only current  producers on the farm and FSA later learns that there was another  current producer at the time of election who did not agree to the  election, the election is invalid. If at any time FSA determines that an  election fails to satisfy the requirements of this subpart because it  did not include the unanimous agreement of all current producers on the  farm at the time of election, the election will immediately be invalid.  This is not a compliance provision. Only valid elections by all current  producers will be recognized and used by CCC. All ARC and PLC payments  that were issued to any producers on a farm based on an election later  determined by CCC to be invalid, for whatever reason, regardless of  whether those producers who were issued unearned payments personally  made or participated in the invalid election, must be refunded with  interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Election is separate from enrollment; producers on farms that  have validly completed an election by the current producers in the  prescribed election period must still annually enroll as specified in  subpart D for PLC and ARC payments, as applicable.</p>
