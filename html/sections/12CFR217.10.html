                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Minimum capital requirements. A Board-regulated institution must maintain the following minimum capital ratios:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A tier 1 capital ratio of 6 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A total capital ratio of 8 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A leverage ratio of 4 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For advanced approaches Board-regulated institutions, a supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Standardized capital ratio calculations. Other than as provided in paragraph (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Common equity tier 1 capital ratio. A Board-regulated institution's common equity tier 1 capital ratio is the ratio of the Board-regulated institution's common equity tier 1 capital to standardized total risk-weighted assets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Tier 1 capital ratio. A Board-regulated institution's tier 1 capital ratio is the ratio of the Board-regulated institution's tier 1 capital to standardized total risk-weighted assets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Total capital ratio. A Board-regulated institution's total capital ratio is the ratio of the Board-regulated institution's total capital to standardized total risk-weighted assets; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Leverage ratio. A Board-regulated institution's leverage ratio is the ratio of the Board-regulated institution's tier 1 capital to the Board-regulated institution's average total consolidated assets as reported on the Board-regulated institution's Call Report, for a state member bank, or the Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (FR Y-9C), for a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company, as applicable minus amounts deducted from tier 1 capital under Sec. 217.22(a), (c) and (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Advanced approaches capital ratio calculations. An advanced approaches Board-regulated institution that has

completed the parallel run process and received notification from the Board pursuant to Sec. 217.121(d) must determine its regulatory capital ratios as described in this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Common equity tier 1 capital ratio. The Board-regulated institution's common equity tier 1 capital ratio is the lower of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The ratio of the Board-regulated institution's common equity tier 1 capital to standardized total risk-weighted assets; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The ratio of the Board-regulated institution's common equity tier 1 capital to advanced approaches total risk-weighted assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Tier 1 capital ratio. The Board-regulated institution's tier 1 capital ratio is the lower of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The ratio of the Board-regulated institution's tier 1 capital to standardized total risk-weighted assets; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The ratio of the Board-regulated institution's tier 1 capital to advanced approaches total risk-weighted assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Total capital ratio.

A Board-regulated institution's advanced-approaches-adjusted total capital is the Board-regulated institution's total capital after being adjusted as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An advanced approaches Board-regulated institution must deduct from its total capital any allowance for loan and lease losses included in its tier 2 capital in accordance with Sec. 217.20(d)(3); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An advanced approaches Board-regulated institution must add to its total capital any eligible credit reserves that exceed the Board-regulated institution's total expected credit losses to the extent that the excess reserve amount does not exceed 0.6 percent of the Board-regulated institution's credit risk-weighted assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Supplementary leverage ratio.
