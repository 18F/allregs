However, this limitation does not apply to a wage adjustment during the 90 day period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each demand shall specify a date (the same as or subsequent to the date of the delivery of the demand) as to when the revised prices shall be effective. This date is the effective date of the price revision.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the Contractor makes a demand under this clause, the demand shall briefly state the basis of the demand and include the statements and data referred to in paragraph (d) of this clause.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the demand is made by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish the statements and data within 30 days of the delivery of the demand.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Submission of data.

The Contractor shall support its request with--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An estimate of the changes in cost resulting from the retroactive wage adjustment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Complete information upon which the estimate is based; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A certified copy of the collective bargaining agreement, arbitration award, or other document evidencing the retroactive wage adjustment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subject to the limitation in paragraph (g)(2) of this clause as to the time of making a request, completion or termination of this contract shall not affect the Contractor's right under paragraph (g) of this clause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In case of disagreement concerning any question of fact, including whether any adjustment should be made, or the amount of such adjustment, the disagreement will be resolved in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing of any request by or on behalf of the employees of the Contractor which may result in a retroactive wage adjustment.
