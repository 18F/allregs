                                Sec.  73.658  Affiliation agreements and network program practices;
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exclusive affiliation of station. No license shall be granted to  a television broadcast station having any contract, arrangement, or  understanding, express or implied, with a network organization under  which the station is prevented or hindered from, or penalized for,  broadcasting the programs of any other network organization. (The term  ``network organization'' as used in this section includes national and  regional network organizations. See ch. VII, J, of Report on Chain  Broadcasting.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Territorial exclusively. No license shall be granted to a  television broadcast station having any contract, arrangement, or  understanding, express or implied, with a network organization which  prevents or hinders another broadcast station located in the same  community from broadcasting the network's programs not taken by the  former station, or which prevents or hinders another broadcast station  located in a different community from broadcasting any program of the  network organization. This section shall not be construed to prohibit  any contract, arrangement, or understanding between a station and a  network organization pursuant to which the station is granted the first  call in its community upon the programs of the network organization. As  employed in this paragraph, the term ``community'' is defined as the  community specified in the instrument of authorization as the location  of the station.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Station commitment of broadcast time. No license shall be  granted to a television broadcast station having any contract,  arrangement, or understanding, express or implied, with any network  organization, which provides for optioning of the station's time to the  network organization, or which has the same restraining effect as time  optioning. As used in this section, time optioning is any contract,  arrangement, or understanding, express or implied, between a station and  a network organization which prevents or hinders the station from  scheduling programs before the network agrees to utilize the time during  which such programs are scheduled, or which requires the station to  clear time already scheduled when the network organization seeks to  utilize the time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Right to reject programs. No license shall be granted to a  television broadcast station having any contract, arrangement, or  understanding, express or implied, with a network organization which,  with respect to programs offered or already contracted for pursuant to  an affiliation contract, prevents or hinders the station from:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rejecting or refusing network programs which the station  reasonably believes to be unsatisfactory or unsuitable or contrary to  the public interest, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Substituting a program which, in the station's opinion, is of  greater local or national importance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Dual network operation. A television broadcast station may  affiliate with a person or entity that maintains two or more networks of  television broadcast stations unless such dual or multiple networks are  composed of two or more persons or entities that, on February 8, 1996,  were ``networks'' as defined in Sec.  73.3613(a)(1) of the Commission's  regulations (that is, ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Control by networks of station rates. No license shall be  granted to a television broadcast station having any contract,  arrangement, or understanding, express or implied, with a network  organization under which the station is prevented or hindered from, or  penalized for, fixing or altering its rates for the sale of broadcast  time for other than the network's programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> No license shall be granted to a television broadcast station  which is represented for the sale of non-network time by a network  organization or by an organization directly or indirectly controlled by  or under common control with a network organization, if the station has  any contract, arrangement or understanding, express or implied, which  provides for the affiliation of the   station with such network organization: Provided, however, That this  rule shall not be applicable to stations licensed to a network  organization or to a subsidiary of a network organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)-(l)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Territorial exclusivity in non-network arrangements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No  television station shall enter into any contract, arrangement, or  understanding, expressed or implied; with a non-network program  producer, distributor, or supplier, or other person; which prevents or  hinders another television station located in a community over 56.3  kilometers (35 miles) away, as determined by the reference points  contained in Sec.  76.53 of this chapter, (if reference points for a  community are not listed in Sec.  76.53, the location of the main post  office will be used) from broadcasting any program purchased by the  former station from such non-network program producer, distributor,  supplier, or other person, except that a television station may secure  exclusivity against a television station licensed to another designated  community in a hyphenated market specified in the market listing as  contained in Sec.  76.51 of this chapter for those 100 markets listed,  and for markets not listed in Sec.  76.51 of this chapter, the listing  as contained in the Nielsen Media Research DMA Rankings for the most  recent year at the time that the exclusivity contract, arrangement or  understanding is complete under practices of the industry. As used in  this paragraph, the term ``community'' is defined as the community  specified in the instrument of authorization as the location of the  station.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (m)(1) of this section, a television  station may enter into a contract, arrangement, or understanding with a  producer, supplier, or distributor of a non-network program if that  contract, arrangement, or understanding provides that the broadcast  station has exclusive national rights such that no other television  station in the United States may broadcast the program.</p><p class="depth3">Note 1: Contracts, arrangements, or understandings that are complete  under the practices of the industry prior to August 7, 1973, will not be  disturbed. Extensions or renewals of such agreements are not permitted  because they would in effect be new agreements without competitive  bidding. However, such agreements that were based on the broadcaster's  advancing ``seed money'' for the production of a specific program or  series that specify two time periods--a tryout period and period  thereafter for general exhibition--may be extended or renewed as  contemplated in the basic agreement.</p><p class="depth3">Note 2: It is intended that the top 100 major television markets  listed in Sec.  76.51 of this chapter shall be used for the purposes of  this rule and that the listing of the top 100 television markets  appearing in the ARB Television Market Analysis shall not be used. The  reference in this rule to the listing of markets in the ARB Television  Market Analysis refers to hyphenated markets below the top-100 markets  contained in the ARB Television Market Analysis. If a community is  listed in a hyphenated market in Sec.  76.51 and is also listed in one  of the markets in the ARB listing, the listing in Sec.  76.51 shall  govern.</p><p class="depth3">Note 3: The provisions of this paragraph apply only to U.S.  commercial television broadcast stations in the 50 states, and not to  stations in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands, foreign stations or  noncommercial educational television or ``public'' television stations  (either by way of restrictions on their exclusivity or on exclusivity  against them).</p><p class="depth3">Note 4: New stations authorized in any community of a hyphenated  market listed in Sec.  76.51 of this chapter or in any community of a  hyphenated market listed in the ARB Television Market Analysis (for  markets below the top-100 markets) are subject to the same rules as  previously existing stations therein. New stations authorized in other  communities are considered stations in separate markets unless and until  Sec.  76.51 is amended by Commission action, or the ARB listing is  changed.  (Sec. 5, 48 Stat. 1068 (47 U.S.C. 155))  [28 FR 13660, Dec. 14, 1963]</p><p class="depth3">Editorial Note: For Federal Register citations affecting Sec.   73.658, see the List of CFR Sections Affected, which appears in the  Finding Aids section of the printed volume and at www.fdsys.gov.
