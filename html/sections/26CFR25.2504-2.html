                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Gifts made before August 6, 1997. If the time has expired within which a tax may be assessed under chapter 12 of the Internal Revenue Code (or under corresponding provisions of prior laws) on the transfer of property by gift made during a preceding calendar period, as defined in Sec. 25.2502-1(c)(2), the gift was made prior to August 6, 1997, and a tax has been assessed or paid for such prior calendar period, the value of the gift, for purposes of arriving at the correct amount of the taxable gifts for the preceding calendar periods (as defined under Sec. 25.2504-1(a)), is the value used in computing the tax for the last preceding calendar period for which a tax was assessed or paid under chapter 12 of the Internal Revenue Code or the corresponding provisions of prior laws. However, this rule does not apply where no tax was paid or assessed for the prior calendar period. Furthermore, this rule does not apply to adjustments involving issues other than valuation. See Sec. 25.2504-1(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Gifts made or section 2701(d) taxable events occurring after August 5, 1997. If the time has expired under section 6501 within which a gift tax may be assessed under chapter 12 of the Internal Revenue Code (or under corresponding provisions of prior laws) on the transfer of property by gift made during a preceding calendar period, as defined in Sec. 25.2502-1(c)(2), or with respect to an increase in taxable gifts required under section 2701(d) and Sec. 25.2701-4, and the gift was made, or the section 2701(d) taxable event occurred, after August 5, 1997, the amount of the taxable gift or the amount of the increase in taxable gifts, for purposes of determining the correct amount of taxable gifts for the preceding calendar periods (as defined in Sec. 25.2504-1(a)), is the amount that is finally determined for gift tax purposes (within the meaning of Sec. 20.2001-1(c) of this chapter) and such amount may not be thereafter adjusted. The rule of this paragraph (b) applies to adjustments involving all issues relating to the gift including valuation issues and legal issues involving the interpretation of the gift tax law. For purposes of determining if the time has expired within which a gift tax may be assessed, see Sec. 301.6501(c)-1(e) and (f) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. In 1996, A transferred closely-held stock in trust for the benefit of B, A's child. A timely filed a Federal gift tax return reporting the 1996 transfer to B. No gift tax was assessed or paid as a result of the gift tax annual exclusion and the application of A's available unified credit. In 2001, A transferred additional closely-held stock to the trust. A's Federal gift tax return reporting the 2001 transfer was timely filed and the transfer was adequately disclosed under Sec. 301.6501(c)-1(f)(2) of this chapter. In computing the amount of taxable gifts, A claimed annual exclusions with respect to

the transfers in 1996 and 2001. In 2003, A transfers additional property to B and timely files a Federal gift tax return reporting the gift. (ii) Application of the rule limiting adjustments to prior gifts. Under section 2504(c), in determining A's 2003 gift tax liability, the amount of A's 1996 gift can be adjusted for purposes of computing prior taxable gifts, since that gift was made prior to August 6, 1997, and therefore, the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section apply. Adjustments can be made with respect to the valuation of the gift and legal issues presented (for example, the availability of the annual exclusion with respect to the gift). However, A's 2001 transfer was adequately disclosed on a timely filed gift tax return and, thus, under paragraph (b) of this section, the amount of the 2001 taxable gift by A may not be adjusted (either with respect to the valuation of the gift or any legal issue) for purposes of computing prior taxable gifts in determining A's 2003 gift tax liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. In 1996, A transferred closely-held stock to B, A's child. A timely filed a Federal gift tax return reporting the 1996 transfer to B and paid gift tax on the value of the gift reported on the return. On August 1, 1997, A transferred additional closely-held stock to B in exchange for a promissory note signed by B. Also, on September 10, 1997, A transferred closely-held stock to C, A's other child. On April 15, 1998, A timely filed a gift tax return for 1997 reporting the September 10, 1997, transfer to C and, under Sec. 301.6501(c)-1(f)(2) of this chapter, adequately disclosed that transfer and paid gift tax with respect to the transfer. However, A believed that the transfer to B on August 1, 1997, was for full and adequate consideration and A did not report the transfer to B on the 1997 Federal gift tax return. In 2002, A transfers additional property to B and timely files a Federal gift tax return reporting the gift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application of the rule limiting adjustments to prior gifts. Under section 2504(c), in determining A's 2002 gift tax liability, the value of A's 1996 gift cannot be adjusted for purposes of computing the value of prior taxable gifts, since that gift was made prior to August 6, 1997, and a timely filed Federal gift tax return was filed on which a gift tax was assessed and paid. However, A's prior taxable gifts can be adjusted to reflect the August 1, 1997, transfer because, although a gift tax return for 1997 was timely filed and gift tax was paid, under Sec. 301.6501(c)-1(f) of this chapter the period for assessing gift tax with respect to the August 1, 1997, transfer did not commence to run since that transfer was not adequately disclosed on the 1997 gift tax return. Accordingly, a gift tax may be assessed with respect to the August 1, 1997, transfer and the amount of the gift would be reflected in prior taxable gifts for purposes of computing A's gift tax liability for 2002. A's September 10, 1997, transfer to C was adequately disclosed on a timely filed gift tax return and, thus, under paragraph (b) of this section, the amount of the September 10, 1997, taxable gift by A may not be adjusted for purposes of computing prior taxable gifts in determining A's 2002 gift tax liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. In 1994, A transferred closely-held stock to B and C, A's children. A timely filed a Federal gift tax return reporting the 1994 transfers to B and C and paid gift tax on the value of the gifts reported on the return. Also in 1994, A transferred closely-held stock to B in exchange for a bona fide promissory note signed by B. A believed that the transfer to B in exchange for the promissory note was for full and adequate consideration and A did not report that transfer to B on the 1994 Federal gift tax return. In 2002, A transfers additional property to B and timely files a Federal gift tax return reporting the gift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application of the rule limiting adjustments to prior gifts. Under section 2504(c), in determining A's 2002 gift tax liability, the value of A's 1994 gifts cannot be adjusted for purposes of computing prior taxable gifts because those gifts were made prior to August 6, 1997, and a timely filed Federal gift tax return was filed with respect to which a gift tax was assessed and paid, and the period of limitations on assessment has expired. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section apply to the 1994 transfers. However, for purposes of determining A's adjusted taxable gifts in computing A's estate tax liability, the gifts may be adjusted. See Sec. 20.2001-1(a) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective dates. Paragraph (a) of this section applies to transfers of property by gift made prior to August 6, 1997. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section apply to transfers of property by gift made after August 5, 1997, if the gift tax return for the calendar period in which the transfer is reported is filed after December 3, 1999.

Sec. 25.2505-1T  Unified credit against gift tax; in general (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Section 2505(a) allows a citizen or resident of the United States a credit against the tax imposed by section 2501 for each calendar year. The allowable credit is the applicable credit amount in effect under section 2010(c) that would apply if the donor died as of the end of the calendar year, reduced by the sum of the amounts allowable as a credit against the gift tax due for all preceding calendar periods. See Sec. Sec. 25.2505-2T, 20.2010-1T, and 20.2010-2T of this chapter for additional rules and definitions related to determining the applicable credit amount in effect under section 2010(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applicable rate of tax. In determining the amounts allowable as a credit against the gift tax due for all preceding calendar periods, the unified rate schedule under section 2001(c) in effect for such calendar year applies instead of the rates of tax actually in effect for preceding calendar periods. See sections 2505(a) and 2502(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special rule in case of certain gifts made before 1977. The applicable credit amount allowable under paragraph (a) of this section must be reduced by an amount equal to 20 percent of the aggregate amount allowed as a specific exemption under section 2521 (as in effect before its repeal by the Tax Reform Act of 1976) for gifts made by the decedent after September 8, 1976, and before January 1, 1977.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Credit limitation. The applicable credit amount allowed under paragraph (a) of this section for any calendar year shall not exceed the amount of the tax imposed by section 2501 for such calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective/applicability date. Paragraph (a) of this section applies to gifts made on or after January 1, 2011.

Sec. 25.2505-2T  Gifts made by a surviving spouse having a DSUE amountavailable (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Donor who is surviving spouse is limited to DSUE amount of last deceased spouse--(1) In general. In computing a surviving spouse's gift tax liability with regard to a transfer subject to the tax imposed by section 2501 (taxable gift), a deceased spousal unused exclusion (DSUE) amount of a decedent, computed under Sec. 20.2010-2T(c) of this chapter, is included in determining the surviving spouse's applicable exclusion amount under section 2010(c)(2), provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. In computing a surviving spouse's gift tax liability with regard to a transfer subject to the tax imposed by section 2501 (taxable gift), a deceased spousal unused exclusion (DSUE) amount of a decedent, computed under Sec. 20.2010-2T(c) of this chapter, is included in determining the surviving spouse's applicable exclusion amount under section 2010(c)(2), provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such decedent is the last deceased spouse of such surviving spouse within the meaning of Sec. 20.2010-1T(d)(5) of this chapter at the time of the surviving spouse's taxable gift; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The executor of the decedent's estate elected portability (see Sec. 20.2010-2T(a) and (b) of this chapter for applicable requirements).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No DSUE amount available from last deceased spouse. If on the date of the surviving spouse's taxable gift the last deceased spouse of such surviving spouse had no DSUE amount or if the executor of the estate of such last deceased spouse did not elect portability, the surviving spouse has no DSUE amount (except as and to the extent

provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) to be included in determining his or her applicable exclusion amount, even if the surviving spouse previously had a DSUE amount available from another decedent who, prior to the death of the last deceased spouse, was the last deceased spouse of such surviving spouse. See paragraph (c) of this section for a special rule in the case of multiple deceased spouses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Identity of last deceased spouse unchanged by subsequent marriage or divorce. A decedent is the last deceased spouse (as defined in Sec. 20.2010-1T(d)(5) of this chapter) of a surviving spouse even if, on the date of the surviving spouse's taxable gift, the surviving spouse is married to another (then-living) individual. If a surviving spouse marries again and that marriage ends in divorce or an annulment, the subsequent death of the divorced spouse does not end the status of the prior deceased spouse as the last deceased spouse of the surviving spouse. The divorced spouse, not being married to the surviving spouse at death, is not the last deceased spouse as that term is defined in Sec. 20.2010-1T(d)(5) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Manner in which DSUE amount is applied. If a donor who is a surviving spouse makes a taxable gift and a DSUE amount is included in determining the surviving spouse's applicable exclusion amount under section 2010(c)(2), such surviving spouse will be considered to apply such DSUE amount to the taxable gift before the surviving spouse's own basic exclusion amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special rule in case of multiple deceased spouses and previously-applied DSUE amount--(1) In general. A special rule applies to compute the DSUE amount included in the applicable exclusion amount of a surviving spouse who previously has applied the DSUE amount of one or more deceased spouses. If a surviving spouse applied the DSUE amount of one or more last deceased spouses to the surviving spouse's previous lifetime transfers, and if any of those last deceased spouses is different from the surviving spouse's last deceased spouse as defined in Sec. 20.2010-1T(d)(5) of this chapter at the time of the current taxable gift by the surviving spouse, then the DSUE amount to be included in determining the applicable exclusion amount of the surviving spouse that will be applicable at the time of the current taxable gift is the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A special rule applies to compute the DSUE amount included in the applicable exclusion amount of a surviving spouse who previously has applied the DSUE amount of one or more deceased spouses. If a surviving spouse applied the DSUE amount of one or more last deceased spouses to the surviving spouse's previous lifetime transfers, and if any of those last deceased spouses is different from the surviving spouse's last deceased spouse as defined in Sec. 20.2010-1T(d)(5) of this chapter at the time of the current taxable gift by the surviving spouse, then the DSUE amount to be included in determining the applicable exclusion amount of the surviving spouse that will be applicable at the time of the current taxable gift is the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The DSUE amount of the surviving spouse's last deceased spouse as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The DSUE amount of each other deceased spouse of the surviving spouse to the extent that such amount was applied to one or more previous taxable gifts of the surviving spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example, in which all described individuals are US citizens, illustrates the application of this paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.</p><p class="depth0">Husband 1 (H1) dies on January 15, 2011, survived by Wife (W). Neither has made any taxable gifts during H1's lifetime. H1's executor elects portability of H1's deceased spousal unused exclusion (DSUE) amount. The DSUE amount of H1 as computed on the estate tax return filed on behalf of H1's estate is $5,000,000. On December 31, 2011, W makes taxable gifts to her children valued at $2,000,000. W reports the gifts on a timely-filed gift tax return. W is considered to have applied $2,000,000 of H1's DSUE amount to the 2011 taxable gifts, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, and, therefore, W owes no gift tax. W is considered to have an applicable exclusion amount remaining in the amount of $8,000,000 ($3,000,000 of H1's remaining DSUE amount plus W's own $5,000,000 basic exclusion amount). After the death of H1, W marries Husband 2 (H2). H2 dies on June 30, 2012. H2's executor elects portability of H2's DSUE amount, which is properly computed on H2's estate tax return to be $2,000,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application. The DSUE amount to be included in determining the applicable exclusion amount available to W for gifts during the second half of 2012 is $4,000,000, determined by adding the $2,000,000 DSUE amount of H2 and the $2,000,000 DSUE amount of H1 that was applied by W to W's 2011 taxable gifts. Thus, W's applicable exclusion amount during the balance of 2012 is $9,000,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Date DSUE amount taken into consideration by donor who is a surviving spouse--(1) General rule. A portability election made by an executor of a decedent's estate (see Sec. 20.2010-2T(a) and (b) of this chapter for applicable requirements) applies as of the date of the decedent's death. Thus, the decedent's DSUE amount is included in the applicable exclusion amount of the decedent's surviving spouse under section

2010(c)(2) and will be applicable to transfers made by the surviving spouse after the decedent's death. However, such decedent's DSUE amount will not be included in the applicable exclusion amount of the surviving spouse, even if the surviving spouse had made a taxable gift in reliance on the availability or computation of the decedent's DSUE amount:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. A portability election made by an executor of a decedent's estate (see Sec. 20.2010-2T(a) and (b) of this chapter for applicable requirements) applies as of the date of the decedent's death. Thus, the decedent's DSUE amount is included in the applicable exclusion amount of the decedent's surviving spouse under section

2010(c)(2) and will be applicable to transfers made by the surviving spouse after the decedent's death. However, such decedent's DSUE amount will not be included in the applicable exclusion amount of the surviving spouse, even if the surviving spouse had made a taxable gift in reliance on the availability or computation of the decedent's DSUE amount:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the executor of the decedent's estate supersedes the portability election by filing a subsequent estate tax return in accordance with Sec. 20.2010-2T(a)(4) of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To the extent that the DSUE amount subsequently is reduced by a valuation adjustment or the correction of an error in calculation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> To the extent that the DSUE amount claimed on the decedent's return cannot be determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule when property passes to surviving spouse in a qualified domestic trust--(i) In general. When property passes from a decedent for the benefit of a surviving spouse in one or more qualified domestic trusts (QDOT) as defined in section 2056A(a) and the decedent's executor elects portability, the DSUE amount available to be included in the applicable exclusion amount of the surviving spouse under section 2010(c)(2) is the DSUE amount of the decedent as redetermined in accordance with Sec. 20.2010-2T(c)(4) of this chapter. The earliest date on which the decedent's DSUE amount may be included in the applicable exclusion amount of the surviving spouse under section 2010(c)(2) is the date of the occurrence of the final QDOT distribution or final other event (generally, the death of the surviving spouse or the earlier termination of all QDOTs for that surviving spouse) on which tax under section 2056A is imposed. However, the decedent's DSUE amount as redetermined in accordance with Sec. 20.2010-2T(c)(4) of this chapter may be applied to the surviving spouse's taxable gifts made in the year of the surviving spouse's death, or if the terminating event occurs prior to the surviving spouse's death, then in the year of that terminating event and/or any subsequent year during the surviving spouse's life.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. When property passes from a decedent for the benefit of a surviving spouse in one or more qualified domestic trusts (QDOT) as defined in section 2056A(a) and the decedent's executor elects portability, the DSUE amount available to be included in the applicable exclusion amount of the surviving spouse under section 2010(c)(2) is the DSUE amount of the decedent as redetermined in accordance with Sec. 20.2010-2T(c)(4) of this chapter. The earliest date on which the decedent's DSUE amount may be included in the applicable exclusion amount of the surviving spouse under section 2010(c)(2) is the date of the occurrence of the final QDOT distribution or final other event (generally, the death of the surviving spouse or the earlier termination of all QDOTs for that surviving spouse) on which tax under section 2056A is imposed. However, the decedent's DSUE amount as redetermined in accordance with Sec. 20.2010-2T(c)(4) of this chapter may be applied to the surviving spouse's taxable gifts made in the year of the surviving spouse's death, or if the terminating event occurs prior to the surviving spouse's death, then in the year of that terminating event and/or any subsequent year during the surviving spouse's life.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (d)(2):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Husband (H), a US citizen, dies in January 2011 having made no taxable gifts during his lifetime. H's gross estate is $3,000,000. H's wife (W) is a US resident but not a citizen of the United States and, under H's will, a pecuniary bequest of $2,000,000 passes to a QDOT for the benefit of W. H's executor timely files an estate tax return and makes the QDOT election for the property passing to the QDOT, and H's estate is allowed a marital deduction of $2,000,000 under section 2056(d) for the value of that property. H's taxable estate is $1,000,000. On H's estate tax return, H's executor computes H's preliminary DSUE amount to be $4,000,000. No taxable events within the meaning of section 2056A occur during W's lifetime with respect to the QDOT. W makes a taxable gift of $1,000,000 to X in December 2011 and a taxable gift of $1,000,000 to Y in January 2012. W dies in September 2012, not having married again, when the value of the assets of the QDOT is $2,200,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application. H's DSUE amount is redetermined to be $1,800,000 (the lesser of the $5,000,000 basic exclusion amount in 2011, or the excess of H's $5,000,000 applicable exclusion amount over $3,200,000 (the sum of the $1,000,000 taxable estate augmented by the $2,200,000 of QDOT assets)). On W's gift tax return filed for 2011, W cannot apply any DSUE amount to the gift made to X. However, because W's gift to Y was made in the year that W died, W's executor will apply $1,000,000 of H's redetermined DSUE amount to the gift on W's gift tax return filed for 2012. The remaining $800,000 of H's redetermined DSUE amount is included in W's applicable exclusion amount to be used in computing W's estate tax liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Authority to examine returns of deceased spouses. For the purpose of determining the DSUE amount to be included in the applicable exclusion amount of the surviving spouse, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may examine returns of each of the surviving spouse's deceased spouses whose DSUE amount is claimed to be included in the surviving spouse's applicable exclusion amount, regardless of whether the period of limitations on assessment has expired for any such return. The IRS's authority to examine returns of a deceased spouse applies with respect to each transfer by the surviving spouse to which a DSUE amount is or has been applied. Upon examination, the IRS may adjust or eliminate the DSUE amount reported on such a return;

however, the IRS may assess additional tax on that return only if that tax is assessed within the period of limitations on assessment under section 6501 applicable to the tax shown on that return. See also section 7602 for the IRS's authority, when ascertaining the correctness of any return, to examine any returns that may be relevant or material to such inquiry.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Availability of DSUE amount for nonresidents who are not citizens.
