                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Termination of a Federal award generally gives rise to the  incurrence of costs, or the need for special treatment of costs, which  would not have arisen had the Federal award not been terminated. Cost  principles covering these items are set forth in this section. They are  to be used in conjunction with the other provisions of this part in  termination situations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The cost of items reasonably usable on the non-Federal entity's  other work must not be allowable unless the non-Federal entity submits  evidence that it would not retain such items at cost without sustaining  a loss. In deciding whether such items are reasonably usable on other  work of the non-Federal entity, the HHS awarding agency should consider  the non-Federal entity's plans and orders for current and scheduled  activity. Contemporaneous purchases of common items by the non-Federal  entity must be regarded as evidence that such items are reasonably  usable on the non-Federal entity's other work. Any acceptance of common  items as allocable to the terminated portion of the Federal award must  be limited to the extent that the quantities of such items on hand, in   transit, and on order are in excess of the reasonable quantitative  requirements of other work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If in a particular case, despite all reasonable efforts by the  non-Federal entity, certain costs cannot be discontinued immediately  after the effective date of termination, such costs are generally  allowable within the limitations set forth in this part, except that any  such costs continuing after termination due to the negligent or willful  failure of the non-Federal entity to discontinue such costs must be  unallowable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Loss of useful value of special tooling, machinery, and  equipment is generally allowable if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Such special tooling, special machinery, or equipment is not  reasonably capable of use in the other work of the non-Federal entity,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The interest of the Federal Government is protected by transfer  of title or by other means deemed appropriate by the HHS awarding agency  (see also Sec. 75.320(d)), and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The loss of useful value for any one terminated Federal award is  limited to that portion of the acquisition cost which bears the same  ratio to the total acquisition cost as the terminated portion of the  Federal award bears to the entire terminated Federal award and other  Federal awards for which the special tooling, machinery, or equipment  was acquired.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rental costs under unexpired leases are generally allowable  where clearly shown to have been reasonably necessary for the  performance of the terminated Federal award less the residual value of  such leases, if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount of such rental claimed does not exceed the reasonable  use value of the property leased for the period of the Federal award and  such further period as may be reasonable, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The non-Federal entity makes all reasonable efforts to  terminate, assign, settle, or otherwise reduce the cost of such lease.  There also may be included the cost of alterations of such leased  property, provided such alterations were necessary for the performance  of the Federal award, and of reasonable restoration required by the  provisions of the lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Settlement expenses including the following are generally  allowable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Accounting, legal, clerical, and similar costs reasonably  necessary for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The preparation and presentation to the Federal awarding agency  of settlement claims and supporting data with respect to the terminated  portion of the Federal award, unless the termination is for cause (see  subpart D of this part, Sec. Sec. 75.371 through 75.375); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The termination and settlement of subawards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reasonable costs for the storage, transportation, protection,  and disposition of property provided by the Federal Government or  acquired or produced for the Federal award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Claims under subawards, including the allocable portion of  claims which are common to the Federal award and to other work of the  non-Federal entity, are generally allowable. An appropriate share of the  non-Federal entity's indirect costs may be allocated to the amount of  settlements with contractors and/or subrecipients, provided that the  amount allocated is otherwise consistent with the basic guidelines  contained in Sec. 75.414. The indirect costs so allocated must exclude  the same and similar costs claimed directly or indirectly as settlement  expenses.</p>
