                            <p class="depth0">A list of qualified companies is published annually as of July 1 in  Department Circular No. 570, Companies Holding Certificates of Authority  as Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds and as Acceptable Reinsuring  Companies, with information as to underwriting limitations, areas in  which listed sureties are licensed to transact surety business and other  details. If the Secretary of the Treasury shall take any exceptions to  the financial statements submitted by a company, he or she shall, before  issuing Department Circular 570, give a company due notice of such  exceptions. Copies of the Circular are available at http:// www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/ref/suretyBnd/c570.htm, or from the  designated Treasury official, upon request. Bonds underwritten by  certified companies on the Department Circular No. 570 list may be  presented to an agency bond-approving official for acceptance. Selection  of a particular qualified company from among all companies holding  certificates of authority is discretionary with the principal required  to furnish the bond, but the acceptance of a bond by an agency bond- approving official is subject to Sec. 223.17.
