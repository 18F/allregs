The Assistant Secretary may, if warranted by  circumstances beyond the control of the grantee, extend the time to  allow for initiation of the enterprise, provided there is assurance the  enterprise will be initiated forthwith within the extended time period.  The Assistant Secretary will notify the lender in writing   of a proposed action to require the return of grant funds or of a  proposal to extend the time.</p>
