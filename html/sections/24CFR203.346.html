                            <p class="depth0">If at any time during default the mortgagor is a ``Person in  military service,'' as such term is defined in the Soldiers' and  Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, the period during which the mortgagor  is in such service shall be excluded in computing the period within  which the mortgagee shall commence foreclosure or acquire the property  by other means as provided in Sec. 203.355 of this subpart. No  postponement or delay in the prosecution of   foreclosure proceedings during the period the mortgagor is in such  military service shall be construed as failure on the part of the  mortgagee to exercise reasonable diligence in prosecuting such  proceedings to completion as required by this subpart.
