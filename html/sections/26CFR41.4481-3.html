                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of the regulations in this part, the term  ``registered'' when used in reference to a highway motor vehicle means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Registered under the law of any State or Territory of the United  States, the District of Columbia, or contiguous foreign country, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Required to be registered under the law of any State or  Territory of the United States or contiguous foreign country in which  such highway motor vehicle is operated or situated or, in case the  vehicle is operated or situated in the District of Columbia, under the  law of the District of Columbia.  Any highway motor vehicle which is operated under a dealer's tag,  license, or permit is considered to be registered in the name of such  dealer. A highway motor vehicle is not considered to be registered  solely by reason of the fact that there has been issued a special permit  for operation of the vehicle at particular times and under specified  conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any highway motor vehicle which, at any time in the taxable  period, is registered both in the name of the owner of the vehicle and  in the name of any other person, is considered, for purposes of the  regulations in this part, to be registered, at such time, solely in the  name of the owner of the vehicle.  [T.D. 6216, 21 FR 9645, Dec. 6, 1956, as amended by T.D. 6743, 29 FR  7931, June 23, 1964; T.D. 8159, 52 FR 33584, Sept. 4, 1987]    Sec. 41.4482(a)-1  Definition of highway motor vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Highway motor vehicle. The term ``highway motor vehicle'' means  any vehicle that is both:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A vehicle propelled by means of its own motor, whether such  motor is powered by gasoline, diesel fuel, special motor fuels,  electricity, or otherwise, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A ``highway vehicle'' as defined in Sec. 48.4061(a)-1(d) of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>-1  Definition of taxable gross weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Actual unloaded weight--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Actual unloaded weight  means the empty (or tare) weight of the truck, truck-tractor, or bus,  fully equipped for service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Trucks and truck-tractors. A truck or truck-tractor fully  equipped for service includes the body (whether or not designed and  adapted primarily for transporting cargo, as for example, concrete  mixers); all accessories; all   equipment attached to or carried on such truck or truck-tractor for use  in connection with the movement of the vehicle by means of its own motor  or for use in the maintenance of the vehicle; and a full complement of  lubricants, fuel, and water. It does not include the driver, any  equipment (not including the body) attached to or carried on the vehicle  for use in handling, protecting, or preserving cargo, or any special  equipment (such as an air compressor, crane, specialized oilfield  machinery, etc.) mounted on the vehicle for use on construction jobs, in  oilfield operations, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Buses. A bus fully equipped for service includes the body; all  accessories; all equipment attached to or carried on such bus for use in  connection with the movement of the vehicle by means of its own motor,  for use in the maintenance of the vehicle, or for the accommodation of  passengers or others (such as air conditioning equipment and sanitation  facilities, etc.); and a full complement of lubricants, fuel, and water.  It does not include the driver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determination of taxable gross weight--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  taxable gross weight of a highway motor vehicle is the sum of the actual  unloaded weight of the vehicle fully equipped for service, the actual  unloaded weight of any semitrailers or trailers fully equipped for  service customarily used in combination with the vehicle, and the weight  of the maximum load customarily carried on the vehicle and on any  semitrailers or trailers customarily used in combination with the  vehicle. In the case of a highway motor vehicle that is registered in at  least one State that requires a declaration of gross weight to be stated  as a specific amount for any purpose (including proportional or prorate  registration or the payment of any other fees or taxes), the taxable  gross weight of such vehicle must be no less than the highest gross  weight declaration (or combined gross weight declaration in the case of  a tractor-trailer or truck-trailer combination) made by the registrant  in any State with respect to such vehicle. If a highway motor vehicle is  registered in at least one State that requires vehicles to register on  the basis of gross weight and such vehicle is not registered in any  State that requires a declaration of gross weight to be stated as a  specific amount by the registrant, the taxable gross weight of such  vehicle must fall within the highest gross weight category of such State  for which such vehicle is registered during the taxable period.  Declarations of weight made in order to obtain special temporary travel  permits which allow a vehicle to, (i) operate in a State in which the  vehicle is not registered or prorated, (ii) operate at more than a  State's maximum statutory weight limit, or (iii) operate at more than  the weight that the vehicle is registered in a State, shall not be  considered in determining the taxable gross weight of a vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Buses. For purposes of the tax imposed by section 4481(a), the  taxable gross weight of a bus shall be the sum of the weights referred  to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section except that ``the weight of the  maximum load customarily carried'' on a bus shall be equal to 150 pounds  times the number of units of seating capacity provided for passengers  and driver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). A is the owner of a truck-tractor. On January 1, 1985,  A registers the truck-tractor in three states--X, Y, and Z. For purposes  of registering the vehicle in State X, A declares the gross operating  weight of his truck-tractor to be 60,000 pounds. The declaration of the  gross weight of the vehicle at 50,000 pounds places A's truck-tractor in  the State X registration category of 55,000 to 62,000 pounds gross  weight. Thus, the registered weight of A's vehicle in State X is 62,000  pounds. At the same time as A registers the vehicle in State X, A also  proportionally registers the vehicle under the IRP in State Y. A uses  the same declared gross weight of 60,000 pounds for purposes of the  State Y proportional registration. Registration in State Y at this  declared gross weight places A's truck-tractor in the State Y gross  weight registration category of 58,000 to 68,000 pounds. Finally, A  registers the truck-tractor in State Z. Registration of vehicles in  State Z is based on the unladen weight of the vehicle. During the  taxable period beginning on July 1, 1985, A's truck-tractor is not  registered in any other state. For the taxable period beginning on July  1, 1985, A must declare a taxable gross weight of no less than 60,000  pounds for   purposes of the tax imposed by section 4481(a) because that is the  highest declared gross weight for state registration or other purposes.  Should A declare to any State agency a higher gross operating weight  with respect to the truck-tractor during the same taxable period (except  for a special temporary permit), A would then be liable for additional  tax as determined under paragraph (c)(3) of Sec. 41.4481-1.</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that on  one occasion during the taxable period, A was issued a special 2-day  permit to use his truck-tractor in State Y to haul a load which would  give A's unit a total gross weight of 80,000 pounds. A may still declare  the taxable gross weight of his unit to be no less than 60,000 pounds  because special permits to haul heavier loads on a temporary basis are  not considered in determining the taxable gross weight of a vehicle.</p><p class="depth0">Example (3). C owns and has registered in his name 2 trucks which  are identical in all respects and which are used to carry the same type  of load. The first vehicle is registered only in State X at a registered  weight of 73,000 pounds based on a declared gross weight of 70,000  pounds. The second vehicle is registered only in State Y at a registered  weight of 68,000 pounds based on a declared gross weight of 65,000  pounds. No other declarations of gross weight are made with respect to  either vehicle. For purposes of the Federal heavy vehicle use tax, the  taxable gross weight of the vehicle registered in State X may be  declared at no less than 70,000 pounds and the taxable gross weight of  the vehicle registered in State Y may be declared at no less than 65,000  pounds even though the vehicles are identical.   [T.D. 6216, 21 FR 9645, Dec. 6, 1956, as amended by T.D. 6743, 29 FR  7931, June 23, 1964; T.D. 7011, 34 FR 7448, May 8, 1969; T.D. 8027, 50  FR 21247, May 23, 1985; T.D. 8879, 65 FR 17153, Mar. 31, 2000]    Sec. 41.4482(c)-1  Definition of State, taxable period, use, and customarily used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> State. State includes any State, any political subdivision of a  State, the District of Columbia, and, to the extent provided by section  7871, any Indian tribal government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Taxable period. For the definition of taxable period, see  section 4482(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Use. The term ``use'', as used in the regulations in this part  with reference to a highway motor vehicle, means the use of the highway  motor vehicle on the public highways in the United States, that is,  operation of the vehicle, by means of its own motor, on any roadway  (whether a Federal highway, State highway, city street, or otherwise) in  the United States which is not a private roadway. Thus, for purposes of  the tax, there is no use of a highway motor vehicle while the vehicle is  in ``dead storage''. The term ``use'' does not include operation of a  new highway motor vehicle on a public highway in the United States if  such operation is merely for the purpose of transporting the vehicle  from the point of manufacture or assembly to the consumer, whether  direct or with intermediate deliveries to such points as are involved in  the distribution process. For example, operation of a new vehicle for  the purpose of delivering it from the factory to a branch establishment  of the manufacturer, or from the factory or branch establishment to a  dealer, distributor, or consumer, does not constitute use of the vehicle  within the meaning of the regulations in this part; likewise, the  further operation of the vehicle by a dealer or distributor for the  purpose of delivering the vehicle to a consumer does not constitute use  of the vehicle. Similarly, the operation of a secondhand highway motor  vehicle by a dealer or distributor for the purpose of delivering the  vehicle to a purchaser does not constitute use of the vehicle within the  meaning of the regulations in this part. Furthermore, the term ``use''  does not include operation of a new or secondhand highway motor vehicle,  if such operation is exclusively for the purpose of demonstration of the  vehicle by a dealer in, or distributor of, new or secondhand highway  motor vehicles. Operation of a highway motor vehicle on a private  roadway, or other private property, does not constitute use of the  vehicle within the meaning of the regulations in this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Customarily used. A semitrailer or trailer is treated as  customarily used in connection with a highway motor vehicle if the  vehicle is equipped to tow the semitrailer or trailer.
