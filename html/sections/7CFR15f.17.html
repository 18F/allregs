                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Do I need to file another answer or pre-hearing brief? You may file a pre-hearing brief in support of your complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Will there be a pre-hearing conference? The ALJ may hold a pre-hearing conference. If such a conference is to be held, the notice of the pre-hearing conference also will contain a notice to the parties of a time and date for the pre-hearing conference. Pre-hearing conferences normally will be held by telephone. Issues that may be addressed at the pre-hearing conference may include: simplification of the issues; the possibility of obtaining stipulations of fact and of the authenticity of documents; limitation of the number of witnesses; exchange of copies of hearing exhibits; negotiation, compromise or settlement of issues; identification of documents of which official notice will be requested; a schedule for completion of the actions decided upon at the conference; and any other matters that may aid and expedite the conclusion of the proceeding. No transcript of the pre-hearing conference will be made but the ALJ will issue a written memorandum summarizing the results of the pre-hearing conference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> What else may the ALJ ask for before the hearing? Prior to the hearing, the ALJ may require each of the parties to furnish any or all of the following: an outline of a party's position with respect to the complaint, the facts upon which the party intends to rely, the legal theories upon which the party intends to rely, copies of or a list of the documents and exhibits which the party anticipates on introducing at the hearing, and a list of anticipated witnesses.</p>
