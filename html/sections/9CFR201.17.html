                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Schedules of rate changes for stockyard services. Each stockyard  owner and market agency operating at a posted stockyard shall file with  the regional supervisor for the region in which they operate a signed  copy of all schedules of rates and charges, supplements and amendments  thereto. The schedules, supplements and amendments must be conspicuously  posted for public inspection at the stockyard, and filed with the  regional supervisor, at least 10 days before their effective dates,  except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Each  schedule, supplement and amendment shall set forth its effective date, a  description of the stockyard services rendered, the stockyard at which  it applies, the name and address of the stockyard owner or market  agency, the kind of livestock covered by it, and any rules or  regulations which affect any rate or charge contained therein. Each  schedule of rates and charges filed shall be designated by successive  numbers. Each supplement and amendment to such schedule shall be  numbered and shall designate the number of the schedule which it  supplements or amends.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Feed charges. When the schedule in effect provides for feed  charges to be based on an average cost plus a specified margin, the 10- day filing and notice provision contained in section 306(c) of the Act  is waived. A schedule of the current feed charges based on average feed  cost and showing the effective date shall be conspicuously posted at the  stockyard at all times. Changes in feed charges may become effective 2  days after the change is posted at the stockyard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Professional veterinary services. The 10-day filing and notice  provision contained in section 306(a) of the Act is waived for a  schedule of charges for professional veterinary services.
