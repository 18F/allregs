Coordination of all frequency assignments for all mobile (temporary  fixed) stations in all bands above 2110 MHz, except the bands 6425-6525  MHz and 17.7-19.7 GHz, will be conducted in accordance with the  procedure established in paragraph (b) of this section or with the  procedure in paragraph (d) of this section.

Applicants are responsible for selecting  the frequency assignments that are least likely to result in mutual  interference with other licensees in the same area. Applicants may  consult local frequency coordination committees, where they exist, for  information on frequencies available in the area. Proposed frequency  usage must be coordinated with existing licensees and applicants in the  area whose facilities could affect or be affected by the new proposal in  terms of frequency interference on active channels, applied-for  channels, or channels coordinated for future growth. Coordination must  be completed prior to filing an application for regular authorization,  for major amendment to a pending application, or for major modification  to a license.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To be acceptable for filing, all applications for regular  authorization, or major amendment to a pending application, or major  modification to a license, must include a certification attesting that  all co-channel and adjacent-channel licensees and applicants potentially  affected by the proposed fixed use of the frequency(ies) have been  notified and are in agreement that the proposed facilities can be  installed without causing harmful interference to those other licensees  and applicants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For each frequency coordinated under this paragraph, applicants  are responsible for selecting the frequency assignments that are least  likely to result in mutual interference with other licensees in the same  area. Applicants may consult local frequency coordination committees,  where they exist, for information on frequencies available in the area.  In selecting frequencies, consideration should be given to the relative  location of receive points, normal transmission paths, and the nature of  the contemplated operation.
