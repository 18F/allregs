                            <p class="depth0">The selection criteria are designed to ensure a consistently high level of quality and diverse products are available at the market, while operating in the constraints of space available at the market site. The criteria are:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Member of one of the three participant groups specified in Sec. 170.4 of this part. The participant must be a producer-only farmer or producer, seller of value-added products, or specialized non-produce vendor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Participant offers a product that adds to a product mix. Market management will ensure that a balanced mix of fresh fruits and vegetables will be maintained throughout the season. Final selection of fruit and vegetable producers will be made based on their ability to ensure a wide range of fresh farm products throughout the season.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Willingness to Glean. Participants should commit to supporting the USDA food gleaning/food recovery initiative.

This commitment requires farmers and vendors to donate surplus food and food products at the end of each market day to a local nonprofit organization identified by USDA. Questions about tax deductions for gleaning should be referred to the Internal Revenue Service or a tax advisor. Receipts for donated foods may be obtained from the receiving nonprofit organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Commitment to market. Participants must commit to the entire market season and be willing to participate on a regular basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Grandfather provision. Market management reserves the right to select several farmers or vendors based on previous participation in the program, consistency in providing quality products, and compliance with operating guidelines.</p>
