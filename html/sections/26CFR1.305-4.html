                                Sec. 1.305-4  Distributions of common and preferred stock.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Under section 305(b)(3), a distribution (or a series  of distributions) by a corporation which results in the receipt of  preferred stock whether or not convertible into common stock) by some  common shareholders and the receipt of common stock by other common  shareholders is treated as a distribution of property to which section  301 applies. For the meaning of the term a series of distribution, see  subparagraphs (1) through (6) of Sec. 1.305-3(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)</em> may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Corporation X is organized with two classes of common  stock, class A and class B. Dividends may be paid in stock or in cash on  either class of stock without regard to the medium of payment of  dividends on the other class. A dividend is declared on the class A  stock payable in additional shares of class A stock and a dividend is  declared on class B stock payable in newly authorized class C stock  which is nonconvertible and limited and preferred as to dividends. Both  the distribution of class A shares and the distribution of new class C  shares are distributions to which section 301 applies.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Corporation Y is organized with one class of stock, class  A common. During the year the corporation declares a dividend   on the class A stock payable in newly authorized class B preferred stock  which is convertible into class A stock no later than 6 months from the  date of distribution at a price that is only slightly higher than the  market price of class A stock on the date of distribution. Taking into  account the dividend rate, redemption provisions, the marketability of  the convertible stock, and the conversion price, it is reasonable to  anticipate that within a relatively short period of time some  shareholders will exercise their conversion rights and some will not.  Since the distribution can reasonably be expected to result in the  receipt of preferred stock by some common shareholders and the receipt  of common stock by other common shareholders, the distribution is a  distribution of property to which section 301 applies.
