                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> EISs will be done for those Class I and Class II actions that  are determined to have a significant impact on the quality of the human  environment. The criteria for determining significant impacts are  contained in Sec. 1508.27 of the CEQ regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In utilizing the criteria for a significant impact, the  cumulative impacts of other FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 actions planned or recently approved in the proposal's area  of environmental impact, other related or similarly located Federal  actions, and non-federal related actions must be given consideration.  This is particularly relevant for frequently recurring FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 actions that on an individual  basis may have relatively few environmental impacts but create a  potential for significantly impacts on a cumulative basis. Housing  assistance is one such example. Consequently, in reviewing proposals for  subdivisions and multi-family housing sites, consideration must be given  to the cumulative impacts of other federally assisted housing in the  area, including FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's.  The boundaries of the area to be considered should be based upon such  factors as common utility or public service districts, common  watersheds, and common commuting patterns to central employment or  commercial areas. Additionally, the criteria for significant impacts  utilized by the other involved housing agency(s), (VA and HUD, for  example) must be reviewed when there is a potential for cumulative  impacts. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will  consult with HUD for determining a significant impact whenever the total  of HUD and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 housing  units being planned within a common area of environmental impact exceeds  the HUD thresholds listed in its NEPA regulations. (See 24 CFR part 50.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Because the environmental values and functions of floodplains  and wetlands are of critical importance to man, and because these areas  are often extremely sensitive to man-induced disturbances, actions which  affect wetlands and floodplains will be considered to have a significant  environmental impact whenever one or more of the following criteria are  met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The public health and safety are identifiably affected, that is,  whenever the proposed action may affect any standards promulgated under  the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.), the Clean Water  Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) or similar State authorities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The preservation of natural systems is identifiably affected,  that is, whenever the proposed action or related activities may  potentially create or induce changes in the existing habitat that may  affect species diversity and stability (both flora and fauna and over  the short and long term) or affect ecosystem productivity over the long  term.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The proposal, if located or carried out within a floodplain,  poses a greater than normal risk for flood-caused loss of life or  property. Examples of such actions include facilities which produce,  use, or store highly volatile, toxic, or water-reactive materials or  facilities which contain occupants who may not be sufficiently mobile to  avoid the loss of life or injury during flood and storm events (i.e.,  hospitals, nursing homes, schools).</p>
