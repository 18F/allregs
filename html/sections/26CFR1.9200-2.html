                                Sec. 1.9200-2  Manner of taking deduction.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The deduction provided by Sec. 1.9200-1 shall be  taken by multiplying the amount of the monthly deduction determined  under Sec. 1.9200-1 (c)(2) for each motor carrier operating authority  by the number of months in the taxable year for which the deduction is  allowable, and entering the resulting amount at the appropriate place on  the taxpayer's return for each year in which the deduction is properly  claimed. Additionally, any taxpayer who has claimed the deduction  provided by Sec. 1.9200-1 must (unless it has already filed a statement  containing the required information) attach a statement to the next  income tax return of the taxpayer which has a filing due date on or  after June 4, 1984. The statement shall provide, in addition to the  taxpayer's name, address, and taxpayer identification number, the  following information for each motor carrier operating authority for  which a deduction was claimed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The taxable year of the taxpayer for which the deduction was  first claimed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If an allocation of stock basis has been made under Sec.  1.9200-1(e)(2), the calculations made in determining the amount of basis  to be allocated to the authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Filing and amendment of returns. A taxpayer who has filed its  return for the taxable year that includes July 1, 1980, claiming the  deduction allowed under Sec. 1.9200-1, may amend its return for such  year in order to elect under Sec. 1.9200-1(c)(1)(ii) to begin the 60- month period in the subsequent taxable year. A taxpayer eligible to take  the deduction under Sec. 1.9200-1 who has filed its returns for both  the taxable year that includes July 1, 1980, and the following taxable  year without claiming the deduction, may claim the deduction by filing  amended returns or claims for refund for the taxable year in which the  taxpayer elects to begin the 60-month period, and for subsequent taxable  years. If a taxpayer first claims the deduction on an amended return  under the preceding sentence, the statement required by paragraph (a) of  this section must be attached to such amended return.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Deduction taken for operating authority other than under Sec.  1.9200-1. If a deduction other than the deduction allowed under Sec.  1.9200-1 was taken in any taxable year for the reduction in value of a  motor carrier operating authority caused by administrative or  legislative actions to decrease restrictions on entry into the  interstate motor carrier business, the taxpayer should file an amended  return for such taxable year which computes taxable income without  regard to such deduction.
