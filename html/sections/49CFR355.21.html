With respect to any State law or regulation which is not  the same as the FMCSRs (FHMRs must be identical), the State shall  identify such law or regulation and determine whether:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It has the same effect as a corresponding section of the Federal  Motor Carrier Safety Regulations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It applies to interstate commerce;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> It is more stringent than the FMCSRs in that it is more  restrictive or places a greater burden on any entity subject to its  provisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the inconsistent State law or regulation applies to  interstate commerce and is more stringent than the FMCSRs, the State  shall determine:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The safety benefits associated with such State law or  regulation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The effect of the enforcement of such State law or regulation  on interstate commerce.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the inconsistent State law or regulation does not apply to  interstate commerce or is less stringent than the FMCSRs, the guidelines  for participation in the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program in  Sec.
