Good cause may be established when--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There is new and material evidence that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Was not available or known at the time of the determination or decision; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> May result in a different conclusion; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The evidence that was considered in making the determination or decision clearly shows on its face that an obvious error was made at the time of the determination or decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Change in substantive law or interpretative policy. (1) General rule. A change of legal interpretation or policy by CMS in a regulation, CMS ruling, or CMS general instruction, whether made in response to judicial precedent or otherwise, is not a basis for reopening a determination or hearing decision regarding appeals under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An adjudicator may reopen a determination or decision to apply the current law or CMS or the Part D plan sponsor policy rather than the law or CMS or the Part D plan sponsor policy at the time the coverage determination is made in situations where the enrollee has not yet received the drug and the current law or CMS or the Part D plan sponsor policy may affect whether the drug should be received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Third party payer error. A request to reopen a claim based upon a third party payer's error in making a primary payment determination when Medicare processed the claim in accordance with the information in its system of records or on the claim form does not constitute good cause for reopening.</p>
