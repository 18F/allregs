                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Administrator may assess a civil money penalty not to exceed  $1,000 per nurse per violation, with the total penalty not to exceed  $10,000 per violation. The Administrator also may impose appropriate  remedies, including the payment of back wages, the performance of  attested obligations such as providing training, and reinstatement and/ or wages for laid off U.S. nurses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In determining the amount of civil money penalty to be assessed  for any violation, the Administrator will consider the type of violation  committed and other relevant factors. The matters which may be  considered include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Previous history of violation, or violations, by the facility  under the Act and subpart L or M of this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The number of workers affected by the violation or violations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The gravity of the violation or violations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Efforts made by the violator in good faith to comply with the  Attestation as provided in the Act and subparts L and M of this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The violator's explanation of the violation or violations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The violator's commitment to future compliance, taking into  account the public health, interest, or safety; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The extent to which the violator achieved a financial gain due  to the violation, or the potential financial loss or potential injury or  adverse effect upon the workers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The civil money penalty, back wages, and any other remedy  determined by the Administrator to be appropriate, are immediately due  for payment or performance upon the assessment by the Administrator, or  the decision by an administrative law judge where a hearing is  requested, or the decision by the Secretary where review is granted. The  facility must remit the amount of the civil money penalty, by certified  check or money order made payable to the order of ``Wage and Hour  Division, Labor.'' The remittance must be delivered or mailed to the  Wage and Hour Division Regional Office for the area in which the  violation(s) occurred. The payment of back wages, monetary relief, and/ or the performance or any other remedy prescribed by the Administrator  will follow procedures established by the Administrator. The facility's  failure to pay the civil money penalty, back wages, or other monetary  relief, or to perform any other assessed remedy, will result in the  rejection by ETA of   any future Attestation submitted by the facility until such payment or  performance is accomplished.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as  amended (28 U.S.C. 2461 note), requires that inflationary adjustments to  civil money penalties in accordance with a specified cost-of-living  formula be made, by regulation, at least every four years. The  adjustments are to be based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for  all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the U.S. City Average for All Items. The  adjusted amounts will be published in the Federal Register. The amount  of the penalty in a particular case will be based on the amount of the  penalty in effect at the time the violation occurs.</p>
