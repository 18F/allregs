                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The retention periods in 4.705 are calculated from the end of  the contractor's fiscal year in which an entry is made charging or  allocating a cost to a Government contract or subcontract. If a specific  record contains a series of entries, the retention period is calculated  from the end of the contractor's fiscal year in which the final entry is  made. The contractor should cut off the records in annual blocks and  retain them for block disposal under the prescribed retention periods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When records generated during a prior contract are relied upon  by a contractor for certified cost or pricing data in negotiating a  succeeding contract, the prescribed periods shall run from the date of  the succeeding contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If two or more of the record categories described in 4.705 are  interfiled and screening for disposal is not practical, the contractor  shall retain the entire record series for the longest period prescribed  for any category of records.
