                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Requests for extensions of time for regulatory  elections that do not meet the requirements of Sec. 301.9100-2 must be  made under the rules of this section. Requests for relief subject to  this section will be granted when the taxpayer provides the evidence  (including affidavits described in paragraph (e) of this section) to  establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the taxpayer  acted reasonably and in good faith, and the grant of relief will not  prejudice the interests of the Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reasonable action and good faith--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as  provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section, a  taxpayer is deemed to have acted reasonably and in good faith if the  taxpayer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Requests relief under this section before the failure to make  the regulatory election is discovered by the Internal Revenue Service  (IRS);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Failed to make the election because of intervening events  beyond the taxpayer's control;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Failed to make the election because, after exercising  reasonable diligence (taking into account the taxpayer's experience and  the complexity of the return or issue), the taxpayer was unaware of the  necessity for the election;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Reasonably relied on the written advice of the Internal Revenue  Service (IRS); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional, including a  tax professional employed by the taxpayer, and the tax professional  failed to make, or advise the taxpayer to make, the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reasonable reliance on a qualified tax professional. For  purposes of this paragraph (b), a taxpayer will not be considered to  have reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional if the taxpayer  knew or should have known that the professional was not--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Competent to render advice on the regulatory election; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Aware of all relevant facts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Taxpayer deemed to have not acted reasonably or in good faith.  For purposes of this paragraph (b), a taxpayer is deemed to have not  acted reasonably and in good faith if the taxpayer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Seeks to alter a return position for which an accuracy-related  penalty has been or could be imposed under section 6662 at the time the  taxpayer requests relief (taking into account any qualified amended  return filed within the meaning of Sec. 1.6664-2(c)(3) of this chapter)  and the new position requires or permits a regulatory election for which  relief is requested;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Was informed in all material respects of the required election  and related tax consequences, but chose not to file the election; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Uses hindsight in requesting relief. If specific facts have  changed since the due date for making the election that make the  election advantageous to a taxpayer, the IRS will not ordinarily grant  relief. In such a case, the IRS will grant relief only when the taxpayer  provides strong proof that the taxpayer's decision to seek relief did  not involve hindsight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Prejudice to the interests of the Government--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.  The Commissioner will grant a reasonable extension of time to make a  regulatory election only when the interests of the Government will not  be prejudiced by the granting of relief. This paragraph (c) provides the  standards the Commissioner will use to determine when the interests of  the Government are prejudiced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Lower tax liability. The interests of the Government are  prejudiced if granting relief would result in a taxpayer having a lower  tax liability in the aggregate for all taxable years affected by the  election than the taxpayer would have had if the election had been  timely made (taking into account the time value of money). Similarly, if  the tax consequences of more than one taxpayer are affected by the  election, the Government's interests are prejudiced if extending the  time for making the election may result in the affected taxpayers, in  the aggregate, having a lower tax liability than if the election had  been timely made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Closed years. The interests of the Government are ordinarily  prejudiced if the taxable year in which the regulatory election should  have been made or any taxable years that would have been affected by the  election had it been timely made are closed by the period of limitations  on assessment under section 6501(a) before the taxpayer's receipt of a  ruling granting relief under this section. The IRS may condition a grant  of relief on the taxpayer providing the IRS with a statement from an  independent auditor (other than an auditor providing an affidavit  pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section) certifying that the  interests of the Government are not prejudiced under the standards set  forth in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules for accounting method regulatory elections. The  interests of the Government are deemed to be prejudiced except in  unusual and compelling circumstances if the accounting method regulatory  election for which relief is requested--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  of this chapter (requiring the advance written consent of the  Commissioner);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Requires an adjustment under section 481(a) (or would require  an adjustment under section 481(a) if the taxpayer changed to the method  of accounting for which relief is requested in a taxable year subsequent  to the taxable year the election should have been made);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Would permit a change from an impermissible method of  accounting that is an issue under consideration by examination, an  appeals office, or a federal court and the change would provide a more  favorable method or more favorable terms and conditions than if the  change were made as part of an examination; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Provides a more favorable method of accounting or more  favorable terms and conditions if the election is made by a certain date  or taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rules for accounting period regulatory elections. The  interests of the Government are deemed to be prejudiced except in  unusual and compelling circumstances if an election is an accounting  period regulatory election (other than the election to use other than  the required taxable year under section 444) and the request for relief  is filed more than 90 days after the due date for filing the Form 1128,  Application to Adopt, Change, or Retain a Tax Year (or other required  statement).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effect of amended returns--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Second examination under section  7605(b). Taxpayers requesting and receiving an extension of time under  this section waive any objections to a second examination under section  7605(b) for the issue(s) that is the subject of the relief request and  any correlative adjustments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Suspension of the period of limitations under section 6501(a). A  request for   relief under this section does not suspend the period of limitations on  assessment under section 6501(a). Thus, for relief to be granted, the  IRS may require the taxpayer to consent under section 6501(c)(4) to an  extension of the period of limitations on assessment for the taxable  year in which the regulatory election should have been made and any  taxable years that would have been affected by the election had it been  timely made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Procedural requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Requests for relief  under this section must provide evidence that satisfies the requirements  in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and must provide additional  information as required by this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Affidavit and declaration from taxpayer. The taxpayer, or the  individual who acts on behalf of the taxpayer with respect to tax  matters, must submit a detailed affidavit describing the events that led  to the failure to make a valid regulatory election and to the discovery  of the failure. When the taxpayer relied on a qualified tax professional  for advice, the taxpayer's affidavit must describe the engagement and  responsibilities of the professional as well as the extent to which the  taxpayer relied on the professional. The affidavit must be accompanied  by a dated declaration, signed by the taxpayer, which states: ``Under  penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this request,  including accompanying documents, and, to the best of my knowledge and  belief, the request contains all the relevant facts relating to the  request, and such facts are true, correct, and complete.'' The  individual who signs for an entity must have personal knowledge of the  facts and circumstances at issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Affidavits and declarations from other parties. The taxpayer  must submit detailed affidavits from the individuals having knowledge or  information about the events that led to the failure to make a valid  regulatory election and to the discovery of the failure. These  individuals must include the taxpayer's return preparer, any individual  (including an employee of the taxpayer) who made a substantial  contribution to the preparation of the return, and any accountant or  attorney, knowledgeable in tax matters, who advised the taxpayer with  regard to the election. An affidavit must describe the engagement and  responsibilities of the individual as well as the advice that the  individual provided to the taxpayer. Each affidavit must include the  name, current address, and taxpayer identification number of the  individual, and be accompanied by a dated declaration, signed by the  individual, which states: ``Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I  have examined this request, including accompanying documents, and, to  the best of my knowledge and belief, the request contains all the  relevant facts relating to the request, and such facts are true,  correct, and complete.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Other information. The request for relief filed under this  section must also contain the following information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer must state whether the taxpayer's return(s) for the  taxable year in which the regulatory election should have been made or  any taxable years that would have been affected by the election had it  been timely made is being examined by a district director, or is being  considered by an appeals office or a federal court. The taxpayer must  notify the IRS office considering the request for relief if the IRS  starts an examination of any such return while the taxpayer's request  for relief is pending;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The taxpayer must state when the applicable return, form, or  statement used to make the election was required to be filed and when it  was actually filed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The taxpayer must submit a copy of any documents that refer to  the election;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> When requested, the taxpayer must submit a copy of the  taxpayer's return for any taxable year for which the taxpayer requests  an extension of time to make the election and any return affected by the  election; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> When applicable, the taxpayer must submit a copy of the returns  of other taxpayers affected by the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Filing instructions. A request for relief under this section is  a request for a letter ruling. Requests for relief should be submitted  in accordance with the applicable procedures for requests   for a letter ruling and must be accompanied by the applicable user fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Taxpayer discovers own error. Taxpayer A prepares A's  1997 income tax return. A is unaware that a particular regulatory  election is available to report a transaction in a particular manner. A  files the 1997 return without making the election and reporting the  transaction in a different manner. In 1999, A hires a qualified tax  professional to prepare A's 1999 return. The professional discovers that  A did not make the election. A promptly files for relief in accordance  with this section. Assume paragraphs (b)(3) (i) through (iii) of this  section do not apply. Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, A is  deemed to have acted reasonably and in good faith because A requested  relief before the failure to make the regulatory election was discovered  by the IRS.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Reliance on qualified tax professional. Taxpayer B hires  a qualified tax professional to advise B on preparing B's 1997 income  tax return. The professional was competent to render advice on the  election and B provided the professional with all the relevant facts.  The professional fails to advise B that a regulatory election is  necessary in order for B to report income on B's 1997 return in a  particular manner. Nevertheless, B reports this income in a manner that  is consistent with having made the election. In 2000, during the  examination of the 1997 return by the IRS, the examining agent discovers  that the election has not been filed. B promptly files for relief in  accordance with this section, including attaching an affidavit from B's  professional stating that the professional failed to advise B that the  election was necessary. Assume paragraphs (b)(3) (i) through (iii) of  this section do not apply. Under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, B  is deemed to have acted reasonably and in good faith because B  reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional and the tax  professional failed to advise B to make the election.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Accuracy-related penalty. Taxpayer C reports income on  its 1997 income tax return in a manner that is contrary to a regulatory  provision. In 2000, during the examination of the 1997 return, the IRS  raises an issue regarding the reporting of this income on C's return and  asserts the accuracy-related penalty under section 6662. C requests  relief under this section to elect an alternative method of reporting  the income. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, C is deemed to  have not acted reasonably and in good faith because C seeks to alter a  return position for which an accuracy-related penalty could be imposed  under section 6662.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Election not requiring adjustment under section 481(a).  Taxpayer D prepares D's 1997 income tax return. D is unaware that a  particular accounting method regulatory election is available. D files  D's 1997 return without making the election and uses another permissible  method of accounting. The applicable regulation provides that the  election is made on a cut-off basis (without an adjustment under section  481(a)). In 1998, D requests relief under this section to make the  election under the regulation. If D were granted an extension of time to  make the election, D would pay no less tax than if the election had been  timely made. Assume that paragraphs (c)(2) (i), (iii), and (iv) of this  section do not apply. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the  interests of the Government are not deemed to be prejudiced because the  election does not require an adjustment under section 481(a).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Election requiring adjustment under section 481(a). The  facts are the same as in Example 4 of this paragraph (f) except that the  applicable regulation provides that the election requires an adjustment  under section 481(a). Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the  interests of the Government are deemed to be prejudiced except in  unusual or compelling circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Under examination by the IRS. A regulation permits an  automatic change in method of accounting for an item on a cut-off basis.  Taxpayer E reports income on E's 1997 income tax return using an  impermissible method of accounting for the item. In 2000, during the  examination of the 1997 return by the IRS, the examining agent notifies  E in writing that its method of accounting for the item is an issue  under consideration. Any change from the impermissible method made as  part of an examination is made with an adjustment under section 481(a).  E requests relief under this section to make the change pursuant to the  regulation for 1997. The change on a cut-off basis under the regulation  would be more favorable than if the change were made with an adjustment  under section 481(a) as part of an examination. Under paragraph  (c)(2)(iii) of this section, the interests of the Government are deemed  to be prejudiced except in unusual and compelling circumstances because  E seeks to change from an impermissible method of accounting that is an  issue under consideration in the examination on a basis that is more  favorable than if the change were made as part of an examination.

Elections  under section 508(c) or 509 of the Act shall be made by the due date  (taking extensions into account) of the income tax return for the  taxable year for which the election is to be effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Manner of making elections. The elections specified in paragraph  (a)(1) of this section shall be made by attaching a statement to the  income tax return (or amended return) for the taxable year for which the  election is made. Except as otherwise provided in the return or in the  instructions accompanying the return for the taxable year, the statement  shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of  the electing taxpayer,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Identify the election,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Indicate the section of the Code (or, if the provision is not  codified, the section of the Act) under which the election is being  made,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Specify the period for which the election is being made and the  property to which the election is to apply, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Provide any information required by the relevant statutory  provisions and any information necessary to show that the taxpayer is  entitled to make the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>.

The rules of section 21 (relating to effects of changes in rates   during a taxable year) shall apply in the case of any taxable year  beginning before 1982 for which a designation is made. The statement of  designation shall be signed by the candidate and shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of  the candidate and of the committee,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identify the statement as a designation under section 527(h) of  the Code, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Designate the committee as the principal campaign committee of  the candidate.  The candidate shall attach to the statement a copy of the statement of  designation filed with the Federal Election Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Election to be treated as a qualified fund for purposes of the  research credit. This paragraph applies to the election provided under  section 44F(e)(4) of the Code, as added by section 221(a) of the Act.  The election to be treated as a qualified fund for purposes of the  research credit may be made effective as of any date after June 30,  1981, and before January 1, 1986. An organization shall make this  election by filing with the service center with which it files its  annual return a statement signed by a person authorized to act on behalf  of the organization. That statement shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of  the electing organization and of the organization that established and  maintains the electing organization,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identify the election as an election under section 44F(e)(4) of  the Code,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specify the date on which the election is to become effective  (in the case of elections filed before February 1, 1982, not earlier  than the date that is 7 months before the date on which the election is  filed; in the case of elections filed after January 31, 1982, not  earlier than the date on which the election is filed), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Provide all information necessary to show that the organization  is entitled to make the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Election to treat qualified subchapter S trust as grantor trust.  This paragraph applies to the election provided under section 1371(g)(2)  of the Code, as added by section 234(b) of the Act. The election to  treat a qualified subchapter S trust as a grantor trust described in  section 1371(e)(1)(A) of the Code is available for taxable years  beginning after 1981. The beneficiary of the trust (or the legal  representative of the beneficiary) shall make this election by signing  and filing with the service center with which the subchapter S  corporation files its income tax return a statement that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contains the name, address, and taxpayer identification number  of the beneficiary, the trust, and the subchapter S corporation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>  of the Code,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specifies the date on which the election is to become effective  (not earlier than 60 days before the date on which the election is  filed), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Provides all information necessary to show that the beneficiary  is entitled to make the election.  Note that this election does not itself constitute an election as to the  status of the corporation; the corporation must make the election  provided in section 1372(a) to be treated as an electing small business  corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Election to have Code section 422A apply to options granted  before 1981. This paragraph applies to the election provided under  section 251(c)(1)(B) of the Act to have Code section 422A apply to  certain options granted before 1981. A corporation may make only one  election under this provision. Thus, a corporation that makes an  election under this provision with respect to certain options granted  before 1981 may not make any subsequent election under this provision  with respect to other options granted before 1981. An election under  this provision shall be made no later than the due date (taking  extensions into account) of the income tax return of the corporation for  its first taxable year during which either an option subject to the  election or an option subject to the rules of section 422A of the Code  is exercised. In any event, no election under this provision will be  permitted after the due date (taking extensions into account) of the  income tax return for the taxable year including December 31, 1982. A  corporation shall make this election by attaching   to its income tax return (or amended return) a statement that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contains the name, address, and taxpayer identification number  of the corporation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identifies the election as an election under section  251(c)(1)(B) of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specifies the options to which the election applies, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Provides all information necessary to show that the corporation  is entitled to make the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Election to increase basis of property on which additional  estate tax is imposed. This paragraph applies to the election provided  under section 1016(c) of the Code, as amended by section 421(g) of the  Act. The election to increase the basis of property on which additional  estate tax is imposed is available with respect to the estates of  decedents dying after 1981. The qualified heir shall make this election  by filing with the Form 706-A (Additional Estate Tax Return) a statement  that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contains the name, address, and taxpayer identification number  of the qualified heir and of the estate,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identifies the election as an election under section 1016(c) of  the Code,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specifies the property with respect to which the election is  made, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Provides any additional information required by the instructions  accompanying Form 706-A.  A qualified heir making an election under this paragraph must pay  interest on the additional estate tax from the date that is 9 months  after the date of the decedent's death to the date of the payment of the  additional estate tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Revocation of elections.

In the case  of partnerships and S corporations, the election under section 431(e) is  made, respectively, at the partner or the shareholder level. Any  election made under section 431(e) shall apply to all property of the  taxpayer to which the   amendments made by section 211(f) of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of  1981 apply.

The statement, however, need not specify each  individual contract for which the election is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(C))</em> shall be treated as a change  in basis of computing reserves that is subject to the adjustment  provided in section 807(f) of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Church or qualified church-controlled organization's election of  exemption from social security taxes under chapter 21--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

Any election made under  section 3121(w) shall apply to all services performed on or after  January 1, 1984, by employees of such church or organization (whether or  not they were employees on that date or on the date the election is  made). Employees of the electing church or organization are subject to  the provisions of chapter 2 of the Code (relating to the tax on self- employment income) as amended by section 2603 (c)(2) and (d)(2) of the  Act for service performed for such church or organization on or after  January 1, 1984.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> shall be void.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Manner of making the election. To make an election under section  3121(w), a church or qualified church-controlled organization must  certify that it is opposed for religious reasons to the payment of the  tax imposed by section 3111 (relating to the employer tax) of the Code.  The election and certification are made by executing and filing Form  8274 in accordance with the form and its instructions. The form shall be  signed by an official authorized to sign tax returns for the church or  organization. Where tax imposed by section 3111 is reported (or would be  reported but for this election) with respect to more   than one church or organization on a single quarterly employment tax  return, and the election under section 3121(w) is made, then all of the  churches and organizations covered by the last such return filed before  such election was made for which the time for making the election has  not expired shall be covered by the election unless specifically  excluded by stating such exclusion in the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Refunds of FICA taxes paid. Where a church or qualified church- controlled organization makes a timely election under section 3121(w), a  refund, without interest, shall be made to such church or organization  of any taxes paid under sections 3101 and 3111 with respect to service  performed after December 31, 1983, covered by the election. However, the  refund will be made only if the church or organization agrees on its  claim for the refund to pay to each employee covered by the election the  portion of the refund attributable to the tax imposed on the wages of  the employee by section 3101. The employee may not receive any other  refund of such taxes. The claim for refund shall be made by the church  or organization by filing Form 843 with the service center where the  Form 941 on which the taxes subject to refund was filed. Form 843 shall  be executed in accordance with the form and its instructions, and also  in accordance with the instructions to Form 8274 that relate to Form  843.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Irrevocability of election except by Commissioner. An election  under section 3121 shall be irrevocable by the electing church or  organization. The Commissioner, however, shall permanently revoke the  election if the church or organization fails to furnish the information  required under section 6051 to the Internal Revenue Service for a period  of 2 years or more and also fails to furnish such information within 60  days after a written request therefor is made by the Internal Revenue  Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 and shall contain the name, address  and taxpayer identification number of the issuer, and the total purchase  price, face amount and interest rate of the issue, bond issuance costs,  amounts allocated to reasonably required reserve or replacement funds,  and the date of issue. The issuer shall attach to the statement of  election a copy of previous Internal Revenue Service correspondence  relating to the tax exempt status of the issuing authority and a  statement containing the total purchase price, face amount, interest  rate, bond issuance costs, amounts allocated to reasonably required  reserve or replacement funds, and the date of issuance of outstanding  tax exempt issues of student loan bonds of the issuer. With respect to  outstanding tax exempt issues of student loan bonds of the issuer issued  after December 31, 1982, the issuer may alternatively attach copies of  the Form 8038 filed with respect to such issues. Each taxable student  loan bond must state on its face that the interest paid on such bond is  subject to federal income taxation. An election with respect to an issue  is irrevocable once made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Election not to claim the credit for alcohol used as fuel. The  election under section 40(f) (as added by section 474(k) of the Act) not  to claim the alcohol fuels credit is available for taxable years  beginning after December 31, 1983, and shall be made for the taxable  year in which such credit is determined by not claiming such credit on  an original return or amended return at any time before the expiration  of the 3-year period beginning on the last date prescribed by law for  filing the return for the taxable year (determined without regard for  extensions). The election may be revoked within the 3-year period by  filing an amended return and claiming the credit on the return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Protective election to adopt LIFO method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Time for making  the election. A protective election in connection with the enactment of  section 95 of the   Act to adopt the LIFO method of accounting for inventory under section  472 of the Code can only be made for the taxpayer's first taxable year  beginning after July 18, 1984, and must be made on or before the due  date (including extensions) of the tax return for such taxable year.  Once made, the election is irrevocable unless the Commissioner  authorizes the use of another inventory method (see Sec. 1.472-5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Manner for making a protective election. The protective election  is made by completing all line items on a current Form 970 and  indicating that the election is a protective election filed in  connection with the enactment of section 95 of the Tax Reform Act of  1984. The Form 970 must be attached to the taxpayer's income tax return  for the taxable year for which the protective election is made. The LIFO  method adopted under the protective election must be consistent in all  respects with the taxpayer's LIFO method used in the taxpayer's most  recently completed taxable year for which the LIFO method was used. In  completing the current Form 970, the taxpayer shall specify the method  of inventory valuation that the taxpayer would have used, the opening  LIFO inventory for the taxable year for which the protective election is  made, and the section 481 adjustment that would be required, as if the  taxpayer were not on the LIFO method for the taxable year immediately  preceding the taxable year for which the protective election is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Election by an estate or trust to recognize gain or loss on the  distribution of property (other than cash) to a beneficiary. This  paragraph applies to the election made by a trust or estate to recognize  gain or loss on the distribution of property (other than cash) to a  beneficiary under section 643(d) of the Code as amended by section 81 of  the Act. The election is available for distributions made after June 1,  1984, in taxable years ending after such date. The election must be made  by the fiduciary who is required to make the return of the estate or  trust under section 641 and Sec. 1.641(b)-2. The election shall be made  by such fiduciary on the tax return of the estate or trust for the  taxable year with respect to which the distribution of property was made  and must be filed by the due date (including extensions) of such return.  Until the Form 1041, U.S. Fiduciary Income Tax Return is revised, the  election should be made by including the gain or loss on the Schedule D  (or other appropriate schedule, if applicable) of the Form 1041 and  attaching the statement described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section to  the tax return on which the election is made and including on that  statement the name and taxpayer identification number of the  distributee. For distributions made after June 1, 1984, and before July  18, 1984, the election must be filed by the later of the due date  (including extentions) of the tax return of the estate or trust for the  taxable year with respect to which the distribution was made or January  1, 1985. For those distributions, the fiduciary may make the election in  the manner described above on a tax return, or amended return, for the  year with respect to which the distribution was made. An election under  section 643(d) may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner.  The request for revocation of an election should be made by the  fiduciary in the form of a ruling request and must contain the  information required by regulations and revenue procedures pertaining  thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Election to treat a stapled foreign entity as a subsidiary. This  paragraph applies to the election, provided under section 136(c)(6) of  the Act, to treat a foreign corporation which was a stapled entity with  a domestic corporation as of June 30, 1983, as being owned (to the  extent of its stapled interests) by the domestic corporation with which  it is stapled. This treatment, if so elected, is in lieu of the  treatment prescribed in section 269B(a)(1) of the Code, as added by the  Act. This election may be made by the domestic corporation with which  the foreign entity is stapled. The election may not be made by the  foreign entity or by shareholders of the domestic corporation. This  election must be made no later than January 14, 1985, and may be revoked  only with the consent of the Commissioner. This election shall be  effective after December 31, 1986. The domestic corporation shall make  this   election by filing with the service center with which the domestic  corporation files its income tax return a statement that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contains the name, address, and taxpayer identification number  of the domestic corporation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identifies the election as made under section 136(c)(6) of the  Tax Reform Act of 1984, and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Identifies the foreign entity and the interests in the foreign  entity which constitute stapled interests with respect to the stock of  the domestic corporation, and specifies the date on which those  interests became stapled interests.  If this election is not made, the foreign corporation (interests in  which were stapled interests as of June 30, 1983) will be treated as a  domestic corporation, effective January 1, 1987, under section  269B(a)(1) of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Election to treat certain section 1248 amounts as included in  gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A).

The election with respect to transactions to which section  1248(a) applies may be made by the foreign corporation described in  section 1248(a) (or its successor in interest). The election with  respect to transactions to which section 1248(f) applies may be made by  the domestic corporation described in section 1248(f)(1) (or its  successor in interest). Neither election may be made by an affected  shareholder of any such corporation (unless the shareholder is the  successor in interest). This election must be made no later than January  14, 1985, and shall apply with respect to all transactions to which  section 1248 (a) or (f) applies that occurred after October 9, 1975, and  before July 19, 1984. Once made, the election may be revoked only with  the consent of the Commissioner. A foreign corporation shall make this  election by filing the statement described in this paragraph with the  Internal Revenue Service Center, Philadelphia, PA 19255. A domestic  corporation shall make this election by filing the statement described  in this paragraph with the service center with which the domestic  corporation files its income tax return.

This paragraph applies to the election by a regulated investment  company provided under section 1071(b) of the Act, which added section  852(b)(2)(F) to the Code. Under section 852(b)(2)(F), the taxable income  of a regulated investment company shall be computed without regard to  section 454(b) (relating to short-term obligations issued on a discount  basis) if the company so elects. The election may be made only for  taxable years beginning after December 31, 1978. A regulated investment  company shall make the election by computing taxable income without  regard to section 454(b) on its return for the first taxable year for  which it desires the election to apply and shall attach the statement  described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section to the return on which the  election is made. A regulated investment company shall make the election  by the time set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
