Such claim  must be based on an increase in the impairment rating that is the result  of the covered illness or illnesses from the impairment rating that  formed the basis for the last award of such benefits by OWCP. OWCP will  only adjudicate claims for such an increased rating that are filed at  least two years from the date of the last award of impairment benefits.
