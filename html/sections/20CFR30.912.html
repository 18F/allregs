Such claim must be based on an increase in the impairment rating that is the result of the covered illness or illnesses from the impairment rating that formed the basis for the last award of such benefits by OWCP. OWCP will only adjudicate claims for such an increased rating that are filed at least two years from the date of the last award of impairment benefits. However, OWCP will not wait two years before it will adjudicate a claim for additional impairment that is based on an allegation that the employee sustained a new covered illness.</p><p class="depth0">SUBCHAPTERS D	E [RESERVED]</p><p class="depth0">SUBCHAPTER F_COMPENSATION FOR INJURY, DISABILITY, DEATH, OR ENEMY</p><p class="depth0">DETENTION OF EMPLOYEES OF CONTRACTORS WITH THE UNITED STATES</p>
