Section 189.35-13 may be used as a  guide for the safety assessment. It shall be the responsibility of the  owner or operator to notify the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, of  the time and place of the installation tests when occurring in a port of  the United States to permit a marine inspector to witness the tests if  desired. Subsequent owner or operator conducted tests may be required at  the time of the vessel's inspection periods if a visual examination or  review of the equipment record reveals evidence of an unsafe condition.  Tests should normally consist of exercising the equipment as a unit with  a proof load 25 percent in excess of the equipment's normal working  load, however manufacturer's design limitations should not be exceeded.  Consideration shall be given to the plans of loading when conducting  these tests. Braking, safety and limiting devices shall be tested  whenever feasible.</p>
