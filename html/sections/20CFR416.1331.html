                                Sec. 416.1331  Termination of your disability or blindness payments.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The last month for which we can pay you benefits based  on disability or blindness is the second month after the month in which  your disability or blindness ends. (See Secs. 416.987(e), 416.994(b)(6)  and 416.994a(g) for when disability ends, and Sec. 416.986 for when  blindness ends.) See Sec. 416.1338 for an exception to this rule if you  are participating in an appropriate program of vocational rehabilitation  services, employment services, or other support services. You must meet  the income, resources, and other eligibility requirements to receive any  of the benefits referred to in this paragraph. We will also stop payment  of your benefits if you have not cooperated with us in getting  information about your disability or blindness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After we make a determination that you are not now disabled or  blind. If we determine that you do not meet the disability or blindness  requirements of the law, we will send you an advance written notice  telling you why we believe you are not disabled or blind and when your  benefits should stop. The notice will explain your right to appeal if  you disagree with our determination. You may still appeal our  determination that you are not now disabled or blind even though your  payments are continuing because of your participation in an appropriate  program of vocational rehabilitation services, employment services, or  other support services. You may also appeal a determination that your  completion of, or continuation for a specified period of time in, an  appropriate program of vocational rehabilitation services, employment  services, or other support services will not increase the likelihood  that you will not have to return to the disability or blindness benefit  rolls and, therefore, you are not eligible to continue to receive  benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When benefits terminate due to 12 consecutive suspension months  for failure to comply with treatment for drug addiction or alcoholism.  If you are disabled and drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing  factor material to the determination of disability as described in  Sec. 416.935, your benefits will terminate after 12 consecutive months  of suspension for noncompliance with treatment requirements as described  in Sec. 416.1326.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When benefits terminate due to payment of 36 months of benefits  based on disability when drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing  factor material to the determination of disability. If you are disabled  and drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing factor material to  the determination of disability as described in Sec. 416.935, your  benefits will terminate after you receive a total of 36 months of SSI  benefits. The 36-month limit is no longer effective for benefits for  months beginning after September 2004.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Months we count in determining the 36 months of benefits when  drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing factor material to the  determination of disability. Beginning March 1995, we will count all  months for which you were paid an SSI benefit, a federally-administered  State supplement, a special SSI cash benefit, or you were in special SSI  eligibility status, toward the 36 months described in paragraph (d) of  this section. Months for which you were not eligible for benefits will  not count toward the 36 months.
