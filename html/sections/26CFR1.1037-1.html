                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Nonrecognition of gain or loss--(1) In general. Section 1037(a) provides for the nonrecognition of gain or loss on the surrender to the United States of obligations of the United States issued under the Second Liberty Bond Act (31 U.S.C. 774(2)) when such obligations are exchanged solely for other obligations issued under that Act and the Secretary provides by regulations promulgated in connection with the issue of such other obligations that gain or loss is not to be recognized on such exchange. It is not necessary that at the time of the exchange the obligation which is surrendered to the United States be a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. For purposes of section 1037(a) and this subparagraph, a circular of the Treasury Department which offers to exchange obligations of the United States issued under the Second Liberty Bond Act for other obligations issued under that Act shall constitute regulations promulgated by the Secretary in connection with the issue of the obligations offered to be exchanged if such circular contains a declaration by the Secretary that no gain or loss shall be recognized for Federal income tax purposes on the exchange or grants the privilege of continuing to defer the reporting of the income of the bonds exchanged until such time as the bonds received in the exchange are redeemed or disposed of, or have reached final maturity, whichever is earlier. See, for example, regulations of the Bureau of the Public Debt, 31 CFR part 339, or Treasury Department Circular 1066, 26 FR 8647. The application of section 1037(a) and this subparagraph will not be precluded merely because the taxpayer is required to pay money on the exchange. See section 1031 and the regulations thereunder if the taxpayer receives money on the exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

Gain or loss which has been realized but not recognized on the exchange of a U.S. obligation for another such obligation because of the provisions of section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031 (b) or (c) as related to section 1037(a)) shall be recognized at such time as the obligation received in the exchange is disposed of, or redeemed, in a transaction other than an exchange described in section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031 (b) or (c) as relates to section 1037(a)) or reaches final maturity, whichever is earlier, to the extent gain or loss is realized on such later transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Illustrations. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples, in which it is assumed that the taxpayer uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and has never elected under section 454(a) to include in gross income currently the annual increase

in the redemption price of non-interest-bearing obligations issued at a discount. In addition, it is assumed that the old obligations exchanged are capital assets transferred in an exchange in respect of which regulations are promulgated pursuant to section 1037(a):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, the owner of a $1,000 series E U.S. savings bond purchased for $750 and bearing an issue date of May 1, 1945, surrenders the bond to the United States in exchange solely for series H U.S. savings bonds on February 1, 1964, when the series E bond has a redemption value of $1,304.80. In the exchange A pays an additional $195.20 and obtains three $500 series H bonds. None of the $554.80 gain ($1,304.80 less $750) realized by A on the series E bond is recognized at the time of the exchange.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. In 1963, B purchased for $97 a marketable U.S. bond which was originally issued at its par value of $100. In 1964 he surrenders the bond to the United States in exchange solely for another marketable U.S. bond which then has a fair market value of $95. B's loss of $2 on the old bond is not recognized at the time of the exchange, and his basis for the new bond is $97 under section 1031(d). If it has been necessary for B to pay $1 additional consideration in the exchange, his basis in the new bond would be $98.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example (2) except that B also receives $1 interest on the old bond for the period which has elapsed since the last interest payment date and that B does not pay any additional consideration on the exchange. As in example (2), B has a loss of $2 which is not recognized at the time of the exchange and his basis in the new bond is $97. In addition, the $1 of interest received on the old bond is includible in gross income. B holds the new bond 1 year and sells it in the market for $99 plus interest. At this time he has a gain of $2, the difference between his basis of $97 in the new bond and the sales price of such bond. In addition, the interest received on the new bond is includible in gross income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in example (2), except that in addition to the new bond B also receives $1.85 in cash, $0.85 of which is interest. The $0.85 interest received is includible in gross income. B's loss of $1 ($97 less $96) on the old bond is not recognized at the time of the exchange by reason of section 1031(c). Under section 1031(d) B's basis in the new bond is $96 (his basis of $97 in the old bond, reduced by the $1 cash received in the exchange).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For $975 D subscribes to a marketable U.S. obligation which has a face value of $1,000. Thereafter, he surrenders this obligation to the United States in exchange solely for a 10-year marketable $1,000 obligation which at the time of exchange has a fair market value of $930, at which price such obligation is initially offered to the public. At the time of issue of the new obligation there was no intention to call it before maturity. Five years after the exchange D sells the new obligation for $960.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> On the exchange of the old obligation for the new obligation D sustains a loss of $45 ($975 less $930), none of which is recognized pursuant to section 1037(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The basis of the new obligation in D's hands, determined under section 1031(d), is $975 (the same basis as that of the old obligation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> On the sale of the new obligation D sustains a loss of $15 ($975 less $960), all of which is recognized by reason of section 1002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as in example (5), except that five years after the exchange D sells the new obligation for $1,020.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> On the exchange of the old obligation for the new obligation D sustains a loss of $45 ($975 less $930), none of which is recognized pursuant to section 1037(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The basis of the new obligation in D's hands, determined under section 1031(d), is $975 (the same basis as that of the old obligation). The issue price of the new obligation under section 1232(b)(2) is $930.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> On the sale of the new obligation D realizes a gain of $45 ($1,020 less $975), all of which is recognized by reason of section 1002. Of this gain of $45, the amount of $35 is treated as ordinary income and $10 is treated as long-term capital gain, determined as follows:

The issue price of the new obligation is $930 under section 1232(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> On the redemption of the new obligation D realizes a gain of $25 ($1,000 less $975), all of which is recognized by reason of section 1002. Of this gain of $25, the entire amount is treated as ordinary income, determined as follows:

If an obligation, the gain on which is subject to the first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B), because the obligation was originally issued at a discount, is surrendered to the United States in exchange for another obligation and any part of the gain realized on the exchange is not then recognized because of the provisions of section 1037(a) (or because of so much of section 1031(b) as relates to section 1037(a)), the first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B) shall apply to so much of such unrecognized gain as is later recognized upon the disposition or redemption of the obligation which is received in the exchange as though the obligation so disposed of or redeemed were the obligation surrendered, rather than the obligation received, in such exchange. See the first sentence of section 1037(b)(1). Thus, in effect that portion of the gain which is unrecognized on the exchange but is recognized upon the later disposition or redemption of the obligation received from the United States in the exchange shall be considered as ordinary income in an amount which is equal to the gain which, by applying the first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B) upon the earlier surrender of the old obligation to the United States, would have been considered as ordinary income if the gain had been recognized upon such earlier exchange. Any portion of the gain which is recognized under section 1031(b) upon the earlier exchange and is treated at such time as ordinary income shall be deducted from the gain which is treated as ordinary income by applying the first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B) pursuant to this subparagraph upon the disposition or redemption of the obligation which is received in the earlier exchange. This subparagraph shall apply only in a case where on the exchange of United States obligations there was some gain not recognized by reason of section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031(b) as relates to section 1037(a)); it shall not apply where, only loss was unrecognized by reason of section 1037(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Exchanges involving nonrecognition of gain on obligations issued at a discount. If an obligation, the gain on which is subject to the first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B), because the obligation was originally issued at a discount, is surrendered to the United States in exchange for another obligation and any part of the gain realized on the exchange is not then recognized because of the provisions of section 1037(a) (or because of so much of section 1031(b) as relates to section 1037(a)), the first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B) shall apply to so much of such unrecognized gain as is later recognized upon the disposition or redemption of the obligation which is received in the exchange as though the obligation so disposed of or redeemed were the obligation surrendered, rather than the obligation received, in such exchange. See the first sentence of section 1037(b)(1). Thus, in effect that portion of the gain which is unrecognized on the exchange but is recognized upon the later disposition or redemption of the obligation received from the United States in the exchange shall be considered as ordinary income in an amount which is equal to the gain which, by applying the first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B) upon the earlier surrender of the old obligation to the United States, would have been considered as ordinary income if the gain had been recognized upon such earlier exchange. Any portion of the gain which is recognized under section 1031(b) upon the earlier exchange and is treated at such time as ordinary income shall be deducted from the gain which is treated as ordinary income by applying the first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B) pursuant to this subparagraph upon the disposition or redemption of the obligation which is received in the earlier exchange. This subparagraph shall apply only in a case where on the exchange of United States obligations there was some gain not recognized by reason of section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031(b) as relates to section 1037(a)); it shall not apply where, only loss was unrecognized by reason of section 1037(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rules to apply when a nontransferable obligation is surrendered in the exchange. For purposes of applying both section 1232(a)(2)(B) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph to the total gain realized on the obligation which is later disposed of or redeemed, if the obligation surrendered to the United States in the earlier exchange is a nontransferable obligation described in section 454 (a) or (c)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The aggregate amount considered, with respect to the obligation so surrendered in the earlier exchange, as ordinary income shall not exceed the difference between the issue price of the surrendered obligation and the stated redemption price of the surrendered obligation which applied at the time of the earlier exchange, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The issue price of the obligation which is received from the United States in the earlier exchange shall be considered to be the stated redemption price of the surrendered obligation which applied at the time of the earlier exchange, increased by the amount of other consideration (if any) paid to the United States as part of the earlier exchange.

If the obligation received in the earlier exchange is a nontransferable obligation described in section 454(c) and such obligation is partially redeemed before final maturity or partially disposed of by being partially reissued to another owner, the amount determined by applying subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be determined on a basis proportional to the total denomination of obligations redeemed or disposed of. See paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.454-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Long-term capital gain. If, in a case where both subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph are applied, the total gain realized on the redemption or disposition of the obligation which is received from the United States in the exchange to which section 1037(a) (or so

much of section 1031(b) as related to section 1037(a)) applies exceeds the amount of gain which, by applying such subparagraphs, is treated as ordinary income, the gain in excess of such amount shall be treated as long-term capital gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Illustrations. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples, in which it is assumed that the taxpayer uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and has never elected under section 454(a) to include in gross income currently the annual increase in the redemption price of non-interest-bearing obligations issued at a discount. In addition, it is assumed that the old obligations exchanged are capital assets transferred in an exchange in respect of which regulations are promulgated pursuant to section 1037(a):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A purchased a noninterest-bearing nontransferable U.S. bond for $74 which was issued after December 31, 1954, and redeemable in 10 years for $100. Several years later, when the stated redemption value of such bond is $94.50, A surrenders it to the United States in exchange for $1 in cash and a 10-year marketable bond having a face value of $100. On the date of exchange the bond received in the exchange has a fair market value of $96. Less than one month after the exchange, A sells the new bond for $96.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> On the exchange of the old bond for the new bond A realizes a gain of $23, determined as follows:
