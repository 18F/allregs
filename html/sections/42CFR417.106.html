                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Quality assurance program. Each HMO or CMP must have an ongoing quality assurance program for its health services that meets the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Stresses health outcomes to the extent consistent with the state of the art.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provides review by physicians and other health professionals of the process followed in the provision of health services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Uses systematic data collection of performance and patient results, provides interpretation of these data to its practitioners, and institutes needed change.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Includes written procedures for taking appropriate remedial action whenever, as determined under the quality assurance program, inappropriate or substandard services have been provided or services that ought to have been furnished have not been provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Availability and accessibility of health care services. Basic health services and those supplemental health services for which enrollees have contracted must be provided or arranged for by the HMO in accordance with the following rules:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the services must be available to each enrollee within the HMO's service area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception. If the HMO's service area is located wholly within a nonmetropolitan area, the HMO may make available outside its service area any basic health service that is not a primary care or emergency care service, if the number of providers of that basic health service who will provide the service to the HMO's enrollees is insufficient to meet the demand. As used in this paragraph, primary care includes general practice, family practice, general internal medicine, general pediatrics, and general obstetrics and gynecology. An HMO that provides the services covered by these fields through at least a general or family practitioner, or a pediatrician and a general internist, is considered to be providing primary care.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The services must be available and accessible with reasonable promptness to each of the HMO's enrollees as ensured through--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Staffing patterns within generally accepted norms for meeting the projected enrollment needs; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Geographic location, hours of operation, and arrangements for after-hours services. (Medically necessary emergency services must be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Continuity of care. The HMO must ensure continuity or care through arrangements that include but are not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use of a health professional who is primarily responsible for coordinating the enrollee's overall health care.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A system of health and medical records that accumulates pertinent information about the enrollee's health care and makes it available to appropriate professionals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Arrangements made directly or through the HMO's providers to ensure that the HMO or the health professional who coordinates the enrollee's overall health care is kept informed about the services that the referral resources furnish to the enrollee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Confidentiality of health records. Each HMO must establish adequate procedures to ensure the confidentiality of the health and medical records of its enrollees.
