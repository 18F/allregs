                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In determining whether a claimant developed a nonmalignant  respiratory disease following pertinent employment as a miller, the  Assistant Director shall resolve all reasonable   doubt in favor of the claimant. A conclusion that a claimant developed a  nonmalignant respiratory disease must be supported by medical  documentation. In cases where the claimant is deceased, the claimant's  beneficiary may submit any form of medical documentation specified in  paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and for proof of cor pulmonale must  also submit one or more forms of documentation specified in paragraph  (d)(2). A living claimant must at a minimum submit the medical  documentation required in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and for  proof of cor pulmonale must also submit one or more forms of  documentation specified in paragraph (d)(2). In all cases, the Program  will review submitted medical documentation, and will, in addition and  where appropriate, review any pertinent records discovered within the  sources referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. With  respect to a deceased claimant, the Program will treat as equivalent to  a diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis any diagnosis of ``restrictive lung  disease'' made by a physician employed by the Indian Health Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where appropriate, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Program  will search the records of the PHS (including NIOSH), created or  gathered during the course of any health study of uranium workers  conducted or being conducted by these agencies, to determine whether  those records contain proof of the claimant's medical condition. (In  cases where the claimant is deceased, the Program will accept as proof  of medical condition the verification of the PHS or NIOSH that it  possesses medical records or abstracts of medical records of the  claimant that contain a verified diagnosis of a nonmalignant respiratory  disease.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If medical records regarding the claimant were gathered during  the course of any federally supported, health-related study of uranium  workers, and the claimant or eligible surviving beneficiary submits with  the claim an Authorization To Release Medical or Other Information that  authorizes the Program to contact the custodian of the records of the  study to determine if proof of the claimant's medical condition is  contained in the records of the study, the Program will, where  appropriate, request such records from that custodian and will review  records that it obtains from the custodian. (In cases where the claimant  is deceased, the Program will accept as proof of the claimant's medical  condition such medical records or abstracts of medical records  containing a verified diagnosis of a nonmalignant respiratory disease.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A claimant or beneficiary may submit any of the following  forms of medical documentation in support of a claim that the claimant  contracted a nonmalignant respiratory disease, including pulmonary  fibrosis, fibrosis of the lung, cor pulmonale related to fibrosis of the  lung, silicosis, and pneumoconiosis:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Pathology report of tissue biopsy;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Autopsy report;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If an x-ray exists, the x-ray and interpretive reports of the  x-ray by a maximum of two NIOSH certified ``B'' readers classifying the  existence of disease of category 1/0 or higher according to a 1989  report of the International Labor Office (known as the ``ILO''), or  subsequent revisions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If no x-rays exist, an x-ray report;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Physician summary report;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Hospital discharge summary report;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Hospital admitting report;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Death certificate, provided that it is signed by a physician  at the time of death; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Documentation specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (d)(3)(ii)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In order to demonstrate that the claimant developed cor  pulmonale related to fibrosis of the lung, the claimant or beneficiary  must, at a minimum, submit one or more of the following medical records:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Right heart catheterization;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Cardiology summary or consultation report;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Electrocardiogram;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Echocardiogram;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Physician summary report;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Hospital discharge summary report;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Autopsy report;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Report of physical examination; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Death certificate, provided that it is signed by a physician at  the time of death.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding any other documentation provided, a living  claimant must at a minimum provide the following medical documentation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Either:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An arterial blood gas study administered at rest in a sitting  position, or an exercise arterial blood gas test, reflecting values  equal to or less than the values set forth in the tables to appendix B  of this part; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A written diagnosis by a physician in accordance with  Sec. 79.51(s); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> One of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A chest x-ray administered in accordance with standard  techniques accompanied by interpretive reports of the x-ray by a maximum  of two NIOSH certified ``B'' readers, classifying the existence of  disease of category 1/0 or higher according to a 1989 report of the  International Labor Office (known as the ``ILO'') or subsequent  revisions;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> High-resolution computed tomography scans (commonly known as  ``HRCT scans''), including computer-assisted tomography scans (commonly  known as ``CAT scans''), magnetic resonance imaging scans (commonly  known as ``MRI scans''), and positron emission tomography scans  (commonly known as ``PET scans''), and interpretive reports of such  scans;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Pathology reports of tissue biopsies; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Pulmonary function tests indicating restrictive lung function  and consisting of three reproducible time/volume tracings recording the  results of the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and the  forced vital capacity (FVC) administered and reported in accordance with  the Standardization of Spirometry--1994 Update by the American Thoracic  Society, and reflecting values for FEV1 or FVC that are less than or  equal to the lower limit of normal for an individual of the claimant's  age, sex, height, and ethnicity as set forth in the tables in appendix A  to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Assistant Director shall treat any documentation described  in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B) or paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section as  conclusive evidence of the claimant's nonmalignant respiratory disease;  provided, however, that the Program may subject such documentation to a  fair and random audit to guarantee its authenticity and reliability for  purposes of treating it as conclusive evidence; and provided further  that, in order to be treated as conclusive evidence, a written diagnosis  described in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B) must be by a physician who is  employed by the Indian Health Service or the Department of Veterans  Affairs or who is board certified (as described in Sec. 79.51(s)), and  who must have a documented, ongoing physician-patient relationship with  the claimant. Notwithstanding the conclusive effect given to certain  evidence, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as relieving a  living claimant of the obligation to provide the Program with the forms  of documentation required under paragraph (d)(3).</p>
