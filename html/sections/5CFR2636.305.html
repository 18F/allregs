                                Sec. 2636.305  Compensation and other restrictions relating to professions
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicable restrictions. A covered noncareer employee shall not:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Receive compensation for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Practicing a profession which involves a fiduciary relationship;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Affiliating with or being employed to perform professional  duties by a firm, partnership, association, corporation, or other entity  which provides professional services involving a fiduciary relationship;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Permit his name to be used by any firm, partnership,  association, corporation, or other entity which provides professional  services involving a fiduciary relationship.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. A covered noncareer employee of the White House Office  who is an attorney   may not receive compensation for drafting a will for her friend. She  may, however, participate in her bar association's pro bono program by  providing free legal services for the elderly, provided her  participation in the program is otherwise proper. For example, 18 U.S.C.  205 would prohibit her from representing her pro bono client in a  hearing before the Social Security Administration.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. An accountant named C.B. Debit who is offered a covered  noncareer appointment must terminate his partnership in the accounting  firm of Delight, Waterhose and Debit upon appointment. Because his  deceased father, J.R. Debit, was the founding partner for whom the firm  is named, the name Debit need not be deleted from the firm's name.  However, the name C.B. Debit may not appear on the firm's letterhead  after the individual enters on duty as a covered noncareer employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Profession means a calling requiring specalized knowledge and  often long and intensive preparation including instruction in skills and  methods as well as in the scientific, historical or scholarly principles  underlying such skills and methods. It is characteristic of a profession  that those in the profession, through force of organization or concerted  opinion, establish and maintain high standards of achievement and  conduct, and commit its practitioners to continued study of the field.  Consulting and advising with respect to subject matter that is generally  regarded as the province of practitioners of a profession shall be  considered a profession.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Profession which involves a fiduciary relationship means a  profession in which the nature of the services provided causes the  recipient of those services to place a substantial degree of trust and  confidence in the integrity, fidelity and specialized knowledge of the  practitioner. Such professions are not limited to those whose  practitioners are legally defined as fiduciaries and include  practitioners in such areas as law, insurance, medicine, architecture,  financial services and accounting. A covered noncareer employee who is  uncertain whether a particular field of endeavor is a profession which  involves a fiduciary relationship may request an advisory opinion under  Sec. 2636.103.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. In view of the standards of the profession which require  a licensed real estate broker to act in the best interests of his  clients, the selling of real estate by a licensed broker involves the  practice of a profession involving a fiduciary relationship.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. A covered noncareer employee may receive the customary  fee for serving as the executor of his mother's estate, provided he does  not violate the applicable limitation on the amount of outside earned  income he may receive. Although the executor of an estate has fiduciary  obligations, serving as an executor in these circumstances does not  involve the practice of a profession and, therefore, is not prohibited.  He could not, however, serve for compensation as attorney for the  estate.  [56 FR 1723, Jan. 17, 1991, as amended at 58 FR 69176, Dec. 30, 1993]</p>
