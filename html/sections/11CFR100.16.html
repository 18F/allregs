A communication is ``made in  cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or  suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee, or their  agents, or a political party committee or its agents'' if it is a  coordinated communication under 11 CFR 109.21 or a party coordinated  communication under 11 CFR 109.37.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No expenditure by an authorized committee of a candidate on  behalf of that candidate shall qualify as an independent expenditure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No expenditure shall be considered independent if the person  making the expenditure allows a candidate, a candidate's authorized  committee, or their agents, or a political party committee or its agents  to become materially involved in decisions regarding the communication  as described in 11 CFR 109.21(d)(2), or shares financial responsibility  for the costs of production or dissemination with any such person.
