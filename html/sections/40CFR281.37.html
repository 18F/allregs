Financial responsibility requirements for petroleum UST systems must, at a minimum, be scheduled to be applied at all UST systems on an orderly schedule that completes a phase-in of the financial responsibility requirements within the time allowed in the Federal regulations under 40 CFR 280.91.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> States may allow the use of a wide variety of financial assurance mechanisms to meet this requirement. Each financial mechanism must meet the following criteria in order to be no less stringent than the federal requirements. The mechanism must: Be valid and enforceable; be issued by a provider that is qualified or licensed in the state; not permit cancellation without allowing the state to draw funds; ensure that funds will only and directly be used for corrective action and third party liability costs; and require that the provider notify the owner or operator of any circumstances that would impair or suspend coverage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> States must require owners and operators to maintain records that demonstrate compliance with the state financial responsibility requirements, and these records must be made readily available when requested by the implementing agency.
