A cover crop, planted after a first insured crop and planted for the purpose

of haying, grazing or otherwise harvesting in any manner or that is hayed or grazed during the crop year, or that is otherwise harvested is considered to be a second crop. A cover crop that is covered by FSA's noninsured crop disaster assistance program (NAP) or receives other USDA benefits associated with forage crops will be considered as planted for the purpose of haying, grazing or otherwise harvesting. A crop meeting the conditions stated herein will be considered to be a second crop regardless of whether or not it is insured. Notwithstanding the references to haying and grazing as harvesting in these Basic Provisions, for the purpose of determining the end of the insurance period, harvest of the crop will be as defined in the applicable Crop Provisions.</p><p class="depth0">Section.

In this case, each individual would be considered to have a 25 percent interest in you, and both the partnerships and the individuals would have a substantial beneficial interest in you. The spouses of the individuals would not be considered to have a substantial beneficial interest unless the spouse was one of the individuals that made up the partnership. However, if each partnership is made up of six individuals with equal interests, then each would only have an 8.33 percent interest in you and although the partnership would still have a substantial beneficial interest in you, the individuals would not for the purposes of reporting in section 2). The spouse of any individual applicant or individual insured will be presumed to have a substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured unless the spouses can prove they are legally separated or otherwise legally separate under the applicable State dissolution of marriage laws. Any child of an individual applicant or individual insured will not be considered to have a substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured unless the child has a separate legal interest in such person.</p><p class="depth0">Summary of coverage.

elevation, any damage caused by water that exceeded that elevation would be caused by an insurable cause of loss);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Failure or breakdown of the irrigation equipment or facilities, or the inability to prepare the land for irrigation using your established irrigation method (e.g., furrow irrigation), unless the failure, breakdown or inability is due to a cause of loss specified in the Crop Provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You must make all reasonable efforts to restore the equipment or facilities to proper working order within a reasonable amount of time unless we determine it is not practical to do so.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cost will not be considered when determining whether it is practical to restore the equipment or facilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Failure to carry out a good irrigation practice for the insured crop, if applicable; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Any cause of loss that results in damage that is not evident or would not have been evident during the insurance period, including, but not limited to, damage that only becomes evident after the end of the insurance period unless expressly authorized in the Crop Provisions.

Other Insurance</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Other Like Insurance--Nothing in this section prevents you from obtaining other insurance not authorized under the Act.

If you cannot demonstrate that you did not intend to have more than one policy in effect, you may be subject to the consequences authorized under this policy, the Act, or any other applicable statute. If you can demonstrate that you did not intend to have more than one policy in effect (For example, an application to transfer your policy or written notification to an insurance provider that states you want to purchase, or transfer, insurance and you want any other policies for the crop canceled would demonstrate you did not intend to have duplicate policies), and:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> One is an additional coverage policy and the other is a Catastrophic Risk Protection policy:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The additional coverage policy will apply if both policies are with the same insurance provider or, if not, both insurance providers agree; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The policy with the earliest date of application will be in force if both insurance providers do not agree; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Both are additional coverage policies or both are Catastrophic Risk Protection policies, the policy with the earliest date of application will be in force and the other policy will be void, unless both policies are with:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The same insurance provider and the insurance provider agrees otherwise; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Different insurance providers and both insurance providers agree otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Other Insurance Against Fire. If you have other insurance, whether valid or not, against damage to the insured crop by fire during the insurance period, and you have not excluded coverage for fire from this policy, we will be liable for loss due to fire caused by a naturally occurring event only for the smaller of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount of indemnity determined pursuant to this policy without regard to such other insurance; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount by which the loss from fire is determined to exceed the indemnity paid or payable under such other insurance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For the purpose of section 22(b), the amount of loss from fire will be the difference between the total value of the insured crop before the fire and the total value of the insured crop after the fire. This amount will be determined in accordance with the provisions in section 35.</p><p class="depth0">23. Conformity to Food Security Act</p><p class="depth0">Although your violation of a number of federal statutes, including the Act, may cause cancellation, termination, or voidance of your insurance contract, you should be specifically aware that your policy will be canceled if you are determined to be ineligible to receive benefits under the Act due to violation of the controlled substance provisions (title XVII) of the Food Security Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-198) and the regulations promulgated under the Act by USDA. Your insurance policy will be canceled if you are determined, by the appropriate Agency, to be in violation of these provisions. We will recover any and all monies paid to you or received by you during your period of ineligibility, and your premium will be refunded, less an amount for expenses and handling equal to 20 percent of the premium paid or to be paid by you.</p><p class="depth0">For FCIC policies</p><p class="depth0">24.

Amounts Due Us</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Interest will accrue at the rate of 1.25 percent simple interest per calendar month on any unpaid amount owed to us or on any unpaid administrative fees owed to FCIC.

The interest rate will be that established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) and published in the Federal Register semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1 of each year, and may vary with each publication.</p><p class="depth0">27.

For example, if sections are the basis for optional units where the insured acreage is located and you have 80 planted acres in section one, 10 planted acres in section two, and 10 planted acres in section three, you may aggregate sections two and three to meet this requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The crop must be insured under revenue protection or yield protection, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If you want to change your unit structure from enterprise units to basic or optional units in any subsequent crop year, you must maintain separate records of acreage and production:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For each basic unit, to be eligible to use records to establish the production guarantee for the basic unit; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For optional units, to qualify for optional units and to be eligible to use such records to establish the production guarantee for the optional units;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If you do not comply with the production reporting provisions in section 3(f) for the enterprise unit, your yield for the enterprise unit will be determined in accordance with section 3(f)(1);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> You must separately designate on the acreage report each section or other basis in section 34(a)(4)(i) you used to qualify for an enterprise unit; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> If we discover you do not qualify for an enterprise unit and such discovery is made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> On or before the acreage reporting date, your unit division will be based on the basic or optional units, whichever you report on your acreage report and qualify for; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> At any time after the acreage reporting date, we will assign the basic unit structure; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> If allowed by the actuarial documents, you may elect separate enterprise units for irrigated and non-irrigated practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> You may elect one enterprise unit for all irrigated practices and one enterprise unit for all non-irrigated practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> You must separately meet the requirements in section 34(a)(4) for each enterprise unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If we discover you do not qualify for an enterprise unit for the irrigated and non-irrigated practices and such discovery is made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> On or before the acreage reporting date, you may elect to insure all acreage of the crop in the county in one enterprise unit provided you meet the requirements in section 34(a)(4), or your unit division will be based on basic or optional units, whichever you report on your acreage report and qualify for; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> At any time after the acreage reporting date, your unit structure will be one enterprise unit provided you meet the requirements in section 34(a)(4). Otherwise, we will assign the basic unit structure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For a whole-farm unit:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To qualify:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All crops in the whole-farm unit must be insured:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Under revenue protection (if you elected the harvest price exclusion for any crop, you must elect it for all crops in the whole-farm unit), unless the Special Provisions allow whole-farm units for another plan of insurance and you insure all crops in the whole-farm unit under such plan (e.g., if you plant corn and soybeans for which you have elected revenue protection and you plant canola for which you have elected yield protection, the corn, soybeans and canola would

be assigned the unit structure in accordance with section 34(a)(5)(v));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> With us (e.g., if you insure your corn and canola with us and your soybeans with a different insurance provider, the corn, soybeans and canola would be assigned the unit structure in accordance with section 34(a)(5)(v)); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> At the same coverage level (e.g., if you elect to insure your corn and canola at the 65 percent coverage level and your soybeans at the 75 percent coverage level, the corn, soybeans and canola would be assigned the unit structure in accordance with section 34(a)(5)(v));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A whole-farm unit must contain all of the insurable acreage of at least two crops; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> At least two of the insured crops must each have planted acreage that constitutes 10 percent or more of the total planted acreage liability of all insured crops in the whole-farm unit (For crops for which revenue protection is available, liability will be based on the applicable projected price only for the purpose of section 34(a)(5)(i)(C));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> You will be required to pay separate administrative fees for each crop included in the whole-farm unit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> You must separately designate on the acreage report each basic unit for each crop in the whole-farm unit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If you want to change your unit structure from a whole-farm unit to basic or optional units in any subsequent crop year, you must maintain separate records of acreage and production:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For each basic unit, to be eligible to use such records to establish the production guarantee for the basic units; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For optional units, to qualify for optional units and to be eligible to use such records to establish the production guarantee for the optional units; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If we discover you do not qualify for a whole-farm unit for at least one insured crop because, even though you elected revenue protection for all your crops:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> You do not meet all of the other requirements in section 34(a)(5)(i), and such discovery is made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> On or before the acreage reporting date, your unit division for all crops for which you elected a whole-farm unit will be based on basic or optional units, whichever you report on your acreage report and qualify for; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> At any time after the acreage reporting date, we will assign the basic unit structure for all crops for which you elected a whole-farm unit; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> It was not possible to establish a projected price for at least one of your crops, your unit division will be based on the unit structure you report on your acreage report and qualify for only for the crop for which a projected price could not be established, unless the remaining crops in the unit would no longer qualify for a whole-farm unit, in such case your unit division for the remaining crops will be based on the unit structure you report on your acreage report and qualify for.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Unless limited by the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions, a basic unit as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions may be divided into optional units if, for each optional unit, you meet the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You must plant the crop in a manner that results in a clear and discernible break in the planting pattern at the boundaries of each optional unit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All optional units you select for the crop year are identified on the acreage report for that crop year (Units will be determined when the acreage is reported but may be adjusted or combined to reflect the actual unit structure when adjusting a loss. No further unit division may be made after the acreage reporting date for any reason);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> You have records, that are acceptable to us, for at least the previous crop year for all optional units that you will report in the current crop year (You may be required to produce the records for all optional units for the previous crop year); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> You have records of marketed or stored production from each optional unit maintained in such a manner that permits us to verify the production from each optional unit, or the production from each optional unit is kept separate until loss adjustment is completed by us.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Each optional unit must meet one or more of the following, unless otherwise specified in the Crop Provisions or allowed by written agreement:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Optional units may be established if each optional unit is located in a separate section where the boundaries are readily discernible:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the absence of sections, we may consider parcels of land legally identified by other methods of measure, such as Spanish grants, provided the boundaries are readily discernible, if such parcels can be considered as the equivalent of sections for unit purposes in accordance with FCIC issued procedures; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the absence of sections as described in section 34(c)(1) or other methods of measure used to establish section equivalents as described in section 34(c)(1)(i), optional units may be established if each optional unit is located in a separate FSA farm serial number in accordance with FCIC issued procedure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In addition to, or instead of, establishing optional units by section, section equivalent or FSA farm serial number, optional units may be based on irrigated and non-irrigated acreage. To qualify as separate irrigated and non-irrigated optional units, the non-irrigated acreage may not continue into the irrigated acreage in the same rows

or planting pattern. The irrigated acreage may not extend beyond the point at which the irrigation system can deliver the quantity of water needed to produce the yield on which the guarantee is based, except the corners of a field in which a center-pivot irrigation system is used may be considered as irrigated acreage if the corners of a field in which a center-pivot irrigation system is used do not qualify as a separate non-irrigated optional unit. In this case, production from both practices will be used to determine your approved yield; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In addition to, or instead of, establishing optional units by section, section equivalent or FSA farm serial number, or irrigated and non-irrigated acreage, separate optional units may be established for acreage of the insured crop grown and insured under an organic farming practice. Certified organic, transitional and buffer zone acreages do not individually qualify as separate units. (See section 37 for additional provisions regarding acreage insured under an organic farming practice).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Optional units are not available for crops insured under a Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> If you do not comply fully with the provisions in this section, we will combine all optional units that are not in compliance with these provisions into the basic unit from which they were formed. We will combine the optional units at any time we discover that you have failed to comply with these provisions. If failure to comply with these provisions is determined by us to be inadvertent, and the optional units are combined into a basic unit, that portion of the additional premium paid for the optional units that have been combined will be refunded to you for the units combined.</p><p class="depth0">35. Multiple Benefits</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If you are eligible to receive an indemnity and are also eligible to receive benefits for the same loss under any other USDA program, you may receive benefits under both programs, unless specifically limited by the crop insurance contract or by law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any amount received for the same loss from any USDA program, in addition to the crop insurance payment, will not exceed the difference between the crop insurance payment and the actual amount of the loss, unless otherwise provided by law. The amount of the actual loss is the difference between the total value of the insured crop before the loss and the total value of the insured crop after the loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For crops for which revenue protection is not available:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If you have an approved yield, the total value of the crop before the loss is your approved yield times the highest price election for the crop; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If you have an approved yield, the total value of the crop after the loss is your production to count times the highest price election for the crop; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If you have an amount of insurance, the total value of the crop before the loss is the highest amount of insurance available for the crop; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If you have an amount of insurance, the total value of the crop after the loss is your production to count times the price contained in the Crop Provisions for valuing production to count.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For crops for which revenue protection is available and:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> You elect yield protection:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The total value of the crop before the loss is your approved yield times the applicable projected price (at the 100 percent price level) for the crop; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The total value of the crop after the loss is your production to count times the applicable projected price (at the 100 percent price level) for the crop; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> You elect revenue protection:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The total value of the crop before the loss is your approved yield times the higher of the applicable projected price or harvest price for the crop (If you have elected the harvest price exclusion, the applicable projected price for the crop will be used); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The total value of the crop after the loss is your production to count times the harvest price for the crop.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> FSA or another USDA agency, as applicable, will determine and pay the additional amount due you for any applicable USDA program, after first considering the amount of any crop insurance indemnity.</p><p class="depth0">36. Substitution of Yields.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> When you have actual yields in your production history database that, due to an insurable cause of loss, are less than 60 percent of the applicable transitional yield you may elect, on an individual actual yield basis, to exclude and replace one or more of any such yields within each database.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Each election made in section 36(a) must be made on or before the production reporting date for the insured crop and each such election will remain in effect for succeeding years unless canceled by the production reporting date for the succeeding crop year. If you cancel an election, the actual yield will be used in the database. For example, if you elected to substitute yields in your database for the 1998 and 2000 crop year, for any subsequent crop year, you can elect to cancel the substitution for either or both years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Each excluded actual yield will be replaced with a yield equal to 60 percent of the applicable transitional yield for the crop year in which the yield is being replaced, unless you qualify as a beginning farmer or rancher in which case the excluded actual

yield will be replaced with a yield equal to 80 percent of the applicable transitional yield for the crop year in which the yield is being replaced. (For example, if you elect to exclude a 2001 crop year actual yield, the transitional yield in effect for the 2001 crop year in the county will be used. If you also elect to exclude a 2002 crop year actual yield, the transitional yield in effect for the 2002 crop year in the county will be used). The replacement yields will be used in the same manner as actual yields for the purpose of calculating the approved yield.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Once you have elected to exclude an actual yield from the database, the replacement yield will remain in effect until such time as that crop year is no longer included in the database unless this election is canceled in accordance with section 36(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Although your approved yield will be used to determine your amount of premium owed, the premium rate will be increased to cover the additional risk associated with the substitution of higher yields.</p><p class="depth0">37. Organic Farming Practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with section 8(b)(2), insurance will not be provided for any crop grown using an organic farming practice, unless the information needed to determine a premium rate for an organic farming practice is specified on the actuarial table, or insurance is allowed by a written agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If insurance is provided for an organic farming practice as specified in section 37(a), only the following acreage will be insured under such practice:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Certified organic acreage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transitional acreage being converted to certified organic acreage in accordance with an organic plan; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Buffer zone acreage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> On the date you report your acreage, you must have:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For certified organic acreage, a written certification in effect from a certifying agent indicating the name of the entity certified, effective date of certification, certificate number, types of commodities certified, and name and address of the certifying agent (A certificate issued to a tenant may be used to qualify a landlord or other similar arrangement);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For transitional acreage, a certificate as described in section 37(c)(1), or written documentation from a certifying agent indicating an organic plan is in effect for the acreage; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Records from the certifying agent showing the specific location of each field of certified organic, transitional, buffer zone, and acreage not maintained under organic management.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If you claim a loss on any acreage insured under an organic farming practice, you must provide us with copies of the records required in section 37(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> If any acreage qualifies as certified organic or transitional acreage on the date you report such acreage, and such certification is subsequently revoked by the certifying agent, or the certifying agent no longer considers the acreage as transitional acreage for the remainder of the crop year, that acreage will remain insured under the reported practice for which it qualified at the time the acreage was reported. Any loss due to failure to comply with organic standards will be considered an uninsured cause of loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Contamination by application or drift of prohibited substances onto land on which crops are grown using organic farming practices will not be an insured peril on any certified organic, transitional or buffer zone acreage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> In addition to the provisions contained in section 17(f), prevented planting coverage will not be provided for any acreage based on an organic farming practice in excess of the number of acres that will be grown under an organic farming practice and shown as such in the records required in section 37(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> In lieu of the provisions contained in section 17(f)(1) that specify prevented planting acreage within a field that contains planted acreage will be considered to be acreage of the same practice that is planted in the field, prevented planting acreage will be considered as organic practice acreage if it is identified as certified organic, transitional, or buffer zone acreage in the organic plan.
