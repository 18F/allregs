                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A locomotive's air brake system shall receive the calibration, maintenance, and testing as prescribed in this section. The level of maintenance and testing and the intervals for receiving such maintenance and testing of locomotives with various types of air brake systems shall be conducted in accordance with paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section. Records of the maintenance and testing required in this section shall be maintained in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except for DMU or MU locomotives covered under Sec. 238.309 of this chapter, the air flow method (AFM) indicator shall be calibrated in accordance with Sec. 232.205(c)(1)(iii) at intervals not to exceed 92 days, and records shall be maintained as prescribed paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except for DMU or MU locomotives covered under Sec. 238.309 of this chapter, the extent of air brake system maintenance and testing that is required on a locomotive shall be in accordance with the following levels:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Level one: Locomotives shall have the filtering devices or dirt collectors located in the main reservoir supply line to the air brake system cleaned, repaired, or replaced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Level two: Locomotives shall have the following components cleaned, repaired, and tested: brake cylinder relay valve portions; main reservoir safety valves; brake pipe vent valve portions; and, feed and reducing valve portions in the air brake system (including related dirt collectors and filters).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Level three: Locomotives shall have the components identified in this paragraph removed from the locomotive and disassembled, cleaned and lubricated (if necessary), and tested. In addition, all parts of such components that can deteriorate within the inspection interval as defined in paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section shall be replaced and tested. The components include: all pneumatic components of the locomotive equipment's brake system that contain moving parts, and are sealed against air leaks; all valves and valve portions; electric-pneumatic master controllers in the air brake system; and all air brake related filters and dirt collectors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except for MU locomotives covered under Sec. 238.309 of this chapter, all locomotives shall receive level one air brake maintenance and testing as described in this section at intervals that do not exceed 368 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Locomotives equipped with an air brake system not specifically identified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section shall receive level two air brake maintenance and testing as described in this section at intervals that

do not exceed 368 days and level three air brake maintenance and testing at intervals that do not exceed 736 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Level two and level three air brake maintenance and testing shall be performed on each locomotive identified in this paragraph at the following intervals:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At intervals that do not exceed 1,104 days for a locomotive equipped with a 26-L or equivalent brake system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At intervals that do not exceed 1,472 days for locomotives equipped with an air dryer and a 26-L or equivalent brake system and for locomotives not equipped with an air compressor and that are semi-permanently coupled and dedicated to locomotives with an air dryer; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At intervals that do not exceed 1,840 days for locomotives equipped with CCB-1, CCB-2, CCB-26, EPIC 1 (formerly EPIC 3102), EPIC 3102D2, EPIC 2, KB-HS1, or Fastbrake brake systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Records of the air brake system maintenance and testing required by this section shall be generated and maintained in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The date of AFM indicator calibration shall be recorded and certified on Form F6180-49A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date and place of the cleaning, repairing and testing required by this section shall be recorded on Form FRA F 6180-49A, and the work shall be certified. A record of the parts of the air brake system that are cleaned, repaired, and tested shall be kept in the railroad's files or in the cab of the locomotive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At its option, a railroad may fragment the work required by this section. In that event, a separate record shall be maintained under a transparent cover in the cab. The air record shall include: the locomotive number; a list of the air brake components; and the date and place of the inspection and testing of each component. The signature of the person performing the work and the signature of that person's supervisor shall be included for each component. A duplicate record shall be maintained in the railroad's files.
