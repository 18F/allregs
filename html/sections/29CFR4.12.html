Section 5(a) further states that ``no contract of the United States shall be awarded * * * to any firm, corporation, partnership, or association in which such persons or firms have a substantial interest * * * .''

Such a request shall be submitted in writing to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The request shall include a statement setting forth in detail why the petitioner believes that a person or firm whose name appears on the debarred bidders list has a substantial interest in any firm, corporation, partnership, or association which is seeking or has been awarded a contract of the United States or the District of Columbia. No particular form is prescribed for the submission of a request under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> The Administrator, on his/her own motion or after receipt of a request for a determination, may make a finding on the issue of substantial interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Administrator, on his/her own motion or after receipt of a request for a determination, may make a finding on the issue of substantial interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Administrator determines that there may be a substantial interest, but finds that there is insufficient evidence to render a final ruling thereon, the Administrator may refer the issue to the Chief Administrative Law Judge in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Administrator finds that no substantial interest exists, or that there is not sufficient information to warrant the initiation of an investigation, the requesting party, if any, will be so notified and no further action taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em> If the Administrator finds that a substantial interest exists, the person or firm affected will be notified of the Administrator's finding, which shall include the reasons therefor, and such person or firm shall be afforded an opportunity to request that a hearing be held to render a decision on the issue of substantial interest.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the Administrator finds that a substantial interest exists, the person or firm affected will be notified of the Administrator's finding, which shall include the reasons therefor, and such person or firm shall be afforded an opportunity to request that a hearing be held to render a decision on the issue of substantial interest.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Such person or firm shall have 20 days from the date of the Administrator's ruling to request a hearing.

If a hearing is requested, the decision of the Administrator shall be inoperative unless and until the Administrative Law Judge or the Administrative Review Board issues an order that there is a substantial interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Referral to the Chief Administrative Law Judge. The Administrator on his/her own motion, or upon a request for a hearing where the Administrator determines that relevant facts are in dispute, shall by order refer the issue to the Chief Administrative Law Judge, for designation of an Administrative Law Judge who shall conduct such hearings as may be necessary to render a decision solely on the issue of substantial interest. As provided in section 4(a) of the Act, the provisions of sections 4 and 5 of the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act (41 U.S.C. 38, 39) shall be applicable to such proceedings, which shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth at 29 CFR part 6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Referral to the Administrative Review Board.
