The decisional authority may disallow, for a good cause, all or part of a withdrawal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The withdrawal of any pleading is effective at the end of 15 days from the date of filing of a notice of withdrawal, if no motion in opposition to the notice of withdrawal is filed within that period and the decisional authority does not issue an order disallowing the withdrawal within that period. The decisional authority may disallow, for a good cause, all or part of a withdrawal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a motion in opposition to a notice of withdrawal is filed within the 15 day period, the withdrawal is not effective until the decisional authority issues an order accepting the withdrawal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conditional withdrawal.
