                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Commission will designate the official reporter for all hearings. The official transcript of testimony taken, together with any exhibits and any briefs or memoranda of law filed therewith, shall be filed with the Commission. Transcripts of testimony will be available in any proceeding under the rules in this part, and will be supplied by the official reporter to the

parties and to the public, except when required for good cause to be held confidential, at rates not to exceed the maximum rates fixed by contract between the Commission and the reporter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> Section 11 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act provides that, except where prohibited by contractual agreements entered into prior to the effective date of this Act, agencies and advisory committees shall make available to any person, at actual cost of duplication, copies of transcripts of agency proceedings or advisory committee meetings. As used in this section, ``agency proceeding'' means any proceeding as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(12).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 11 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act provides that, except where prohibited by contractual agreements entered into prior to the effective date of this Act, agencies and advisory committees shall make available to any person, at actual cost of duplication, copies of transcripts of agency proceedings or advisory committee meetings. As used in this section, ``agency proceeding'' means any proceeding as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(12).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Office of Management and Budget has interpreted this provision as being applicable to proceedings before the Commission and its administrative law judges. (Guidelines, 38 FR 12851, May 16, 1973.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commission interprets section 11 and the OMB guidelines as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Future contracts between the Commission and the successfully bidding recording firm will provide that any party to a Commission proceeding or other interested person (hereinafter included within the meaning of ``party'') shall be able to obtain a copy of the transcript of the proceeding in which it is involved at the actual cost of duplication of the original transcript, which includes a reasonable amount for overhead and profit, except where it requests delivery of copies in a shorter period of time than is required for delivery by the Commission.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Commission will bear the full expense of transcribing all of its administrative proceedings where it requests regular delivery service (as set forth in the Contract). In cases where the Commission requests daily delivery of transcript copies (as set forth in the Contract), any party may receive daily delivery service at the actual cost of duplication.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)(A)</em> Where the Commission does not request daily copy service, any party requesting such service must bear the incremental cost of transcription above the regular copy transcription cost borne by the Commission, in addition to the actual cost of duplication, except that where the party applies for and properly shows that the furnishing of daily copy is indispensable to the protection of a vital right or interest in achieving a fair hearing, the presiding officer in the proceeding in which the application is made shall order that daily copy service be provided the applying party at the actual cost of duplication, with the full cost of transcription being borne by the Commission.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Where the Commission does not request daily copy service, any party requesting such service must bear the incremental cost of transcription above the regular copy transcription cost borne by the Commission, in addition to the actual cost of duplication, except that where the party applies for and properly shows that the furnishing of daily copy is indispensable to the protection of a vital right or interest in achieving a fair hearing, the presiding officer in the proceeding in which the application is made shall order that daily copy service be provided the applying party at the actual cost of duplication, with the full cost of transcription being borne by the Commission.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In the event a request for daily copy is denied by the presiding officer, the requesting party, in order to obtain daily copy, must pay the cost of transcription over and above that borne by the Commission, i.e., the incremental cost between that paid by the Commission when it requests regular copy and when it requests daily copy.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The decision of the presiding officer in this situation is interpreted as falling within the scope of the functions and powers of the presiding officer, as defined in Sec. 502.147(a).
