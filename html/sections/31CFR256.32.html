                                Sec. 256.32  What documentation must be submitted to the Judgment 31 U.S.C. 1304(b) in a case where the government has taken an appeal?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">31 U.S.C. 1304(b) specifies that a ``transcript of the judgment'' must be filed with the Secretary of the Treasury. This means that a copy of the judgment must be filed with the Judgment Fund Branch for interest to accrue on a judgment of a federal district court, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or the United States Court of Federal Claims. By practice, the successful plaintiff files a copy of the judgment. Whoever submits the judgment should include a cover letter explaining that it is being submitted to preserve interest rights under 31 U.S.C. 1304. A copy of the judgment and cover letter must be sent to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Judgment Fund Branch, at the address indicated on the Judgment Fund Web site at http://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/judgefund.</p>
