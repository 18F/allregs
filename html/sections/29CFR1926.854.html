All walls shall be left in a stable condition at the end of each shift.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Employees shall not be permitted to work on the top of a wall when weather conditions constitute a hazard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Structural or load-supporting members on any floor shall not be cut or removed until all stories above such a floor have been demolished and removed. This provision shall not prohibit the cutting of floor beams for the disposal of materials or for the installation of equipment, provided that the requirements of Sec. Sec. 1926.853 and 1926.855 are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Floor openings within 10 feet of any wall being demolished shall be planked solid, except when employees are kept out of the area below.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In buildings of ``skeleton-steel'' construction, the steel framing may be left in place during the demolition of masonry. Where this is done, all steel beams, girders, and similar structural supports shall be cleared of all loose material as the masonry demolition progresses downward.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Walkways or ladders shall be provided to enable employees to safely reach or leave any scaffold or wall.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Walls, which serve as retaining walls to support earth or adjoining structures, shall not be demolished until such earth has been properly braced or adjoining structures have been properly underpinned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Walls, which are to serve as retaining walls against which debris will be piled, shall not be so used unless capable of safely supporting the imposed load.</p>
