                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Department of State has no funds from which expenses  attendant upon an accident to United States aircraft can be paid. In  emergencies involving scheduled carriers and in the absence of airline  representatives, or other authority, the Foreign Service post should  request a deposit from the airline (through the Department if desired)  with specific authorization to incur whatever financial obligations the  airline is willing to assume for the hiring of guards (in case local  police protection is considered inadequate), the provision of  accommodations, medical care, and onward transportation for survivors  and for other expenses resulting from the accident. In accidents  involving a private plane or non-scheduled carrier, the Foreign Service  post is not in a position to expend any funds without prior  authorization from the Department. In such cases, and in extreme cases  involving scheduled carriers, when airline and investigation personnel  may be delayed in reaching the scene, the Foreign Service  representative, as the representative of all segments of the United  States Government in the area, should endeavor to protect and promote  the interests of the Government, the airline, and the individual citizen  by any means available to him that are consistent with these  regulations, and should request funds and instructions as required from  the Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The local Foreign Service post is not authorized to expend any  funds for guarding the wreckage to preserve evidence as to the cause of  the accident unless the Civil Aeronautics Board or the Civil Aeronautics  Administration authorizes in advance the expenditure of such funds on a  reimbursable basis. In the absence of such advance authorization, the  Foreign Service post can arrange only for such protection as local  authorities are willing to furnish gratuitously.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Voluntary services and personal services in excess of those  authorized by law may be accepted and utilized in the case of an  aircraft accident since the law which normally prohibits such acceptance  (31 U.S.C. 665) does not   apply ``in case of sudden emergency involving the loss of human life or  the destruction of property''.</p>
