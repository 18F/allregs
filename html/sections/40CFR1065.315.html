                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Calibrate instruments for measuring pressure, temperature, and dewpoint upon initial installation. Follow the instrument manufacturer's instructions and use good engineering judgment to repeat the calibration, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pressure. We recommend temperature-compensated, digital-pneumatic, or deadweight pressure calibrators, with data-logging capabilities to minimize transcription errors. We recommend using calibration reference quantities that are NIST-traceable within 0.5% uncertainty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Temperature. We recommend digital dry-block or stirred-liquid temperature calibrators, with data logging capabilities to minimize transcription errors. We recommend using calibration reference quantities that are

NIST-traceable within 0.5% uncertainty. You may perform linearity verification for temperature measurement systems with thermocouples, RTDs, and thermistors by removing the sensor from the system and using a simulator in its place. Use a NIST-traceable simulator that is independently calibrated and, as appropriate, cold-junction compensated. The simulator uncertainty scaled to absolute temperature must be less than 0.5% of Tmax. If you use this option, you must use sensors that the supplier states are accurate to better than 0.5% of Tmax compared with their standard calibration curve.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dewpoint. We recommend a minimum of three different temperature-equilibrated and temperature-monitored calibration salt solutions in containers that seal completely around the dewpoint sensor. We recommend using calibration reference quantities that are NIST-traceable within 0.5% uncertainty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You may remove system components for off-site calibration. We recommend specifying calibration reference quantities that are NIST-traceable within 0.5% uncertainty.
