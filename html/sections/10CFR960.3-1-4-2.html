                            <p class="depth0">The evidence required to support the nomination of a site as  suitable for characterization shall include the types of information  specified in appendix IV of this part and shall be contained or  referenced in the environmental assessments to be prepared in accordance  with the requirements of the Act. The source of this information shall  include the literature and related studies in the public domain and the  private sector, when available, and various meteorological,  environmental, socioeconomic, and transportation studies conducted by  the DOE in the affected area; exploratory boreholes in the region of  such site, including lithologic logging and hydrologic and geophysical  testing of such boreholes, laboratory testing of core samples for the  evaluation of geochemical and engineering rock properties, and chemical  analyses of water samples from such boreholes; surface investigations,  including geologic mapping and geophysical surveys, and compilations of  satellite imagery data; in situ or laboratory testing of similar rock  types under expected repository conditions; evaluations of natural and  man-made analogs of the repository and its subsystems, such as  geothermally active areas, underground excavations, and case histories  of socioeconomic cycles in areas that have experienced intermittent  large-scale construction and industrial activities; and extrapolations  of regional data to estimate site-specific characteristics and  conditions. The exact types and amounts of information to be collected  within the above categories, including such details as the specific  types of hydrologic tests, combinations of geophysical tests, or number  of exploratory boreholes, are dependent on the site-specific needs for  the application of the guidelines of subparts C and D, in accordance  with the provisions of this subpart and the application requirements set  forth in appendix III of this part. The evidence shall also include  those technical evaluations that use the information specified above and  that provide additional bases for evaluating the ability of a site to  meet the qualifying conditions of the guidelines of subparts C and D. In  developing the above-mentioned bases for evaluation, as may be  necessary, assumptions that approximate the characteristics or  conditions considered to exist at a site, or expected to exist or occur  in the future, may be used. These assumptions will be realistic but  conservative enough to underestimate the potential for a site to meet  the qualifying condition of a guideline; that is, the use of such  assumptions should not lead to an   exaggeration of the ability of a site to meet the qualifying condition.</p>
