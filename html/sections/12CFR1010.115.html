                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General topography. What is the general topography and the major physical characteristics of the land in the subdivision? State the percentage of the subdivision which is to remain as natural open space and as developed parkland. Are there any steep slopes, rock outcroppings, unstable or expansive soil conditions, etc., which will necessitate the use of special construction techniques to build on, or use, any lot in the subdivision? If so, identify the lots affected, and describe the techniques recommended. If any lots in the subdivision have a slope of 20%, or more, include a warning that ``Some lots in this subdivision have a slope of 20%, or more. This may affect the type and cost of construction.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Water coverage. Are any lots, or portions of any lots, covered by water at any time? What lots are affected? When are they covered by water? How does this affect their use for the purpose for which they are sold? Can the condition be corrected? At what cost to the purchaser?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Drainage and fill. Identify the lots which require draining or fill prior to being used for the purpose for which they are being sold. Who will be responsible for any corrective action? If the purchaser is responsible, what are the estimated costs?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Flood plain. Is the subdivision located within a flood plain or an area designated by any Federal, state or local agency as being flood prone? What lots are affected? Is flood insurance available? Is it required in connection with the financing of any improvements to the lot? What is the estimated cost of the flood insurance?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Flooding and soil erosion. (1) Does the developer have a program which provides, or will provide, at least minimum controls for soil erosion, sedimentation or periodic flooding throughout the subdivision?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Does the developer have a program which provides, or will provide, at least minimum controls for soil erosion, sedimentation or periodic flooding throughout the subdivision?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If there is a program, describe it. Include in the description information as to whether the program has been approved by the appropriate government officials; when it is to start; when it is to be completed (month and year); whether the developer is obligated to comply with the program and whether there is any financial assurance of completion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If there is no program or if the program has not been approved by the appropriate officials or if the program does not provide minimum protection, include a statement to the effect that the measures being taken may not be sufficient to prevent property damage or health and safety hazards. A minimum program will usually provide for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Temporary measures such as mulching and seeding of exposed areas and silt basins to trap sediments in runoff water, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Permanent measures such as sodding and seeding in areas of heavy grading or cut and fill along with the construction of diversion channels, ditches, outlet channels, waterway stabilizers and sediment control basins.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Nuisances. Are there any land uses which may adversely affect the subdivision (e.g., unusual or unpleasant noises or odors, pollutants or nuisances such as existing or proposed industrial activity, military installations, airports, railroads, truck terminals, race tracks, animal pens, noxious smoke, chemical fumes, stagnant ponds, marshes, slaughterhouses and sewage treatment facilities)? If any nuisances exist, describe them. If there are none, state there are no nuisances which affect the subdivision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Hazards. (1) Are there any unusual safety factors which affect the subdivision (e.g., dilapidated buildings, abandoned mines or wells, air or vehicular traffic hazards, danger from fire or explosion or radiation hazards)? Is the developer aware of any proposed plans for construction which may create a nuisance or safety hazard or adversely affect the subdivision? If there are any

existing hazards or if there is any proposed construction which will create a nuisance or hazard, describe the hazard or nuisance. If there are no existing or possible future hazards, state that there are none.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Are there any unusual safety factors which affect the subdivision (e.g., dilapidated buildings, abandoned mines or wells, air or vehicular traffic hazards, danger from fire or explosion or radiation hazards)? Is the developer aware of any proposed plans for construction which may create a nuisance or safety hazard or adversely affect the subdivision? If there are any

existing hazards or if there is any proposed construction which will create a nuisance or hazard, describe the hazard or nuisance. If there are no existing or possible future hazards, state that there are none.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is the area subject to natural hazards or has it been formally identified by any Federal, state or local agency as an area subject to the frequent occurrence of natural hazards (e.g., tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, mudslides, forest fires, brush fires, avalanches, flash flooding)? If the jurisdiction in which the subdivision is located has a rating system for fire hazard, state the rating assigned to the land in the subdivision and explain its meaning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Climate. What are the average temperature ranges, summer and winter, for the area in which the subdivision is located (i.e., high, low and mean)? What is the average annual rainfall and snowfall?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Occupancy. How many homes are occupied on a full- or part-time basis as of (date of submission)?</p>
