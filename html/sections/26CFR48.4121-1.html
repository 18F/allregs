                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Imposition of tax--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 4121(a) imposes a tax  on coal mined at any time in this country if the coal is sold or used by  the producer after March 31, 1978 (see section 4218 and the regulations  under that section for rules relating to the use of coal being treated  as a sale of coal). For purposes of this section, the term ``producer''  means the person in whom is vested ownership of the coal under state law  immediately after the coal is severed from the ground, without regard to  the existence of any contractual arrangement for the sale or other  disposition of the coal or the payment of any royalties between the  producer   and third parties. The term includes any person who extracts coal from  coal waste refuse piles or from the silt waste product which results  from the wet washing (or similarly processing) of coal. However, the  excise tax does not apply to a producer who sells the silt waste product  without extracting the coal from it, or to the producer who uses the  silt waste product without extracting the coal from it. Furthermore, the  excise tax does not apply to the sale or use of the silt waste product  after any coal has been extracted from it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example (1). A, a limited partnership, is the owner of land on which  a coal mine is located. A contracts with XYZ Company to extract the coal  for a set price per ton. XYZ Company is an independent contractor and  has no ownership interest in the coal mined. Under state law, A is the  owner of the coal immediately after severance. After XYZ extracts the  coal from the mine, A sells the coal. A is the producer of the coal and  is responsible for the payment of the excise tax.</p><p class="depth3">Example (2). A, a limited partnership, is the owner of land on which  a coal mine is located. A leases the land to XYZ Company, and XYZ  Company extracts coal from the mine and sells it. Under state law, XYZ  is the owner of the coal immediately after the coal is severed from the  ground. XYZ Company is the producer and must pay the excise tax. This is  true even though the lease agreement requires XYZ to pay a royalty to A.</p><p class="depth3">Example (3). XYZ Company purchases a coal waste refuse pile from B  and extracts the coal from the waste refuse pile and sells the coal. XYZ  is the producer and must pay the excise tax.</p><p class="depth3">Example (4). XYZ Company is a producer of coal and operates its own  cleaning plant. After wet washing the coal, it sells the coal and the  silt waste product. The sale of the coal is subject to the excise tax  whereas the sale of the silt is not.</p><p class="depth3">Example (5). Assume the same facts as in example (4) except that  before selling the silt waste product XYZ Company extracts a small  quantity of finely sized coal from the silt waste product and then sells  both the finely sized coal and the silt waste product. The sale of the  finely sized coal is subject to the excise tax whereas the sale of the  silt is not.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rate of tax--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Underground mines; surface mines. The rate of  tax imposed on coal from underground mines located in the United States  is the lower of 50 cents per ton (2,000 pounds), or 2 percent of the  sale price. The rate of tax imposed on coal from surface mines located  in the United States is the lower of 25 cents per ton (2,000 pounds) or  2 percent of the sale price. If a sale or use includes a portion of a  ton, the tax is applied proportionately. Thus, if 1,200 pounds of coal  from an underground mine are sold for $35.00, the tax is 30 cents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Combination. If a single mine yields coal from both surface and  underground mining, the producer must determine the rate (50 cents or 25  cents per ton) for each ton of coal mined: It is presumed that coal is  mined from underground mines (50 cents per ton) unless the producer  keeps sufficient records to establish to the satisfaction of the  Secretary that the coal was mined from a surface mine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exemptions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Lignite or imported coal. The excise tax of coal  does not apply to lignite or imported coal. Lignite is defined in  accordance with the standard specification for classification of coals  by rank of the American Society for Testing and Materials (Annual Book  of ASTM Standards Part 26, D 388). The procedures specified in D 388  must be followed. If a producer extracts both taxable coal and lignite,  then the producer must maintain adequate records to establish the  portion of the mineral mined that is exempt from the tax. In determining  whether all or a portion of the mineral extracted is lignite, the  Service will consider all the facts and circumstances. For example, if a  producer sells lignite and coal, the Service will examine all the facts  and circumstances, including the contract price, contract  specifications, and the amount of lignite extracted as it compares to  the amount of lignite sold.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other exemptions not applicable. There are no exemptions for  sales for further manufacture, for export, for use as supplies for  vessels or aircraft, for the use of a State or local government, or for  the use of a nonprofit educational organization. Furthermore, the  Secretary does not have discretion to exempt sales of coal for use of  the United States from the tax. There is also no exemption from the coal  excise tax when the coal is used in further   manufacture of another article that is subject to manufacturers excise  tax. For example, if a producer of coal converts coal into gasoline  which the producer then sells, the producer is liable for the coal  excise tax when the coal is converted into gasoline and also liable for  the manufacturers excise tax on gasoline when the gasoline is sold.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Definitions and special rules--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Coal produced from surface  mine. Coal is treated as produced from a surface mine if all of the  geological matter (e.g., trees, earth, rock) above the coal is removed  before the coal is mined. In addition, both coal mined by auger and coal  that is reclaimed from coal waste refuse piles are treated as produced  from a surface mine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Coal produced from underground mine. Coal is treated as produced  from an underground mine if it is not produced from a surface mine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Coal used by the producer. For purposes of this section, the  term ``coal used by the producer'' means use by the producer in other  than a mining process. A mining process is determined the same way it is  determined for percentage depletion purposes. For example, a producer  who mines coal does not ``use'' the coal and thereby becomes liable for  the tax merely because, before selling the coal, the producer breaks it,  cleans it, sizes it, or applies one of the other processes listed in  section 613(c)(4)(A) of the Code. In such a case, the producer will be  liable for the tax only when he sells the coal. On the other hand, a  producer who mines coal does become liable for the tax when he uses the  coal as fuel, as an ingredient in making coke, or in another process not  treated as ``mining'' under section 613(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Tonnage sold and sales price. For purposes of determining both  the amount of coal sold by a producer and the sales price of the coal,  the point of sale is f.o.b. mine, or f.o.b. cleaning point if the  producer cleans the coal before selling it. This is true even if the  producer sells the coal on the basis of a delivered price. Accordingly,  f.o.b. mine or cleaning point is the point at which the number of tons  sold is to be determined for purposes of applying the applicable tonnage  rate, and the point at which the sales price is to be determined for  purposes of the tax under the 2 percent rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Constructive sale price. If a producer uses coal mined by the  producer in other than a mining process, a constructive sale price must  be used in determining the tax under the 2 percent rate. This  constructive price is determined under sections 613(c) and 4218(e) of  the Code, and is based on sales of like kind and grade of coal by the  producer or other producers made f.o.b. mine (if the coal is used  without first being cleaned) or f.o.b. cleaning plant (if the coal is  cleaned before it is used). Normally, this constructive price will be  the same as the constructive price used in determining the producer's  percentage depletion deduction.
