                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> These rules apply only to adversary adjudications. For the  purpose of these rules, only an adjudication required to be under 5  U.S.C. 554, in which the position of the Department or one of its  components is represented by an attorney or other representative (``the  agency's litigating party'') who enters an appearance and participates  in the proceeding, constitutes an adversary adjudication. These rules do  not apply to proceedings for the purpose of establishing or fixing a  rate or for the purpose of granting, denying, or renewing a license.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the agency's litigating party enters an appearance,  Department proceedings listed in appendix A to this part are covered by  these rules. Also covered are any other proceedings under statutes that  incorporate by reference the procedures of sections 1128(f),  1128A(c)(2), or 1842(j)(2) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320a- 7(f), 1320a-7a(c)(2), or 1395u(j)(2). If a proceeding is not covered  under either of the two previous sentences, a party may file a fee  application as otherwise required by this part and may argue that the  Act covers the proceeding. Any coverage issue shall be determined by the  adjudicative officer and, if necessary, by the appellate authority on  review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a proceeding is covered by these rules, but also involves  issues excluded under paragraph (a) of this section from the coverage of  these rules, reimbursement is available only for fees and expenses  resulting from covered issues.
