                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When a Vice President proposes to debar a firm or individual already debarred by another Government agency for a term concurrent with such debarment, the debarment proceedings before the Postal Service may be based entirely upon the record of facts obtained from such other agency or upon such facts and additional other facts. In such cases the facts obtained from the other agency shall be considered as established, but the party to be debarred shall have opportunity to present information to the Judicial Officer and to explain why the debarment by the Postal Service should not be imposed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where the Vice President initiating the debarment proceeding relies:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon all or part of the record of the proposed Respondent's previous debarment by another Government agency, in initiating such proceeding, the notice of proposed debarment shall contain a statement so stating in sufficient detail to apprise the Respondent of the extent of such reliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Vice President's reliance upon provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, stated in conformity with the directions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section does not deprive the Respondent of the right to request the Judicial Officer to grant a hearing pursuant to these rules, nor the Judicial Officer the full discretion to grant or deny such request.
