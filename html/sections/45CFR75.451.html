This includes, but is not limited to, the  non-Federal entity's contributed portion by reason of cost-sharing  agreements or any under-recoveries through negotiation of flat amounts  for indirect (F&A;) costs. Also, any excess of costs over authorized  funding levels transferred from any award or contract to another award  or contract is unallowable. All losses are not allowable indirect (F&A;)  costs and are required to be included in the appropriate indirect cost  rate base for allocation of indirect costs.</p>
