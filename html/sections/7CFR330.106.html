                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Procedures to prevent pest dissemination. Whenever inspection of  any means of conveyance, stores, baggage, mail, plants, plant products,  earth, stone and quarry products, garbage, or other products or articles  of any character whatsoever, arriving in the United States from a place  outside thereof, or moving interstate, discloses a plant pest, or  provides a reason to believe such a pest is present (other than one  moving under permit in accordance with any conditions in the permit and  the provisions in this part) which is new to, or not theretofore known  to be widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United  States, the inspector shall employ procedures necessary to prevent the  dissemination of the plant pest. Such procedures shall also be employed  with respect to means of conveyance or products or articles of any  character whatsoever which have moved into the United States or  interstate and which the inspector has reason to believe were infested  or infected by or contained any such plant pest at the time of such  movement. The inspector may follow administrative instructions  containing procedures prescribed for certain situations, or he may  follow a procedure selected by him from administratively approved  methods known to be effective. The procedure may involve seizure,  quarantine, treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter,  application of other remedial measures, exportation, return to shipping  point of origin, destruction, or other disposal, but no means of  conveyance, product, article, or plant pest owned by any person shall be  destroyed, exported, or returned to shipping point of origin or ordered  to be so handled, unless there is, in the opinion of the inspector, no  less drastic action adequate to prevent the dissemination of the plant  pest. In forming such an opinion that no less drastic action is  adequate, the inspector shall be guided by applicable specific and  general instructions received from officers of the Plant Protection and  Quarantine Programs. In taking action with respect to any means of  conveyance, product, article, plant pest, the inspector shall take  cognizance of applicable requirements of the customs and postal laws and  regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Orders for remedial measures. The inspector may order the owner  of any means of conveyance, product, article, or plant pest, subject to  disposal under paragraph (a) of this section, to treat,   apply other remedial measures, destroy, or make other disposal thereof  without cost to the Federal Government and in a manner specified in  accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure to apply remedial measures. If the measures required by  the inspector are not applied promptly by the owner within the time  limits specified by the inspector, the inspector shall apply measures  necessary to prevent the dissemination of the plant pests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Khapra beetle infestations of means of conveyance, or cargo or  stores thereof; other infestations. As a means of preventing the  dissemination into the United States, or interstate, of the khapra  beetle (Trogoderma granarium Everts), the following procedures will be  applicable when that insect is found, or there is reason to believe it  is present, in a means of conveyance within paragraph (a) of this  section, or in any cargo or stores in such a means of conveyance, or in  any cargo or stores unloaded or landed, or being unloaded or landed, in  the United States therefrom. These procedures will also apply with  respect to other plant pests when the inspector finds they are necessary  and sufficient to prevent the spread of such pests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Infestation in storerooms and similar compartments of means of  conveyance (except aircraft). </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When infestation is found only in  stores or storerooms, galleys, pantries, or similar noncargo  compartments of a means of conveyance, except aircraft, the inspector  shall prescribe and supervise the application of such remedial measures  as, in his opinion, will be effective under conditions that will not  spread the infestation to other parts of the means of conveyance, or to  adjacent piers or other installations. If, in the opinion of the  inspector, fumigation is the only available safeguard to eliminate the  infestation, he shall order the owner to arrange for immediate  fumigation of the infested stores and portions of the means of  conveyance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the means of conveyance is to leave the territorial limits  of the United States directly for a port in another country within 24  hours of such order, the inspector may suspend compliance with the  fumigation requirement pending departure from the United States. Pending  fumigation or departure, the inspector may seal the openings of infested  compartments, packages, or articles, if in his opinion the action is  necessary to prevent plant pest dissemination while the means of  conveyance remains in the teritorial limits of the United States, as  authorized in Sec. 330.110. The inspector may extend the 24-hour period  to 48 hours, if, in his judgment, such extension is warranted by plans  of the owner to remove the means of conveyance from the territorial  limits of the United States within the extended period, the inability of  the contractor to begin fumigation within the 24-hour period, or other  reason deemed valid by the inspector. Further extension shall be given  only under authority of the Deputy Administrator. Pending compliance  with the requirement of fumigation, or the departure from the  territorial limits of the United States directly for a port in another  country, no stores, laundry, furnishings or equipment, or other articles  or products whether in cargo or stores, shall be unloaded from the means  of conveyance except as authorized by the inspector and under conditions  prescribed by him. The owner of an infested means of conveyance under  notice for fumigation which leaves the territorial limits of the United  States without fumigation should arrange for the eradication of the  infestation before returning to the same or another port in the United  States. Upon return to a port in the United States and unless the  infestation has been eliminated to the satisfaction of the inspector,  the means of conveyance shall be subject to fumigation immediately upon  arrival in the United States. Unloading or landing of any product or  article shall not be permitted pending compliance with the fumigation  requirement, except as authorized by the inspector and under conditions  prescribed by him.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the means of conveyance is to remain at the port where the  infestation was found or is to be moved to another port in the United  States, the inspector shall prescribe and supervise the application of  the remedial measures at the port where the infestation is found, as  provided in this paragraph,   or he may authorize the means of conveyance to be moved to another port  for fumigation or the application of other remedial measures under  safeguards prescribed by him.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In all instances where the inspector prescribed procedures  concerned with the application of remedial measures which involve (a)  withholding permission to discharge articles or products; (b) permission  to discharge after such permission has been withheld; (c) discontinuance  of discharging; or (d) resumption of discharging after it has been  discontinued, the appropriate Customs officer shall be immediately  notified in writing. The inspector shall also inform the Customs  officers at the port where the infestation is found and at such other  ports as may be necessary of the requirement for fumigation and/or  permission to move coastwise to another U.S. port for fumigation or  other remedial measures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Infestation in cargo compartments of means of conveyance (except  aircraft). When infestation is found in cargo compartments or in cargo  of a means of conveyance, except aircraft, the inspector shall prescribe  and supervise the application of such remedial measures as, in his  opinion are necessary, with respect to the cargo and the portions of the  means of conveyance which contain or contained or were contaminated by  the infested cargo. If in the opinion of the inspector fumigation is the  only available safeguard to eliminate the infestation, he shall order  the owner to arrange for immediate fumigation of the infested portions  of such means of conveyance and cargo. However, if such cargo  compartments cannot be fumigated without fumigating the entire means of  conveyance, the inspector may order the entire means of conveyance and  cargo to be fumigated. The inspector shall notify the owner of the means  of conveyance of such requirement and the owner shall arrange for  immediate fumigation. Discharge of cargo shall be discontinued unless  the inspector allows it to continue under safeguards to be prescribed by  him. The provisions applicable to stores and storerooms in paragraph  (d)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section shall apply to cargo and cargo  areas of such means of conveyance. Customs officers shall be informed as  required in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Infestation in an aircraft. If infestation is found in an  aircraft, the inspector may apply seals as provided in Sec. 330.110,  and he may require such temporary safeguards as he deems necessary,  including the discontinuance of further unloading or landing of any  products or articles except as authorized by him. Upon finding such  infestation in an aircraft the inspector shall promptly notify the Plant  Protection and Quarantine Programs of all circumstances and the  temporary safeguards employed, and the Plant Protection and Quarantine  Programs will specify the measures for eliminating the infestation which  will not be deleterious to the aircraft or its operating components. Any  insecticidal application required shall be approved by the Deputy  Administrator for use in aircraft. If the aircraft is to depart from the  territorial limits of the United States within 24 hours after the  infestation is found, the inspector shall permit such departure in lieu  of the application of other measures and shall prior to departure break  any seals that would prevent access to the aircraft or safe operation  thereof. Other seals shall remain intact at time of departure and shall  be broken by the aircraft commander or a crew member upon his order only  after the aircraft is beyond the territorial limits of the United  States. Extension of the 24-hour period shall be given only under  authority of the Deputy Administrator. The owner of the aircraft under  notice of khapra beetle infestation which leaves the territorial limits  of the United States before the infestation has been eradicated should  arrange for eradication before returning the aircraft to the United  States. Upon return to the United States, if the infestation is not  eliminated to the satisfaction of the inspector, the aircraft shall be  subject to the same disinfestation requirements and other safeguards  immediately upon arrival in the United States. Customs officers shall be  notified as required in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Precautions. The owner of a means of conveyance required to be  fumigated pursuant to this section shall arrange with a competent  operator to apply the   fumigant under the supervision of the inspector. The owner shall  understand that if certain fumigants are used they may result in  residues in or on foodstuffs which may render them unsafe for use as  food items. He is hereby warned against such use unless as ascertains  that the fumigated foodstuffs are fit for human consumption. It should  also be understood by the owner that emergency measures prescribed by  the inspector to safeguard against dissemination of infestation may have  adverse effects on certain products and articles, and that the  acceptance of fumigation as a requirement is an alternative to the  immediate removal of the infested means of conveyance and any products  and articles thereon, from the territorial limits of the United States.  Products or articles in a means of conveyance, or compartments thereof,  which may be exposed to methyl bromide or other remedial measures and  may be adversely affected thereby, may be removed from the means of  conveyance or compartments thereof prior to the application of the  remedial measures if in the opinion of the inspector this can be done  without danger of plant pest dissemination and under conditions  authorized by him, for additional inspection and/or application of  effective remedial measures.
