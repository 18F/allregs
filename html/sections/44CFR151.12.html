                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em> of this section. The Administrator shall  establish the reimbursable amount by determining:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The extent to which the fire service incurred additional  firefighting costs, over and above its normal operating costs, in  connection with the fire which is the subject of the claim, i.e., the  ``amount of costs''; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Administrator will first determine the costs as contemplated  in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The Administrator will then notify  the claimant as to that amount. The claimant must indicate within 30  days its acceptance or rejection of that amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the determination is accepted by the claimant, this will be  the final and conclusive determination of the amount of costs by the  claimant in conjunction with the fire for which the claims are  submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the claimant rejects this amount, it must notify the  Administrator , within 30 days, of its reasons for its rejection. Upon  receipt of notification of rejection, the Administrator shall reconsider  his determination and notify the claimant of the results of the  reconsideration. The amount determined on reconsideration will  constitute the costs to be used by the Director in determining the  reimbursable amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon receipt of documentation from the claimant on the amount of  payments the Federal Government has made for the support of fire  services on the property in question, the Administrator will, following  such verification or investigation as the Administrator may deem  appropriate, calculate the full amount to be reimbursed under the  section 11 formula as set forth in Sec. 151.12(a). This calculation of  the reimbursable amount is based upon the costs determined pursuant to  Sec. 151.12(b) and the documentation of Federal payments that the  claimant submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Administrator's determination of the reimbursable amount  will be sent to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the  Treasury shall, upon receipt of the claim and determination made under  Sec. 151.12 (a), (b), and (c), determine the amount authorized for  payment, which shall be the amount actually available for payment from  any monies in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated but subject to  reimbursement (from any appropriations which may be available or which  may be made available for the purpose) by the Federal department or  agency under whose jurisdiction the fire occurred. This shall be a sum  no greater, although it may be less, that the reimbursable amount  determined by the Administrator , FEMA, with respect to the claim under  Sec. 151.12 (a), (b) and (c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Upon receipt of written notification from the claimant of its  intention to accept the amount authorized as full settlement of the  claim, accompanied by a properly executed document of release, the  Administrator will forward the claim, a copy of the Administrator's  determination and the claimant's document of release to the Secretary of  the Treasury for payment of the claim in the amount authorized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Subject to the discovery of additional material evidence, the  Administrator may reconsider any determination in this section, whether  or not made as his final determination.  [49 FR 5929, Feb. 16, 1984, as amended at 49 FR 38119, Sept. 27, 1984]</p>
