                                Sec. 1.707-3  Disguised sales of property to partnership; general
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Treatment of transfers as a sale--(1) In general. Except as  otherwise provided in this section, if a transfer of property by a  partner to a partnership and one or more transfers of money or other  consideration by the partnership to that partner are described in  paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section, the transfers are treated as a sale of  property, in whole or in part, to the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition and timing of sale. For purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.707- 3 through 1.707-5, the use of the term sale (or any variation of that  word) to refer to a transfer of property by a partner to a partnership  and a transfer of consideration by a partnership to a partner means a  sale or exchange of that property, in whole or in part, to the  partnership by the partner acting in a capacity other than as a member  of the partnership, rather than a contribution and distribution to which  sections 721 and 731, respectively, apply. A transfer that is treated as  a sale under paragraph (a)(1) this section is treated as a sale for all  purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (e.g., sections 453, 483, 1001,  1012, 1031 and 1274). The sale is considered to take place on the date  that, under general principles of Federal tax law, the partnership is  considered the owner of the property. If the transfer of money or other  consideration from the partnership to the partner occurs after the  transfer of property to the partnership; the partner and the partnership  are treated as if, on the date of the sale, the partnership transferred  to the partner an obligation to transfer to the partner money or other  consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Application of disguised sale rules. If a person purports to  transfer property to a partnership in a capacity as a partner, the rules  of this section apply for purposes of determining whether the property  was transferred in a disguised sale, even if it is determined after the  application of the rules of this section that such person is not a  partner. If after the application of the rules of this section to a  purported transfer of property to a partnership, it is determined that  no partnership exists because the property was actually sold, or it is  otherwise determined that the contributed property is not owned by the  partnership for tax purposes, the transferor of the property is treated  as having sold the property to the person (or persons) that acquired  ownership of the property for tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Deemed terminations under section 708. In applying the rules of  this section, transfers resulting from a termination of a partnership  under section 708(b)(1)(B) are disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Transfers treated as a sale--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A transfer of  property (excluding money or an obligation to contribute money) by a  partner to a partnership and a transfer of money or other consideration  (including the assumption of or the taking subject to a liability) by  the partnership to the partner constitute a sale of property, in whole  or in part, by the partner to the partnership only if based on all the  facts and circumstances--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transfer of money or other consideration would not have been  made but for the transfer of property; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In cases in which the transfers are not made simultaneously,  the subsequent transfer is not dependent on the entrepreneurial risks of  partnership operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Facts and circumstances. The determination of whether a transfer  of property by a partner to the partnership and a transfer of money or  other consideration by the partnership to the partner constitute a sale,  in whole or in part, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is made  based on all the facts and circumstances in each case. The weight to be  given each of the facts and circumstances will depend on the particular  case. Generally, the facts and circumstances existing on the date of the  earliest of such transfers are the ones considered in determining  whether a sale exists under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Among the  facts and circumstances that may tend to prove the existence of a sale  under paragraph (b)(1) of this section are the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> That the timing and amount of a subsequent transfer are  determinable with reasonable certainty at the time of an earlier  transfer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> That the transferor has a legally enforceable right to the  subsequent transfer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> That the partner's right to receive the transfer of money or  other consideration is secured in any manner, taking into account the  period during which it is secured;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> That any person has made or is legally obligated to make  contributions to the partnership in order to permit the partnership to  make the transfer of money or other consideration;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> That any person has loaned or has agreed to loan the partnership  the money or other consideration required to enable the partnership to  make the transfer, taking into account whether any such lending  obligation is subject to contingencies related to the results of  partnership operations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> That a partnership has incurred or is obligated to incur debt  to acquire the money or other consideration necessary to permit it to  make the transfer, taking into account the likelihood that the  partnership will be able to incur that debt (considering such factors as  whether any person has agreed to guarantee or otherwise assume personal  liability for that debt);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> That the partnership holds money or other liquid assets,  beyond the reasonable needs of the business, that are expected to be  available to make the transfer (taking into account the income that will  be earned from those assets);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> That partnership distributions, allocation or control of  partnership operations is designed to effect an exchange of the burdens  and benefits of ownership of property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> That the transfer of money or other consideration by the  partnership to the partner is disproportionately large in relationship  to the partner's general and continuing interest in partnership profits;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> That the partner has no obligation to return or repay the money  or other consideration to the partnership, or has such an obligation but  it is likely to become due at such a distant point in the future that  the present value of that obligation is small in relation to the amount  of money or other consideration transferred by the partnership to the  partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Transfers made within two years presumed to be a sale--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. For purposes of this section, if within a two-year period a  partner transfers property to a partnership and the partnership  transfers money or other consideration to the partner (without regard to  the order of the transfers), the transfers are presumed to be a sale of  the property to the partnership unless the facts and circumstances  clearly establish that the transfers do not constitute a sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Disclosure of transfers made within two years. Disclosure to the  Internal Revenue Service in accordance with Sec. 1.707-8 is required  if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A partner transfers property to a partnership and the  partnership transfers money or other consideration to the partner with a  two-year period (without regard to the order of the transfers);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The partner treats the transfers other than as a sale for tax  purposes; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The transfer of money or other consideration to the partner is  not presumed to be a guaranteed payment for capital under Sec. 1.707- 4(a)(1)(ii), is not a reasonable preferred return within the meaning of  Sec. 1.707-4(a)(3), and is not an operating cash flow distribution  within the meaning of Sec. 1.707-4(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Transfers made more than two years apart presumed not to be a  sale. For purposes of this section, if a transfer of money or other  consideration to a partner by a partnership and the transfer of property  to the partnership by that partner are more than two years apart, the  transfers are presumed not to be a sale of the property to the  partnership unless the facts and circumstances clearly establish that  the transfers constitute a sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Scope. This section and Sec. Sec. 1.707-4 through 1.707-9 apply  to contributions and distributions of property described in section  707(a)(2)(A) and transfers described in section 707(a)(2)(B) of the  Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Treatment of simultaneous transfers as a sale. A  transfers property X to partnership AB on April 9, 1992, in exchange for  an interest in the partnership. At the time of the transfer, property X  has a fair market value of $4,000,000 and an adjusted tax basis of  $1,200,000. Immediately after the transfer, the partnership transfers  $3,000,000 in cash to A. Assume that, under this section, the  partnership's transfer of cash to A is treated as part of a sale of  property X to the partnership. Because the amount of cash A receives on  April 9, 1992, does not equal the fair market value of the property, A  is considered to have sold a portion of property X with a value of  $3,000,000 to the partnership in exchange for the cash. Accordingly, A  must recognize $2,100,000 of gain ($3,000,000 amount realized less  $900,000 adjusted tax basis ($1,200,000 multiplied by $3,000,000/ $4,000,000)). Assuming A receives no other transfers that are treated as  consideration for the sale of the property under this section, A is  considered to have contributed to the partnership, in A's capacity as a  partner, $1,000,000 of the fair market value of the property with an  adjusted tax basis of $300,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the $3,000,000 is  transferred to A one year after A's transfer of property X to the  partnership. Assume that under this section the partnership's transfer  of cash to A is treated as part of a sale of property X to the  partnership. Assume also that the applicable Federal short-term rate for  April, 1992, is 10 percent, compounded semiannually.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, A and the partnership  are treated as if, on April 9, 1992, A sold a portion of property X to  the partnership in exchange for an obligation to transfer $3,000,000 to  A one year later. Section 1274 applies to this obligation because it  does not bear interest and is payable more than six months after the  date of the sale. As a result, A's amount realized from the receipt of  the partnership's obligation will be the imputed principal amount of the  partnership's obligation to transfer $3,000,000 to A, which equals  $2,721,088 (the present value on April 9, 1992, of a $3,000,000 payment  due one year later, determined using a discount rate of 10 percent,  compounded semiannually). Therefore, A's amount realized from the  receipt of the partnership's obligation is $2,721,088 (without regard to  whether the sale is reported under the installment method). A is  therefore considered to have sold only $2,721,088 of the fair market  value of property X. The remainder of the $3,000,000 payment ($278,912)  is characterized in accordance with the provisions of section 1272.  Accordingly, A must recognize $1,904,761 of gain ($2,721,088 amount  realized less $816,327 adjusted tax basis ($1,200,000 multiplied by  $2,721,088/$4,000,000)) on the sale of property X to the partnership.  The gain is reportable under the installment method of section 453 if  the sale is otherwise eligible. Assuming A receives no other transfers  that are treated as consideration for the sale of property under this  section, A is considered to have contributed to the partnership, in A's  capacity as a partner, $1,278,912 of the fair market value of property X  with an adjusted tax basis of $383,673.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> C transfers undeveloped land to the CD partnership in exchange for  an interest in the partnership. The partnership intends to construct a  building on the land. At the time the land is transferred to the  partnership, it is unencumbered and has an adjusted tax basis of  $500,000 and a fair market value of $1,000,000. The partnership  agreement provides that upon completing construction of the building the  partnership will distribute $900,000 to C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If, within two years of C's transfer of land to the  partnership, a transfer is made to C pursuant to the provision requiring  a distribution upon completion of the building, the transfer is presumed  to be, under paragraph (c) of this section, part of a sale of the land  to the partnership. C may rebut the presumption that the transfer is  part of a sale if the facts and circumstances clearly establish that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The transfer to C would have been made without regard to C's  transfer of land to the partnership; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The partnership's obligation or ability to make this transfer to  C depends, at the time of the transfer to the partnership, on the  entrepreneurial risks of partnership operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For example, if the partnership will be able to fund the  transfer of cash to C only to the extent that permanent loan proceeds  exceed the cost of constructing the building, the fact that excess  permanent loan proceeds will be available only if the cost to complete  the building is significantly less than the amount projected by a  reasonable budget would be evidence that the transfer to C is not part  of a sale. Similarly, a condition that limits the amount of the  permanent loan to the cost of constructing the building (and thereby  limits the partnership's ability to make a transfer to C) unless all or  a substantial portion of the building is leased would be evidence that  the transfer to C is not part of a sale, if a significant risk exists  that the partnership may not be able to lease the building to that  extent. Another factor that may prove that the transfer of cash to C is  not part of a sale would be that, at the time the land is transferred to  the partnership, no lender has committed to make a permanent loan to  fund the transfer of cash to C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Facts indicating that the transfer of cash to C is not part of  a sale, however, may be offset by other factors. An offsetting factor to  restrictions on the permanent loan proceeds may be that the permanent  loan is to be a recourse loan and certain conditions to the loan are  likely to be waived by the lender because of the creditworthiness of the  partners or the value of the partnership's other assets. Similarly, the  factor that no lender has committed to fund the transfer of cash to C  may be offset by facts establishing that the partnership is obligated to  attempt to obtain such a loan and that its ability to obtain such a loan  is not significantly dependent on the value that will be added by  successful completion of the building, or that the partnership  reasonably anticipates that it will have (and will utilize) an  alternative source to fund the transfer of cash to C if the permanent  loan proceeds are inadequate.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Operation of presumption for transfers within two years.  E is a partner in the equal EF partnership. The partnership owns two  parcels of unimproved real property (parcels 1 and 2). Parcels 1 and 2  are unencumbered. Parcel 1 has a fair market value of $500,000, and  parcel 2 has a fair market value of $1,500,000. E transfers additional  unencumbered, unimproved real property (parcel 3) with a fair market  value of $1,000,000 to the partnership in exchange for an increased  interest in partnership profits of 66\2/3\ percent. Immediately after  this transfer, the partnership sells parcel 1 for $500,000 in a  transaction not in the ordinary course of business. The partnership  transfers the proceeds of the sale $333,333 to E and $166,667 to F in  accordance with their respective partnership interests. The transfer of  $333,333 to E is presumed to be, in accordance with paragraph (c) of  this section, a sale, in part, of parcel 3 to the partnership. However,  the facts of this example clearly establish that $250,000 of the  transfer to E is not part of a sale of parcel 3 to the partnership  because E would have been distributed $250,000 from the sale of parcel 1  whether or not E had transferred parcel 3 to the partnership. The  transfer to E exceeds by $83,333 ($333,333 minus $250,000) the amount of  the distribution that would have been made to E if E had not transferred  parcel 3 to the partnership. Therefore, $83,333 of the transfer is  presumed to be part of a sale of a portion of parcel 3 to the  partnership by E.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> G transfers undeveloped land to the GH partnership in  exchange for an interest in the partnership. At the time the land is  transferred to the partnership, it is unencumbered and has an adjusted  tax basis of $500,000 and a fair market value of $1,000,000. H  contributes $1,000,000 in cash in exchange for an interest in the  partnership. Under the partnership agreement, the partnership is  obligated to construct a building on the land. The projected  construction cost is $5,000,000, which the partnership plans to fund  with its $1,000,000 in cash and the proceeds of a construction loan  secured by the land and improvements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Shortly before G's transfer of the land to the partnership, the  partnership secures commitments from lending institutions for  construction and permanent financing. To obtain the construction loan, H  guarantees completion of the building for a cost of $5,000,000. The  partnership is not obligated to reimburse or indemnify H if H must make  payment on the completion guarantee. The permanent loan will be funded  upon completion of the building, which is expected to occur two years  after G's transfer of the land. The amount of the permanent loan is to  equal the lesser of $5,000,000 or 80 percent of the appraised value of  the improved property at the time the permanent loan is closed. Under  the partnership agreement, the partnership is obligated to apply the  proceeds of the permanent loan to retire the construction loan and to  hold any excess proceeds for transfer to G 25 months after G's transfer  of the land to the partnership. The appraised value of the improved  property at the time the permanent loan is closed is expected to exceed  $5,000,000 only if the partnership is able to lease a substantial  portion of the improvements by that time, and there is a significant  risk that the partnership will not be able to achieve a satisfactory  occupancy level. The partnership completes construction of the building  for the projected cost of $5,000,000 approximately two years after G's  transfer of the land. Shortly thereafter, the permanent loan is funded  in the amount of $5,000,000. At the time of funding the land and  building have an appraised value of $7,000,000. The partnership  transfers the $1,000,000 excess permanent loan proceeds to G 25 months  after G's transfer of the land to the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> G's transfer of the land to the partnership and the  partnership's transfer of $1,000,000 to G occurred more than two years  apart. In accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, those transfers  are presumed not to be a sale unless the facts and circumstances clearly  establish that the transfers constitute a sale of the property, in whole  or part, to the partnership. The transfer of $1,000,000 to G would not  have been made but for G's transfer of the land to the partnership. In  addition, at the time G transferred the land to the partnership, G had a  legally enforceable right to receive a transfer from the partnership at  a specified time an amount that equals the excess of the permanent loan  proceeds over $4,000,000. In this case, however, there was a significant  risk that the appraised value of the property would be insufficient to  support a permanent   loan in excess of $4,000,000 because of the risk that the partnership  would not be able to achieve a sufficient occupancy level. Therefore,  the facts of this example indicate that at the time G transferred the  land to the partnership the subsequent transfer of $1,000,000 to G  depended on the entrepreneurial risks of partnership operations.  Accordingly, G's transfer of the land to the partnership is not treated  as part of a sale.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Rebuttal of presumption for transfers more than two years  apart. The facts are the same as in Example 5, except that the  partnership is able to secure a commitment for a permanent loan in the  amount of $5,000,000 without regard to the appraised value of the  improved property at the time the permanent loan is funded. Under these  facts, at the time that G transferred the land to the partnership the  subsequent transfer of $1,000,000 to G was not dependent on the  entrepreneurial risks of partnership operations, because during the  period before the permanent loan is funded, the permanent lender's  obligation to make a loan in the amount necessary to fund the transfer  is not subject to the contingencies related to the risks of partnership  operations, and after the permanent loan is funded, the partnership  holds liquid assets sufficient to make the transfer. Therefore, the  facts and circumstances clearly establish that G's transfer of the land  to the partnership is part of a sale.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Operation of presumption for transfers more than two  years apart. The facts are the same as in Example 6, except that H does  not guarantee either that the improvements will be completed or that the  cost to the partnership of completing the improvements will not exceed  $5,000,000. Under these facts, if there is a significant risk that the  improvements will not be completed, G's transfer of the land to the  partnership will not be treated as part of a sale because the lender is  required to make the permanent loan if the improvements are not  completed. Similarly, the transfers will not be treated as a sale to the  extent that there is a significant risk that the cost of constructing  the improvements will exceed $5,000,000, because, in the absence of a  guarantee of the cost of the improvements by H, the $5,000,000 proceeds  of the permanent loan might not be sufficient to retire the construction  loan and fund the transfer to G. In either case, the transfer of cash to  G would be dependent on the entrepreneurial risks of partnership  operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On February 1, 1992, I, J, and K form partnership IJK. On  formation of the partnership, I transfers an unencumbered office  building with a fair market value of $50,000,000 and an adjusted tax  basis of $20,000,000 to the partnership, and J and K each transfer  United States government securities with a fair market value and an  adjusted tax basis of $25,000,000 to the partnership. Substantially all  of the rentable space in the office building is leased on a long-term  basis. The partnership agreement provides that all items of income,  gain, loss, and deduction from the office building are to be allocated  45 percent to J, 45 percent to K, and 10 percent to I. The partnership  agreement also provides that all items of income, gain, loss, and  deduction from the government securities are to be allocated 90 percent  to I, 5 percent to J, and 5 percent to K. The partnership agreement  requires that cash flow from the office building and government  securities be allocated between partners in the same manner as the items  of income, gain, loss, and deduction from those properties are allocated  between them. The partnership agreement complies with the requirements  of Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b). It is not expected that the partnership  will need to resort to the government securities or the cash flow  therefrom to operate the office building. At the time the partnership is  formed, I, J, and K contemplated that I's interest in the partnership  would be liquidated sometime after January 31, 1994, in exchange for a  transfer of the government securities and cash (if necessary). On March  1, 1995, the partnership transfers cash and the government securities to  I in liquidation of I's interest in the partnership. The cash  transferred to I represents the excess of I's share of the appreciation  in the office building since the formation of the partnership over J's  and K's share of the appreciation in the government securities since  they are acquired by the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> I's transfer of the office building to the partnership and the  partnership's transfer of the government securities and cash to I  occurred more than two years apart. Therefore, those transfers are  presumed not to be a sale unless the facts and circumstances clearly  establish that the transfers constitute a sale. Absent I's transfer of  the office building to the partnership, I would not have received the  government securities from the partnership. The facts including the  amount and nature of partnership assets) indicate that, at the time that  I transferred the office building to the partnership, the timing of the  transfer of the government securities to I was anticipated and was not  dependent on the entrepreneurial risks of partnership operations.  Moreover, the facts indicate that the partnership allocations were  designed to effect an exchange of the burdens and benefits of ownership  of the government securities in anticipation of the transfer of those  securities to I and those burdens and benefits were effectively shifted  to I on formation of the partnership. Accordingly, the facts and  circumstances clearly establish that I sold   the office building to the partnership on February 1, 1992, in exchange  for the partnership's obligation to transfer the government securities  to I and to make certain other cash transfers to I.
