For either type of  license, the applicant should estimate the cost of each proposed  resource protection, mitigation, or enhancement measure and any specific  measure filed with the Commission by agencies, Indian tribes, or members  of the public when the application is filed. For an existing license,  the applicant's economic analysis must estimate the value of  developmental resources associated with the project under the current  license and the applicant's proposal. For an original license, the  applicant must estimate the value of the developmental resources for the  proposed project. As applicable, these developmental resources may  include power generation, water supply, irrigation, navigation, and  flood control. Where possible, the value of developmental resources must  be based on market prices.
