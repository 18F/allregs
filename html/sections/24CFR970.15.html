                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In addition to other applicable requirements of this part, HUD will approve an application for demolition upon the PHA's certification that it meets the following statutory criteria, unless the application meets the criteria for disapproval under 24 CFR 970.29. An application for the demolition of all or a portion of a public housing project must certify that the project:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is obsolete as to physical condition, location, or other factors, making it unsuitable for housing purposes, and no reasonable program of modifications is cost-effective to return the public housing project or portion of the project to useful life; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of an application for demolition of a portion of a project, the demolition will help to ensure the viability of the remaining portion of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As to paragraph (a)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Major problems indicative of obsolescence are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As to physical condition: Structural deficiencies that cannot be corrected in a cost-effective manner (settlement of earth below the building caused by inadequate structural fills, faulty structural design, or settlement of floors), or other design or site problems (severe erosion or flooding);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As to location: physical deterioration of the neighborhood; change from residential to industrial or commercial development; or environmental conditions as determined by HUD environmental review in accord with 24 CFR part 50, which jeopardize the suitability of the site or a portion of the site and its housing structures for residential use; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> There are other factors that have seriously affected the marketability, usefulness, or management of the property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> HUD generally shall not consider a program of modifications to be cost-effective if the costs of such program exceed 62.5 percent of total development cost (TDC) for elevator structures and 57.14 percent of TDC for all other types of structures in effect at the time the application is submitted to HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a partial demolition will be considered to ensure the viability of the remaining portion if the application certifies that the demolition will reduce development density to permit better access by emergency, fire, or rescue services, or improve marketability by reducing the density to that of the neighborhood or other developments in the PHA's inventory.
