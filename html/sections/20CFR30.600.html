Nevertheless, a  claimant may appoint one individual to represent his or her interests,  but the appointment must be in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of this section, a  ``representative'' does not include a person who only has a power of  attorney to act on behalf of a claimant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A properly appointed representative who is recognized by OWCP  may make a request or give direction to OWCP regarding the claims  process, including a hearing. This authority includes presenting or  eliciting evidence, making arguments on facts or the law, and obtaining  information from the case file, to the same extent as the claimant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any notice requirement contained in this part or EEOICPA is  fully satisfied if served on the representative, and has the same force  and effect as if sent to the claimant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A representative does not have authority to sign the Form EN-20,  described in Sec. 30.505(c) of these regulations, which collects  information necessary for issuance of a compensation payment.</p>
