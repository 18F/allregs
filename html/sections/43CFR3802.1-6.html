                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the development of a plan for an entire operation is not  possible, the operator shall file an initial plan setting forth this  proposed operation to the degree reasonably foreseeable at that time.  Thereafter, the operator shall file a supplemental plan or plans prior  to undertaking any operations not covered by the initial plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At any time during operations under an approved plan of  operations, the authorized officer or the operator may initiate a  modification of the plan detailing any necessary changes that were  unforeseen at the time of filing of the plan of operations. If the  operator does not furnish a proposed modification within a time  considered reasonable by the authorized officer, the authorized officer  may recommend to the State Director that the operator be required to  submit a proposed modification of the plan. The recommendation of the  authorized officer shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the  supporting facts and reasons for his recommendations. In acting upon  such recommendation, except in the case of a modification under Sec.  3802.1-5(e) of this title, the State Director shall determine (1)  whether all reasonable measures were taken by the authorized officer to  predict the environmental impacts of the proposed operations; (2)  whether the disturbance is or may become of such significance as to  require modification of the plan of operations in order to meet the  requirement for environmental protection specified in Sec. 3802.3-2 of  this title, and (3) whether the disturbance can be minimized using  reasonable means. Lacking such a determination by the State Director, an  operator is not required to submit a proposed modification of an  approved plan of operations. Operations may continue in accordance with  the approved plan of operations until a modified plan is approved,  unless the State Director determines that the operations are causing  impairment or unnecessary or undue degradation to surface resources. He  shall advise the operator of those measures needed to avoid such damage  and the operator shall immediately take all necessary steps to implement  measures recommended by the State Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A supplemental plan of operations or a modification of an  approved plan of operations shall be approved by the authorized officer  in the same manner as the initial plan of operations.</p>
