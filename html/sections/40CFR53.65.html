                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Overview. (1) The loading tests are designed to quantify any appreciable

changes in a candidate method sampler's performance as a function of coarse aerosol collection. The candidate sampler is exposed to a mass of coarse aerosol equivalent to sampling a mass concentration of 150 g/m\3\ over the time period that the manufacturer has specified between periodic cleaning. After loading, the candidate sampler is then evaluated by performing the test in Sec. 53.62 (full wind tunnel test), Sec. 53.63 (wind tunnel inlet aspiration test), or Sec. 53.64 (static fractionator test). If the acceptance criteria are met for this evaluation test, then the candidate sampler is approved for multi-day sampling with the periodic maintenance schedule as specified by the candidate method. For example, if the candidate sampler passes the reevaluation tests following loading with an aerosol mass equivalent to sampling a 150 g/m\3\ aerosol continuously for 7 days, then the sampler is approved for 7 day field operation before cleaning is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The loading tests are designed to quantify any appreciable

Effectiveness after loading is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the mass concentration of particles of a given size reaching the sampler filter to the mass concentration of particles of the same size approaching the sampler.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Facilities and equipment required--(1) Particle delivery system. The particle delivery system shall consist of a static chamber or a low velocity wind tunnel having a sufficiently large cross-sectional area such that the test sampler, or portion thereof, may be installed in the test section. At a minimum, the system must have a sufficiently large cross section to house the candidate sampler inlet as well as a collocated isokinetic nozzle for measuring total aerosol concentration. The mean velocity in the test section of the static chamber or wind tunnel shall not exceed 2 km/hr.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Particle delivery system.

The mean velocity in the test section of the static chamber or wind tunnel shall not exceed 2 km/hr.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Aerosol generation equipment. For purposes of these tests, the test aerosol shall be produced from commercially available, bulk Arizona road dust. To provide direct interlaboratory comparability of sampler loading characteristics, the bulk dust is specified as 0-10 m ATD available from Powder Technology Incorporated (Burnsville, MN). A fluidized bed aerosol generator, Wright dust feeder, or sonic nozzle shall be used to efficiently deagglomerate the bulk test dust and transform it into an aerosol cloud. Other dust generators may be used contingent upon prior approval by the Agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Isokinetic sampler. Mean aerosol concentration within the static chamber or wind tunnel shall be established using a single isokinetic sampler containing a preweighed high-efficiency total filter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Analytic balance. An analytical balance shall be used to determine the weight of the total filter in the isokinetic sampler. The precision and accuracy of this device shall be such that the relative measurement error is less than 5.0 percent for the difference between the initial and final weight of the total filter. The identical analytic balance shall be used to perform both initial and final weighing of the total filter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Test procedure. (1) Calculate and record the target time weighted concentration of Arizona road dust which is equivalent to exposing the sampler to an environment of 150 g/m\3\ over the time between cleaning specified by the candidate sampler's operations manual as:</p><p class="depth0">Equation 40[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.133
where:
t = the number of hours specified by the candidate method prior to</p><p class="depth0">periodic cleaning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Clean the candidate sampler. (i) Clean and dry the internal surfaces of the candidate sampler.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Clean and dry the internal surfaces of the candidate sampler.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Prepare the internal surfaces in strict accordance with the operating manual referred to in section 7.4.18 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determine the preweight of the filter that shall be used in the isokinetic sampler. Record this value as InitWt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Install the candidate sampler's inlet and the isokinetic sampler within the test chamber or wind tunnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Generate a dust cloud. (i) Generate a dust cloud composed of Arizona test dust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Generate a dust cloud composed of Arizona test dust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Introduce the dust cloud into the chamber.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Allow sufficient time for the particle concentration to become steady within the chamber.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Sample aerosol with a total filter and the candidate sampler. (i) Sample the aerosol for a time sufficient to produce an equivalent TWC equal to that of the target TWC [15 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sample the aerosol for a time sufficient to produce an equivalent TWC equal to that of the target TWC [15 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Record the sampling time as t.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Determine the time weighted concentration. (i) Determine the postweight of the isokinetic sampler's total filter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determine the postweight of the isokinetic sampler's total filter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Record this value as FinalWt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Calculate and record the TWC as:</p><p class="depth0">Equation 41[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.134
where:
Q = the flow rate of the candidate method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the value of TWC deviates from the target TWC [15 percent, then the loaded mass is unacceptable and the entire test procedure must be repeated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Determine the candidate sampler's effectiveness after loading. The candidate sampler's effectiveness as a function of particle aerodynamic diameter must then be evaluated by performing the test in Sec. 53.62 (full wind tunnel test). A sampler which fits the category of inlet deviation in Sec. 53.60(e)(1) may opt to perform the test in Sec. 53.63 (inlet aspiration test) in lieu of the full wind tunnel test. A sampler which fits the category of fractionator deviation in Sec. 53.60(e)(2) may opt to perform the test in Sec. 53.64 (static fractionator test) in lieu of the full wind tunnel test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Test results. If the candidate sampler meets the acceptance criteria for the evaluation test performed in paragraph (d)(8) of this section, then the candidate sampler passes this test with the stipulation that the sampling train be cleaned as directed by and as frequently as that specified by the candidate sampler's operations manual.</p>
