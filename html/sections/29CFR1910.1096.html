                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions applicable to this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Radiation includes  alpha rays, beta rays, gamma rays, X-rays, neutrons, high-speed  electrons, high-speed protons, and other atomic particles; but such term  does not include sound or radio waves, or visible light, or infrared or  ultraviolet light.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Radioactive material means any material which emits, by  spontaneous nuclear disintegration, corpuscular or electromagnetic  emanations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Restricted area means any area access to which is controlled by  the employer for purposes of protection of individuals from exposure to  radiation or radioactive materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Unrestricted area means any area access to which is not  controlled by the employer for purposes of protection of individuals  from exposure to radiation or radioactive materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Dose means the quantity of ionizing radiation absorbed, per unit  of mass, by the body or by any portion of the body. When the provisions  in this section specify a dose during a period of time, the dose is the  total quantity of radiation absorbed, per unit of mass, by the body or  by any portion of the body during such period of time. Several different  units of dose are in current use. Definitions of units used in this  section are set forth in paragraphs (a) (6) and (7) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Rad means a measure of the dose of any ionizing radiation to  body tissues in terms of the energy absorbed per unit of mass of the  tissue. One rad is the dose corresponding to the absorption of 100 ergs  per gram of tissue (1 millirad (mrad)=0.001 rad).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Rem means a measure of the dose of any ionizing radiation to  body tissue in terms of its estimated biological effect relative to a  dose of 1 roentgen (r) of X-rays (1 millirem (mrem)=0.001 rem). The  relation of the rem to other dose units depends upon the biological  effect under consideration and upon the conditions for irradiation. Each  of the following is considered to be equivalent to a dose of 1 rem:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A dose of 1 roentgen due to X- or gamma radiation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A dose of 1 rad due to X-, gamma, or beta radiation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A dose of 0.1 rad due to neutrons or high energy protons;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A dose of 0.05 rad due to particles heavier than protons and  with sufficient energy to reach the lens of the eye;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If it is more convenient to measure the neutron flux, or  equivalent, than to determine the neutron dose in rads, as provided in  paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section, 1 rem of neutron radiation may,  for purposes of the provisions in this section be assumed to be  equivalent to 14 million neutrons per square centimeter incident upon  the body; or, if there is sufficient information to estimate with  reasonable accuracy the approximate distribution in energy of the  neutrons, the incident number of neutrons per square centimeter  equivalent to 1 rem may be estimated from Table G-17:</p><p class="depth0">Table G-17--Neutron Flux Dose Equivalents ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Average</p><p class="depth0">Number of      flux to</p><p class="depth0">neutrons per     deliver</p><p class="depth0">square          100</p><p class="depth0">Neutron energy (million electron volts       centimeter     millirem</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Mev))</em>                      equivalent to     in 40</p><p class="depth0">a dose of 1      hours</p><p class="depth0">rem (neutrons/  (neutrons/</p><p class="depth0">cm\2\)       cm\2\ per</p><p class="depth0">sec.) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Thermal.....................................       970x10\6\         670 0.0001......................................       720x10\6\         500 0.005.......................................       820x10\6\         570 0.02........................................       400x10\6\         280 0.1.........................................       120x10\6\          80 0.5.........................................        43x10\6\          30 1.0.........................................        26x10\6\          18 2.5.........................................        29x10\6\          20 5.0.........................................        26x10\6\          18 7.5.........................................        24x10\6\          17 10..........................................        24x10\6\          17 10 to 30....................................        14x10\6\          10 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> For determining exposures to X- or gamma rays up to 3 Mev., the  dose limits specified in this section may be assumed to be equivalent to  the ``air dose''.
