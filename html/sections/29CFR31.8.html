                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure  to comply with this part, and if the noncompliance or threatened  noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with  this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal  to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance, or by any other  means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not  limited to,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation  that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the  United States under any law of the United States (including other titles  of the Act), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any applicable proceeding under State or local law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal  financial assistance. No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to  grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective  until:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary has advised the applicant or recipient of his  failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured  by voluntary means,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There has been an express finding on the record, after  opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to  comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The action has been approved by the Secretary, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The expiration of 30 days after the Secretary has filed with the  committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having  legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written  report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any action  to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal  financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political  entity, or part thereof,   or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made  and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part  thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by  any other means authorized by law shall be taken until:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary has determined that compliance cannot be secured  by voluntary means,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The action has been approved by the Secretary,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The recipient or other person has been notified of its failure  to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such  notice to the recipient or other person. During this period of at least  10 days additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient or  other person to comply with this part and to take such corrective action  as may be appropriate.
