                            <p class="depth0">The limitation of risk prescribed in Sec. 223.10 may be complied with by the following methods:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Coinsurance. Two or more companies may underwrite a risk on any bond or policy, the amount of which does not exceed their aggregate underwriting limitations. Each company shall limit its liability upon the face of the bond or policy, to a definite specified amount which shall be within its underwriting limitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reinsurance. (1) In respect to bonds running to the United States, liability in excess of the underwriting limitation shall be reinsured within 45 days from the date of execution and delivery of the bond with one or more companies holding a certificate of authority from the Secretary of the Treasury. Such reinsurance shall not be in excess of the underwriting limitation of the reinsuring company. Where reinsurance is contemplated, Federal agencies may accept a bond from the direct writing company in satisfaction of the total bond requirement even though it may exceed the direct writing company's underwriting limitation. Within the 45 day period, the direct writing company shall furnish to the Federal agency any necessary reinsurance agreements. However, a Federal agency may, at its discretion, require that reinsurance be obtained within a lesser period than 45 days, and may require completely executed reinsurance agreements to be provided before making a final determination that any bond is acceptable. Reinsurance may protect bonds required to be furnished to the United States by the Miller Act (40 U.S.C. 3131, as amended) covering contracts for the construction, alteration, or repair of any public building or public work of the United States, as well as other types of Federal bonds. Use of reinsurance or coinsurance to protect such bonds is at the discretion of the direct writing company. Reinsurance shall be executed on reinsurance agreement forms: Standard Form 273 (Reinsurance Agreement for a Miller Act Performance Bond), Standard Form 274 (Reinsurance Agreement for a Miller Act Payment Bond), and Standard Form 275 (Reinsurance Agreement in Favor of the United States for other types of Federal bonds). These Standard Forms are available on the General Services Administration Web site at www.gsa.gov.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In respect to bonds running to the United States, liability in excess of the underwriting limitation shall be reinsured within 45 days from the date of execution and delivery of the bond with one or more companies holding a certificate of authority from the Secretary of the Treasury.

In respect to all risks other than Miller Act performance and payment bonds running to the

United States, which must be coinsured or reinsured in accord with paragraph (a) or (b)(1) of this section respectively, the excess liability may otherwise be protected:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By the deposit with the company in pledge, or by conveyance to it in trust for its protection, of assets admitted by the Treasury the current market value of which is at least equal to the liability in excess of its underwriting limitation, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If such obligation was incurred on behalf of or on account of a fiduciary holding property in a trust capacity, by a joint control agreement which provides that the whole or a sufficient portion of the property so held may not be disposed of or pledged in any way without the consent of the insuring company.
