                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority of director. The director may withdraw the status of an alien granted Temporary Protected Status under section 244 of the Act at any time upon the occurrence of any of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The alien was not in fact eligible at the time such status was granted, or at any time thereafter becomes ineligible for such status;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The alien has not remained continuously physically present in the United States from the date the alien was first granted Temporary Protected Status under this part. For the purpose of this provision, an alien granted Temporary Protected Status under this part shall be deemed not to have failed to maintain continuous physical presence in the United States if the alien departs the United States after first obtaining permission from the district director to travel pursuant to Sec. 1244.15;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The alien fails without good cause to register with the Attorney General annually within thirty (30) days before the end of each 12-month period after the granting of Temporary Protected Status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Decision by director. (1) Withdrawal of an alien's status under paragraph (a) of this section shall be in writing and served by personal service pursuant to Sec. 103.5(a) of this chapter. If the ground for withdrawal is Sec. 240.14(a)(3), the notice shall provide that the alien has thirty (30) days within which to provide evidence of good cause for failure to register. If the alien fails to respond within thirty (30) days, Temporary Protected Status shall be withdrawn without further notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Withdrawal of an alien's status under paragraph (a) of this section shall be in writing and served by personal service pursuant to Sec. 103.5(a) of this chapter. If the ground for withdrawal is Sec. 240.14(a)(3), the notice shall provide that the alien has thirty (30) days within which to provide evidence of good cause for failure to register. If the alien fails to respond within thirty (30) days, Temporary Protected Status shall be withdrawn without further notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Withdrawal of the alien's Temporary Protected Status under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may subject the applicant to exclusion or deportation proceedings under sections 235, 236, 237, 238, 240, or 241 of the Act as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the basis for the withdrawal of Temporary Protected Status constitutes a ground of deportability or excludability which renders an alien ineligible for Temporary Protected Status under Sec. 1244.4 or inadmissible under Sec. 1244.3(c), the decision shall include a charging document which sets forth such ground(s) with notice of the right of a de novo determination of eligibility for Temporary Protected Status in deportation or exclusion proceedings. If the basis for withdrawal does not constitute such a ground, the alien shall be given written notice of his or her right to appeal to the AAU. Upon receipt of an appeal, the administrative record will be forwarded to the AAU for review and decision pursuant to the authority delegated under Sec. 103.1(f)(2). Temporary Protected Status benefits will be extended during the pendency of an appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Decision by AAU. If a decision to withdraw Temporary Protected Status is entered by the AAU, the AAU shall notify the alien of the decision and the right to a de novo determination of eligibility for Temporary Protected Status in deportation or exclusion proceedings, if the alien is then deportable or excludable, as provided by Sec. 1244.10(d).
