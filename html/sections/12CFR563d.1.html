                            <p class="depth0">In respect to any securities issued by savings associations, the powers, functions, and duties vested in the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') to administer and enforce sections 12, 13, 14(a), 14(c), 14(d), 14(f), and 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') are vested in the Office. The rules, regulations and forms prescribed by the Commission pursuant to those sections or applicable in connection with obligations imposed by those sections, shall apply to securities issued by savings associations, except as otherwise provided in this part. The term ``Commission'' as used in those rules and regulations shall with respect to securities issued by savings associations be deemed to refer to the Office unless the context otherwise requires. All filings with respect to securities issued by savings associations required by those rules and regulations to be made with the Commission shall be made with the Business Transactions Division, Chief Counsel's Office, Office of Thrift Supervision, 1700 G Street, NW., Washington, DC 20552, by submitting such filings to the Securities Filing Desk at the above address, except as noted in Sec. 563d.2 of this part. Except to the extent otherwise specifically provided by the Office in the application fee schedule published in the Thrift Bulletin pursuant to 12 CFR part 502, all filing fees specified by the Commission's rules shall be paid to the Office. If, after the Office reviews a Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G and determines that the filing is materially deficient such that the Office requires that an amendment be filed to correct the deficiency, then, upon the filing of the amendment to the Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G, as the case may be, the filer shall pay an additional filing fee to the Office, in the amount specified by the Office in the application fee schedule published in the Thrift Bulletin pursuant to 12 CFR part 502.
