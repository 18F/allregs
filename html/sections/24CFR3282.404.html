                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial determination. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Not later than 30 days after a  manufacturer receives information that it believes in good faith may  indicate a noncompliance, defect, serious defect, or imminent safety  hazard, the manufacturer must make a specific initial determination that  there is a noncompliance, defect, serious defect, or imminent safety  hazard, or that the information requires no further action under this  subpart. If a manufacturer makes a final determination of noncompliance  for an individual home (see Sec. 3282.412(b)) and a class of homes is  not involved, no further action is needed by the manufacturer other than  to keep a record of its determination as required by Sec. 3282.417. If  the manufacturer determines that it is not the cause of the problem, but  a problem still exists, the manufacturer must forward the information in  its possession to the appropriate retailer (see Sec. 3282.254), and, if  known, to the installer (see Sec. Sec. 3286.115 and 3286.811) for their  consideration. Alternatively, the manufacturer, retailer, or installer  may choose to submit the issue for resolution under dispute resolution  (see 24 CFR part 3288).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a manufacturer makes an initial determination that there is  a serious defect or an imminent safety hazard, the manufacturer must  immediately notify the Secretary, the SAA in the state of manufacture,  and the manufacturer's IPIA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In making the determination of noncompliance, defect, serious  defect, or imminent safety hazard, or that no further action is required  under this subpart, the manufacturer must review the information it  received and carry out investigations, including, a review of service  records, IPIA inspection records, and, as appropriate, inspections of  homes in the class. The manufacturer must review the information, the  known facts, and the circumstances relating to the complaint or  information, including service records, approved designs, and audit  findings, as applicable, to decide what investigations are reasonable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Class determination. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the manufacturer makes an initial  determination of defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard, the  manufacturer must also make a good-faith determination of the class that  includes each manufactured home in which the same defect, serious  defect, or imminent safety hazard exists or likely exists. Multiple  occurrences of defects may be considered the same defect if they have  the same cause, are related to a specific workstation description, or  are related to the same failure to follow the manufacturer's approved  quality assurance manual. Good faith may be used as a defense to the  imposition of a penalty, but does not relieve the manufacturer of its  responsibilities for notification or correction under this subpart I.  The manufacturer must make this class determination not later than 20  days after making a determination of defect, serious defect, or imminent  safety hazard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Paragraph (c) of this section sets out methods for a  manufacturer to use in determining the class of manufactured homes. If  the manufacturer can identify the precise manufactured homes affected by  the defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard, the class of  manufactured homes may include only those manufactured homes actually  affected by the same defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard.  The manufacturer is also permitted to exclude from the class those  manufactured homes for which the manufacturer has information that  indicates the homes were not affected by the same cause. If it is not  possible to identify the precise manufactured homes affected, the class  must include every manufactured home in the group of homes that is  identifiable, since the same defect, serious defect, or imminent safety  hazard exists or likely exists in some homes in that group of  manufactured homes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes related to this section, a defect, a serious  defect, or an imminent safety hazard likely exists in a manufactured  home if the cause of the defect, serious defect, or imminent safety  hazard is such that the same defect, serious defect, or imminent safety  hazard would likely have been introduced systematically into more than  one manufactured home. Indications that the defect, serious defect, or  imminent safety hazard would likely have been introduced systematically  may include, but are not limited to, complaints that can be traced to  the same faulty design or faulty construction, problems known to exist  in supplies of components or parts, information related to the  performance of a particular employee or use of a particular process, and  information signaling a failure to follow quality control procedures  with respect to a particular aspect of the manufactured home.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the manufacturer must determine the class of homes pursuant  to paragraph (b) of this section, the manufacturer must obtain from the  IPIA, and the IPIA must provide, either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The IPIA's written concurrence on the methods used by the  manufacturer to identify the homes that should be included in the class  of homes; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The IPIA's written statement explaining why it believes the  manufacturer's methods for determining the class of homes were  inappropriate or inadequate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Methods for determining class. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In making a class  determination under paragraph (b) of this section, a manufacturer is  responsible for carrying out reasonable investigations. In carrying out  investigations, the manufacturer must review the information, the known  facts, and the relevant circumstances, and generally must establish the  cause of the defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard. Based on  the results of such investigations and all information received or  developed, the manufacturer must use an appropriate method or  appropriate methods to determine the class of manufactured homes in  which the same defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard exists  or likely exists.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Methods that may be used in determining the class of  manufactured homes include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Inspection of the manufactured home in question, including its  design, to determine whether the defect, serious defect, or imminent  safety hazard resulted from the design itself;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Physical inspection of manufactured homes of the same design or  construction, as appropriate, that were   produced before and after a home in question;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Inspection of the service records of a home in question and of  homes of the same design or construction, as appropriate, produced  before and after that home, if it is clear that the cause of the defect,  serious defect, or imminent safety hazard is such that the defect,  serious defect, or imminent safety hazard would be visible to and  reportable by consumers or retailers;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Inspection of manufacturer quality control records to determine  whether quality control procedures were followed and, if not, the time  frame during which they were not;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Inspection of IPIA records to determine whether the defect,  serious defect, or imminent safety hazard was either detected or  specifically found not to exist in some manufactured homes;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Identification of the cause as relating to a particular  employee whose work, or to a process whose use, would have been common  to the production of the manufacturer's homes for a period of time; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Inspection of records relating to components supplied by other  parties and known to contain or suspected of containing a defect, a  serious defect, or an imminent safety hazard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the Secretary or an SAA decides the method chosen by the  manufacturer to conduct an investigation in order to make a class  determination is not the most appropriate method, the Secretary or SAA  must explain in writing to the manufacturer why the chosen method is not  the most appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Documentation required. The manufacturer must comply with the  recordkeeping requirements in Sec. 3282.417 as applicable to its  determinations and any IPIA concurrence or statement that it does not  concur.</p>
