                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If during the inspection of a vessel, the vessel or its  equipment is found not to conform to the requirements of law or the  regulations in this subchapter, the marine inspector will   point out deficiencies observed and discuss all requirements with the  owner, managing operator, or a representative thereof. Normally, the  marine inspector will list all such requirements that have not been  completed and present the list to the owner, managing operator, or a  representative thereof. However, when a deficiency presents a serious  safety hazard to the vessel or its passengers or crew, and exists  through negligence or willful noncompliance, the marine inspector may  issue a Report of Violation (ROV) to the owner, managing operator, or a  representative thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In any case where further clarification of or reconsideration of  any requirement placed against the vessel is desired, the owner,  managing operator, or a representative thereof, may discuss the matter  with the cognizant OCMI.
