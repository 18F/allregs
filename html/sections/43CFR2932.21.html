                            <p class="depth0">If you wish to apply for a Special Recreation Permit, we strongly  urge you to contact the appropriate BLM office before submitting your  application. You may need early consultation to become familiar with BLM  practices and responsibilities, and the terms and conditions that we may  require in a Special Recreation Permit. Because of the lead time  involved in processing Special Recreation Permit applications, you  should contact BLM in sufficient time to complete a permit application  ahead of the 180 day requirement (see Sec. 2932.22(a)).</p>
