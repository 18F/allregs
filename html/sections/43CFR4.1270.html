Sec. 4.1273  through 4.1275 are applicable, and the Board must use the point system  and conversion table contained in 30 CFR part 723 or 845 in  recalculating assessments. However, the Board has the same authority to  waive the civil penalty formula as that granted to administrative law  judges in Sec. 4.1157(b)(1). If the petition is denied, the decision of  the administrative law judge is final for the Department, subject to  Sec. 4.5.
