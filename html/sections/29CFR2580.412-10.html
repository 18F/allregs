                                Sec. 2580.412-10  Individual or schedule or blanket form of bonds.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Section 13 provides that ``any bond shall be in a form or of a type  approved by the Secretary, including individual bonds or schedule or  blanket forms of bonds which cover a group or class''. Any form of bond  which may be described as individual, schedule or blanket in form or any  combination of such forms of bonds shall be acceptable to meet the  requirements of section 13, provided that in each case, the form of the  bond, in its particular clauses and application, is not inconsistent  with meeting the substantive requirements of the statute for the persons  and plan involved and with meeting the specific requirements of the  regulations in this part. Basic types of bonds in general usage are:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Individual bond. Covers a named individual in a stated penalty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Name schedule bond. Covers a number of named individuals in the  respective amounts set opposite their names.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Position schedule bond. Covers each of the occupants of  positions listed in the schedule in the respective amounts set opposite  such positions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Blanket bonds. Cover all the insured's officers and employees  with no schedule or list of those covered being necessary and with all  new officers and   employees bonded automatically, in a blanket penalty which takes two  forms--an aggregate penalty bond and a multiple penalty bond which are  described below:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The aggregate penalty blanket bond such as the Commercial  Blanket Bond; the amount of the bond is available for dishonesty losses  caused by persons covered thereunder or losses in which such person is  concerned or implicated. Payment of loss on account of any such person  does not reduce the amount of coverage available for losses other than  those caused by such person or in which he was concerned or implicated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The multiple penalty bond such as the Blanket Position Bond  giving separate coverage on each person for a uniform amount--the net  effect being the same as though a separate bond were issued on each  person covered thereunder and all of such bonds being for a uniform  amount.</p><p class="depth3">Note: For the purpose of section 13, blanket bonds which are either  aggregate penalty or multiple penalty in form shall be permissible if  they otherwise meet the requirements of the Act and the regulations in  this part.   Bonding, to the extent required, of persons indirectly employed, or  otherwise delegated, to perform functions for the plan which are  normally performed by ``administrators, officers, or employees'' as  described in Sec. 2580.412-3(d) may be accomplished either by including  them under individual or schedule bonds or other forms of bonds meeting  the requirements of the Act, or naming them in what is known under  general trade usage as an ``Agents Rider'' attached to a Blanket Bond.</p>
