                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> CMS establishes payment amounts for specific categories of  covered hospice care.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payment amounts are determined within each of the following  categories:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Routine home care day. A routine home care day is a day on which  an individual who has elected to receive hospice care is at home and is  not receiving continuous care as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Service intensity add-on. Routine home care days that occur  during the last 7 days of a hospice election ending with a patient  discharged due to death are eligible for a service intensity add-on  payment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The service intensity add-on payment shall be equal to the  continuous home care hourly payment rate, as described in paragraph  (e)(4) of this section, multiplied by the amount of direct patient care  actually provided by a RN and/or social worker, up to 4 hours total per  day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Continuous home care day. A continuous home care day is a day on  which an individual who has elected to receive hospice care is not in an  inpatient facility and receives hospice care consisting predominantly of  nursing   care on a continuous basis at home. Home health aide (also known as a  hospice aide) or homemaker services or both may also be provided on a  continuous basis. Continuous home care is only furnished during brief  periods of crisis as described in Sec. 418.204(a) and only as necessary  to maintain the terminally ill patient at home.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inpatient respite care day. An inpatient respite care day is a  day on which the individual who has elected hospice care receives care  in an approved facility on a short-term basis for respite.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> General inpatient care day. A general inpatient care day is a  day on which an individual who has elected hospice care receives general  inpatient care in an inpatient facility for pain control or acute or  chronic symptom management which cannot be managed in other settings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The payment amounts for the categories of hospice care are fixed  payment rates that are established by CMS in accordance with the  procedures described in Sec. 418.306. Payment rates are determined for  the following categories:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Routine home care.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Continuous home care.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inpatient respite care.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> General inpatient care.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Medicare Administrative Contractor reimburses the hospice  its appropriate payment amount for each day for which an eligible  Medicare beneficiary is under the hospice's care.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effective December 8, 2003, if a hospice makes arrangements with  another hospice to provide services under the circumstances specified in  section 1861(dd)(5)(D) of the Act, the Medicare Administrative  Contractor reimburses the hospice for which the beneficiary has made an  election as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Medicare Administrative Contractor makes payment according  to the following procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Payment is made for only one of the categories of hospice care  described in Sec. 418.302(b) for any particular day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> On any day on which the beneficiary is not an inpatient, the  hospice is paid the routine home care rate, unless the patient receives  continuous care as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for a  period of at least 8 hours. In that case, a portion of the continuous  care day rate is paid in accordance with paragraph (e)(4) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The hospice payment on a continuous care day varies depending on  the number of hours of continuous services provided. The continuous home  care rate is divided by 24 to yield an hourly rate. The number of hours  of continuous care provided during a continuous home care day is then  multiplied by the hourly rate to yield the continuous home care payment  for that day. A minimum of 8 hours of care must be furnished on a  particular day to qualify for the continuous home care rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Subject to the limitations described in paragraph (f) of this  section, on any day on which the beneficiary is an inpatient in an  approved facility for inpatient care, the appropriate inpatient rate  (general or respite) is paid depending on the category of care  furnished. The inpatient rate (general or respite) is paid for the date  of admission and all subsequent inpatient days, except the day on which  the patient is discharged. For the day of discharge, the appropriate  home care rate is paid unless the patient dies as an inpatient. In the  case where the beneficiary is discharged deceased, the inpatient rate  (general or respite) is paid for the discharge day. Payment for  inpatient respite care is subject to the requirement that it may not be  provided consecutively for more than 5 days at a time. Payment for the  sixth and any subsequent day of respite care is made at the routine home  care rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Payment for inpatient care is limited as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The total payment to the hospice for inpatient care (general or  respite) is subject to a limitation that total inpatient care days for  Medicare patients not exceed 20 percent of the total days for which  these patients had elected hospice care.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At the end of a cap period, the Medicare Administrative  Contractor calculates a limitation on payment for inpatient care to  ensure that Medicare payment is not made for days of inpatient care in  excess of 20 percent of the total number of days of hospice care  furnished to Medicare patients. Only inpatient days that were provided  and billed as general inpatient or respite days are counted as inpatient  days when computing the inpatient cap.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the number of days of inpatient care furnished to Medicare  patients is equal to or less than 20 percent of the total days of  hospice care to Medicare patients, no adjustment is necessary. Overall  payments to a hospice are subject to the cap amount specified in  Sec. 418.309.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the number of days of inpatient care furnished to Medicare  patients exceeds 20 percent of the total days of hospice care to  Medicare patients, the total payment for inpatient care is determined in  accordance with the procedures specified in paragraph (f)(5) of this  section. That amount is compared to actual payments for inpatient care,  and any excess reimbursement must be refunded by the hospice. Overall  payments to the hospice are subject to the cap amount specified in  Sec. 418.309.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a hospice exceeds the number of inpatient care days described  in paragraph (f)(4), the total payment for inpatient care is determined  as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Calculate the ratio of the maximum number of allowable inpatient  days to the actual number of inpatient care days furnished by the  hospice to Medicare patients.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Multiply this ratio by the total reimbursement for inpatient  care made by the Medicare Administrative Contractor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Multiply the number of actual inpatient days in excess of the  limitation by the routine home care rate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Add the amounts calculated in paragraphs (f)(5)(ii) and (iii)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Payment for routine home care, continuous home care, general  inpatient care and inpatient respite care is made on the basis of the  geographic location where the services are provided.
