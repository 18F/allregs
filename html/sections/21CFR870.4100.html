                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. An extracorporeal circuit and accessories for long-term respiratory/cardiopulmonary support (6 hours) is a system of devices and accessories that provides assisted extracorporeal circulation and physiologic gas exchange of the patient's blood in patients with acute respiratory failure or acute cardiopulmonary failure, where other available treatment options have failed, and continued clinical deterioration is expected or the risk of death is imminent. The main devices and accessories of the system include, but are not limited to, the console (hardware), software, and disposables, including, but not limited to, an oxygenator, blood pump, heat exchanger, cannulae, tubing, filters, and other accessories (e.g., monitors, detectors, sensors, connectors).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification--Class II (special controls). The special controls for this device are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The technological characteristics of the device must ensure that the geometry and design parameters are consistent with the intended use, and that the devices and accessories in the circuit are compatible;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The devices and accessories in the circuit must be demonstrated to be biocompatible;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sterility and shelf-life testing must demonstrate the sterility of any patient-contacting devices and accessories in the circuit and the shelf life of these devices and accessories;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Non-clinical performance evaluation of the devices and accessories in the circuit must demonstrate substantial equivalence of the performance characteristics on the bench, mechanical integrity, electromagnetic compatibility (where applicable), software, durability, and reliability;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In vivo evaluation of the devices and accessories in the circuit must demonstrate their performance over the intended duration of use, including a detailed summary of the clinical evaluation pertinent to the use of the devices and accessories to demonstrate their effectiveness if a specific indication (patient population and/or condition) is identified; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Labeling must include a detailed summary of the non-clinical and in vivo evaluations pertinent to use of the devices and accessories in the circuit and adequate instructions with respect to anticoagulation, circuit setup, performance characteristics with respect to compatibility among different devices and accessories in the circuit, and maintenance during a procedure.
