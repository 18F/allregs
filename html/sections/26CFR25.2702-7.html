With respect to transfers to which section 2702 applied made prior to January 28, 1992, taxpayers may rely on any reasonable interpretation of the statutory provisions. For these purposes, the provisions of the proposed regulations and the final regulations are considered a reasonable interpretation of the statutory provisions. The fourth through eighth sentences of Sec. 25.2702-5(b)(1) and Sec. 25.2702-5(c)(9) apply with respect to trusts created after May 16, 1996. Section 25.2702-2(a)(5), the second and third sentences of Sec. 25.2702-2(a)(6), Sec. 25.2702-3(d)(2), the first two sentences of Sec. 25.2702-3(d)(4), the last sentence of Sec. 25.2702-3(e), Example 5, the last two sentences of Sec. 25.2702-3(e), Example 6, and Sec. 25.2702-3(e), Examples 8 and 9, apply for trusts created on or after July 26, 2004.
