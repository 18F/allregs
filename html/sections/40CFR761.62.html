Under some of these  provisions, it may not be necessary to determine the PCB concentration  or leaching characteristics of the PCB bulk product waste. When it is  necessary to analyze the waste to make either of these determinations,  use the applicable procedures in subpart R of this part to sample the  waste for analysis, unless EPA approves another sampling plan under  paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Performance-based disposal. Any person disposing of PCB bulk  product waste may do so as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In an incinerator approved under Sec. 761.70.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In a chemical waste landfill approved under Sec. 761.75.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In a hazardous waste landfill permitted by EPA under section  3004 of RCRA, or by a State authorized under section 3006 of RCRA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Under an alternate disposal approval under Sec. 761.60(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In accordance with the decontamination provisions of Sec.  761.79.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> In accordance with a TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval issued under  Sec. 761.77.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disposal in solid waste landfills. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any person may dispose of  the following PCB bulk product waste in a facility permitted, licensed,  or registered by a State as a municipal or non-municipal non-hazardous  waste landfill:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Plastics (such as plastic insulation from wire or cable; radio,  television and computer casings; vehicle parts; or furniture laminates);  preformed or molded rubber parts and components; applied dried paints,  varnishes, waxes or other similar coatings or sealants;   caulking; Galbestos; non-liquid building demolition debris; or non- liquid PCB bulk product waste from the shredding of automobiles or  household appliances from which PCB small capacitors have been removed  (shredder fluff).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Other PCB bulk product waste, sampled in accordance with the  protocols set out in subpart R of this part, that leaches PCBs at <10  [micro]g/L of water measured using a procedure used to simulate leachate  generation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any person may dispose of PCB bulk product waste other than  those materials meeting the conditions of paragraph (b)(1) of this  section, (e.g., paper or felt gaskets contaminated by liquid PCBs in a  facility that is permitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage  municipal solid waste subject to part 258 of this chapter or non- municipal non-hazardous waste subject to Sec.

The notice  shall state that the PCB bulk product waste may include components  containing PCBs at =50 ppm based on analysis of the waste in  the shipment or application of a general knowledge of the waste stream  (or similar material) which is known to contain PCBs at those levels,  and that the PCB bulk product waste is known or presumed to leach <10  [micro]g/L PCBs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any person disposing off-site of PCB bulk product waste  regulated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section at a waste management  facility not having a commercial PCB storage or disposal approval must  provide written notice to the facility a minimum of 15 days in advance  of the first shipment from the same disposal waste stream and with each  shipment thereafter. The notice shall state that the PCB bulk product  waste may include components containing PCBs at =50 ppm based  on analysis of the waste in the shipment or application of a general  knowledge of the waste stream (or similar material) which is known to  contain PCBs at those levels, and that the PCB bulk product waste is  known or presumed to leach =10 [micro]g/L PCBs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any person disposing of PCB bulk product waste must maintain a  written record of all sampling and analysis of PCBs or notifications  made under this paragraph for 3 years from the date of the waste's  generation.

Each application must contain information  indicating that, based on technical, environmental, or waste-specific  characteristics or considerations, the proposed sampling, disposal, or  storage methods or locations will not pose an unreasonable risk or  injury to health or the environment. EPA may request other information  that it believes necessary to evaluate the application. No person may  conduct sampling, disposal, or storage activities under this paragraph  prior to obtaining written approval by EPA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> EPA will issue a written decision on each application for a  risk-based sampling, disposal, or storage method   for PCB bulk product wastes. EPA will approve such an application if it  finds that the method will not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to  health or the environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disposal as daily landfill cover or roadbed. Bulk product waste  described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be disposed of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As daily landfill cover as long as the daily cover remains in  the landfill and is not released or dispersed by wind or other action;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under asphalt as part of a road bed.
