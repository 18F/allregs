Hydrophytic vegetation consists of plants growing in water or in a substrate that is at least periodically deficient in oxygen during a growing season as a result of excessive water content.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A plant shall be considered to be a plant species that occurs in wetland if such plant is listed in the National List of Plant Species that Occur in Wetlands. The publication may be obtained upon request from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at National Wetland Inventory, Monroe Bldg. Suite 101, 9720 Executive Center Drive, St. Petersburg, Florida 33702.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the purposes of the definition of ``wetland'' in Sec. 12.2 of this part, land shall be determined to have a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> NRCS determines through the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section that under normal circumstances such land supports a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation. The term ``normal circumstances'' refers to the soil and hydrologic conditions that are normally present, without regard to whether the vegetation has been removed; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the event the vegetation on such land has been altered or removed, NRCS will determine if a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation typically exists in the local area on the same hydric soil map unit under non-altered hydrologic conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The determination of prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation will be made in accordance with the current Federal wetland delineation methodology in use by NRCS at the time of the determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Mitigation wetlands. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, wetlands which are created in order to mitigate the loss of other wetlands as a result of irrigation, recreation, municipal water, flood control, or other similar projects shall not be considered to be artificial wetland for the purposes of Sec. 12.5(b)(1)(vii)(A) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Minimal effect determination. For the purposes of Sec. 12.5(b)(1)(v) of this part, NRCS shall determine whether the effect of any action of a person associated with the conversion of a wetland, the conversion of wetland and the production of an agricultural commodity on converted wetland, or the combined effect of the production of an agricultural commodity on a wetland

converted by someone else has a minimal effect on the functions and values of wetlands in the area. Such determination shall be based upon a functional assessment of functions and values of the wetland under consideration and other related wetlands in the area, and will be made through an on-site evaluation. A request for such determination will be made prior to the beginning of activities that would convert the wetland. If a person has converted a wetland and then seeks a determination that the effect of such conversion on wetland was minimal, the burden will be upon the person to demonstrate to the satisfaction of NRCS that the effect was minimal.
The production of an agricultural commodity on any portion of a converted wetland in conformance with a minimal-effect determination by NRCS is exempt under Sec. 12.5(b)(1)(v) of this part. However, any additional action of a person that will change the functions and values of a wetland for which a minimal-effect determination has been made shall be reported to NRCS for a determination of whether the effect continues to be minimal. The loss of a minimal effect determination will cause a person who produces an agricultural commodity on the converted wetland after such change in status to be ineligible, under Sec. 12.4, for certain program benefits. In situations where the wetland values, acreage, and functions are replaced by the restoration, enhancement or creation of a wetland in accordance with a mitigation plan approved by NRCS, the exemption provided by the determination will be effective after NRCS determines that all practices in a mitigation plan are being implemented.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Categorical Minimal Effect Exemptions. (1) The state conservationist, in consultation with the state technical committee established under 16 U.S.C. 3861, shall identify any categories of conversion activities and conditions which are routinely determined by NRCS to have minimal effect on wetland functions and values, as described in paragraph (d) of this section, and recommend to the Chief, NRCS, or a designee, inclusion on a list of categorical minimal effect exemptions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The state conservationist, in consultation with the state technical committee established under 16 U.S.C. 3861, shall identify any categories of conversion activities and conditions which are routinely determined by NRCS to have minimal effect on wetland functions and values, as described in paragraph (d) of this section, and recommend to the Chief, NRCS, or a designee, inclusion on a list of categorical minimal effect exemptions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Chief, or designee, shall evaluate the conversion practices recommended by the state conservationists in the region to ensure consistency across State and regional lines, and to determine whether any categories of conversion activities identified pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if such activities were exempt from the ineligibility provisions of Sec. 12.4, would only have a minimal effect on wetland functions and values in a wetland system within the region.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any categories of conversion activities which meet the criteria of paragraph (e)(2) of this section will be published in the Federal Register for inclusion in this part and shall be exempt under Sec. 12.5(b)(1)(v) of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The NRCS local field office shall maintain a list of any activities and conditions which are determined by the Chief, or designee, exempt pursuant to this section and will provide the list to a person upon request.
