                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The information required to be included in the quarterly report may be presented in any format deemed suitable by the institution, except as otherwise required by this section. The report must be organized in an easily understandable format and not presented in a manner that is misleading.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rules for condensation. For purposes of this section, major captions to be provided in the financial statements are the same as those provided in the financial statements contained in the institution's annual report to shareholders, except that the financial statements included in the quarterly report may be condensed into major captions in accordance with the rules prescribed under this paragraph. If any amount that would otherwise be required to be shown by this subpart with respect to any item is not material, it need not be separately shown. The combination of insignificant items is permitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interim balance sheets. When any major balance sheet caption is less than 10 percent of total assets and the amount in the caption has not increased or decreased by more than 25 percent since the end of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interim statements of income. When any major income statement caption is less than 15 percent of average net income for the 3 most recent fiscal years and the amount in the caption has not increased or decreased by more than 20 percent since the corresponding interim period of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others. In calculating average net income, loss years should be excluded. If losses were incurred in each of the 3 most recent fiscal years, the average loss shall be used for purposes of this test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The interim financial information shall include disclosure either on the face of the financial statements or in accompanying footnotes sufficient to make the interim information presented not misleading. Institutions may presume that users of the interim financial information have read or have access to the audited financial statements for the preceding fiscal year and the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context. Accordingly, footnote disclosure that would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the most recent audited financial statements (such as a statement of significant accounting policies and practices), and details of accounts that have not changed significantly in amount or composition since the end of the most recent completed fiscal year may be omitted. However, disclosure shall be provided of events occurring subsequent to the end of the most recent fiscal year that have a material impact on the institution. Disclosures should encompass, for example, significant changes since the end of the most recently completed fiscal year in such items as accounting principles and practices; estimates inherent in the preparation of financial statements; status of long-term contracts; capitalization, including significant new indebtedness or modification of existing financing agreements; and the reporting entity resulting from business combinations or dispositions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The interim financial statements furnished shall reflect all adjustments that are, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. A statement to that effect shall be included. Furnish any material information necessary to make the information called for not misleading, such as a statement that the results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Required content. A quarterly report must, at a minimum, contain the following items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Discuss material changes, if any, to the information provided to shareholders pursuant to Sec. 620.5(g) that have occurred during the periods specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. Such additional information as is needed to enable the reader to assess material changes in financial

condition and results of operations between the periods specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section shall be provided.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Material changes in financial condition. Discuss any material changes in financial condition from the end of the preceding fiscal year to the date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided. If the interim financial statements include an interim balance sheet as of the corresponding interim date of the preceding fiscal year, any material changes in financial conditions from that date to the date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided also shall be discussed. If discussions of changes from both the end and the corresponding interim date of the preceding fiscal year are required, the discussions may be combined at the discretion of the institution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Material changes in results of operations. Discuss any material changes in the institution's results of operations with respect to the most recent fiscal year-to-date period for which an income statement is provided and the corresponding year-to-date period of the preceding fiscal year. Such discussion also shall cover material changes with respect to that fiscal quarter and the corresponding fiscal quarter in the preceding fiscal year. In addition, if the institution has elected to provide an income statement for the 12-month period ended as of the date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided, the discussion also shall cover material changes with respect to that 12-month period and the 12-month period ended as of the corresponding interim balance sheet date of the preceding fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interim financial statements. The following financial statements must be provided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An interim balance sheet as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter and as of the end of the preceding fiscal year. A balance sheet for the comparable quarter of the preceding fiscal year is optional.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Interim statements of income for the most recent fiscal quarter, for the period between the end of the preceding fiscal year and the end of the most recent fiscal quarter, and for the comparable periods for the previous fiscal year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Interim statements of changes in protected borrower capital and at-risk capital for the period between the end of the preceding fiscal year and the end of the most recent fiscal quarter, and for the comparable period for the preceding fiscal year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For banks, interim statements of cash flows for the period between the end of the preceding fiscal year and the end of the most recent fiscal quarter, and for the comparable period for the preceding fiscal year. For associations, interim statements of cash flows are optional.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other related financial items. State that the financial statements were prepared under the oversight of the audit committee. The interim financial information need not be audited or reviewed by a qualified public accountant or external auditor prior to filing. If, however, a review of the data is made in accordance with the established professional standards and procedures for such a review, the institution may state that a qualified public accountant or external auditor has performed such a review under the supervision of the institution's audit committee. If such a statement is made, the report of a qualified public accountant or external auditor on such review must accompany the interim financial information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notices. Institutions using the quarterly report to deliver any notice required under Sec. 620.15 must put the notice information at the beginning of the quarterly report. The notice must be conspicuous and may not be part of any footnotes to the quarterly report.
