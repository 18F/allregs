                            <p class="depth0">If you have property to replace which is eligible for exchange/sale,  you should first, to the maximum extent practicable, solicit:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Federal agencies known to use or distribute such property. If a  Federal agency is interested in acquiring and paying for the property,  you should arrange for a reimbursable transfer. Reimbursable transfers  may also be conducted with the Senate, the House of   Representatives, the Architect of the Capitol and any activities under  the Architect's direction, the District of Columbia, and mixed-ownership  Government corporations. When conducting a reimbursable transfer, you  must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Do so under terms mutually agreeable to you and the recipient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Not require reimbursement of an amount greater than the  estimated fair market value of the transferred property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Apply the transfer proceeds in whole or part payment for  property acquired to replace the transferred property; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> State Agencies for Surplus Property (SASPs) known to have an  interest in acquiring such property. If a SASP is interested in  acquiring the property, you should consider selling it to the SASP by  negotiated sale at fixed price under the conditions specified at Sec.  102-38.125 of this title. The sales proceeds must be applied in whole or  part payment for property acquired to replace the transferred property.  [66 FR 48614, Sept. 21, 2001, as amended at 69 FR 11539, Mar. 11, 2004.
