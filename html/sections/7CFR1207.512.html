                            <p class="depth0">The assessment on each lot of potatoes produced in the 50 States of  the United States and handled shall be paid by the designated handler as  hereafter set forth.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(8)</em>, (b), and (c) of  this section, the designated handler shall be the first handler of such  potatoes. The first handler is the person who initially performs a  handler function as heretofore defined. Such person may be a fresh  shipper, processor, or other person who first places the potatoes in the  channels of commerce. A producer who grades, packs, or otherwise  performs handler functions thereby becomes a handler and as such assumes  first handler responsibilities under this part. The following examples  are provided to aid in identification of first handlers who are  designated handlers:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Producer delivers field-run potatoes of his own production to a  handler for preparation for market. The handler in this instance is the  designated handler, regardless of whether he subsequently handles such  potatoes for his own account or for the account of the producer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Producer delivers field-run potatoes of his own production to a  handler who takes title to such potatoes and places them in storage for  subsequent handling. The handler who purchases such potatoes from the  producer is the designated handler.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Producer delivers field-run potatoes to a commercial storage  facility for the purpose of holding such potatoes under his own account  for later sale. There is no designated handler in this instance since  such potatoes have not been handled as heretofore defined and no  assessment is due. The designated handler of such potatoes would be  identified on the basis of subsequent handling of such potatoes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Fresh shipper purchases a lot of potatoes from a producer, packs  a portion of such potatoes for fresh market, and delivers the balance to  a processor. The fresh shipper is the designated handler for all  potatoes in the lot.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Handler purchases potatoes from a producer's field or storage  for the purpose of preparing such potatoes for market or for  transporting such potatoes to storage for subsequent handling. The  handler who purchases such potatoes from the producer is the designated  handler.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Producer packs and sells potatoes of his own production from the  field, roadside stand, or storage to a consumer, itinerant trucker, or  other buyer. In performing such handler functions the producer assumes  the responsibility of designated handler.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Processor utilizes potatoes of his own production in the  manufacture of potato chips, frozen, dehydrated, or canned products for  human consumption. In so handling potatoes, the processor assumes the  responsibility of designated handler.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Producer utilizes potatoes of his own production for seed in  planting his subsequent crop. Such seed potatoes do not enter the  current of commerce; there is no designated handler in this instance  since the potatoes have not been handled as heretofore defined and no  assessment is due. However, seed potatoes sold or shipped to other  producers for planting or to other persons for subsequent disposition  enter the current of commerce and are subject to assessment. The  producer of seed potatoes shall be the designated handler of such  potatoes shipped to other producers for planting and the assessment is  due when he first sells or otherwise handles such potatoes. The first  person who acquires seed potatoes from the producer thereof for  subsequent disposition other than planting by said person shall be the  designated handler of such potatoes. However, the seed producer will be  the designated handler responsible for filing reports and making  payments, unless he can show that the first person who obtained the  potatoes from him disposed of them other than by planting. To show this  the seed producer must submit to the Potato Board the name and address  of the first person who obtained the potatoes from him and an invoice of  sale or settlement sheet on which it is indicated that such person will  be the designated handler and therefore will be responsible for the  payment of the assessments. Only by showing this is the seed producer no  longer considered the designated handler and therefore not liable for  the assessments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any person who handles potatoes for a producer thereof under  oral or written contract or agreement providing for the sale thereof  shall be the designated handler for such potatoes,   notwithstanding the fact that the producer may have graded, packed, or  otherwise handled such potatoes and thereby became the first handler of  such potatoes.</p><p class="depth2">Examples. A cooperative marketing association, or other person, who  makes an accounting to the producer, or pay the proceeds of the sale to  the producer would be the designated handler responsible for the  assessment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any processor who purchases potatoes from the producer thereof  shall be the designated handler even though the producer may have  graded, packed, or otherwise handled such potatoes and thereby became  the first handler of such potatoes.
