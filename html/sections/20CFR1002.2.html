                                Sec. 1002.2  Is USERRA a new law?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">USERRA is the latest in a series of laws protecting veterans'  employment and reemployment rights going back to the Selective Training  and Service Act of 1940. USERRA's immediate predecessor was commonly  referred to as the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act (VRRA), which was  enacted as section 404 of the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment  Assistance Act of 1974. In enacting USERRA, Congress emphasized USERRA's  continuity with the VRRA and its intention to clarify and strengthen  that law. Congress also emphasized that Federal laws protecting  veterans' employment and reemployment rights for the past fifty years  had been successful and that the large body of case law that had  developed under those statutes remained in full force and effect, to the  extent it is consistent with USERRA. USERRA authorized the Department of  Labor to publish regulations implementing the Act for State, local  government, and private employers. USERRA also authorized the Office of  Personnel Management to issue regulations implementing the Act for  Federal executive agencies (other than some Federal intelligence  agencies). USERRA established a separate program for employees of some  Federal intelligence agencies.</p>
