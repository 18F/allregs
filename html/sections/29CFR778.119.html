                            <p class="depth0">If the calculation and payment of the commission cannot be completed  until sometime after the regular pay day for the workweek, the employer  may disregard the commission in computing the regular hourly rate until  the amount of commission can be ascertained. Until that is done he may  pay compensation for overtime at a rate not less than one and one-half  times the hourly rate paid the employee, exclusive of the commission.  When the commission can be computed and paid, additional overtime  compensation due by reason of the inclusion of the commission in the  employee's regular rate must also be paid. To compute this additional  overtime compensation, it is necessary, as a general rule, that the  commission be apportioned back over the workweeks of the period during  which it was earned. The employee must then receive additional overtime  compensation for each week   during the period in which he worked in excess of the applicable maximum  hours standard. The additional compensation for that workweek must be  not less than one-half of the increase in the hourly rate of pay  attributable to the commission for that week multipled by the number of  hours worked in excess of the applicable maximum hours standard in that  workweek.</p>
