                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> During the conduct of investigations, MPI will identify  themselves by presenting their credentials and referring to themselves  as ``INVESTIGATOR.'' When signing military police   records the title ``Military Police Investigator'' may be used in lieu  of military titles. Civilian personnel will refer to themselves as  ``INVESTIGATOR'' if they are classified in the 1811 series, and as  ``DETECTIVE'' if they are in the 083 series. Civilian personnel will use  the title ``DAC Investigator'' or ``DAC Detective''; corresponding to  their classification series.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The use of titles such as ``Mr.'', ``Mrs.'', ``Miss'' or ``Ms.''  in connection with an individual's identification as an MPI is  prohibited, except when employed in a covert investigative role. When  MPI or DAC detectives/investigators are employed in covert roles,  supervisors will ensure that coordination with USACIDC or civilian law  enforcement agencies is accomplished as appropriate.</p>
