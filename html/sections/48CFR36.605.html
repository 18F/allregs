                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An independent Government estimate of the cost of architect- engineer services shall be prepared and furnished to the contracting  officer before commencing negotiations for each proposed contract or  contract modification expected to exceed the simplified acquisition  threshold. The estimate shall be prepared on the basis of a detailed  analysis of the required work as though the Government were submitting a  proposal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Access to information concerning the Government estimate shall  be limited to Government personnel whose official duties require  knowledge of the estimate. An exception to this rule may be made during  contract negotiations to allow the contracting officer to identify a  specialized task and disclose the associated cost breakdown figures in  the Government estimate, but only to the extent deemed necessary to  arrive at a fair and reasonable price. The overall amount of the  Government's estimate shall not be disclosed except as permitted by  agency regulations.
