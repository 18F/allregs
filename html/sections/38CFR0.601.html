                            <p class="depth0">VA's Core Values define VA employees. They describe the  organization's culture and character, and serve as the foundation for  the way VA employees should interact with each other, as well as with  people outside the organization. They also serve as a common bond  between all employees regardless of their grade, specialty area, or  location. These Core Values are Integrity, Commitment, Advocacy,  Respect, and Excellence. Together, the first letters of the Core Values  spell ``I CARE,'' and VA employees should adopt this motto and these  Core Values in their day-to-day operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Integrity. VA employees will act with high moral principle,  adhere to the highest professional standards, and maintain the trust and  confidence of all with whom they engage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Commitment. VA employees will work diligently to serve veterans  and other beneficiaries, be driven by an earnest belief in VA's mission,  and fulfill their individual responsibilities and organizational  responsibilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Advocacy. VA employees will be truly veteran-centric by  identifying, fully considering, and appropriately advancing the  interests of veterans and other beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Respect.
