This  part also implements section 109 of the Housing and Community  Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5309). This part does not  effectuate section 504 as it applies to any program or activity  conducted by the Department. Compliance with this part does not assure  compliance with requirements for accessibility by physically-handicapped  persons imposed under the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C.  4151-4157; 24 CFR part 40).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The policies and standards for compliance established by this  part are established in contemplation of, and with a view to enforcement  through, the Department's administration of programs or activities  receiving Federal financial assistance and the administrative procedures  described in subparts D and E (including, without limitation, judicial  enforcement under Sec. 8.57(a)).</p>
