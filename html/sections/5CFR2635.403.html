                            <p class="depth0">An employee shall not acquire or hold any financial interest that he  is prohibited from acquiring or holding by statute, by agency regulation  issued in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section or by reason of  an agency   determination of substantial conflict under paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0">Note: There is no statute of Governmentwide applicability  prohibiting employees from holding or acquiring any financial interest.  Statutory restrictions, if any, are contained in agency statutes which,  in some cases, may be implemented by agency regulations issued  independent of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agency regulation prohibiting certain financial interests. An  agency may, by supplemental agency regulation issued after February 3,  1993, prohibit or restrict the acquisition or holding of a financial  interest or a class of financial interests by agency employees, or any  category of agency employees, and the spouses and minor children of  those employees, based on the agency's determination that the  acquisition or holding of such financial interests would cause a  reasonable person to question the impartiality and objectivity with  which agency programs are administered. Where the agency restricts or  prohibits the holding of certain financial interests by its employees'  spouses or minor children, any such prohibition or restriction shall be  based on a determination that there is a direct and appropriate nexus  between the prohibition or restriction as applied to spouses and minor  children and the efficiency of the service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agency determination of substantial conflict. An agency may  prohibit or restrict an individual employee from acquiring or holding a  financial interest or a class of financial interests based upon the  agency designee's determination that the holding of such interest or  interests will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Require the employee's disqualification from matters so central  or critical to the performance of his official duties that the  employee's ability to perform the duties of his position would be  materially impaired; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adversely affect the efficient accomplishment of the agency's  mission because another employee cannot be readily assigned to perform  work from which the employee would be disqualified by reason of the  financial interest.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1: An Air Force employee who owns stock in a major aircraft  engine manufacturer is being considered for promotion to a position that  involves responsibility for development of a new fighter airplane. If  the agency determined that engineering and other decisions about the Air  Force's requirements for the fighter would directly and predictably  affect his financial interests, the employee could not, by virtue of 18  U.S.C. 208(a), perform these significant duties of the position while  retaining his stock in the company. The agency can require the employee  to sell his stock as a condition of being selected for the position  rather than allowing him to disqualify himself in particular matters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definition of financial interest. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the term  financial interest is limited to financial interests that are owned by  the employee or by the employee's spouse or minor children. However, the  term is not limited to only those financial interests that would be  disqualifying under 18 U.S.C. 208(a) and Sec. 2635.402. The term  includes any current or contingent ownership, equity, or security  interest in real or personal property or a business and may include an  indebtedness or compensated employment relationship. It thus includes,  for example, interests in the nature of stocks, bonds, partnership  interests, fee and leasehold interests, mineral and other property  rights, deeds of trust, and liens, and extends to any right to purchase  or acquire any such interest, such as a stock option or commodity  future. It does not include a future interest created by someone other  than the employee, his spouse, or dependent child or any right as a  beneficiary of an estate that has not been settled.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1: A regulatory agency has concluded that ownership by its  employees of stock in entities regulated by the agency would  significantly diminish public confidence in the agency's performance of  its regulatory functions and thereby interfere with the accomplishment  of its mission. In its supplemental agency regulations, the agency may  prohibit its employees from acquiring or continuing to hold stock in  regulated entities.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2: An agency that insures bank deposits may, by supplemental  agency regulation, prohibit its employees who are bank examiners from  obtaining loans from banks they examine. Examination of a member bank  could have no effect on an employee's fixed obligation to repay a loan  from that bank and, thus, would not affect an employee's financial  interests so as to require disqualification under Sec. 2635.402.  Nevertheless, a   loan from a member bank is a discrete financial interest within the  meaning of Sec. 2635.403(c) that may, when appropriate, be prohibited by  supplemental agency regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> (iii) or  (iv).</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. The Foundation for the Preservation of Wild Horses  maintains herds of horses that graze on public and private lands.  Because its costs are affected by Federal policies regarding grazing  permits, the Foundation routinely comments on all proposed rules  governing use of Federal grasslands issued by the Bureau of Land  Management. BLM may require an employee to resign his uncompensated  position as Vice President of the Foundation as a condition of his  promotion to a policy-level position within the Bureau rather than  allowing him to rely on disqualification in particular cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reasonable period to divest or terminate. Whenever an agency  directs divestiture of a financial interest under paragraph (a) or (b)  of this section, the employee shall be given a reasonable period of  time, considering the nature of his particular duties and the nature and  marketability of the interest, within which to comply with the agency's  direction. Except in cases of unusual hardship, as determined by the  agency, a reasonable period shall not exceed 90 days from the date  divestiture is first directed. However, as long as the employee  continues to hold the financial interest, he remains subject to any  restrictions imposed by this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Eligibility for special tax treatment. An employee required to  sell or otherwise divest a financial interest may be eligible to defer  the tax consequences of divestiture under subpart J of part 2634 of this  chapter.  [57 FR 35042, Aug. 7, 1992, as amended at 59 FR 4780, Feb. 2, 1994; 60  FR 6391, Feb. 2, 1995; 60 FR 66858, Dec. 27, 1995; 61 FR 40951, Aug. 7,  1996; 62 FR 48748, Sept. 17, 1996]</p>
