                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Publication of notice in the FR. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A SORN shall be published  in the FR of any record system meeting the definition of a SOR, as  defined by 5 U.S.C. 552a.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> System Managers shall submit notices for new or revised SORNs  through their Director to the Chief of the OIP   for review at least 90 working days prior to implementation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Chief of the OIP shall forward complete SORNs to the Defense  Privacy and Civil Liberties Office (DPCLO), or the respective service  that has the statutory authority to publish the SORN, for review and  publication in the FR in accordance with 32 CFR part 310, subpart G.  Following the OMB comment period, the public is given 30 days to submit  written data, views, or arguments for consideration before a SOR is  established or modified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Access to Systems of Records Information. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As provided by 5  U.S.C. 552a, records shall be disclosed to the individual they pertain  to and under whose individual name or identifier they are filed, unless  exempted by the provisions in 32 CFR part 310, subpart F, and Sec. 329.7  of this part. If an individual is accompanied by a third party, or  requests a release to a third party, the individual shall be required to  furnish a signed access authorization granting the third party access  conditions according to 32 CFR part 310, subpart D.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Individuals seeking access to records that pertain to  themselves, and that are filed by their name or other personal  identifier, may submit the request in person, by mail, or by email. All  requests for access must be in accordance with these procedures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any individual making a request for access to records in person  shall show personal identification to the appropriate System Manager, as  identified in the SORN published in the FR, to verify his or her  identity, according to 32 CFR part 310, subpart D.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any individual making a request for access to records by mail  or email shall address such request to the System Manager. If the System  Manager is unknown, the individual may inquire to NGB-JA/OIP: AHS-Bldg  2, Suite T319B, 111 S. George Mason Drive, Arlington, VA 22204-1382, or  email ng.ncr.arng.mbx.ngb-privacy-office@mail  .mil for assistance in locating the System Manager.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Requests for access shall include a mailing address where the  records should be sent and include either a signed notarized statement  or a signed unsworn declaration to verify his or her identity to ensure  that they are seeking to access records about themselves and not,  inadvertently or intentionally, the records of others. The Privacy Act  (5 U.S.C. 552a) provides a penalty of a misdemeanor and a fine of not  more than $5,000 for any person who knowingly and willfully requests or  obtains any record concerning an individual from an agency under false  pretenses. If making a declaration, it shall read as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Inside the U.S.: ``I declare (or certify, verify, or state)  under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  Executed on (date). (Signature).''</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Outside the U.S.: ``I declare (or certify, verify, or state)  under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America  that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date).  (Signature).''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> All requests for records shall describe the record sought and  provide sufficient information to enable the records to be located (e.g.  identification of the SORN, approximate date the record was initiated,  originating organization, and type of document).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> All requesters shall comply with the procedures in 32 CFR part  310, subpart D for inspecting and/or obtaining copies of requested  records.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Requestors affiliated with the DoD may not use official  government supplies or equipment to include mailing addresses, work  phones/faxes, or DoD-issued email accounts to make requests. If requests  are received using DoD equipment, the requestor will be advised to make  a new request, using non-DoD equipment, and processing of their request  will begin only after such new request is received.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The System Manager shall mail a written acknowledgement of the  request for access to the individual within 10 working days of receipt.  The acknowledgement shall identify the request and may, if necessary,  request any additional information needed to access the record, advising  the requestor that they have 20 calendar days to reply. No  acknowledgement is necessary if the request can be reviewed and  processed, to include notification to the individual of a grant or  denial of access, within the 10 working   day period. Whenever practical, the decision to grant or deny access  shall be made within 30 working days. For requests presented in person,  written acknowledgement may be provided at the time the request is  presented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When a request for access is received, System Managers shall  promptly take one of three actions on requests to access records:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If no portions of the record are exempt, pursuant to the  published SORN, 32 CFR part 310, subpart F, and Sec. 329.7 of this part,  the request for access shall be granted and the individual will be  provided access to all records about him or her. If there is information  within the record not about the record subject (e.g. third party  information) that information will be removed and referred to the Chief  of the OIP for processing under 5 U.S.C. 552, pursuant to 32 CFR part  286.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the System Manager finds that the record, or portions of the  record, is exempt from access pursuant to the published SORN, 32 CFR  part 310, subpart F, and Sec. 329.7 of this part, they will refer the  recommended denial to the Chief of the OIP, through their Director,  within 10 working days of receipt. The referral will include the  following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Written recommendation for denial explaining which portion(s) of  the record should be exempt from access and a discussion for why the  record, or portions of the record, should be denied.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The record, or portions of the record, being recommended for  denial. If only portions of records are recommended for denial they must  be clearly marked or highlighted.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The original request and any correspondence with the requestor.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> A clean copy of the record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the request for access pertains to a record controlled and  maintained by another Federal agency, but in the temporary custody of  the NGB, the records are the property of the originating Component.  Access to these records is controlled by the system notice and rules for  the originating component/agency. Such requests shall be referred to the  originating component/agency and the requestor will be notified in  writing of the referral and contact information for the component/ agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Chief of the OIP will use the following procedures for  processing any recommended denials of access:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The specific reason for denial cited by the System Manager will  be evaluated and a recommendation will be presented to the denial  authority.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the request for access is denied, a written letter will be  sent to the requestor using procedures outlined in 32 CFR part 310,  subpart D. The requestor will be advised they have 60 calendar days to  appeal the decision to deny access. Appeals should be sent to: NGB Chief  Counsel, 1636 Defense Pentagon, Room 1D164, Washington, DC 20301-1636.  The requester must provide proof of identity or a sworn declaration with  their appeal, as outlined in 32 CFR part 310, subpart D.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the request for access should be granted, the access  request will be directed back to the System Manager to process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The Chief Counsel will use the following procedures for any  appeals received:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Chief Counsel will notify the Chief of the OIP that an  appeal has been received and will request the administrative record of  the initial denial.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Chief of the OIP will provide an exact copy of all records  from the initial denial to the Chief Counsel within 10 working days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Chief Counsel will review the appeal and make a final  determination on whether to grant or deny the appeal.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If the appellate authority denies the appeal, he or she will  provide a formal written notification to the requestor using the  procedures outlined in 32 CFR part 310, subpart D and will provide a  copy of the response to the Chief of the OIP.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the appellate authority grants the appeal, he or she will  notify the Chief of the OIP and the Directorate that recommended the  denial that the individual is being given access to the record. The  Chief Counsel will provide a subsequent notification to the requestor  advising that his or her appeal has been granted, and will provide the  requestor access to his or her record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> All appeals should be processed within 30 working days after  receipt by the Chief Counsel. If the Chief Counsel determines that a  fair and equitable review cannot be made within that time, the  individual shall be informed in writing of the reasons for the delay and  of the approximate date the review is expected to be completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> There is no requirement that an individual be given access to  records that are not in a group of records that meet the definition of a  SOR in 5 U.S.C. 552a.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> No verification of identity shall be required of an individual  seeking access to records that are otherwise available to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Individuals shall not be denied access to a record in a SOR  about themselves because those records are exempted from disclosure  under 32 CFR part 285. Individuals may only be denied access to a record  in a SOR about themselves when those records are exempted from the  access provisions of 32 CFR part 310, subpart F, and this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Individuals shall not be denied access to their records for  refusing to disclose their Social Security Number (SSN), unless  disclosure of the SSN is required by statute, by regulation adopted  before January 1, 1975, or if the record's filing identifier and only  means of retrieval is by the SSN (reference 5 U.S.C. 552a, note,  Executive Order 9397, as amended).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Access to Records or Information Compiled for Law Enforcement  Purposes. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All requests by individuals to access records about  themselves are processed under 5 U.S.C. 552, 5 U.S.C. 552a as well as 32  CFR part 286, 32 CFR part 310, subpart D to give requesters a greater  degree of access to records on themselves, regardless of which Act is  cited by the requestor for processing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Records (including those in the custody of law enforcement  activities) that have been incorporated into a SOR exempted from the  access conditions of 5 U.S.C. 552a and 32 CFR part 310, subpart D will  be processed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a, 32 CFR part 310, subpart  D, and this part. Individuals shall not be denied access to records  solely because they are in an exempt system. They will have the same  access that they would receive under 5 U.S.C. 552 and 32 CFR part 286.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Records systems exempted from access conditions will be  processed under 5 U.S.C. 552 and 32 CFR part 286, or 5 U.S.C. 552a and  32 CFR part 310, subpart D, depending upon which gives the greater  degree of access.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a non-law enforcement element has temporary custody of a  record otherwise exempted from access under 32 CFR part 310, subpart F  for the purpose of adjudication or personnel actions, they shall refer  any such access request, along with the records, to the originating  agency and notify the requestor of the referral.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Access to illegible, incomplete, or partially exempt records.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An individual shall not be denied access to his or her record or a  copy of the record solely because the physical condition or the format  of the record does not make it readily available (e.g. record is in a  deteriorated state or on a magnetic tape). The document will be prepared  as an extract, or it will be exactly recopied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a portion of the record contains information that is exempt  from access, an extract or summary containing all of the information in  the record that is releasable shall be prepared by the System Manager.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the physical condition of the record makes it necessary to  prepare an extract for release, the extract shall be prepared so that  the requestor will understand it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The requester shall be given access to any deletions or changes  to records that are accessible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Access to medical records. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Medical records and other  protected health information (PHI) shall be disclosed to the individual  pursuant to Chapter 11 of DoD 6025.18-R, DoD Health Information Privacy  Regulation (Available at  http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres  /pdf/602518r.pdf) and 32 CFR part 310, subpart D.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The individual may be charged reproduction fees for copies or  records as outlined in 32 CFR part 310, subpart D.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Amending and disputing personal information in systems of  records. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The System Manager shall allow individuals to request  amendments to the records covered by their system notice   to the extent that such records are not accurate, relevant, timely, or  complete. Amendments are limited to correcting factual matters and not  matters of official judgment, such as performance ratings, promotion  potential, and job performance appraisals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Individuals seeking amendment to records that pertain to  themselves, and that are filed or retrieved by their name or other  personal identifier, may submit a request for amendment in person, by  mail, or by email. All requests for amendment must be in accordance with  the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any individual making a request for amendment to records in  person shall show personal identification to the appropriate System  Manager, as identified in the SORN published in the FR, to verify his or  her identity, as outlined in 32 CFR part 310, subpart D.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any individual making a request for amendment to records by  mail or email shall address such request to the System Manager.
