                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any amount paid by FSA as a result of an approved loss claim is  immediately due and payable by the buyer after FSA notifies the buyer  that a loss claim has been paid to the seller. If the debt is not  restructured into a repayment plan or the obligation otherwise cured,  FSA may use all remedies available, including offset as authorized by  the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, to collect the debt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interest on the debt will be at the FLP non-program real  property loan rate in effect at the time of the first Agency payment of  a loss claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The debt may be scheduled for repayment consistent with the  buyer's repayment ability, not to exceed 7 years. Before any payment  plan can be approved, the buyer must provide the Agency with the best  lien obtainable on all of the buyer's assets. This includes the buyer's  ownership interest in the real estate under contract for guarantees  using the prompt payment guarantee plan. When the buyer is an entity,  the best lien obtainable will be taken on all of the entity's assets,  and all assets owned by individual members of the entity, including  their ownership interest in the real estate under contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Annually, buyers with an Agency approved repayment plan under  this section will supply the Agency a current balance sheet, income  statement, cash flow budget, complete copy of Federal income tax  returns, and any additional information needed to analyze the buyer's  financial condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of this chapter.</p>
