                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability and adoption of the citizen participation plan. (1) The jurisdiction is required to adopt a citizen participation plan that sets forth the jurisdiction's policies and procedures for citizen participation. (Where a jurisdiction, before February 6, 1995, adopted a citizen participation plan that complies with section 104(a)(3) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5304(A)(3)) but will need to amend the citizen participation plan to comply with provisions of this section, the citizen participation plan shall be amended by the first day of the jurisdiction's program year that begins on or after 180 days following February 6, 1995.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The jurisdiction is required to adopt a citizen participation plan that sets forth the jurisdiction's policies and procedures for citizen participation.

(i) The citizen participation plan must provide for and encourage citizens to participate in the development of any consolidated plan, any substantial amendment to the consolidated plan, and the performance report. These requirements are designed especially to encourage participation by low- and moderate-income persons, particularly those living in slum and blighted areas and in areas where CDBG funds are proposed to be used, and by residents of predominantly low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, as defined by the jurisdiction. A jurisdiction is also expected to take whatever actions are appropriate to encourage the participation of all its citizens, including minorities and non-English speaking persons, as well as persons with disabilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The citizen participation plan must provide for and encourage citizens to participate in the development of any consolidated plan, any substantial amendment to the consolidated plan, and the performance report.

The jurisdictions shall make an effort to provide information to the public housing agency (PHA) about consolidated plan activities related to its developments and surrounding communities so that the PHA can make this information available at the annual public hearing required for the PHA Plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The jurisdiction should explore alternative public involvement techniques and quantitative ways to measure efforts that encourage citizen participation in a shared vision for change in communities and neighborhoods,

and the review of program performance; e.g., use of focus groups and the Internet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Citizen comment on the citizen participation plan and amendments. The jurisdiction must provide citizens with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the original citizen participation plan and on substantial amendments to the citizen participation plan, and must make the citizen participation plan public. The citizen participation plan must be in a format accessible to persons with disabilities, upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Development of the consolidated plan. The citizen participation plan must include the following minimum requirements for the development of the consolidated plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The citizen participation plan must require that, before the jurisdiction adopts a consolidated plan, the jurisdiction will make available to citizens, public agencies, and other interested parties information that includes the amount of assistance the jurisdiction expects to receive (including grant funds and program income) and the range of activities that may be undertaken, including the estimated amount that will benefit persons of low- and moderate-income. The citizen participation plan also must set forth the jurisdiction's plans to minimize displacement of persons and to assist any persons displaced, specifying the types and levels of assistance the jurisdiction will make available (or require others to make available) to persons displaced, even if the jurisdiction expects no displacement to occur. The citizen participation plan must state when and how the jurisdiction will make this information available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The citizen participation plan must require the jurisdiction to publish the proposed consolidated plan in a manner that affords citizens, public agencies, and other interested parties a reasonable opportunity to examine its contents and to submit comments.

The requirement for publishing may be met by publishing a summary of the proposed consolidated plan in one or more newspapers of general circulation, and by making copies of the proposed consolidated plan available at libraries, government offices, and public places. The summary must describe the contents and purpose of the consolidated plan, and must include a list of the locations where copies of the entire proposed consolidated plan may be examined. In addition, the jurisdiction must provide a reasonable number of free copies of the plan to citizens and groups that request it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The citizen participation plan must provide for at least one public hearing during the development of the consolidated plan.

A summary of these comments or views, and a summary of any comments or views not accepted and the reasons therefor, shall be attached to the final consolidated plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amendments--(1) Criteria for amendment to consolidated plan. The citizen participation plan must specify the criteria the jurisdiction will use for determining what changes in the jurisdiction's planned or actual activities constitute a substantial amendment to the consolidated plan.

(1) The citizen participation plan must provide for at least two public hearings per year to obtain citizens' views and to respond to proposals and questions, to be conducted at a minimum of two different stages of the program year. Together, the hearings must address housing and community development needs, development of proposed activities, and review of program performance.

(Publishing small print notices in the newspaper a few days before the hearing does not constitute adequate notice. Although HUD is not specifying the length of notice required, it would consider two weeks adequate.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The citizen participation plan must provide that hearings be held at times and locations convenient to potential and actual beneficiaries, and with accommodation for persons with disabilities. The citizen participation plan must specify how it will meet these requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The citizen participation plan must identify how the needs of non-English speaking residents will be met in the case of public hearings where a significant number of non-English speaking residents can be reasonably expected to participate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Meetings.
