                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The USCG has the responsibility (1) to determine whether a USCG  permit is required for the improvement or construction of a bridge over  navigable waters except for the exemption exercised by FHWA in Sec.  650.805 and (2) to approve the bridge location, alignment   and appropriate navigational clearances in all bridge permit  applications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A USCG permit shall be required when a bridge crosses waters  which are: (1) tidal and used by recreational boating, fishing, and  other small vessels 21 feet or greater in length or (2) used or  susceptible to use in their natural condition or by reasonable  improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce. If  it is determined that a USCG permit is required, the project shall be  processed in accordance with the following procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The HA shall initiate coordination with the USCG at an early  stage of project development and provide opportunity for the USCG to be  involved throughout the environmental review process in accordance with  23 CFR part 771. The FHWA and Coast Guard have developed internal  guidelines which set forth coordination procedures that both agencies  have found useful in streamlining and expediting the permit approval  process. These guidelines include (1) USCG/FHWA Procedures for Handling  Projects which Require a USCG Permit \1\ and (2) the USCG/FHWA  Memorandum of Understanding on Coordinating The Preparation and  Processing of Environmental Projects. \2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ This document is an internal directive in the USCG Bridge  Administration Manual, Enclosure 1a, COMDT INST M16590.5, change 2 dated  Dec. 1, 1983. It is available for inspection and copying from the U.S.  Coast Guard or the Federal Highway Administration as prescribed in 49  CFR part 7, appendices B and D.</p><p class="depth2">\2\ FHWA Notice 6640.22 dated July 17, 1981, is available for  inspection and copying as prescribed in 49 CFR part 7, appendix D. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The HA shall accomplish sufficient preliminary design and  consultation during the environmental phase of project development to  investigate bridge concepts, including the feasibility of any proposed  movable bridges, the horizontal and vertical clearances that may be  required, and other location considerations which may affect navigation.  At least one fixed bridge alternative shall be included with any  proposal for a movable bridge to provide a comparative analysis of  engineering, social, economic and environmental benefit and impacts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The HA shall consider hydraulic, safety, environmental and  navigational needs along with highway costs when designing a proposed  navigable waterway crossing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For bridges where the risk of ship collision is significant,  HA's shall consider, in addition to USCG requirements, the need for pier  protection and warning systems as outlined in FHWA Technical Advisory  5140.19, Pier Protection and Warning Systems for Bridges Subject to Ship  Collisions, dated February 11, 1983.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Special navigational clearances shall normally not be provided  for accommodation of floating construction equipment of any type that is  not required for navigation channel maintenance. If the navigational  clearances are influenced by the needs of such equipment, the USCG  should be consulted to determine the appropriate clearances to be  provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> For projects which require FHWA approval of plans,  specifications and estimates, preliminary bridge plans shall be approved  at the appropriate level by FHWA for structural concepts, hydraulics,  and navigational clearances prior to submission of the permit  application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> If the HA bid plans contain alternative designs for the same  configuration (fixed or movable), the permit application shall be  prepared in sufficient detail so that all alternatives can be evaluated  by the USCG. If appropriate, the USCG will issue a permit for all  alternatives. Within 30 days after award of the construction contract,  the USCG shall be notified by the HA of the alternate which was  selected. The USCG procedure for evaluating permit applications which  contain alternates is presented in its Bridge Administration Manual  (COMDT INST M16590.5). \3\ The FHWA policy on alternates, Alternate  Design for Bridges; Policy Statement, was published at 48 FR 21409 on  May 12, 1983. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\3\ United States Coast Guard internal directives are available for  inspection and copying as prescribed in 49 CFR part 7, appendix B.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
