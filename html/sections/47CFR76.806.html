                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prior to termination of service, a customer may: install or provide for the installation of their own cable home wiring; or connect additional home wiring, splitters or other equipment within their premises to the wiring owned by the cable operator, so long as no electronic or physical harm is caused to the cable system and the physical integrity of the cable operator's wiring remains intact.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cable operators may require that home wiring (including passive splitters, connectors and other equipment used in the installation of home wiring) meets reasonable technical specifications, not to exceed the technical specifications of such equipment installed by the cable operator; provided however, that if electronic or physical harm is caused to the cable system, the cable operator may impose additional technical specifications to eliminate such harm. To the extent a customer's installations or rearrangements of wiring degrade the signal quality of or interfere with other customers' signals, or cause electronic or physical harm to the cable system, the cable operator may discontinue service to that subscriber until the degradation or interference is resolved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Customers shall not physically cut, substantially alter, improperly terminate or otherwise destroy cable operator-owned home wiring.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Section 76.806 shall apply to all MVPDs.
