If the person arranges to have the  auto dealer or other party provide   a notice described in Sec. 640.5(e), the person's obligation is  satisfied if the consumer receives a notice containing a credit score  obtained by the dealer or other party, even if a different credit score  is obtained and used by the person on whose behalf the notice is  provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Timing requirements for contemporaneous purchase credit. When  credit under an open-end credit plan is granted, extended, or provided  to a consumer in person or by telephone for the purpose of financing the  contemporaneous purchase of goods or services, any risk-based pricing  notice required to be provided pursuant to this part (or the disclosures  permitted under Sec. 640.5(e) or (f)) may be provided at the earlier  of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The time of the first mailing by the person to the consumer  after the decision is made to approve the grant, extension, or other  provision of open-end credit, such as in a mailing containing the  account agreement or a credit card; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Within 30 days after the decision to approve the grant,  extension, or other provision of credit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Multiple credit scores--(1) In general.

That person must disclose the low  score in the notices described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A person that uses consumer reports to set the material terms  of automobile loans granted, extended, or provided to consumers  regularly requests credit scores from several consumer reporting  agencies, each of which it uses in an underwriting program in order to  determine the material terms it will offer to the consumer.
