Determine the mass rate of fuels using the procedures for combustion  units in Sec. 98.34. No determination of the mass of steel output from  decarburization vessels is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(vi)</em> of this section as applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> ASTM C25-06, Standard Test Methods for Chemical Analysis of  Limestone, Quicklime, and Hydrated Lime (incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 98.7) for limestone, dolomite, and slag.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> ASTM D5373-08 Standard Test Methods for Instrumental  Determination of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Nitrogen in Laboratory Samples of  Coal (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7) for coal, coke, and  other carbonaceous materials.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> ASTM E1915-07a, Standard Test Methods for Analysis of Metal  Bearing Ores and Related Materials by Combustion Infrared-Absorption  Spectrometry (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7) for iron ore,  taconite pellets, and other iron-bearing materials.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> ASTM E1019-08, Standard Test Methods for Determination of  Carbon, Sulfur, Nitrogen, and Oxygen in Steel, Iron, Nickel, and Cobalt  Alloys by Various Combustion and Fusion Techniques (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 98.7) for iron and ferrous scrap.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> ASM CS-104 UNS No. G10460--Alloy Digest April 1985 (Carbon Steel  of Medium Carbon Content) (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7);  ISO/TR 15349-1:1998, Unalloyed steel--Determination of low carbon  content, Part 1: Infrared absorption method after combustion in an  electric resistance furnace (by peak separation) (1998-10-15) First  Edition (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7); or ISO/TR 15349- 3:1998, Unalloyed steel-Determination of low carbon content Part 3:  Infrared absorption method after combustion in an electric resistance  furnace (with preheating) (1998-10-15) First Edition (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 98.7) as applicable for steel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> For each process input that is a fuel, determine the carbon  content and molecular weight (if applicable) using the applicable  methods listed in Sec. 98.34.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For solid ferrous materials charged to basic oxygen process  furnaces or EAFs that differ in carbon content, you may determine a  weighted average carbon content based on the carbon content of each type  of ferrous material and the average weight percent of each type that is  used.
