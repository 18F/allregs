                                Sec. 404.1023  Ministers of churches and members of religious orders.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. If you are a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed  minister of a church, the work you do in the exercise of your ministry  is excluded from employment. However, it is treated as self-employment  for social security purposes. If you are a member of a religious order  who has not taken a vow of poverty, the same rule applies to the work  you do in the exercise of your duties required by that order. If you are  a member of a religious order who has taken a vow of poverty, the work  you do in the exercise of duties required by the order (the work may be  done for the order or for another employer) is covered as employment  only if the order or autonomous subdivision   of the order to which you belong has filed an effective election of  coverage. The election is made under section 3121(r) of the Code. For  the rules on self-employment coverage of ministers and members of  religious orders who have not taken vows of poverty, see Sec. 404.1071.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What is an ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister. The  terms ordained, commissioned, or licensed describe the procedures  followed by recognized churches or church denominations to vest  ministerial status upon qualified individuals. If a church or church  denomination has an ordination procedure, the commissioning or licensing  of a person as a minister may not make him or her a commissioned or  licensed minister for purposes of this subpart. Where there is an  ordination procedure, the commissioning or licensing must be recognized  as having the same effect as ordination and the person must be fully  qualified to exercise all of the ecclesiastical duties of the church or  church denomination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When is work by a minister in the exercise of the ministry. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  A minister is working in the exercise of the ministry when he or she  is--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ministering sacerdotal functions or conducting religious worship  (other than as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Working in the control, conduct, and maintenance of a religious  organization (including an integral agency of a religious organization)  under the authority of a religious body constituting a church or church  denomination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following rules are used to decide whether a minister's work  is in the exercise of the ministry:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the work is the conduct of religious worship or the  ministration of sacerdotal functions depends on the tenets and practices  of the religious body which is his or her church or church denomination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Work in the control, conduct, and maintenance relates to  directing, managing, or promoting the activities of the religious  organization. Any religious organization is considered to be under the  authority of a religious body constituting a church or church  denomination if it is organized and dedicated to carrying out the tenets  and principles of a faith according to either the requirements or  sanctions governing the creation of institutions of the faith.  The term religious organization has the same meaning and application as  is given to the term for income tax purposes under the Code.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a minister is working in the conduct of religious worship  or the ministration of sacerdotal functions, the work is in the exercise  of the ministry whether or not it is performed for a religious  organization. (See paragraph (d)(2) of this section for an exception to  this rule.)</p><p class="depth4">Example: M, a duly ordained minister, is engaged to work as chaplain  at a privately owned university. M spends his entire time working as  chaplain. This includes the conduct of religious worship, offering  spiritual counsel to the university students, and teaching a class in  religion. M is working in the exercise of the ministry.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If a minister is working for an organization which is operated  as an integral agency of a religious organization under the authority of  a religious body constituting a church or church denomination, all work  by the minister in the conduct of religious worship, in the ministration  of sacerdotal functions, or in the control, conduct, and maintenance of  the organization is in the exercise of the ministry.</p><p class="depth4">Example: M, a duly ordained minister, is engaged by the N Religious  Board as director of one of its departments. M performs no other  service. The N Religious Board is an integral agency of O, a religious  organization operating under the authority of a religious body  constituting a church denomination. M is working in the exercise of the  ministry.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If a minister, under an assignment or designation by a religious  body constituting a church, works for an organization which is neither a  religious organization nor operated as an integral agency of a religious  organization, all service performed by him or her, even though the  service may not involve the conduct of religious worship or the  ministration of sacerdotal functions, is in the exercise of the  ministry.</p><p class="depth4">Example: M, a duly ordained minister, is assigned by X, the  religious body constituting M's church, to perform advisory service to Y  company in connection with the publication   of a book dealing with the history of M's church denomination. Y is  neither a religious organization nor operated as an integral agency of a  religious organization. M performs no other service for X or Y. M is  working in the exercise of the ministry.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If a minister is working for an organization which is neither a  religious organization nor operated as an integral agency of a religious  organization and the work is not performed under an assignment or  designation by ecclesiastical superiors, then only the work done by the  minister in the conduct of religious worship or the ministration of  sacerdotal functions is in the exercise of the ministry. (See paragraph  (d)(2) of this section for an exception to this rule.)</p><p class="depth4">Example: M, a duly ordained minister, is engaged by N University to  teach history and mathematics. M does no other work for N although from  time to time M performs marriages and conducts funerals for relatives  and friends. N University is neither a religious organization nor  operated as an integral agency of a religious organization. M is not  working for N under an assignment by his ecclesiastical superiors. The  work performed by M for N University is not in the exercise of the  ministry. However, service performed by M in performing marriages and  conducting funerals is in the exercise of the ministry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When is work by a minister not in the exercise of the ministry.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Work performed by a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed  minister of a church which is not in the exercise of the ministry is not  excluded from employment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Work performed by a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed  minister of a church as an employee of the United States, or a State,  territory, or possession of the United States, or the District of  Columbia, or a foreign government, or a political subdivision of any of  these, is not in the exercise of the ministry, even though the work may  involve the ministration of sacerdotal functions or the conduct of  religious worship. For example, we consider service performed as a  chaplain in the Armed Forces of the United States to be work performed  by a commissioned officer and not by a minister in the exercise of the  ministry. Also, service performed by an employee of a State as a  chaplain in a State prison is considered to be performed by a civil  servant of the State and not by a minister in the exercise of the  ministry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Work in the exercise of duties required by a religious order.  Work performed by a member of a religious order in the exercise of  duties required by the order includes all duties required of the member  of the order. The nature or extent of the work is immaterial so long as  it is service which the member is directed or required to perform by the  member's ecclesiastical superiors.</p>
