                                Sec. 783.34  Employees aboard vessels who are not ``seamen''.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Concessionaires and their employees aboard a vessel ordinarily do  not perform their services subject to the authority, direction, and  control of the master of the vessel, except incidentally, and their  services are ordinarily not rendered primarily as an aid in the  operation of the vessel as a means of transportation. As a rule,  therefore, they are not employed as seamen for purposes of the Act.  Also, other employees working aboard vessels, whose service is not  rendered primarily as an aid to the operation of the vessel as a means  of transportation are not employed as seamen (Knudson v. Lee & Simmons,  Inc., 163 F. 2d 95; Walling v. Haden, 153 F. 2d 196, certiorari denied  32 U.S. 866). Thus, employees on floating equipment who are engaged in  the construction of docks, levees, revetments or other structures, and  employees engaged in dredging operations or in the digging or processing  of sand, gravel, or other materials are not employed as seamen within  the meaning of the Act but are engaged in performing essentially  industrial or excavation work (Sternberg Dredging Co. v. Walling, 158 F.  2d 678; Walling v. Haden, supra; Walling v. Bay State Dredging &  Contracting Co., 149 F. 2d 346; Walling v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock  Co., 149 F. 2d 9, certiorari denied 327 U.S. 722). Thus, ``captains''  and ``deck hands'' of launches whose dominant work was industrial  activity performed as an integrated part of harbor dredging operations  and not in furtherance of transportation have been held not to be  employed as seamen within the meaning of the Act (Cuascut v. Standard  Dredging Corp. 94 F. Supp. 197).</p>
