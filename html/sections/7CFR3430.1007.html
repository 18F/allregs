                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Required plan. The Centers and Subcenter shall jointly develop and submit to NIFA for approval a plan for addressing the bioenergy, biomass, and gasification research priorities of the Department and the Department of Energy at the State and regional levels. To comply with this requirement, NIFA requires that the proposals from each of the five Centers be of similar format and subject matter and complementary to comprise a national program for purposes of serving as the actual ``plan.'' Each proposal will present a plan that includes a description of what will be done in common and collectively by the Centers and Subcenter, what each will do as a Center and Subcenter, and how each Center and Subcenter will implement its regional competitive grants program. Proposals submitted to the Sun Grant Program must be sufficiently detailed and of high enough quality and demonstrate adequate evidence of collaboration to meet this requirement. Funds available for administrative costs (see Sec. 3430.1005(b)) may be used to meet this requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Gasification. With respect to gasification research activities, the Centers and Subcenter shall coordinate planning with land-grant colleges and universities in their respective regions that have ongoing research activities in that area.</p>
