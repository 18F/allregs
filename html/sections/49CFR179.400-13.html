The longitudinal acceleration may be reduced to 3``g'' where a cushioning device of approved design, which has been tested to demonstrate its ability to limit body forces to 400,000 pounds maximum at 10 miles per hour, is used between the coupler and the tank structure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The inner tank and outer jacket must be permanently bonded to each other electrically, by either the support system, piping, or a separate electrical connection of approved design.</p>
