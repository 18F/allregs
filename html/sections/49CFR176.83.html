                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. (1) The requirements of this section apply to all cargo spaces on deck or under deck of all types of vessels, and to all cargo transport units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The requirements of this section apply to all cargo spaces on deck or under deck of all types of vessels, and to all cargo transport units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Segregation is obtained by maintaining certain distances between incompatible hazardous materials or by requiring the presence of one or more steel bulkheads or decks between them

or a combination thereof. Intervening spaces between such hazardous materials may be filled with other cargo which is not incompatible with the hazardous materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The general requirements for segregation between the various classes of dangerous goods are shown in the segregation table. In addition to these general requirements, there may be a need to segregate a particular material from other materials which would contribute to its hazard. Such segregation requirements are indicated by code numbers in Column 10B of the Sec. 172.101 Table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Segregation is not required:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Between hazardous materials of different classes which comprise the same substance but vary only in their water content (for example, sodium sulfide in Division 4.2 or Class 8) or quantity for Class 7 materials; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Between hazardous materials of different classes which comprise a group of substances that do not react dangerously with each other. The following materials are grouped by compatibility:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Hydrogen peroxide, aqueous solutions with not less than 8 percent but less than 20 percent hydrogen peroxide (stabilized as necessary); Hydrogen peroxide, aqueous solutions with not less than 20 percent but not more than 40 percent hydrogen peroxide; Hydrogen peroxide, aqueous solutions with more than 40 percent but not more than 60 percent hydrogen peroxide; Hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacetic acid mixtures, stabilized with acids, water and not more than 5 percent peroxyacetic acid; Organic peroxide type D, liquid; Organic peroxide type E, liquid; Organic peroxide type F, liquid; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Dichlorosilane, Silicon tetrachloride, and Trichlorosilane.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Whenever hazardous materials are stowed together, whether or not in a cargo transport unit, the segregation of such hazardous materials from others must always be in accordance with the most restrictive requirements for any of the hazardous materials concerned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> When the Sec. 172.101 Table or Sec. 172.402 requires packages to bear a subsidiary hazard label or labels, the segregation appropriate to the subsidiary hazards must be applied when that segregation is more restrictive than that required by the primary hazard. For the purposes of this paragraph, the segregation requirements corresponding to an explosive subsidiary hazard are--except for organic peroxides which are those corresponding to Division 1.3--those for Division 1.4 (explosive) materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Where, for the purposes of segregation, terms such as ``away from'' a particular hazard class are used in the Sec. 172.101 Table, the segregation requirement applies to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All hazardous materials within the hazard class; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All hazardous materials for which a secondary hazard label of that class is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a)(6) and (a)(7) of this section, hazardous materials of the same class may be stowed together without regard to segregation required by secondary hazards (subsidiary risk label(s)), provided the substances do not react dangerously with each other and cause:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Combustion and/or evolution of considerable heat;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Evolution of flammable, toxic or asphyxiant gases;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The formation of corrosive substances; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The formation of unstable substances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Stowage in a shelter-'tween deck cargo space is not considered to be ``on deck'' stowage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Where the code in column (10B) of the Sec. 172.101 Table specifies that ``Segregation as for. . .'' applies, the segregation requirements applicable to that class in the Sec. 176.83(b) General Segregation Table must be applied. However, for the purposes of paragraph (a)(8) of this section, which permits substances of the same class to be stowed together provided they do not react dangerously with each other, the segregation requirements of the class as represented by the primary hazard class in the Sec. 172.101 Table entry must be applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Certain exceptions from segregation for waste cyanides or waste cyanide mixtures or solutions transported with acids; waste Division 4.2 materials transported with Class 8 liquids; and

waste Division 6.1 Packing Group I, Hazard Zone A material transported with waste Class 3 material, Class 8 liquids, and Division 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1 or 5.2 material are set forth in Sec. 173.12(e) of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General Segregation Table. The following table sets forth the general requirements for segregation between the various classes (divisions) of hazardous materials. Certain divisions are listed as separate hazard classes for the purpose of this table (e.g., ``2.1'' and ``2.2''). The properties of materials within each class may vary greatly and may require greater segregation than is reflected in this table. If the Sec. 172.101 Table sets forth particular requirements for segregation, they take precedence over these general requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Table 176.83(b)--General Segregation Requirements for Hazardous Materials</p><p class="depth0">[Segregation must also take account of a single secondary hazard label, as required by paragraph (a)(6) of this section.]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">1.1,</p><p class="depth0">Class                                 1.2, 1.5   1.3   1.4, 1.6   2.1    2.2    2.3     3     4.1    4.2    4.3    5.1    5.2    6.1    6.2     7      8      9------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Explosives, 1.1, 1.2, 1.5..........................................

The segregation groups (such as ``acids'', ``chlorates'', ``permanganates'') and the entries allocated to each of these groups include the substances identified in section 3.1.4 of the IMDG Code (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). When column (10B) of the Sec. 172.101 Table refers to a numbered stowage provision set forth in Sec. 176.84(b) such as ``Stow `away from' acids'', that particular stowage/segregation requirement applies to all the materials allocated to the respective segregation group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Not all hazardous materials falling within a segregation group are listed by name in the regulations. These materials are shipped under ``n.o.s.'' entries. Although these ``n.o.s.'' entries are not listed themselves in the above groups, the person who offers a hazardous material for transportation must decide whether allocation under a segregation group is appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The segregation groups described above do not address materials that fall outside the classification criteria of the hazardous materials regulations, although it is recognized that some non-hazardous materials have certain chemical properties similar to hazardous materials listed in the segregation groups. A person who offers a hazardous material for transportation or the person responsible for packing the materials into a cargo transport unit who does have knowledge of the chemical properties of such non-hazardous materials may identify a relevant segregation group and apply the segregation requirements for that segregation group.
