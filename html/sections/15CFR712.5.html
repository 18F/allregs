If you are not already a declared facility, you must complete an initial declaration (see Sec. 712.4 of the CWCR) 200 calendar days before commencing operations or increasing production which will result in production of more than 100 grams aggregate of Schedule 1 chemicals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Declaration forms to be used--(1) Initial declaration. (i) You must have completed the Certification Form, Form 1-1 and Form A if you produced at your facility in excess of 100 grams aggregate of Schedule 1 chemicals in calendar years 1997, 1998, or 1999. You must have provided a detailed current technical description of your facility or its relevant parts including a narrative statement, and a detailed diagram of the declared areas in the facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initial declaration.

You must have provided a detailed current technical description of your facility or its relevant parts including a narrative statement, and a detailed diagram of the declared areas in the facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you plan to change the technical description of your facility from your initial declaration completed and submitted pursuant to Sec. 712.3 or Sec. 712.4 of the CWCR, you must submit an amended initial declaration to BIS 200 calendar days prior to the change. Such amendments to your initial declaration must be made by completing a Certification Form, Form 1-1 and Form A, including the new description of the facility. See Sec. 712.7 of the CWCR for additional instructions on amending Schedule 1 declarations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Annual declaration on past activities. If you are subject to the declaration requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you must complete the Certification Form and Forms 1-1, 1-2, 1-2A, 1-2B, and Form A if your facility was involved in the production of Schedule 1 chemicals in the previous calendar year.

If you produced in excess of 100 grams aggregate of Schedule 1 chemicals in the previous calendar year, you must declare the entire quantity of such production, rounded to the nearest gram. You must also declare the quantity of any Schedule 1, Schedule 2 or Schedule 3 precursor used to produce the declared Schedule 1 chemical, rounded to

the nearest gram. You must further declare the quantity of each Schedule 1 chemical consumed or stored by, or domestically transferred from, your facility, whether or not the Schedule 1 chemical was produced by your facility, rounded to the nearest gram. In calculating the amount of Schedule 1 chemical you produced, consumed or stored, count only the amount of the Schedule 1 chemical(s) in a mixture, not the total weight of the mixture (i.e., do not count the weight of the solution, solvent, or container).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For the purpose of determining if a Schedule 1 chemical is subject to declaration, you must declare a Schedule 1 chemical that is an intermediate, but not a transient intermediate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> ``Declared'' Schedule 1 facilities and routine inspections. Only facilities that submitted a declaration pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section or Sec. 712.4 of the CWCR are considered ``declared'' Schedule 1 facilities. A ``declared'' Schedule 1 facility is subject to initial and routine inspection by the OPCW (see part 716 of the CWCR).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Approval of declared Schedule 1 production facilities. Facilities that submit declarations pursuant to this section are considered approved Schedule 1 production facilities for purposes of the CWC, unless otherwise notified by BIS within 30 days of receipt by BIS of an annual declaration on past activities or annual declaration on anticipated activities (see paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section). If your facility does not produce more than 100 grams aggregate of Schedule 1 chemicals, no approval by BIS is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Withdrawal of Schedule 1 initial declarations. A facility subject to Sec. Sec. 712.3, 712.4 and 712.5 of the CWCR may withdraw its initial declaration at any time by notifying BIS in writing. A notification requesting the withdrawal of the initial declaration should be sent on company letterhead to the address in Sec. 711.6 of the CWCR. BIS will acknowledge receipt of the withdrawal of the initial declaration. Facilities withdrawing their initial declaration may not produce subsequently in excess of 100 grams aggregate of Schedule 1 chemicals within a calendar year unless pursuant to Sec. 712.4.</p>
