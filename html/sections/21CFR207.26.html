A change in a registered establishment's firm  name within 6 months of the registration of the establishment is  required to be supported by a signed statement of the establishment's  owner or operator that the change is not made for the purpose   of changing the name of the manufacturer of a drug product under Sec.  201.1 of this chapter. Changes in the names of officers and directors of  the corporations do not require such amendment but must be shown at time  of annual registration.
