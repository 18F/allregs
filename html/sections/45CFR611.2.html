                            <p class="depth0">This part applies to any program for which Federal financial  assistance is authorized under a law administered by the Foundation,  including the types of Federal financial assistance listed in appendix A  of this part. It applies to money paid, property transferred, or other  Federal financial assistance extended after the effective date of the  regulation pursuant to an application approved prior to such effective  date. This part does not apply to (a) any Federal financial assistance  by way of insurance or guaranty contract, (b) money paid, property  transferred, or other assistance extended before the effective date of  this part, (c) any assistance to any individual who is the ultimate  beneficiary, or (d) any employment practice, under any such program, of  any employer, employment agency, or labor organization, except to the  extent described in Sec. 611.3. The fact that a type of Federal  financial assistance is not listed in the appendix shall not mean, if  title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that a program is not  covered. Other types of Federal financial assistance under statutes now  in force or hereafter enacted may be added to this list by notice  published in the Federal Register.
