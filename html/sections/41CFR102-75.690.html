                                Sec. 102-75.690  What happens if property that was transferred for States by reason of noncompliance with the terms or conditions of  disposal, or for other cause?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">DOI must notify the appropriate GSA regional office immediately by  letter when title to property transferred for use as a public park or  recreation area is to be revested in the United States for noncompliance  with the terms or conditions of disposal or for other cause. The  notification must cite the legal and administrative actions that DOI  must take to obtain full title and possession of the property. In  addition, it must include an adequate description of the property, using  the Report of Excess Real Property (Standard Form 118) and the  appropriate schedules. After receiving notice from DOI that title to the  property is proposed for revesting, GSA will review the statement and  determine if title should be revested. If GSA, in consultation with DOI,  determines that the property should be revested, DOI must submit a  Standard Form 118 to GSA. GSA will review and act upon the Standard Form  118, if acceptable. However, the grantee must provide protection and  maintenance for the property until the title reverts to the Federal  Government, including the period of any notice of intent to revert. Such  protection and maintenance must, at a minimum, conform to the standards  prescribed in the GSA Customer Guide to Real Property Disposal.</p><p class="depth0">Property for Displaced Persons</p>
