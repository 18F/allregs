In such cases, Federal agencies should consider  joint preparation or lead agency development of the consistency  determination. In either case, the consistency determination shall be  transmitted to the State agency at least 90 days before final decisions  are taken by any of the participating agencies and shall comply with the  requirements of Sec. 930.39.</p>
