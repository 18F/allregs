The false match rate is similar to the false accept (or acceptance) rate.</p><p class="depth0">False non-match rate means the rate at which a genuine user's biometric is falsely rejected when the user's biometric data fail to match the enrolled data for the user. It is one of the statistics used to measure biometric performance when operating in the verification or authentication task. The false match rate is similar to the false reject (or rejection) rate, except that it does not include the rate at which a biometric system fails to acquire a biometric sample from a genuine user.</p><p class="depth0">FIPS means Federal Information Processing Standards. These Federal standards, as incorporated by reference in Sec. 1311.08 of this chapter, prescribe specific performance requirements, practices, formats, communications protocols, etc., for hardware, software, data, etc.</p><p class="depth0">FIPS 140-2, as incorporated by reference in Sec. 1311.08 of this chapter, means the National Institute of Standards and Technology publication entitled ``Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules,'' a Federal standard for security requirements for cryptographic modules.</p><p class="depth0">FIPS 180-2, as incorporated by reference in Sec. 1311.08 of this chapter, means the National Institute of Standards and Technology publication entitled ``Secure Hash Standard,'' a Federal secure hash standard.</p><p class="depth0">FIPS 180-3, as incorporated by reference in Sec. 1311.08 of this chapter, means the National Institute of Standards and Technology publication entitled ``Secure Hash Standard (SHS),'' a Federal secure hash standard.</p><p class="depth0">FIPS 186-2, as incorporated by reference in Sec. 1311.08 of this chapter, means the National Institute of Standards and Technology publication entitled ``Digital Signature Standard,'' a Federal standard for applications used to generate and rely upon digital signatures.</p><p class="depth0">FIPS 186-3, as incorporated by reference in Sec. 1311.08 of this chapter, means the National Institute of Standards and Technology publication entitled ``Digital Signature Standard (DSS),'' a Federal standard for applications used to generate and rely upon digital signatures.</p><p class="depth0">Hard token means a cryptographic key stored on a special hardware device (e.g., a PDA, cell phone, smart card, USB drive, one-time password device)

rather than on a general purpose computer.</p><p class="depth0">Identity proofing means the process by which a credential service provider or certification authority validates sufficient information to uniquely identify a person.</p><p class="depth0">Installed electronic prescription application means software that is used to create electronic prescriptions and that is installed on a practitioner's computers and servers, where access and records are controlled by the practitioner.</p><p class="depth0">Installed pharmacy application means software that is used to process prescription information and that is installed on a pharmacy's computers or servers and is controlled by the pharmacy.</p><p class="depth0">Intermediary means any technology system that receives and transmits an electronic prescription between the practitioner and pharmacy.</p><p class="depth0">Key pair means two mathematically related keys having the properties that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> One key can be used to encrypt a message that can only be decrypted using the other key; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Even knowing one key, it is computationally infeasible to discover the other key.</p><p class="depth2">NIST means the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</p><p class="depth2">NIST SP 800-63-1, as incorporated by reference in Sec. 1311.08 of this chapter, means the National Institute of Standards and Technology publication entitled ``Electronic Authentication Guideline,'' a Federal standard for electronic authentication.</p><p class="depth2">NIST SP 800-76-1, as incorporated by reference in Sec. 1311.08 of this chapter, means the National Institute of Standards and Technology publication entitled ``Biometric Data Specification for Personal Identity Verification,'' a Federal standard for biometric data specifications for personal identity verification.</p><p class="depth2">Operating point means a point chosen on a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for a specific algorithm at which the biometric system is set to function.
