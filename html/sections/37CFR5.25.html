The showing of facts as to the nature of the error should include  statements by those persons having personal knowledge of the acts  regarding filing in a foreign country and should be accompanied by  copies of any necessary supporting documents such as letters of  transmittal or instructions for filing. The acts which are alleged to  constitute error should cover the period leading up to and including  each of the proscribed foreign filings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a petition for a retroactive license is denied, a time period  of not less than thirty days shall be set, during which the petition may  be renewed. Failure to renew the petition within the set time period  will result in a final denial of the petition. A final denial of a  petition stands unless a petition is filed under Sec.  1.181 within two  months of the date of the denial. If the petition for a retroactive  license is denied with respect to the invention of a pending application  and no petition under Sec.  1.181 has been filed, a final rejection of  the application under 35 U.S.C. 185 will be made.
