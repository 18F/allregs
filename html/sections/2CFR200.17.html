                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Cluster of programs means a grouping of closely related programs that share common compliance requirements. The types of clusters of programs are research and development (R&D;), student financial aid (SFA), and other clusters. ``Other clusters'' are as defined by OMB in the compliance supplement or as designated by a state for Federal awards the state provides to its subrecipients that meet the definition of a cluster of programs. When designating an ``other cluster,'' a state must identify the Federal awards included in the cluster and advise the subrecipients of compliance requirements applicable to the cluster, consistent with Sec. 200.331 Requirements for pass-through entities, paragraph (a). A cluster of programs must be considered as one program for determining major programs, as described in Sec. 200.518 Major program determination, and, with the exception of R&D; as described in Sec. 200.501 Audit requirements, paragraph (c), whether a program-specific audit may be elected.</p>
