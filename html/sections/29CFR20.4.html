                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The agency head (or designee) responsible for carrying out the  provisions of this subpart with respect to the debt shall send to the  debtor appropriate written demands for payment in terms which inform the  debtor of the consequences of failure to cooperate. In accordance with  guidelines established by the Chief Financial Officer, a total of three  progressively stronger written demands at not more than 30-day intervals  will normally be made unless a response to the first or second demand  indicates that a further demand would be futile and the debtor's  response does not require rebuttal. In determining the timing of the  demand letters, agencies should give due regard to the need to act  promptly so that, as a general rule, if necessary to refer the debt to  the Department of Justice for litigation, such referral can be made  within one year of the final determination of the fact and the amount of  the debt. When the agency head (or designee) deems it appropriate to  protect the government's interests (for example, to prevent the statute  of limitations, 28 U.S.C. 2415, from expiring), written demand may be  preceded by other appropriate actions, including immediate referral for  litigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prior to disclosing information to a consumer credit reporting  agency in accordance with this subpart, the agency head (or designee)  responsible for administering the program under which the debt arose  shall review the claim and determine that the claim is valid and  overdue. In cases where the debt arises under programs of two or more  Department of Labor agencies, or in such other instances as the Chief  Financial Officer or his or her designee may deem appropriate, the Chief  Financial Officer, or his or her designee, may determine which agency,  or official, shall have responsibility for carrying out the provisions  of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In accordance with guidelines established by the Chief Financial  Officer, the agency official responsible for disclosure of the debt to a  consumer credit reporting agency shall send written notice to the  individual debtor informing such debtor:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Of the basis for the indebtedness;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the payment of the claim is overdue;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That the agency intends to disclose to a consumer credit  reporting agency, within not less than sixty days after sending such  notice, that the individual is responsible for such claim;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Of the specific information intended to be disclosed to the  credit reporting agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Of the rights of such debtor to a full explanation of the claim,  to dispute any information in the records of the agency concerning the  claim, and of the name of an agency employee who can provide a full  explanation of the claim;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Of the debtor's right to administrative appeal or review with  respect to the claim and how such review shall be obtained; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Of the date on which or after which the information will be  reported to the consumer credit reporting agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where the disclosure concerns a commercial debt, the responsible  agency head (or designee) shall send written notice to the commercial  debtor informing such debtor of the information discussed in paragraphs  (c)(1), (4), (5), and (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Agencies shall also include in their demand letters the notice  provisions to debtors required by other regulations of the Labor  Department, pertaining to waiver, assessment of interest, penalties and  administrative costs, administrative offset, and salary offset to the  extent that such inclusion is appropriate and practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The responsible agency head (or designee) shall exercise due  care to insure that demand letters are mailed or hand-delivered on the  same day that they are actually dated. If evidence suggests that the  debtor is no longer located at the address of record, reasonable action  shall be taken to obtain a current address.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> To the extent that the requirements under this section have been  provided to the debtor in relation to the same debt under some other  statutory or regulatory authority, the agency is not required to  duplicate such efforts.
