                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Personal information concerning individuals other  than the requester shall not be disclosed under the FOIA if the proposed  release would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal  privacy, or, if the information was compiled for law enforcement  purposes, it could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted  invasion of personal privacy. See 5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(6) and (b)(7)(C). For  purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Personal information means any information about an individual  that is not a matter of public record, or easily discernible to the  public, or protected from disclosure because of the implications that  arise from Government possession of such information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Public interest means the public interest in understanding the  operations and activities of the United States Government and not simply  any matter that might be of general interest to the requester or members  of the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination to be made. In making the required determination  under this section and pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C) of the FOIA,  ODNI will balance the privacy interests that would be compromised by  disclosure against the public interest in release of the requested  information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Otherwise. A requester seeking information on a third party is  encouraged to provide a signed affidavit or declaration from the third  party consenting to disclosure of the information. However, any such  statements shall be narrowly construed and the Director, IMO, in the  exercise of that officer's discretion and administrative authority, may  seek clarification from the third party prior to any or all releases.</p>
