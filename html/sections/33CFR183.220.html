The location and dimensions of the shaded area are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The shaded area is centered at the mid-length of the passenger carrying area and at the mid-breadth of the boat;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The length of the shaded area, measured along the centerline of the boat, is equal to 40 percent of the length of the passenger carrying area of the boat; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The breadth of the shaded area, measured at the midlength of the passenger carrying area, is equal to 40 percent of the breadth of the passenger carrying area of the boat.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Weight must be placed in the normal operating position of the motor and controls and the battery in lieu of this equipment. The required quantity of weight used for this purpose depends upon the maximum rated horsepower of the boat being tested and is specified in Columns 2 and 4 of Table 4 for the swamped weight of the motor and controls and for the submerged weight or the battery, respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Permanent fuel tanks must be filled with fuel and each external opening into the fuel tank must be sealed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The boat must be keel down in the water.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The boat must be swamped, allowing water to flow between the inside and outside of the boat, either over the sides, through a hull opening, or both. Entrapped air in the flooded portion of the boat must be eliminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Water must flood the two largest air chambers and all air chambers integral with the hull.
