What are some general tax considerations?</p><p class="depth0">Interest on savings bonds is subject to taxes imposed under the  Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The bonds are exempt from  taxation by any State or political subdivision of a State, except for  estate or inheritance taxes. (See 31 U.S.C. 3124.)  2. What is an example of a book-entry Series I savings bonds redemption</p><p class="depth0">value calculation?</p><p class="depth0">Assume a New Treasury Direct par investment amount in a book-entry  Series I savings bonds of $34.59, with an issue date of May, 2001, and a  redemption date of December, 2001. The published CRV for a definitive  $100 Series I savings bonds issued May, 2001 and redeemed December, 2001  = $101.96.  Calculation: [(Book-entry par investment) / (100)] x CRV value for $100 bond [(34.59 / 100)] x 101.96 [0.3459] x 101.96 35.267964 = $35.27</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

Appendix C to Part 359--Investment Considerations</p><p class="depth0">1. What are some index contingencies?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a previously reported CPI-U is revised, we will continue to  use the previously reported CPI-U in calculating redemption values.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the CPI-U is rebased to a different year, we will continue to  use the CPI-U based on the base reference period in effect when the  security was first issued, as long as that CPI-U continues to be  published.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If, while an inflation-indexed savings bonds is outstanding, the  applicable CPI-U is discontinued or, in the judgment of the Secretary,  fundamentally altered in a manner materially adverse to the interests of  an investor in the security, or, in the judgment of the Secretary,  altered by legislation or Executive Order in a manner materially adverse  to the interests of an investor in the security, Treasury, after  consulting with the Bureau of Labor Statistics or any successor agency,  will substitute an appropriate alternative index. Treasury will then  notify the public of the substitute index and how it will be applied.  The Secretary's determinations in this regard will be final.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the CPI-U for a particular month is not reported by the last  day of the following month, we will announce an index number based on  the last 12-month change in the CPI-U available. Any calculations of our  payment obligations on the inflation-indexed savings bonds that rely on  that month's CPI-U will be based on the index number that we have  announced.</p><p class="depth0">2. How will inflation lag affect my Series I savings bonds?</p><p class="depth0">The inflation rate component of investor earnings will be determined  twice each year. This rate will be the percentage change in the CPI-U  for the six months ending each March and September. The rate will be  included in the composite rate that is announced each May and November.  For Series I bonds offered from September 1, 1998, through October 31,  1998, the inflation rate component of investor earnings will be the  percentage change in the CPI-U for the six months ending March 31, 1998.  This rate will be included in the composite rate that is announced for  Series I bonds offered effective from September 1, 1998, through October  31, 1998. In the event the Secretary, or the Secretary's designee,  announces a composite rate at an effective date other than May 1 or  November 1, the announcement will specify the period to be used to  calculate the semiannual inflation rate. Each composite rate will be  effective for the entirety of the applicable rate period that begins  while the rate is in effect. Thus, an inflation rate may affect interest  accruals from 3 to 13 months from the date that the CPI-U is measured.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. The inflation rate determined from the CPI-U for the six- month period from October, 2003, through March, 2004, will be included  in the composite rate announced in May, 2004. For a bond purchased in  May 1999, this rate would go into effect immediately, since a new  semiannual rate period for this bond will begin in May, 2004. Series I  bonds issued in May begin new semiannual rate periods in the months of  May and November. In this example, the inflation rate will have its  earliest impact in June 2004, when interest from May accrues, three  months after the end of the six-month CPI-U period that ends in March,  2004.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The May 1, 2004, rate will apply similarly to a bond  purchased in October 1999. Series I bonds issued in October begin new  semiannual rate periods in the months   of April and October. Thus, for this bond, the May 1, 2004, composite  rate (which includes the inflation rate) will not go into effect until a  new semiannual rate period begins on October 1, 2004. This rate,  therefore, will determine the inflation-indexed portion of each interest  accrual from November, 2004, through April, 2005. In this example, the  inflation rate will have its latest impact in April 2005, 13 months  following the six-month CPI-U period that ended March 31, 2004.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix D to Part 359--Tax Considerations</p><p class="depth0">1. What are some general tax considerations?</p><p class="depth0">General. Interest is subject to all taxes imposed under the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The bonds are also subject to Federal  and State estate, inheritance, gift, or other excise taxes. The bonds  are exempt from all other taxation by any State or local taxing  authority.</p><p class="depth0">2. What reporting methods are available for savings bonds?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reporting methods. You may use either of the following two  methods for reporting the increase in the redemption value of the bond  for Federal income tax purposes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cash basis method. You may defer reporting the increase to the  year of final maturity, redemption, or other disposition, whichever is  earliest; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Accrual basis method. You may elect to report the increase each  year, in which case the election applies to all Series I bonds that you  then own, those subsequently acquired, and to any other obligations  purchased on a discount basis, such as savings bonds of Series E or EE.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Changing methods. If you use the cash basis method, you may  change to the accrual basis method without obtaining permission from the  Internal Revenue Service. However, once you elect to use the accrual  basis method in paragraph (a)(2), you may change the method of reporting  the increase only by following the specific procedures prescribed by the  Internal Revenue Service for making an automatic method change. For  further information, you may contact the Internal Revenue Service  director for your area, or the Internal Revenue Service, Washington, DC  20224.</p><p class="depth0">3. What transactions have potential tax consequences?</p><p class="depth0">The following types of transactions, among others, may have  potential tax consequences:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A reissue that affects the rights of any of the persons named on  a definitive Series I savings bonds may have tax consequences for the  owner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The transfer of a book-entry Series I savings bonds from one  owner to another may have tax consequences for the purchaser.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The redemption of a book-entry Series I savings bonds by the  secondary owner may have tax consequences for the primary owner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The purchase of a Series I savings bonds as a gift may have gift  tax consequences for the purchaser.
