                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> (fixed roof and  internal floating roof) each owner or operator shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After installing the control equipment required to comply with  Sec. 61.271(a), visually inspect the internal floating roof, the primary  seal, and the secondary seal (if one is in service), prior to filling  the storage vessel with benzene. If there are holes, tears or other  openings in the primary seal, the secondary seal, or the seal fabric, or  defects in the internal floating roof, the owner or operator shall  repair the items before filling the storage vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Visually inspect the internal floating roof and the primary seal  or the secondary seal (if one is in service) through manholes and roof  hatches on the fixed roof at least once every 12 months after initial  fill, or at least once every 12 months after September 14, 1989, except  as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. If the internal  floating roof is not resting on the surface of the benzene liquid inside  the storage vessel, or there is liquid on the roof, or the seal is  detached, or there are holes or tears in the seal fabric, the owner or  operator shall repair the items or empty and remove the storage vessel  from service within 45 days. If a failure that is detected during  inspections required in this paragraph cannot be repaired within 45 days  and if the vessel cannot be emptied within 45 days, an extension of up  to 30 additional days may be requested from the Administrator in the  inspection report required in Sec. 61.275(a). Such a request for an  extension must document that alternate storage capacity is unavailable  and specify a schedule of actions the company will take that will ensure  that the control equipment will be repaired or the vessel will be  emptied as soon as possible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Visually inspect the internal floating roof, the primary seal,  the secondary seal (if one is in service), gaskets, slotted membranes  and sleeve seals (if any) each time the storage vessel is emptied and  degassed. In no event shall inspections conducted in accordance with  this provision occur at intervals greater than 10 years in the case of  vessels conducting the annual visual inspections as specified in  paragraph (a)(2) of this section and at intervals greater than 5 years  in the case of vessels specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For all the inspections required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3)  of this section, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in  writing at least 30 days prior to the refilling of each storage vessel  to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present.  If the inspection required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section is not  planned and the owner or operator could not have known about the  inspection 30 days in advance of refilling the vessel, the owner or  operator shall notify the Administrator at least 7 days prior to the  refilling of the storage vessel. Notification shall be made by telephone  immediately followed by written documentation demonstrating why the  inspection was unplanned. Alternatively, the notification including the  written documentation may be made in writing and sent by express mail so  that it is received by the Administrator at least 7 days prior to  refilling.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the internal floating roof has defects, the primary seal has  holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric, or the  secondary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in   the seal or the seal fabric, or the gaskets no longer close off the  liquid surfaces from the atmosphere, or the slotted membrane has more  than 10 percent open area, the owner or operator shall repair the items  as necessary so that none of the conditions specified in this paragraph  exist before refilling the storage vessel with benzene.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For vessels equipped with a double-seal system as specified in  Sec. 61.271(a)(2)(ii):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Visually inspect the vessel as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of  this section at least every 5 years; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Visually inspect the vessel annually as specified in paragraph  (a)(2) of this section, and at least every 10 years as specified in  paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> (external floating  roof) the owner or operator shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine the gap areas and maximum gap widths between the  primary seal and the wall of the storage vessel, and the secondary seal  and the wall of the storage vessel according to the following frequency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For an external floating roof vessel equipped with primary and  secondary seals, measurements of gaps between the vessel wall and the  primary seal (seal gaps) shall be performed during the hydrostatic  testing of the vessel or within 90 days of the initial fill with benzene  or within 90 days of September 14, 1989, whichever occurs last, and at  least once every 5 years thereafter, except as provided in paragraph  (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For an external floating roof vessel equipped with a liquid- mounted primary seal and without a secondary seal as provided for in  Sec. 61.271(b)(5), measurement of gaps between the vessel wall and the  primary seal (seal gaps) shall be performed within 90 days of September  14, 1989, and at least once per year thereafter.
