Sec. 1.9005-1  Election relating to the determination of gross incomefrom the property for taxable years beginning prior to 1961 in thecase of clay and quartzite used in making refractory products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 2 of the Act of September 26, 1961 (Pub. L. 87-321, 75 Stat. 683), provides that certain taxpayers may elect to apply the provisions of such section to all taxable years beginning before January 1, 1961, with respect to which the election is effective. Section 2 of the Act prescribes special rules for the application of section 613(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) in the case of quartzite and clay used by the mine owner or operator in the production of refractory products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Election. The election to apply the provisions of section 2 of the Act may be made only in the case of quartzite and clay used in the production of products generally recognized as refractory products by the refractories industry. Examples of such products are clay firebrick, silica brick, and refractory bonding mortars. The election may be made only by a taxpayer who both mined the clay or quartzite and used it in the production of refractory products. The election must be made in accordance with Sec. 1.9005-4 on or before February 14, 1962, and the election shall become irrevocable on that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Years to which the election is applicable. If the election described in paragraph (b) of this section is made by the taxpayer, the provisions of section 2 of the Act shall be effective on and after January 1, 1951, for all taxable years beginning before January 1, 1961, in respect of which the:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Assessment of a deficiency,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Refund or credit of an overpayment, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Commencement of a suit for recovery of a refund under section 7405 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,

was not prevented on September 26, 1961, by the operation of any law or rule of law. The election is also effective on and after January 1, 1951, for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1961, in respect of which an assessment of a deficiency has been made but not collected on or before September 26, 1961.

Sec. 1.9005-2  Effect of election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. If a taxpayer makes the election described in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.9005-1, he shall be deemed to have consented to the application of section 2 of the Act with respect to all the clay and quartzite described in that paragraph for all taxable years for which the election is effective whether or not the taxpayer is litigating the issue for any of such years. Thus, in applying section 613(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) to those years:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term ``ordinary treatment processes'' shall include crushing, grinding, and separating the mineral from waste, but shall not include any subsequent process; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The gross income from mining for each short ton of quartzite or clay mined by the taxpayer and used by him in the production of all refractory products sold during the taxable year shall be equal to 87\1/2\ percent of the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The average lowest published or advertised price, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The average lowest actual selling price at which the mine owner or operator offered to sell or sold any such quartzite or clay during the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Rules for applying paragraph (a) of this section. (1) The price described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and any price described in this paragraph shall be determined with reference to quartzite or clay in the form and condition of such products after the application of only the processes described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and before

transportation from the plant in which such processes were applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The price described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and any price described in this paragraph shall be determined with reference to quartzite or clay in the form and condition of such products after the application of only the processes described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and before

transportation from the plant in which such processes were applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If quartzite and clay were mined and used by the taxpayer in the production of refractory products, a separate price shall be used with respect to each mineral.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> There shall be used for each mineral the lowest price at which it was sold or offered for sale by the taxpayer during the taxable year. Thus, only one price shall be used with respect to each mineral regardless of variations in type or grade.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of this paragraph, exceptional, unusual, or nominal sales of quartzite or clay shall be disregarded. Thus, for example, if the taxpayer made an accommodation sale during the taxable year at other than the regular price, such sale is to be disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the taxpayer made no sales during the taxable year of quartzite or clay in the form and condition described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, or if his sales were exceptional, unusual, or nominal, there shall be used the lowest recognized selling price for the taxpayer's marketing area for quartzite or clay (of the same grade and type as that used by him) which was published for the taxable year in a trade journal or other industry publication.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If subparagraph (5) of this paragraph does not apply for the reason that there is no recognized selling price published in a trade journal or other industry publication for the taxpayer's marketing area, there shall be used the lowest price at which quartzite or clay comparable to that used by the taxpayer was sold or offered for sale during the taxable year in that area by other producers similarly circumstanced as the taxpayer or, if appropriate, the lowest price paid by the taxpayer for purchased quartzite or clay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> If the lowest selling price otherwise applicable under the preceding provisions of this paragraph fluctuated during the taxable year, the two or more lowest selling prices shall be averaged according to the number of days during the taxable year that each such price was in effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Taxpayer A, a calendar year taxpayer, mined quartzite and clay and used them in the production of recognized refractory products. During the taxable year, the lowest price for which A sold clay after the application of crushing and grinding was $13.75 per short ton. He also sold some ground clay of a different type at $20.00 per short ton. A sold quartzite after the application of crushing and grinding for various prices, depending upon type, ranging from $14.00 per short ton to $20.00 per short ton. During the taxable year, the prices for the various types of ground clay and quartzite did not change. None of the sales by A of ground clay or quartzite were exceptional, unusual, or nominal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determination of gross income from mining. If A makes the election described in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.9005-1, the gross income from mining per short ton of clay mined by A and used in the production of refractory products sold during the taxable year is $12.03 (87\1/2\ percent of $13.75), and the gross income from mining per short ton of quartzite mined by A and used in the production of refractory products sold during the taxable year is $12.25 (87\1/2\ percent of $14.00). To determine his gross income from mining, A must compute the sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> $12.03 multiplied by the number of short tons of clay which were mined by A (whether or not during the taxable year) and which were used by A in the production of refractory products (refractory bonding mortar, fire brick, etc.) sold during the taxable year; plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> $12.25 multiplied by the number of short tons of quartzite which were mined by A (whether or not during the taxable year) and which were used by A in the production of refractory products sold during the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that on October 1 of the taxable year A's lowest price for clay after the application of crushing and grinding increased to $14.40 per short ton. In this case, the average lowest price for which A sold ground clay during the taxable year must be determined by taking into account the price adjustment of October 1. Under these circumstances, the average lowest price for the ground clay would be $13.91, that is $13.75 x 273/365 plus $14.40 x 92/365.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effect on depletion rates and other items. The election shall have no effect on the applicable rate of percentage depletion for the taxable years for which the election is effective. In applying the election to the years affected there

shall be taken into account the effect that any adjustments resulting from the election shall have on other items affected thereby, such as charitable contributions, foreign tax credit, net operating loss, and the effect that adjustments to any such items shall have on other taxable years. The provisions of section 2 of the Act are applicable with respect to taxable years subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for purposes of applying sections 450 and 453 of that Code. The election shall have no effect on the determination of the treatment processes which are to be considered as mining or on the determination of gross income from mining for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1960.

Sec. 1.9005-3  Statutes of limitation.</p><p class="depth0">Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the period within which the assessment of any deficiency attributable to the election may be made, or within which the credit or refund of any overpayment attributable to the election may be made, shall not expire sooner than one year after the last day for making the election. Thus, if assessment of a deficiency or credit or refund of an overpayment, whichever is applicable, was not prevented on September 26, 1961, the time for making assessment or credit or refund shall not expire for at least one year after the last day for making the election. Even though assessment of a deficiency was prevented on September 26, 1961, if commencement of a suit for recovery of a refund under section 7405 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 may have been made on such date, then any deficiency resulting from the election may be assessed at any time within one year after the last day for making the election. If a taxpayer makes the election, he shall be deemed to have consented to the application of the provisions of section 2 of the Act extending the time for assessing a deficiency attributable to the election. Section 2 of the Act does not shorten the period of limitations otherwise applicable. An agreement may be entered into under section 6501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and corresponding provisions of prior law to extend the period for assessment.

Sec. 1.9005-4  Manner of exercising election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> By whom election is to be made. Generally, the taxpayer whose tax liability is affected by the election shall make the election. In the case of a partnership, or a corporation electing under the provisions of subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the election shall be exercised by the partnership or such corporation, as the case may be.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Time and manner of making election. The election shall be made on or before February 14, 1962, by filing a statement with the district director with whom the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year in which the election is made is required to be filed. The statement shall include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A clear indication that an election is being made under section 2 of the Act, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The taxable years to which the election applies.

Amended income tax returns reflecting any increase or decrease in tax attributable to the election shall be filed for the taxable years to which the election applies. In the case of partnerships and electing small business corporations under subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, amended returns shall be filed by the partnership or electing small business corporation, as well as by the partners or shareholders, as the case may be. Any amended return shall be filed with the office of the district director with whom the taxpayer files his income tax return for the taxable year in which the election is made, and, if practicable, on the same date the statement of election is filed, but amended returns shall be filed in no event later than May 31, 1962, unless an extension of time is granted under section 6081 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Whenever the amended returns do not accompany the statement of election, a

copy of the statement shall be submitted with the amended returns. The amended returns shall be accompanied by payment of the additional tax (together with interest thereon) resulting from the election.

Sec. 1.9005-5  Terms; applicability of other laws.</p><p class="depth0">All other terms which are not otherwise specifically defined shall have the same meaning as when used in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (or the corresponding provisions of prior law) except where otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly intended to the contrary. Further, all provisions of law contained in the Code (or the corresponding provisions of prior law) shall apply to the extent that they can apply. Thus, all the provisions of subtitle F of the Code (and the corresponding provisions of prior law) shall apply to the extent they can apply, including the provisions of law relating to assessment, collection, credit or refund, and limitations. For purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.9005-1 to 1.9005-4, inclusive, the term ``Act'' means the Act of September 26, 1961 (Pub. L. 87-321, 75 Stat. 683).
