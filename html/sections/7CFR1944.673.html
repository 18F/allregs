                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 has  entered into a Programmatic Memorandum of Agreement (PMOA) with the  National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers (SHPO) and  the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in order to implement the  specific requirements regarding historic preservation contained in  section 533 of the Housing Act of 1949, 42 U.S.C. 1490(m) of the  enabling legislation. The PMOA, with attachments, can be found in FmHA  Instruction 2000-FF (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 office). A copy of the PMOA will be provided to each  applicant for a HPG as part of the preapplication package specified in  paragraph II of exhibit C of this subpart (available in any FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each applicant for an HPG grant will provide, as part of its  preapplication documentation submitted to RHS, a description of its  proposed process for assisting very low-and low-income persons owning  historic properties needing rehabilitation, repair, or replacement.  ``Historic properties'' are defined as properties that are listed or  eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Each  HPG proposal shall comply with the provisions of Stipulation I, A-G of  the PMOA (RD Instruction 2000-FF), available in any Rural Development  State or District Office. Should RHS be required to assume  responsibility for compliance with 36 CFR part 800 in accordance with  Stipulation III of the PMOA, the grantee will assist RHS in preparing an  environmental assessment. RHS will work with the grantee to develop  alternative actions or mitigation measures, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Such assumption of responsibility by FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 on a particular property shall not  preclude the grantee from carrying out the requirements of 36 CFR part  800 on other properties as though it were a Federal agency, but no work  may be commenced on any unit or dwelling in controversy until and unless  so advised by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
