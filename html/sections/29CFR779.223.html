                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Ownership, sufficient to exercise ``control,'' of course, exists where total ownership is vested in a single person, family unit, partnership, corporation, or other single business organization. Ownership sufficient to exercise ``control'' exist also where there is more than 50 percent ownership of voting stock. (See West v. Wal-Mart, 264 F. Supp. 168 (W.D. Ark.).) But ``control'' may exist with much more limited ownership, and, in certain cases exists in the absence of any ownership. The mere ownership of stock in a corporation does not by itself establish the existence of the ``control'' referred to in the definition. The question whether the ownership in a particular case includes the right to exercise the requisite ``control'' will necessarily depend upon all the facts in the light of the statutory provisions.</p>
