For hose,  a dimensional description such as ``\1/4\-inch hose'' refers to the  nominal inside diameter. For tubing, a dimensional description such as  ``\1/4\-in tubing'' refers to the nominal outside diameter.</p><p class="depth0">Brake hose assembly means a brake hose, with or without armor,  equipped with end fittings for use in a brake system, but does not  include an air or vacuum assembly prepared by the owner or operator of a  used vehicle, by his employee, or by a repair facility, for installation  in that used vehicle.</p><p class="depth0">Brake hose end fitting means a coupler, other than a clamp, designed  for attachment to the end of a brake hose.</p><p class="depth0">Free length means the linear measurement of hose exposed between the  end fittings of a hose assembly in a straight position.</p><p class="depth0">Permanently attached end fitting means an end fitting that is  attached by deformation of the fitting about the hose by crimping or  swaging, or an end fitting that is attached by use of a sacrificial  sleeve or ferrule that requires replacement each time a hose assembly is  rebuilt.</p><p class="depth0">Preformed means a brake hose that is manufactured with permanent  bends and is shaped to fit a specific vehicle without further bending.</p><p class="depth0">Rupture means any failure that results in separation of a brake hose  from its end fitting or in leakage.</p><p class="depth0">Vacuum tubing connector means a flexible conduit of vacuum that (i)  connects metal tubing to metal tubing in a brake system, (ii) is  attached without end fittings, and (iii) when installed, has an  unsupported length less than the total length of those portions that  cover the metal tubing.</p><p class="depth0">S5.

Conduct  the following tests:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> With atmospheric pressure applied to the oil inside the tubing  assembly, set the environmental chamber temperature to 200 degrees  Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius) and condition the tubing assembly for 24  hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> With the temperature maintained at 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93  degrees Celsius), increase the oil pressure inside the tubing assembly  at a rate of 3,000 psi per minute to 450 psi, and hold this pressure for  5 minutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Decrease the oil pressure inside the tubing assembly at a rate  of 3,000 psi per minute to atmospheric pressure and set the temperature  of the environmental chamber to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees  Celsius). Condition the tubing assembly at this temperature for 1 hour.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Set the temperature of the environmental chamber to minus 40  degrees Fahrenheit (minus 40 degrees Celsius) and condition the tubing  assembly for 24 hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> With the temperature maintained at minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit  (minus 40 degrees Celsius), increase the hydraulic pressure inside the  tubing assembly at a rate of 3,000 psi per minute to 450 psi, and hold  this pressure for 5 minutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Apparatus. A source of air  pressure that includes a pressure gauge or monitoring system and is  equipped with a mass air flow meter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Preparation. Prepare a 12-inch length of tubing and plug one  end. Assemble the end fitting with the threaded retention nut on the  other end of the tubing according to the end fitting manufacturer's  instructions, then disassemble the fitting. Repeat the assembly and  disassembly sequence three more times, and then reassemble the end  fitting (five total assembly steps).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Attach the end fitting with the threaded retention nut to the  source of air pressure. Pressurize the tubing at a rate of 3,000 psi per  minute to a pressure of 120 psi. If the end fitting leaks, measure and  record the leakage rate using the mass air flow meter.</p><p class="depth0">S12.25 End fitting corrosion resistance. Utilize an air brake tubing  assembly or prepare a 12-inch length of tubing and install end fittings  according to the end fitting manufacturer's instructions. Conduct the  test specified in S6.11 using a plastic air brake tubing assembly.</p><p class="depth0">S13. Test Conditions. Each hose assembly or appropriate part thereof  shall be able to meet the requirements of S5, S7, S9, and S11, under the  following conditions.</p><p class="depth0">S13.1 The temperature of the testing room is 75 degrees Fahrenheit  (24 degrees Celsius).</p><p class="depth0">S13.2 The brake hoses and brake hose assemblies are at least 24  hours old, and unused.</p><p class="depth0">S13.3 Specified test pressures are gauge pressures (psig).
