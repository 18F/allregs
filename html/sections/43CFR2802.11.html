During this process BLM coordinates with other Federal agencies, state, local, and tribal governments,

and the public to identify resource-related issues, concerns, and needs. The process results in a resource management plan or plan amendment, which addresses to what extent you may use public lands and resources for specific purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When determining which lands may be suitable for right-of-way corridors, the factors BLM considers include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Federal, state, and local land use plans, and applicable Federal, state, local, and tribal laws;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Environmental impacts on cultural resources and natural resources, including air, water, soil, fish, wildlife, and vegetation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Physical effects and constraints on corridor placement due to geology, hydrology, meteorology, soil, or land forms;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Costs of construction, operation, and maintenance and costs of modifying or relocating existing facilities in a proposed right-of-way corridor (i.e., the economic efficiency of placing a right-of-way within a proposed corridor);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Risks to national security;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Potential health and safety hazards imposed on the public by facilities or activities located within the proposed right-of-way corridor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Social and economic impacts of the right-of-way corridor on public land users, adjacent landowners, and other groups or individuals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Transportation and utility corridor studies previously developed by user groups; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Engineering and technological compatibility of proposed and existing facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> BLM may designate any transportation and utility corridor existing prior to October 21, 1976, as a transportation and utility corridor without further review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The resource management plan or plan amendment may also identify areas where BLM will not allow right-of-way corridors for environmental, safety, or other reasons.</p><p class="depth2">Subpart 2803_Qualifications for Holding FLPMA Grants</p>
