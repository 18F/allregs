                            <p class="depth0">The proprietor shall, before production, obtain approval of the formula and process by which special natural wine, agricultural wine, and other than standard wine (except distilling material or vinegar stock) are to be made. The formula must be prepared and filed on TTB F 5120.29, Formula and Process for Wine, in accordance with the instructions on the form. A nonbeverage wine formula will show the intended use of the finished wine or wine product. Any formula approved under this section will remain in effect until revoked, superseded, or voluntarily surrendered. Except for research, development, and testing, no special natural wine, agricultural wine, or, if required to be covered by an approved formula, wine other than standard wine may be produced prior to approval by the appropriate TTB officer of a formula covering each ingredient and process (if the process requires approval) used in the production of the product.
