As part of the review of a proposed surface use plan of  operations, the authorized Forest officer shall consider the estimated  cost to the Forest Service to reclaim those areas that would be  disturbed by operations and to restore any lands or surface waters  adversely affected by the lease operations after the abandonment or  cessation of operations on the lease. If at any time prior to or during  the conduct of operations, the authorized Forest officer determines the  financial instrument held by the Bureau of Land Management is not  adequate to ensure complete and timely reclamation and restoration, the  authorized Forest officer shall give the operator the option of either  increasing the financial instrument held by the Bureau of Land  Management or filing a separate instrument with the Forest Service in  the amount deemed adequate by the authorized Forest officer to ensure  reclamation and restoration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standards for estimating reclamation costs. The authorized  Forest officer shall consider the costs of the operator's proposed  reclamation program and the need for additional measures to be taken  when estimating the cost to the Forest Service to reclaim the disturbed  area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Release of reclamation liability. An operator may request the  authorized Forest officer to notify the Bureau of Land Management of  reduced reclamation liability at any time after reclamation has  commenced. The authorized Forest officer shall, if appropriate, notify  the Bureau of Land Management as to the amount to which the liability  has been reduced.</p>
