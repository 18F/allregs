                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Formula. To meet the requirement of Sec. 300.132(a), each LEA must spend the following on providing special education and related services (including direct services) to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For children aged 3 through 21, an amount that is the same proportion of the LEA's total subgrant under section 611(f) of the Act as the number of private school children with disabilities aged 3 through 21 who are enrolled by their parents in private, including religious, elementary schools and secondary schools located in the school district served by the LEA, is to the total number of children with disabilities in its jurisdiction aged 3 through 21.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> For children aged three through five, an amount that is the same proportion of the LEA's total subgrant under section 619(g) of the Act as the number of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities aged three through five who are enrolled by their parents in a private, including religious, elementary school located in the school district served by the LEA, is to the total number of children with disabilities in its jurisdiction aged three through five.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For children aged three through five, an amount that is the same proportion of the LEA's total subgrant under section 619(g) of the Act as the number of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities aged three through five who are enrolled by their parents in a private, including religious, elementary school located in the school district served by the LEA, is to the total number of children with disabilities in its jurisdiction aged three through five.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, children aged three through five are considered to be parentally-placed private school children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private, including religious, elementary schools, if they are enrolled in a private school that meets the definition of elementary school in Sec. 300.13.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If an LEA has not expended for equitable services all of the funds described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section by the end of the fiscal year for which Congress appropriated the funds, the LEA must obligate the remaining funds for special education and related services (including direct services) to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities during a carry-over period of one additional year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Calculating proportionate amount. In calculating the proportionate amount of Federal funds to be provided for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities, the LEA, after timely and meaningful consultation with representatives of private schools under Sec. 300.134, must conduct a thorough and complete child find process to determine the number of parentally-placed children with disabilities attending private schools located in the LEA. (See appendix B for an example of how proportionate share is calculated).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Annual count of the number of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities. (1) Each LEA must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each LEA must--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> After timely and meaningful consultation with representatives of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities (consistent with Sec. 300.134), determine the number of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities attending private schools located in the LEA; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ensure that the count is conducted on any date between October 1 and December 1, inclusive, of each year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The count must be used to determine the amount that the LEA must spend on providing special education and related services to parentally-

placed private school children with disabilities in the next subsequent fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Supplement, not supplant. State and local funds may supplement and in no case supplant the proportionate amount of Federal funds required to be expended for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities under this part.
