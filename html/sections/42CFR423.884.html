                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Employment-based retiree health coverage is considered  to be a qualified retiree prescription drug plan if all of the following  requirements are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An actuarial attestation is submitted in accordance with  paragraph (d) of this section. The rules for submitting attestations as  part of subsidy applications are described in paragraph (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Part D eligible individuals covered under the plan are provided  with creditable coverage notices in accordance with Sec. 423.56.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Records are maintained and made available for audit in  accordance with paragraph (f) of this section and Sec. 423.888(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Disclosure of information.

The sponsor (or its  designee) must submit an application for the subsidy to CMS that is  signed by an authorized representative of the sponsor. The application  must be provided in a form and manner specified by CMS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Required information.

To receive a subsidy payment, the sponsor  (through the signed sponsor agreement or as otherwise specified by CMS)  must specifically accept and agree to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Comply with the terms and conditions of eligibility for a  subsidy payment set forth in this regulation and in any related CMS  guidance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Acknowledge that at the same time CMS releases Part C and Part  D summary payment data in accordance with Secs. 422.504(n) and  423.505(o) CMS will also release Part D retiree drug subsidy payment  data for the most recently reconciled year including the name of the  eligible sponsor, the total gross aggregate dollar amount of the CMS  subsidy, and the number of eligible retirees;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Acknowledge that the information in the application is being  provided to obtain Federal funds; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Require that all subcontractors, including plan administrators,  acknowledge that information provided in connection with the subcontract  is used for purposes of obtaining Federal funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Signature by sponsor. An authorized representative of the  requesting sponsor must sign the completed application and certify that  the information contained in the application is true and accurate to the  best of the sponsor's knowledge and belief.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Timing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. An application for a given plan year  must be submitted prior to the beginning of the plan year by a date  specified by CMS in published guidance, unless a request for an  extension has been filed and approved under procedures set forth in such  guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transition rule. For plan years that end in 2006, an  application must be submitted by September 30, 2005 unless a request for  an extension has been filed and approved under procedures established by  CMS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Updates. The sponsor (or the designee) must provide updates to  CMS in a manner specified by CMS of the information required in  paragraph (c)(2) of this section on a monthly basis or at a frequency  specified by CMS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Data match. Once the full application for the subsidy payment is  submitted, CMS--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Matches the names and identifying information for the  individuals submitted as qualifying covered retirees with a CMS  database(s) to determine which retirees are Part D eligible individuals  who are not enrolled in a Part D plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Provides information concerning the results of the search in  paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this paragraph (such as names and other  identifying information, if necessary) to the sponsor (or to a  designee).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Actuarial attestation--general. The sponsor of the plan must  provide to CMS an attestation in a form and manner specified by CMS that  the actuarial value of the retiree prescription drug coverage under the  plan is at least equal to the actuarial value of the defined standard  prescription coverage (as defined at Sec. 423.100), not taking into  account the value of any discount or coverage provided during the  coverage gap (as defined at Sec. 423.100). The attestation must meet all  of the following standards:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contents of the attestation include the following assurances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The actuarial gross value of the retiree prescription drug  coverage under the plan for the plan year is at   least equal to the actuarial gross value of the defined standard  prescription drug coverage under Part D for the plan year in question,  not taking into account the value of any discount or coverage provided  during the coverage gap.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The actuarial net value of the retiree prescription drug  coverage under the plan for that plan year is at least equal to the  actuarial net value of the defined standard prescription drug coverage  under Part D for that plan year in question, not taking into account the  value of any discount or coverage provided during the coverage gap.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The actuarial values must be determined using the methodology  in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The attestation must be made by a qualified actuary who is a  member of the American Academy of Actuaries. Applicants may use  qualified outside actuaries, including (but not limited to) actuaries  employed by the plan administrator or an insurer providing benefits  under the plan. If an applicant uses an outside actuary, the attestation  can be submitted directly by the outside actuary or by the plan sponsor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The attestation must be signed by a qualified actuary and must  state that the attestation is true and accurate to the best of the  attester's knowledge and belief.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The attestation must contain an acknowledgement that the  information being provided in the attestation is being used to obtain  Federal funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Methodology--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Basis of the attestation. The attestation must  be based on generally accepted actuarial principles and any actuarial  guidelines established by CMS in this section or in future guidance. To  the extent CMS has not provided guidance on a specific aspect of the  actuarial equivalence standard under this section, an actuary providing  the attestation may rely on any reasonable interpretation of this  section and section 1860D-22(a) of the Act consistent with generally  accepted actuarial principles in determining actuarial values.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The net value of coverage provided under the sponsor's retiree  prescription drug plan must be determined by reducing the gross value of  such coverage as determined under paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A) of this  section by the expected premiums paid by Part D eligible individuals who  are plan participants or their spouses and dependents. For sponsors of  plans that charge a single, integrated premium or contribution to their  retirees for both prescription drug coverage and other types of medical  coverage, the attestation must allocate a portion of the premium/ contribution to prescription drug coverage under the sponsor's plan,  under any method determined by the sponsor or its actuary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> To calculate the net value of defined standard prescription drug  coverage under Part D, the gross value of defined standard prescription  drug coverage under Part D as determined by paragraph (d)(5)(iii)(A) of  this section is reduced by the following amounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The monthly beneficiary premiums (as defined in Sec. 423.286)  expected to be paid for standard prescription drug coverage; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The valuation of defined standard prescription drug coverage for  a given plan year is based on the initial coverage limit cost-sharing  and out-of-pocket threshold for defined standard prescription drug  coverage under Part D in effect at the start of such plan year, not  taking into account the value of any discount or coverage provided  during the coverage gap.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Example: If a sponsor's retiree prescription drug plan operates  under a plan year that ends March 30, the sponsor has a choice of basing  the attestation for the year April 1, 2007 through March 30, 2008 on  either the initial coverage limit, cost-sharing amounts, and out-of- pocket threshold amounts that apply to defined standard prescription  drug coverage under Part D in CY 2007, or the amounts announced for CY  2008. However, in order to use the amounts applicable in CY 2007, the  sponsor must submit the attestation within 60 days after the publication  of the Part D coverage limits for CY 2008. If the attestation is  submitted more than 60 days after the 2008 coverage limits have been  published, the CY 2008 coverage limits would apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Employment-based retiree health coverage with two or more  benefit options. For the assurance required under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of  this section, the assurance must be provided separately for each benefit  option for which the sponsor requests a subsidy under this subpart. For  the assurance required under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the  assurance may be provided either separately for each benefit option for  which the sponsor provided assurances under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this  section, or in the aggregate for all benefit options (or for a subset of  the benefit options).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Timing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Annual submission. The attestation must be provided  annually at the time the sponsor's subsidy application is submitted, or  at such other times as specified by CMS in further guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Notice of failure to continue to satisfy the actuarial  equivalence standards. A sponsor must notify CMS, in a form and manner  specified by CMS, no later than 90 days before the implementation of a  change to the drug coverage that impacts the actuarial value of the  retiree prescription drug coverage under the sponsor's plan such that it  no longer meets the standards set forth in paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Disclosure of creditable prescription drug coverage status. The  sponsor must disclose to all of its retirees and their spouses and  dependents eligible to participate in its plan who are Part D eligible  individuals whether the coverage is creditable prescription drug  coverage under Sec. 423.56 in accordance with the notification  requirements under that section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Access to records for audit. The sponsor (and where applicable,  its designee) must meet the requirements of Sec. 423.888(d). Failure to  comply with Sec. 423.888(d) may result in nonpayment or recoupment of  all or part of a subsidy payment.
