                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Comparability. Comparability is shown for SO2, CO,  O3, and NO2 methods when the differences between:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Measurements made by a candidate manual method or by a test  analyzer representative of a candidate automated method, and;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Measurements made simultaneously by a reference method are less  than or equal to the values for maximum discrepancy specified in table  C-1 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Test measurements. All test measurements are to be made at the  same test site. If necessary, the concentration of pollutant in the  sampled ambient air may be augmented with artificially generated  pollutant to facilitate measurements in the specified ranges, as  described under paragraph (f)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requirements for measurements or samples. All test measurements  made or test samples collected by means of a sample manifold as  specified in paragraph (f)(4) of this section shall be at a room  temperature between 20 and 30 C, and at a line voltage between 105 and  125 volts. All methods shall be calibrated as specified in Sec. 53.30(f)  prior to initiation of the tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Set-up and start-up. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Set-up and start-up of the test  analyzer, test sampler(s), and reference method shall be in strict  accordance with the applicable operation manual(s). If the test analyzer  does not have an integral strip chart or digital data recorder, connect  the analyzer output to a suitable strip chart or digital data recorder.  This recorder shall have a chart width of at least 25 centimeters, a  response time of 1 second or less, a deadband of not more than 0.25  percent of full scale, and capability of either reading measurements at  least 5 percent below zero or offsetting the zero by at least 5 percent.  Digital data shall be recorded at appropriate time intervals such that  trend plots similar to a strip chart recording may be constructed with a  similar or suitable level of detail.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other data acquisition components may be used along with the  chart recorder during the conduct of these tests. Use of the chart  recorder is intended only to facilitate visual evaluation of data  submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Allow adequate warmup or stabilization time as indicated in the  applicable operation manual(s) before beginning the tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Range. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this  section, each method shall be operated in the range specified for the  reference method in the appropriate appendix to part 50 of this chapter  (for manual reference methods), or specified in table B-1 of subpart B  of this part (for automated reference methods).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a candidate method having more than one selectable range,  one range must be that specified in table B-1 of subpart B of this part,  and a test analyzer representative of the method must pass the tests  required by this subpart while operated on that range. The tests may be  repeated for one or more broader ranges (i.e., ones extending to higher  concentrations) than the one specified in table B-1 of subpart B of this  part, provided that such a range does not extend to concentrations more  than four times the upper range limit specified in table B-1 of subpart  B of this part and that the test analyzer has passed the tests required  by subpart B of this part (if applicable) for the broader range. If the  tests required by this subpart are conducted or passed only for the  range specified in table B-1 of subpart B of this part, any equivalent  method determination with respect to the method will be limited to that  range. If the tests are passed for both the specified range and a  broader range (or ranges), any such determination will include the  broader range(s) as well as the specified range. Appropriate test data  shall be submitted for each range sought to be included in such a  determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Operation of automated methods. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Once the test analyzer has  been set up and calibrated and tests started, manual adjustment or  normal periodic maintenance, as specified in the manual referred to in  Sec. 53.4(b)(3), is permitted only every 3 days. Automatic adjustments  which the test analyzer performs by itself are permitted at any time.  The submitted records shall show clearly when manual adjustments were  made and describe the operations performed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All test measurements shall be made with the same test analyzer;  use of multiple test analyzers is not permitted. The test analyzer shall  be operated continuously during the entire series of test measurements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a test analyzer should malfunction during any of these tests,  the entire set of measurements shall be repeated, and a detailed  explanation of the malfunction, remedial action taken, and whether  recalibration was necessary (along with all pertinent records and  charts) shall be submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Ambient air shall be sampled from a common intake and  distribution manifold designed to deliver homogenous air samples to both  methods. Precautions shall be taken in the design and construction of  this manifold to minimize the removal of particulate matter and trace  gases, and to insure that identical samples reach the two methods. If  necessary, the concentration of pollutant in the sampled ambient air may  be augmented with artificially generated pollutant. However, at all  times the air sample measured by the candidate and reference methods  under test shall consist of not less than 80 percent ambient air by  volume.   Schematic drawings, physical illustrations, descriptions, and complete  details of the manifold system and the augmentation system (if used)  shall be submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Tests. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conduct the first set of simultaneous measurements  with the candidate and reference methods:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Table C-1 of this subpart specifies the type (1-or 24-hour) and  number of measurements to be made in each of the three test  concentration ranges.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The pollutant concentration must fall within the specified  range as measured by the reference method.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The measurements shall be made in the sequence specified in  table C-2 of this subpart, except for the 1-hour SO2  measurements, which are all in the high range.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each pair of measurements, determine the difference  (discrepancy) between the candidate method measurement and reference  method measurement. A discrepancy which exceeds the discrepancy  specified in table C-1 of this subpart constitutes a failure. Figure C-1  of this subpart contains a suggested format for reporting the test  results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The results of the first set of measurements shall be  interpreted as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Zero failures: The candidate method passes the test for  comparability.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Three or more failures: The candidate method fails the test for  comparability.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> One or two failures: Conduct a second set of simultaneous  measurements as specified in table C-1 of this subpart. The results of  the combined total of first-set and second-set measurements shall be  interpreted as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> One or two failures: The candidate method passes the test for  comparability.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Three or more failures: The candidate method fails the test for  comparability.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For SO2, the 1-hour and 24-hour measurements shall  be interpreted separately, and the candidate method must pass the tests  for both 1- and 24-hour measurements to pass the test for comparability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A 1-hour measurement consists of the integral of the  instantaneous concentration over a 60-minute continuous period divided  by the time period. Integration of the instantaneous concentration may  be performed by any appropriate means such as chemical, electronic,  mechanical, visual judgment, or by calculating the mean of not less than  12 equally-spaced instantaneous readings. Appropriate allowances or  corrections shall be made in cases where significant errors could occur  due to characteristic lag time or rise/fall time differences between the  candidate and reference methods. Details of the means of integration and  any corrections shall be submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A 24-hour measurement consists of the integral of the  instantaneous concentration over a 24-hour continuous period divided by  the time period. This integration may be performed by any appropriate  means such as chemical, electronic, mechanical, or by calculating the  mean of twenty-four (24) sequential 1-hour measurements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For O3 and CO, no more than six 1-hour measurements  shall be made per day. For SO2, no more than four 1-hour  measurements or one 24-hour measurement shall be made per day. One-hour  measurements may be made concurrently with 24-hour measurements if  appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For applicable methods, control or calibration checks may be  performed once per day without adjusting the test analyzer or method.  These checks may be used as a basis for a linear interpolation-type  correction to be applied to the measurements to correct for drift. If  such a correction is used, it shall be applied to all measurements made  with the method, and the correction procedure shall become a part of the  method.
