                                Sec. 411.355  What payment options does a State VR agency have?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Ticket to Work program provides different payment options that are available to a State VR agency for providing services to disabled beneficiaries who have a ticket. A State VR agency participates in the program in one of two ways when providing services to a particular disabled beneficiary under the program. On a case-by-case basis, the State VR agency may participate either--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As an employment network (EN); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under the cost reimbursement payment system (see subpart V of part 404 and subpart V of part 416 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the State VR agency serves a beneficiary with a ticket as an EN, the State VR agency will use the EN payment system it has elected for this purpose, either the outcome payment system or the outcome-milestone payment system (described in subpart H of this part). The State VR agency will have periodic opportunities to change the payment system it uses when serving as an EN.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The State VR agency may seek payment only under its elected EN payment system whenever it serves as an EN. When serving a beneficiary who does not have a ticket that can be assigned pursuant to Sec. 411.140, the State VR agency may seek payment only under the cost reimbursement payment system.
