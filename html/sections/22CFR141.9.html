                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Decisions on record or review by the responsible Department official. The applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with the officer presiding at the hearing briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any. The officer presiding at the hearing shall render a decision on the matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Decisions on record where a hearing is waived. Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to Sec. 141.8(a) a decision shall be made by the responsible Departmental official on the record and a copy of such decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rulings required. Each decision of an officer presiding at the hearing shall set forth his ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Appeal. Either party may appeal from a decision of the officer presiding at the hearing to the responsible Department official within 30 days of the mailing of the officer's decision. In the absence of such an appeal the decision of the officer presiding at the hearings shall constitute the final decision of the Department subject to paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Approval by Secretary. Any final decision by an officer (other than the Secretary) which provides for the suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, or the imposition of any other sanction available under this part or the Act, shall promptly be transmitted to the Secretary who may approve such decision, may vacate it, or remit or mitigate any sanction imposed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Content of orders. The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to this part, or to have otherwise failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the responsible Department official that it will fully comply with this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Post-termination proceedings. (1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this regulation and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this regulation and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the responsible Departmental official to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information establishing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the responsible Departmental official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility, but such determination shall be in writing and shall be supported by evidence and findings of fact which shall be retained by the Department.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the responsible Departmental official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible Departmental official. The burden of substantiating compliance with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section shall be on the applicant or recipient. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.
