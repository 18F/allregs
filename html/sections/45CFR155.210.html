Standards that would prevent the application of the provisions of title I of the Affordable Care Act include but are not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Except as otherwise provided under Sec. 155.705(d), requirements that Navigators refer consumers to other entities not required to provide fair, accurate, and impartial information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Except as otherwise provided under Sec. 155.705(d), requirements that would prevent Navigators from providing services to all persons to whom they are required to provide assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Requirements that would prevent Navigators from providing advice regarding substantive benefits or comparative benefits of different health plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Requiring that a Navigator hold an agent or broker license or imposing any requirement that, in effect, would require all Navigators in the Exchange to be licensed agents or brokers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Imposing standards that would, as applied or as implemented in a

State, prevent the application of Federal requirements applicable to Navigator entities or individuals or applicable to the Exchange's implementation of the Navigator program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Not have a conflict of interest during the term as Navigator; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Comply with the privacy and security standards adopted by the Exchange as required in accordance with Sec. 155.260.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Exchange must include an entity as described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section and an entity from at least one of the other following categories for receipt of a Navigator grant:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Community and consumer-focused nonprofit groups;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Trade, industry, and professional associations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Commercial fishing industry organizations, ranching and farming organizations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Chambers of commerce;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Unions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Resource partners of the Small Business Administration;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Licensed agents and brokers; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Other public or private entities or individuals that meet the requirements of this section.

The Exchange must establish a reasonable retention period for maintaining these records. In Federally-facilitated Exchanges, this period is no less than six years, unless a different and longer retention period has already been provided under other applicable Federal law; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> May revoke at any time the authorization provided the Navigator pursuant to paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Maintain a physical presence in the Exchange service area, so that face-to-face assistance can be provided to applicants and enrollees. In a Federally-facilitated Exchange, no individual or entity shall be ineligible to operate as a Navigator solely because its principal place of business is outside of the Exchange service area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Funding for Navigator grants. Funding for Navigator grants may not be from Federal funds received by the State to establish the Exchange.
