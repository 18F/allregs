Owners or operators of these affected sources shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section using either stripping technology, or control or recovery devices. The organic HAP emissions from all back-end process operations at affected sources producing butyl rubber, epichlorohydrin elastomer, neoprene, and nitrile butadiene rubber shall not exceed the limits determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For styrene butadiene rubber produced by the emulsion process:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A monthly weighted average of 0.40 kg styrene per megagram (Mg) latex for existing affected sources; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A monthly weighted average of 0.23 kg styrene per Mg latex for new sources;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For polybutadiene rubber and styrene butadiene rubber produced by the solution process:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A monthly weighted average of 10 kg total organic HAP per Mg crumb rubber (dry weight) for existing affected sources; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A monthly weighted average of 6 kg total organic HAP per Mg crumb rubber (dry weight) for new sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For ethylene-propylene rubber produced by the solution process:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A monthly weighted average of 8 kg total organic HAP per Mg crumb rubber (dry weight) for existing affected sources; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A monthly weighted average of 5 kg total organic HAP per Mg crumb rubber (dry weight) for new sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The organic HAP emissions from back-end processes at affected sources producing butyl rubber, epichlorohydrin elastomer, neoprene, and nitrile butadiene rubber shall not exceed the limits determined in accordance with paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section for any consecutive 12-month period.
