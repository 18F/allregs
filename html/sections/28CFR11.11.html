                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Debt. Debt means money owed by an individual, organization or entity from sources which include loans insured or guaranteed by the United States and all other amounts due the United States from fees, leases, services, overpayments, civil and criminal penalties, damages, interest, fines, administrative costs, and all other similar sources. A debt becomes eligible for tax refund offset procedures if it cannot currently be collected pursuant to the salary offset procedures of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1) and is ineligible for administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by reason of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2), or cannot currently be collected by administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) against amounts payable to the debtor by the Department of Justice. A non-judgment debt is eligible for tax refund offset procedures if the Department's or the referring agency's right of action accrued more than three months but less than ten years before the offset is made. Judgment debts are eligible for referral at any time. Debts that have been referred to the Department of Justice by other agencies for collection are included in this definition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Past due. All accelerated debts and all judgment debts are past due for purposes of this section. Such debts remain past due until paid in full. An accelerated debt is past due if, at the time of the notice required by Sec.  11.12(b), any part of the debt had been due, but not paid, for at least 90 days. Such an unaccelerated debt remains past due until paid to the current amount of indebtedness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice. Notice means the information sent to the debtor pursuant to Sec.  11.12(b). The date of the notice is the date shown on the notice letter as its date of issuance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Dispute. A dispute is a written statement supported by documentation or other evidence that all or part of an alleged debt is not past due or legally enforceable, that the amount is not the amount currently owed, that the outstanding debt has been satisfied, or, in the case of a debt reduced to judgment, that the judgment has been satisfied or stayed.</p>
