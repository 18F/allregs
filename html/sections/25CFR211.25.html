In instances of irregular surveys, including lands not surveyed under the United States Governmental survey, lands shall be considered in multiples of 40 acres or the nearest aliquot equivalent thereof. The Secretary may, upon application and with the consent of the Indian mineral owner, approve the issuance of a single lease for more than 2,560 acres, in a reasonably compact form, upon a finding that the issuance is in the best interest of the lessor.
