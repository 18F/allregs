                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section provides the test procedure for measuring,  pursuant to EPCA, the water consumption flow rate of commercial prerinse  spray valves.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Testing and Calculations. The test procedure to determine the  water consumption flow rate for prerinse spray valves, expressed in  gallons per minute (gpm) or liters per minute (L/min), shall be  conducted in accordance with the test requirements specified in sections  4.1 and 4.2 (Summary of Test Method), 5.1 (Significance and Use), 6.1  through 6.9 (Apparatus) except 6.5, 9.1 through 9.5 (Preparation of  Apparatus), and 10.1 through 10.2.5. (Procedure), and calculations in  accordance with sections 11.1 through 11.3.2 (Calculation and Report) of  ASTM F2324-03 (2009), (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.263).  Perform only the procedures pertinent to the measurement of flow rate.  Record measurements at the resolution of the test instrumentation. Round  off calculations to the same number of significant digits as the  previous step. Round the final water consumption value to one decimal  place as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A fractional number at or above the midpoint between two  consecutive decimal places shall be rounded up to the higher of the two  decimal places; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A fractional number below the midpoint between two consecutive  decimal places shall be rounded down to the lower of the two decimal  places.
