Except for good cause shown, a motion for leave to intervene shall be submitted not later than 10 days before the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the administrative law judge finds that intervention will not unduly broaden the issues or delay the proceedings, the administrative law judge may grant a motion for leave to intervene if the person will be bound by any order or decision entered in the action or the person has a property, financial, or other legitimate interest that may not be addressed adequately by the parties. The administrative law judge may determine the extent to which an intervenor may participate in the proceedings.</p>
