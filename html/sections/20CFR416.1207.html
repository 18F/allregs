                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Resources determinations are made as of the first  moment of the month. A resource determination is based on what assets an  individual has, what their values are, and whether or not they are  excluded as of the first moment of the month.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Increase in value of resources. If, during a month, a resource  increases in value or an individual acquires an additional resource or  replaces an excluded resource with one that is not excluded, the  increase in the value of the resources is counted as of the first moment  of the next month</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Decrease in value of resources. If, during a month, a resource  decreases in value or an individual spends a resource or replaces a  resource that is not excluded with one that is excluded, the decrease in  the value of the resources is counted as of the first moment of the next  month.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Treatment of items under income and resource counting rules.  Items received in cash or in kind during a month are evaluated first  under the income counting rules and, if retained until the first moment  of the following   month, are subject to the rules for counting resources at that time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Receipts from the sale, exchange, or replacement of a resource.  If an individual sells, exchanges or replaces a resource, the receipts  are not income. They are still considered to be a resource. This rule  includes resources that have never been counted as such because they  were sold, exchanged or replaced in the month in which they were  received. See Sec. 416.1246 for the rule on resources disposed of for  less than fair market value (including those disposed of during the  month of receipt).</p><p class="depth2">Example: Miss L., a disabled individual, receives a $350  unemployment insurance benefit on January 10, 1986. The benefit is  unearned income to Miss L. when she receives it. On January 14, Miss L.  uses the $350 payment to purchase shares of stock. Miss L. has exchanged  one item (cash) for another item (stock). The $350 payment is never  counted as a resource to Miss L. because she exchanged it in the same  month she received it. The stock is not income; it is a different form  of a resource exchanged for the cash. Since a resource is not countable  until the first moment of the month following its receipt, the stock is  not a countable resource to Miss L. until February 1.  [52 FR 4283, Feb. 11, 1987]</p>
