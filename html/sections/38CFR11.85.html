                            <p class="depth0">In order to be eligible for redemption by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the note and certificate must be accompanied by an affidavit of a duly authorized officer (the capacity in which the officer serves must be shown) of the lending bank showing that the said bank has not charged or collected, or attempted to charge or collect, directly or indirectly, any fee or other compensation in respect of the loan, or any other loan made by the bank under the provisions of section 502 of the World War Adjusted Compensation Act, except the rate of interest specified in the section of the Act cited; that the person who obtained the loan is known to the lending bank to be the person named in the Adjusted Service Certificate; and that notice required by Sec.  11.77 was promptly given. In case the note was sold or discounted by the lending

bank, there should be incorporated in the affidavit a statement that the veteran was notified promptly of the transfer by mail to his last known address. In case the note was resold or rediscounted by any other bank, affidavit shall be made by a duly authorized officer of such bank that proper notice of such resale or rediscount was promptly mailed to the veteran at his last known address. The proper execution of the appropriate affidavit on Form 6615 or 6615a will be considered as a compliance with the requirements of this section. A single affidavit setting forth the full particulars may be accepted to cover any number of veterans' notes submitted for redemption at one time. The affidavit must be executed before a judge of the United States court, a United States commissioner, a United States district attorney, a United States marshal, a collector of internal revenue, a collector of customs, a United States postmaster, a clerk of court of record under the seal of the court, an executive officer of an incorporated bank or trust company, under his official designation and the seal of the bank or trust company, or a notary public under his seal, or a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States, under his official seal.</p><p class="depth0">Disposition of Notes Secured by Adjusted Certificates Redeemed from</p><p class="depth0">Banks by the Department of Veterans Affairs Under Section 502 of the</p><p class="depth0">World War Adjusted Compensation Act, as Amended (Pub.
