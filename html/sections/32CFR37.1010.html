                                Sec. 37.1010  What substantive issues should my award document address?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">You necessarily will design and negotiate a TIA individually to meet  the specific requirements of the particular project, so the complete  list of substantive issues that you will address in the award document  may vary. Every award document must address:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a))</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Project management. You should describe the nature of the  relationship between the Federal Government and the recipient; the  relationship among the participants, if the recipient is an  unincorporated consortium; and the overall technical and administrative  management of the project. TIAs are used to carry out collaborative  relationships between the Federal Government and the recipient.  Consequently, there must be substantial involvement of the DoD program  official (see Sec. 37.220) and usually the administrative agreements  officer. The program official provides technical insight, which differs  from the usual technical oversight of a project. The management  provision also should discuss how you and the recipient will make any  modifications to the TIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Termination, enforcement, and disputes. Your TIA must provide  for termination, enforcement remedies, and disputes and appeals  procedures, in accordance with Sec. 37.925.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Funding. You must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Show the total amount of the agreement and the total period of  performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the TIA is an expenditure-based award, state the Government's  and recipient's agreed-upon cost shares. The award document should  identify values for any in-kind contributions, determined in accordance  with Secs. 37.530 through 37.555, to preclude later disagreements about  them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specify the amount of Federal funds obligated and the  performance period for those obligated funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> State, if the agreement is to be incrementally funded, that the  Government's obligation for additional funding is contingent upon the  availability of funds and that no legal obligation on the part of the  Government exists until additional funds are made available and the  agreement is amended. You also must include a prior approval requirement  for changes in plans requiring additional Government funding, in  accordance with Sec. 37.825.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Payment. You must choose the payment method and tell the  recipient how, when, and where to submit payment requests, as discussed  in Secs. 37.805 through 37.815. Your payment method must take into  account sound cash management practices by avoiding unwarranted cash  advances. For an expenditure-based TIA, your payment provision must  require the return of interest should excess cash balances occur, in  accordance with Sec. 37.820. For any TIA using the milestone payment  method described in Sec. 37.805(c), you must include language notifying  the recipient that post-award administrators may adjust amounts of  future milestone payments if a project's expenditures fall too far below  the projections that were the basis for setting the amounts (see  Sec. 37.575(c) and Sec. 37.1105(c)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Records retention and access to records. You must include the  records retention requirement at Sec. 37.910. You also must provide for  access to for-profit and nonprofit participants' records, in accordance  with Sec. 37.915 and Sec. 37.920.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Patents and data rights. In designing the patents and data  rights provision, you must set forth the minimum required Federal  Government rights in intellectual property generated under the award and  address related matters, as provided in Secs. 37.840 through 37.875. It   is important to define all essential terms in the patent rights  provision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Foreign access to technology. You must include a provision, in  accordance with Sec. 37.875, concerning foreign access and domestic  manufacture of products using technology generated under the award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Title to, management of, and disposition of tangible property.  Your property provisions for for-profit and nonprofit participants must  be in accordance with Secs. 37.685 through 37.700.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Financial management systems. For an expenditure-based award,  you must specify the minimum standards for financial management systems  of both for-profit and nonprofit participants, in accordance with  Secs. 37.615 and 37.620.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Allowable costs. If the TIA is an expenditure-based award, you  must specify the standards that both for-profit and nonprofit  participants are to use to determine which costs may be charged to the  project, in accordance with Secs. 37.625 through 37.635, as well as  Sec. 37.830.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Audits. If your TIA is an expenditure-based award, you must  include an audit provision for both for-profit and nonprofit  participants and subrecipients, in accordance with Secs. 37.640 through  37.670 and Sec. 37.680.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Purchasing system standards. You should include a provision  specifying the standards in Secs. 37.705 and 37.710 for purchasing  systems of for-profit and nonprofit participants, respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Program income. You should specify requirements for program  income, in accordance with Sec. 37.835.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Financial and programmatic reporting. You must specify the  reports that the recipient is required to submit and tell the recipient  when and where to submit them, in accordance with Secs. 37.880 through  37.905.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Assurances for applicable national policy requirements. You must  incorporate assurances of compliance with applicable requirements in  Federal statutes, Executive orders, or regulations (except for national  policies that require certifications). Appendix D to this part contains  a list of commonly applicable requirements that you need to augment with  any specific requirements that apply in your particular circumstances  (e.g., general provisions in the appropriations act for the specific  funds that you are obligating).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Other routine matters. The agreement should address any other  issues that need clarification, including who in the Government will be  responsible for post-award administration and the statutory authority or  authorities for entering into the TIA (see appendix B to this part for a  discussion of statutory authorities). In addition, the agreement must  specify that it takes precedence over any inconsistent terms and  conditions in collateral documents such as attachments to the TIA or the  recipient's articles of collaboration.</p>
