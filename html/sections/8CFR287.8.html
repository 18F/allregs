(i) Non-deadly force is any use of force other than that which is considered deadly force as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Non-deadly force may be used only when a designated immigration officer, as listed in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section, has reasonable grounds to believe that such force is necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A designated immigration officer shall always use the minimum non-deadly force necessary to accomplish the officer's mission and shall escalate to a higher level of non-deadly force only when such higher level of force is warranted by the actions, apparent intentions, and apparent capabilities of the suspect, prisoner, or assailant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The following immigration officers who have successfully completed basic immigration law enforcement training are hereby authorized and designated to exercise the power conferred by section 287(a) of the Act to use non-deadly force should circumstances warrant it:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Border patrol agents, including aircraft pilots;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special agents;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Deportation officers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Detention enforcement officers or immigration enforcement agents;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Immigration inspectors;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Adjudications officers when in the uniform of an immigration inspector and performing inspections or supervising other immigration inspectors performing inspections;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Supervisory and managerial personnel who are responsible for supervising the activities of those officers listed in this paragraph; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Immigration officers who need the authority to use non-deadly force under section 287(a) of the Act in order to effectively accomplish their individual missions and who are designated, individually or as a class, by the Commissioner of CBP or the Assistant Secretary for ICE.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Deadly force. (i) Deadly force is any use of force that is likely to cause death or serious physical injury.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Deadly force may be used only when a designated immigration officer, as listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, has reasonable grounds to believe that such force is necessary to protect the designated immigration officer or other persons from the imminent danger of death or serious physical injury.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The following immigration officers who have successfully completed basic immigration law enforcement training are hereby authorized and designated to exercise the power conferred by section 287(a) of the Act to use deadly force should circumstances warrant it:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Border patrol agents, including aircraft pilots;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special agents;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Deportation officers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Detention enforcement officers or immigration enforcement agents;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Immigration inspectors;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Adjudications officers when in the uniform of an immigration inspector and performing inspections or supervising other immigration inspectors performing inspections;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Supervisory and managerial personnel who are responsible for supervising the activities of those officers listed above; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Immigration officers who need the authority to use deadly force under section 287(a) of the Act in order to effectively accomplish their individual missions and who are designated, individually or as a class, by the Commissioner of CBP or the Assistant Secretary for ICE.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Interrogation and detention not amounting to arrest. (1) Interrogation is questioning designed to elicit specific information. An immigration officer, like any other person, has the right to ask questions of anyone as long as the immigration officer does not restrain the freedom of an individual, not under arrest, to walk away.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the immigration officer has a reasonable suspicion, based on specific articulable facts, that the person being questioned is, or is attempting to be, engaged in an offense against the United States or is an alien illegally in the United States, the immigration officer may briefly detain the person for questioning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Information obtained from this questioning may provide the basis for a

subsequent arrest, which must be effected only by a designated immigration officer, as listed in 8 CFR 287.5(c). The conduct of arrests is specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Conduct of arrests--(1) Authority.

It is the duty of the immigration officer to assure that the warnings are given in a language the subject understands, and that the subject acknowledges that the warnings are understood. The fact that a person has been advised of his or her rights shall be documented on appropriate Department forms and made a part of the arrest record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Every person arrested and charged with a criminal violation of the laws of the United States shall be brought without unnecessary delay before a United States magistrate judge, a United States district judge or, if necessary, a judicial officer empowered in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 3041 to commit persons charged with such crimes. Accordingly, the immigration officer shall contact an Assistant United States Attorney to arrange for an initial appearance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The use of threats, coercion, or physical abuse by the designated immigration officer to induce a suspect to waive his or her rights or to make a statement is prohibited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Transportation--(1) Vehicle transportation. All persons will be transported in a manner that ensures the safety of the persons being transported. When persons arrested or detained are being transported by vehicle, each person will be searched as thoroughly as circumstances permit before being placed in the vehicle. The person being transported shall not be handcuffed to the frame or any part of the moving vehicle or an object in the moving vehicle. The person being transported shall not be left unattended during transport unless the immigration officer needs to perform a law enforcement function.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Airline transportation. Escorting officers must abide by all Federal Aviation Administration, Transportation Security Administration, and airline carrier rules and regulations pertaining to weapons and the transportation of prisoners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Vehicular pursuit. (1) A vehicular pursuit is an active attempt by a designated immigration officer, as listed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, in a designated pursuit vehicle to apprehend fleeing suspects who are attempting to avoid apprehension. A designated pursuit vehicle is defined as a vehicle equipped with emergency lights and siren, placed in or on the vehicle, that emit audible and visual signals in order to warn others that emergency law enforcement activities are in progress.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The following immigration officers who have successfully completed basic immigration law enforcement training are hereby authorized and designated to initiate a vehicular pursuit:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Border patrol agents, including aircraft pilots;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Supervisory personnel who are responsible for supervising the activities of those officers listed in this paragraph; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Immigration officers who need the authority to initiate a vehicular pursuit in order to effectively accomplish their individual mission and who are designated, individually or as a class, by the Commissioner of CBP or the Assistant Secretary for ICE.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Site inspections. (1) Site inspections are Border and Transportation Security Directorate enforcement activities undertaken to locate and identify aliens illegally in the United States, or aliens engaged in unauthorized employment, at locations where there is a reasonable suspicion, based on articulable facts, that such aliens are present.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An immigration officer may not enter into the non-public areas of a business, a residence including the curtilage of such residence, or a farm or other outdoor agricultural operation, except as provided in section 287(a)(3) of the Act, for the purpose of questioning the occupants or employees concerning their right to be or remain in the United States unless the officer has either a warrant or the consent of the owner or other person in control of the site to be inspected. When consent to enter is given, the immigration officer must note on the officer's report that consent was given and, if possible, by whom consent was given. If the immigration officer is denied access to conduct a site inspection, a warrant may be obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Adequate records must be maintained noting the results of every site inspection, including those where no illegal aliens are located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Nothing in this section prohibits an immigration officer from entering into any area of a business or other activity to which the general public has access or onto open fields that are not farms or other outdoor agricultural operations without a warrant, consent, or any particularized suspicion in order to question any person whom the officer believes to be an alien concerning his or her right to be or remain in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Guidelines. The criminal law enforcement authorities authorized under this part will be exercised in a manner consistent with all applicable guidelines and policies of the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security.
