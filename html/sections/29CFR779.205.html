                                Sec. 779.205  Enterprise must consist of ``related activities.''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The enterprise must consist of certain ``related activities''  performed for a common business purpose; activities which are not  ``related'' are not a part of the enterprise even if performed by the  same employer. Moreover, even if activities are ``related'' they may be  excluded from the enterprise if they are performed only ``for'' the  enterprise and not as a part of it by an independent contractor. This is  discussed separately in Sec. 779.206.</p>
