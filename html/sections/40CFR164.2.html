The Administrator delegates authority to the Environmental Appeals Board to issue final decisions in appeals filed under subparts B and C of this part. An appeal directed to the Administrator, rather than to the Environmental Appeals Board, will not be considered. This delegation does not preclude the Environmental Appeals Board from referring an appeal or a motion under subparts B and C to the Administrator when the Environmental Appeals Board, in its discretion, deems it appropriate to do so. When an appeal or motion is referred to the Administrator, all of the parties shall be so notified and the rules in subparts B and C referring to the Environmental Appeals Board shall be interpreted as referring to the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The term Expedited Hearing means a hearing commenced as the result of the issuance of a notice of intention to suspend or the suspension of a registration of a pesticide by an emergency order, and is limited to a consideration as to whether a pesticide presents an imminent hazard which justifies such suspension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The term Hearing means a public hearing which is conducted pursuant to the provisions of chapter 5, subchapter II of title 5 of the United States Code and the regulations of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The term Hearing Clerk means the Hearing Clerk, Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC 20460.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The term Initial Decision means the decision of the Administrative Law Judge supported by findings of fact and conclusions regarding all material

issues of law, fact, or discretion, as well as reasons therefor. Such decision shall become the final decision and order of the Administrator without further proceedings unless an appeal therefrom is taken or the Administrator orders review thereof as herein provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> The term Judicial Officer means an officer or employee of the Agency designated as a judicial officer, pursuant to these rules, who shall meet the qualifications and perform functions as herein provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Office. There may be designated for the Agency one or more judicial officers, one of whom may be Chief Judicial Officer. As work requires, there may be a judicial officer designated to act for the purpose of a particular case. All prior designations of judicial officer shall stay in force until further notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Qualification. A judicial officer shall be a permanent or temporary employee or officer of the Agency who may perform other duties for the Agency. Such judicial officer shall not be employed by the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention or have any connection with the preparation or presentation of evidence for a hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Functions. The Administrator may delegate any or part of his authority to act in a given case under subparts B and C of this part to a judicial officer. The Administrator can separately delegate his authority to rule on interlocutory orders and motions, and may also delegate his authority to make findings of fact and draw conclusions of law in a particular proceeding, providing that this delegation shall not preclude the Judicial Officer from referring any motion or case to the Administrator when the Judicial Officer determines such referral to be appropriate. The Administrator, in deciding a case himself, may consult with and assign the preliminary drafting of conclusions of law and findings of fact to any judicial officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> The term Party means any person, group, organization, or Federal agency or department that participates in a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> The term Person includes any individual, partnership, association, corporation, and any organized group of persons, whether incorporated or not.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> The term Petitioner means any person adversely affected by a notice of the Administrator who requests a public hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> The term Presiding Officer means any person designated by the Administrator to conduct an expedited hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> The term Recommended Decision means the recommended findings and conclusions of the Presiding Officer in an expedited hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> The term Registrant means any person who has registered a pesticide pursuant to the provisions of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> The term Respondent means the Assistant Administrator of the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention.
