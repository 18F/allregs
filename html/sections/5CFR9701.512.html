Neither the HSLRB nor the Authority may intervene in this process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The parties will meet at reasonable times and places but for no longer than 30 days, including any voluntary third party assistance, unless the parties mutually agree to extend this period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nothing in the process established under this section will delay the exercise of a management right under Sec. 9701.511(a)(1) and (2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Management retains the sole, exclusive, and unreviewable discretion to determine the procedures that it will observe in exercising the authorities set forth in Sec. 9701.511(a)(1) and (2) and to deviate from such procedures, as necessary.</p>
