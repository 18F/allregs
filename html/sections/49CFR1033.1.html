Such election shall be effective only in accordance with the following provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An election shall be irrevocable and binding as to the rail carrier making the election and all users and subsequent owners if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The rail carrier making the election has legal title to the car; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The rail carrier making the election does not have legal title to the car but obtains written consent for such election from the party holding legal title; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The transaction pursuant to which the party holding legal title to the car has furnished the car to the rail carrier making the election was entered into after January 1, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An election shall be irrevocable and binding only for the term of the transaction pursuant to which the car was furnished to the rail carrier making the election as to that rail carrier and all users and subsequent owners if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> That rail carrier does not have legal title to the car and does not obtain written consent or such election from the party holding legal title;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The transaction was entered into prior to January 1, 1991; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The transaction does not provide that the compensation to be paid to the party furnishing the car is to be based in whole or in part directly on

the car hire earnings of the car; provided, however, that if the rail carrier making the election subsequently obtains legal title to the car, such election shall then be irrevocable and binding as to the rail carrier and all users and subsequent owners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The party holding legal title to the car may revoke an election subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section only:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> At the time the transaction pursuant to which the car was furnished to the rail carrier making the election is first extended or renewed after January 1, 1991; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If such transaction is not extended or renewed, at the time such transaction terminates.
If such election is so revoked, a rail carrier may make a new election only with the written consent of the party holding legal title to the car, and such election shall be irrevocable and binding as to the rail carrier making the election and all users and subsequent owners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Nothing in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section shall be construed to limit the rights of parties to any transaction to provide for the consent of any party to an election made pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Market rate cars.

The Board may review allegations of abuse of the car hire dispute resolution process established under those rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Car hire disputes involving an owner or user not a party to that agreement may be resolved by the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Car hire agreements.
