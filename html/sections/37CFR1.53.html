                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application number. Any papers received in the Patent and Trademark Office which purport to be an application for a patent will be assigned an application number for identification purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application filing requirements--Nonprovisional application. The filing date of an application for patent filed under this section, other than an application for a design patent or a provisional application under paragraph (c) of this section, is the date on which a specification, with or without claims, is received in the Office. The filing date of an application for a design patent filed under this section, except for a continued prosecution application under paragraph (d) of this section, is the date on which the specification as prescribed by 35 U.S.C. 112, including at least one claim, and any required drawings are received in the Office. No new matter may be introduced into an application after its filing date. A continuing application, which may be a continuation, divisional, or continuation-in-part application, may be filed under the conditions specified in 35 U.S.C. 120, 121, 365(c), or 386(c) and Sec.  1.78.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A continuation or divisional application that names as inventors the same or fewer than all of the inventors named in the prior application may be filed under this paragraph or paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A continuation-in-part application (which may disclose and claim subject matter not disclosed in the prior application) or a continuation or divisional application naming an inventor not named in the prior application must be filed under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application filing requirements--Provisional application. The filing date of a provisional application is the date on which a specification, with or without claims, is received in the Office. No amendment, other than to make the provisional application comply with the patent statute and all applicable regulations, may be made to the provisional application after the filing date of the provisional application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A provisional application must also include the cover sheet required by Sec.  1.51(c)(1), which may be an application data sheet (Sec.  1.76), or a cover letter identifying the application as a provisional application. Otherwise, the application will be treated as an application filed under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An application for patent filed under paragraph (b) of this section may

be converted to a provisional application and be accorded the original filing date of the application filed under paragraph (b) of this section. The grant of such a request for conversion will not entitle applicant to a refund of the fees that were properly paid in the application filed under paragraph (b) of this section. Such a request for conversion must be accompanied by the processing fee set forth in Sec.  1.17(q) and be filed prior to the earliest of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Abandonment of the application filed under paragraph (b) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Payment of the issue fee on the application filed under paragraph (b) of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Expiration of twelve months after the filing date of the application filed under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A provisional application filed under paragraph (c) of this section may be converted to a nonprovisional application filed under paragraph (b) of this section and accorded the original filing date of the provisional application. The conversion of a provisional application to a nonprovisional application will not result in either the refund of any fee properly paid in the provisional application or the application of any such fee to the filing fee, or any other fee, for the nonprovisional application. Conversion of a provisional application to a nonprovisional application under this paragraph will result in the term of any patent to issue from the application being measured from at least the filing date of the provisional application for which conversion is requested. Thus, applicants should consider avoiding this adverse patent term impact by filing a nonprovisional application claiming the benefit of the provisional application under 35 U.S.C. 119(e), rather than converting the provisional application into a nonprovisional application pursuant to this paragraph. A request to convert a provisional application to a nonprovisional application must be accompanied by the fee set forth in Sec.  1.17(i) and an amendment including at least one claim as prescribed by 35 U.S.C. 112(b), unless the provisional application under paragraph (c) of this section otherwise contains at least one claim as prescribed by 35 U.S.C. 112(b). The nonprovisional application resulting from conversion of a provisional application must also include the filing fee, search fee, and examination fee for a nonprovisional application, and the surcharge required by Sec.  1.16(f) if either the basic filing fee for a nonprovisional application or the inventor's oath or declaration was not present on the filing date accorded the resulting nonprovisional application (i.e., the filing date of the original provisional application). A request to convert a provisional application to a nonprovisional application must also be filed prior to the earliest of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Abandonment of the provisional application filed under paragraph (c) of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Expiration of twelve months after the filing date of the provisional application filed under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A provisional application is not entitled to the right of priority under 35 U.S.C. 119, 365(a), or 386(a) or Sec.  1.55, or to the benefit of an earlier filing date under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121, 365(c), or 386(c) or Sec.  1.78 of any other application. No claim for priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) or Sec.  1.78(a) may be made in a design application based on a provisional application. The requirements of Sec. Sec.  1.821 through 1.825 regarding application disclosures containing nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences are not mandatory for provisional applications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application filing requirements--Continued prosecution (nonprovisional) application. (1) A continuation or divisional application (but not a continuation-in-part) of a prior nonprovisional application may be filed as a continued prosecution application under this paragraph, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A continuation or divisional application (but not a continuation-in-part) of a prior nonprovisional application may be filed as a continued prosecution application under this paragraph, provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The application is for a design patent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The prior nonprovisional application is a design application, but not an international design application, that is complete as defined by Sec.  1.51(b), except for the inventor's oath or declaration if the application is filed on or after September 16, 2012, and the prior nonprovisional application contains an application data sheet meeting the conditions specified in Sec.  1.53(f)(3)(i); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The application under this paragraph is filed before the earliest of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Payment of the issue fee on the prior application, unless a petition under Sec.  1.313(c) is granted in the prior application;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Abandonment of the prior application; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Termination of proceedings on the prior application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The filing date of a continued prosecution application is the date on which a request on a separate paper for an application under this paragraph is filed. An application filed under this paragraph:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Must identify the prior application;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Discloses and claims only subject matter disclosed in the prior application;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Names as inventors the same inventors named in the prior application on the date the application under this paragraph was filed, except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Includes the request for an application under this paragraph, will utilize the file jacket and contents of the prior application, including the specification, drawings and the inventor's oath or declaration from the prior application, to constitute the new application, and will be assigned the application number of the prior application for identification purposes; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Is a request to expressly abandon the prior application as of the filing date of the request for an application under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The filing fee, search fee, and examination fee for a continued prosecution application filed under this paragraph are the basic filing fee as set forth in Sec.  1.16(b), the search fee as set forth in Sec.  1.16(l), and the examination fee as set forth in Sec.  1.16(p).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An application filed under this paragraph may be filed by fewer than all the inventors named in the prior application, provided that the request for an application under this paragraph when filed is accompanied by a statement requesting deletion of the name or names of the person or persons who are not inventors of the invention being claimed in the new application. No person may be named as an inventor in an application filed under this paragraph who was not named as an inventor in the prior application on the date the application under this paragraph was filed, except by way of correction of inventorship under Sec.  1.48.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any new change must be made in the form of an amendment to the prior application as it existed prior to the filing of an application under this paragraph. No amendment in an application under this paragraph (a continued prosecution application) may introduce new matter or matter that would have been new matter in the prior application. Any new specification filed with the request for an application under this paragraph will not be considered part of the original application papers, but will be treated as a substitute specification in accordance with Sec.  1.125.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The filing of a continued prosecution application under this paragraph will be construed to include a waiver of confidentiality by the applicant under 35 U.S.C. 122 to the extent that any member of the public, who is entitled under the provisions of Sec.  1.14 to access to, copies of, or information concerning either the prior application or any continuing application filed under the provisions of this paragraph, may be given similar access to, copies of, or similar information concerning the other application or applications in the file jacket.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A request for an application under this paragraph is the specific reference required by 35 U.S.C. 120 to every application assigned the application number identified in such request. No amendment in an application under this paragraph may delete this specific reference to any prior application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> In addition to identifying the application number of the prior application, applicant should furnish in the request for an application under this paragraph the following information relating to the prior application to the best of his or her ability:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Title of invention;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Name of applicant(s); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Correspondence address.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> See Sec.  1.103(b) for requesting a limited suspension of action in an application filed under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Failure to meet filing date requirements.

section does not meet the requirements of such paragraph to be entitled to a filing date, applicant will be so notified, if a correspondence address has been provided, and given a period of time within which to correct the filing error. If, however, a request for an application under paragraph (d) of this section does not meet the requirements of that paragraph because the application in which the request was filed is not a design application, and if the application in which the request was filed was itself filed on or after June 8, 1995, the request for an application under paragraph (d) of this section will be treated as a request for continued examination under Sec.  1.114.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an application deposited under paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this
