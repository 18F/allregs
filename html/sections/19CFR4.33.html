                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Unlading at other than original port of destination. A vessel may unlade cargo or baggage at an alternative port of entry to the port of original destination if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is compelled by any cause to put into the alternative port and the director of that port issues a permit for the unlading of cargo or baggage; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As a result of an emergency existing at the port of destination, the port director authorizes the vessel to proceed in accordance with the residue cargo bond procedure to the alternative port. The owner or agent of the vessel shall apply for such authorization in writing, stating the reasons and agreeing to hold the port director and the Government harmless for the diversion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disposition of cargo or baggage at emergency port. Cargo and baggage unladen at the alternative port under the circumstances set forth in paragraph (a) of this section may be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Entered in the same manner as other imported cargo or baggage;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Treated as unclaimed and stored at the risk and expense of its owner; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reladen upon the same vessel without entry, for transportation to its original destination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Substitution of ports of discharge on manifest. After entry, the Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, of a vessel may be changed at any time to permit discharge of manifested cargo at any domestic port in lieu of any other port shown on the Cargo Declaration, if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A written application for the diversion is made on the amended Cargo Declaration by the master, owner, or agent of the vessel to the director of the port where the vessel is located, after entry of the vessel at that port;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An amended Cargo Declaration, under oath, covering the cargo, which it is desired to divert, is furnished in support of the application and is filed in such number of copies as the port director shall require for local Customs purposes; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The certified traveling manifest is not altered or added to in any way by the master, owner, or agent of the vessel. When an application under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is approved, the port director shall securely attach an approved copy of the amended manifest to the traveling manifest and shall send one copy of the amended Cargo Declaration to the director of the port where the vessel's bond was filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Retention of cargo on board for later return to the United States. If, as the result of a strike or other emergency at a United States port for which inward foreign cargo is manifested, it is desired to retain the cargo on board the vessel for discharge at a foreign port but with the purpose of having the cargo returned to the United States, an application may be made by the master, owner, or agent of the vessel to amend the vessel's Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, under a procedure similar to that described in paragraph (c) of this section, except that a foreign port shall be substituted for the domestic port of discharge. If the application is approved, it shall be handled in the same manner as an application filed under paragraph (c) of this section. However, before approving the application, the port director is authorized to require such bond as he deems necessary to insure that export control laws and regulations are not circumvented.
