                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. The requirements of this section apply to insular grants funded under section 106 of the Act. An insular area jurisdiction may choose to prepare program statements following either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The abbreviated consolidated plan procedures described in this subpart and in 24 CFR 91.235; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The complete consolidated plan procedures applicable to local governments, discussed at 24 CFR 91.200 through 91.230.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Proposed statement. An insular area jurisdiction shall prepare and publish a proposed statement and comply with the citizen participation requirements described in Sec. 570.441, if it submits an abbreviated consolidated plan under 24 CFR 91.235. The jurisdiction shall follow the citizen participation requirements of 24 CFR 91.105 and 91.100 (with the exception of Sec. 91.100(a)(4)), if it submits a complete consolidated plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Final statement. The insular area jurisdiction shall submit to HUD a final statement describing its community development objectives and activities. The statement also must include a priority nonhousing community development plan in accordance with 24 CFR 91.235. This final statement shall be submitted, together with the required certifications, to the appropriate field office in a form prescribed by HUD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Submission requirement. Each insular area jurisdiction shall submit its final statement to HUD no later than 45 days before the start of its program year. Each jurisdiction may choose the start date for the annual period of its program year that most closely fits its own needs. HUD may grant an extension of the submission deadline for good cause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Certifications. The insular area jurisdiction's final statement must be accompanied by appropriate certifications as further described under 24 CFR 91.225. The jurisdiction should submit all general certifications, as well as all program certifications for each program from which it receives funding, if it submits a complete consolidated plan. For insular area jurisdictions receiving CDBG funds under an abbreviated consolidated plan, these certifications shall include at a minimum:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The following general certifications described at Sec. 91.225(a) of this title: Affirmatively furthering fair housing; anti-displacement and relocation plan; drug-free workplace; anti-lobbying; authority of jurisdiction; consistency with plan; acquisition and relocation; and Section 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The following CDBG certifications described at Sec. 91.225(b) of this title: Citizen participation; community development plan; following a plan; use of funds; excessive force; compliance with anti-discrimination laws; compliance with lead-based paint procedures; and compliance with laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> HUD action on final statement. Following the review of the statement, HUD will promptly notify each jurisdiction of the action taken with regard to its statement. HUD will approve a grant if the jurisdiction's submissions

have been made and approved in accordance with 24 CFR part 91, and if the certifications required in such submissions are satisfactory to HUD. The certifications will be satisfactory to HUD for this purpose, unless HUD determines pursuant to subpart O of this part that the jurisdiction has not complied with the requirements of this part, has failed to carry out its consolidated plan (or abbreviated consolidated plan) as provided under Sec. 570.903, or has determined that there is evidence, not directly involving the jurisdiction's past performance under this program, that tends to challenge in a substantial manner the jurisdiction's certification of future performance. If HUD makes any such determination, however, further assurances may be required to be submitted by the jurisdiction as HUD may deem warranted or necessary to find the jurisdiction's certification satisfactory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Reimbursement for pre-award costs. Insular area jurisdictions may request reimbursement for pre-award costs in accordance with Sec. 570.200(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Float funding. An insular area jurisdiction may use undisbursed funds in the line of credit and its CDBG program account that are budgeted in final statements or action plans for one or more activities that do not need the funds immediately, subject to the limitations described in Sec. 570.301(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Program amendments. (1) The insular area jurisdiction's citizen participation plan (see Sec. 570.441) must specify the criteria the jurisdiction will use for determining what changes in the jurisdiction's planned or actual activities will constitute a substantial amendment to its final statement. It must include changes in the use of CDBG funds from one eligible activity to another among the changes that qualify as a substantial amendment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The citizen participation plan must provide citizens with reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment on substantial amendments. The citizen participation plan must state how reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment will be given, as well as provide a period of not less than 30 days to receive comments on the substantial amendment before the amendment is implemented.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The citizen participation plan shall require the jurisdiction to consider comments or views of citizens received in writing, or orally at public hearings, if any, in preparing the substantial amendment of its statement. A summary of comments or views not accepted and the reasons for non-acceptance shall be attached to the substantial amendment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any program amendment, regardless of whether it is considered to be substantial, must be fully documented in the jurisdiction's records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Performance reports. Each insular area jurisdiction must submit annual performance reports in accordance with 24 CFR 91.520.
