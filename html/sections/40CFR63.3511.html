                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Semiannual compliance reports. You must submit semiannual compliance reports for each affected source according to the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section. The semiannual compliance reporting requirements may be satisfied by reports required under other parts of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Dates. Unless the Administrator has approved a different schedule for submission of reports under Sec. 63.10(a), you must prepare and submit each semiannual compliance report according to the dates specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section. Note that the information reported for each of the months in the reporting period will be based on the last 12 months of data prior to the date of each monthly calculation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The first semiannual compliance report must cover the first semiannual reporting period which begins the day after the end of the initial compliance period described in Sec. 63.3520, Sec. 63.3530,

Sec. 63.3540, or Sec. 63.3550 that applies to your affected source and ends on June 30 or December 31, whichever occurs first following the end of the initial compliance period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each subsequent semiannual compliance report must cover the subsequent semiannual reporting period from January 1 through June 30 or the semiannual reporting period from July 1 through December 31.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each semiannual compliance report must be postmarked or delivered no later than July 31 or January 31, whichever date is the first date following the end of the semiannual reporting period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For each affected source that is subject to permitting regulations pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71, and if the permitting authority has established dates for submitting semiannual reports pursuant to 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), you may submit the first and subsequent compliance reports according to the dates the permitting authority has established instead of the date specified in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inclusion with title V report. Each affected source that has obtained a title V operating permit pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71 must report all deviations as defined in this subpart in the semiannual monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A). If an affected source submits a semiannual compliance report pursuant to this section along with, or as part of, the semiannual monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), and the semiannual compliance report includes all required information concerning deviations from any emission limitation in this subpart, its submission will be deemed to satisfy any obligation to report the same deviations in the semiannual monitoring report. However, submission of a semiannual compliance report shall not otherwise affect any obligation the affected source may have to report deviations from permit requirements to the permitting authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> General requirements. The semiannual compliance report must contain the information specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (v) of this section and the information specified in paragraphs (a)(4) through (7) and (c)(1) of this section that is applicable to your affected source.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Company name and address.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Statement by a responsible official with that official's name, title, and signature, certifying the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the content of the report.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Date of report and beginning and ending dates of the reporting period. The reporting period is the 6-month period ending on June 30 or December 31. Note that the information reported for each of the 6 months in the reporting period will be based on the last 12 months of data prior to the date of each monthly calculation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Identification of the compliance option or options specified in Sec. 63.3491 that you used on each coating operation during the reporting period. If you switched between compliance options during the reporting period, you must report the beginning and ending dates you used each option.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If you used the emission rate without add-on controls or the emission rate with add-on controls compliance option (Sec. 63.3491(b) or (c)), the calculation results for each rolling 12-month organic HAP emission rate during the 6-month reporting period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No deviations. If there were no deviations from the emission limitations, operating limits, or work practice standards in Sec. Sec. 63.3490, 63.3492, and 63.3493 that apply to you, the semiannual compliance report must include a statement that there were no deviations from the emission limitations during the reporting period. If you used the emission rate with add-on controls option or the control efficiency/outlet concentration option and there were no periods during which the continuous parameter monitoring systems (CPMS) were out of control as specified in Sec. 63.8(c)(7), the semiannual compliance report must include a statement that there were no periods during which the CPMS were out of control during the reporting period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Deviations: compliant material option. If you used the compliant material option and there was a deviation

from the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.3490, the semiannual compliance report must contain the information in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identification of each coating used that deviated from the emission limit, each thinner used that contained organic HAP, and the dates and time periods each was used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The calculation of the organic HAP content (using Equation 1 of Sec. 63.3521) for each coating identified in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section. You do not need to submit background data supporting this calculation (e.g., information provided by coating suppliers or manufacturers, or test reports).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The determination of mass fraction of organic HAP for each coating and thinner identified in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section. You do not need to submit background data supporting this calculation (e.g., information provided by material suppliers or manufacturers, or test reports).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A statement of the cause of each deviation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Deviations: emission rate without add-on controls option.
