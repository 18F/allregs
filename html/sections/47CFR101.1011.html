Failure by any licensee to meet this requirement will result in forfeiture of the license and the licensee will be ineligible to regain it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding shall receive a preference, commonly referred to as a renewal expectancy, that is the most important comparative factor to be considered in the proceeding as long as the applicant's past record for the relevant license period demonstrates that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The renewal applicant has provided ``substantial'' service during its past license term; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The renewal applicant has substantially complied with applicable FCC rules, policies, and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In order to establish its right to a renewal expectancy, an LMDS renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding must submit a showing explaining why it should receive a renewal expectancy. At a minimum, this showing must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of its current service in terms of geographic coverage and population served:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An explanation of its record of expansion, including a timetable of new construction to meet changes in demand for service:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of its investments in its LMDS system; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy; and a list of any pending proceedings that relate to any matter described in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In making its showing of entitlement to a renewal expectancy, a renewal applicant may claim credit for any system modification applications that were pending on the date it filed its renewal application. Such credit will not be allowed if the modification application is dismissed or denied.</p>
