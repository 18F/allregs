                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of this subpart, the following words and phrases have  the meanings indicated:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Adverse marking decision means a decision made by the port  director which an exporter or producer of merchandise believes to be  contrary to the provisions of Annex 311 of the NAFTA and which may be  protested by the importer pursuant to Sec. 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as  amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), and part 174 of this chapter. Notification of  an adverse marking decision is given to an importer in the form of a  Customs Form 4647 (Notice to Mark and/or Notice to Redeliver) and/or by  assessing marking duties on improperly marked merchandise. Examples of  adverse marking decisions include determinations by the port director:  that an imported article is not a good of a NAFTA country, as determined  under the Marking Rules, and that it therefore cannot be marked  ``Canada'' or ``Mexico''; that a good of a NAFTA country is not marked  in a manner which is sufficiently permanent; and that a good of a NAFTA  country does not qualify for an exception from marking specified in  Annex 311 of the NAFTA. Adverse marking decisions do not include:  decisions issued in response to requests for advance rulings under  subpart I of this part or for internal advice under part 177 of this  chapter; decisions on protests under part 174 of this chapter; and  determinations that an article does not qualify as an originating good  under General Note 12, HTSUS, and the appendix to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An exporter of merchandise is an exporter located in Canada or  Mexico who must maintain records in that country relating to the  transaction to which the adverse marking decision relates. The records  must be sufficient to enable Customs to evaluate the merits of the  exporter's claim(s) regarding the adverse marking decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A producer of merchandise is a person who grows, mines,  harvests, fishes, traps, hunts, manufactures, processes or assembles  such merchandise in Canada or Mexico.</p>
