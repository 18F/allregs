                            <p class="depth0">The owners and operators, and to the extent applicable, the designated representative, of a TR NOX Ozone Season unit, shall comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements as provided in this subpart and subpart H of part 75 of this chapter. For purposes of applying such requirements, the definitions in Sec. 97.502 and in Sec. 72.2 of this chapter shall apply, the terms ``affected unit,'' ``designated representative,'' and ``continuous emission monitoring system'' (or ``CEMS'') in part 75 of this chapter shall be deemed to refer to the terms ``TR NOX Ozone Season unit,'' ``designated representative,'' and ``continuous emission monitoring system'' (or ``CEMS'') respectively as defined in Sec. 97.502, and the term ``newly affected unit'' shall be deemed to mean ``newly affected TR NOX Ozone Season unit''. The owner or operator of a unit that is not a TR NOX Ozone Season unit but that is monitored under Sec. 75.72(b)(2)(ii) of this chapter shall comply with the same monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements as a TR NOX Ozone Season unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Requirements for installation, certification, and data accounting. The owner or operator of each TR NOX Ozone Season unit shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Install all monitoring systems required under this subpart for monitoring NOX mass emissions and individual unit heat input (including all systems required to monitor NOX emission rate, NOX concentration, stack gas moisture content, stack gas flow rate, CO2 or O2 concentration, and fuel flow rate, as applicable, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 75.71 and 75.72 of this chapter);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Successfully complete all certification tests required under Sec. 97.531 and meet all other requirements of this subpart and part 75 of this chapter applicable to the monitoring systems under paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Record, report, and quality-assure the data from the monitoring systems under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Compliance deadlines. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall meet the monitoring system certification and other requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section on or before the following dates and shall record, report, and quality-assure the data from the monitoring systems under paragraph (a)(1) of this section on and after the following dates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For the owner or operator of a TR NOX Ozone Season unit that commences commercial operation before July 1, 2014, May 1, 2015.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For the owner or operator of a TR NOX Ozone Season unit that commences commercial operation on or after July 1, 2014 and that reports on an annual basis under Sec. 97.534(d), by the later of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 180 calendar days after the date on which the unit commences commercial operation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> May 1, 2015.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For the owner or operator of a TR NOX Ozone Season unit that commences commercial operation on or after July 1, 2014 and that reports on a control period basis under Sec. 97.534(d)(2)(ii), by the following date:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 180 calendar days after the date on which the unit commences commercial operation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the compliance date under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is not during a control period, May 1 immediately after the compliance date under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The owner or operator of a TR NOX Ozone Season unit for which construction of a new stack or flue or installation of add-on NOX emission controls is completed after the applicable deadline under paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section shall meet the requirements of Sec. Sec. 75.4(e)(1) through (e)(4) of this chapter, except that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such requirements shall apply to the monitoring systems required under Sec. 97.530 through Sec. 97.535, rather than the monitoring systems required under part 75 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> NOX emission rate, NOX concentration, stack gas moisture content, stack gas volumetric flow rate, and O2 or CO2 concentration data shall be determined and reported, rather than the data listed in Sec. 75.4(e)(2) of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any petition for another procedure under Sec. 75.4(e)(2) of this chapter shall be submitted under Sec. 97.535, rather than Sec. 75.66.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reporting data. The owner or operator of a TR NOX Ozone Season unit that does not meet the applicable compliance date set forth in paragraph (b) of this section for any monitoring system under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall, for each such monitoring system, determine, record, and report maximum potential (or, as appropriate, minimum potential) values for NOX concentration, NOX emission rate, stack gas flow rate, stack gas moisture content, fuel flow rate, and any other parameters required to determine NOX mass emissions and heat input in accordance with Sec. 75.31(b)(2) or (c)(3) of this chapter, section 2.4 of appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, or section 2.5 of appendix E to part 75 of this chapter, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Prohibitions. (1) No owner or operator of a TR NOX Ozone Season unit shall use any alternative monitoring system, alternative reference method, or any other alternative to any requirement of this subpart without having obtained prior written approval in accordance with Sec. 97.535.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No owner or operator of a TR NOX Ozone Season unit shall operate the unit so as to discharge, or allow to be discharged, NOX to the atmosphere without accounting for all such NOX in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart and part 75 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> No owner or operator of a TR NOX Ozone Season unit shall disrupt the continuous emission monitoring system, any portion thereof, or any other approved emission monitoring method, and thereby avoid monitoring and recording NOX mass discharged into the atmosphere or heat input, except for periods of recertification or periods when calibration, quality assurance testing, or maintenance is performed in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart and part 75 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> No owner or operator of a TR NOX Ozone Season unit shall retire or permanently discontinue use of the continuous emission monitoring system, any component thereof, or any other approved monitoring system under this subpart, except under any one of the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> During the period that the unit is covered by an exemption under Sec. 97.505 that is in effect;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator is monitoring emissions from the unit with another certified monitoring system approved, in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart and part 75 of this chapter, by the Administrator for use at that unit that provides emission data for the same pollutant or parameter as the retired or discontinued monitoring system; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The designated representative submits notification of the date of certification testing of a replacement monitoring system for the retired or discontinued monitoring system in accordance with Sec. 97.531(d)(3)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Long-term cold storage. The owner or operator of a TR NOX Ozone Season unit is subject to the applicable provisions of Sec. 75.4(d) of this chapter concerning units in long-term cold storage.
