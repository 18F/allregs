                            <p class="depth0">The following procedure shall be used to analyze the test data:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Locate the modes specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(1) through (a)(4) by applying the following starting and ending criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The idle mode specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(1) starts when engine preconditioning or the lugging mode of a preceding cycle has been completed and ends when the engine speed is raised above the idle speed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The acceleration mode specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)(i) starts when the preceding idle mode has been completed and ends when the throttle is in the fully open position, as indicated by the throttle position trace as specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The acceleration mode specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)(ii) starts when the preceding acceleration mode has been completed and ends when the engine speed reaches 85 percent of the rated speed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The transition period specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)(iii) starts when the preceding acceleration mode has been completed and ends when the throttle is in the fully open position as indicated by the throttle position trace, as specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)(iv).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The acceleration mode specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)(iv) starts when the preceding transition period has been completed and ends when the engine speed reaches 95 percent of the rated speed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The transition period specified in Sec. 86.884-7 (a)(3)(i) starts when the preceding acceleration mode has been completed and ends when the engine speed is 50 rpm below the rated speed and the provisions of Sec. 86.884-7 (a)(3)(i) are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The lugging mode specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(3)(ii) starts when the preceding transition period has been completed and ends when the engine speed is at the intermediate speed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determine if the test requirements of Sec. 86.884-7 are met by applying the following modal criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Idle mode as specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(1):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Duration: 5 to 5.5 minutes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Speed: within specification during the last four minutes of the mode.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acceleration mode as specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Duration: three seconds or less.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Speed increase: 200[50 rpm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Acceleration mode as specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)(ii);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Linearity: [100 rpm as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Duration: 3.5 to 6.5 seconds.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Throttle position: fully open until speed is at least 85 percent of the rated speed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Transition period as specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)(iii):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Throttle position: moved rapidly to, and held in, the fully closed position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Acceleration mode as specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)(iv):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Duration: 8 to 12 seconds.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Throttle position: fully open when speed is at intermediate speed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Transition period as specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(3)(i):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Duration: 50 to 60 seconds.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Average speed during the last 10 seconds shall be within [50 rpm of rated speed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Average observed power during the last 10 seconds shall be at least 95 percent of the horsepower developed during the preconditioning mode.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Lugging mode as specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(3)(ii):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Linearity: [100 rpm as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Duration: 30 to 40 seconds.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Speed at end: intermediate speed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determine if the linearity requirements of Sec. 86.884-7 were met by means of the following procedure:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the acceleration mode specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)(ii), note the maximum deflection of the rpm trace from a straight line drawn between the starting and ending points specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the lugging mode specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(3)(ii), note the maximum deflection of the rpm trace from a straight line drawn from the starting and ending points specified in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The test results will be invalid if any deflection is greater than 100 rpm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> This linearity check may be performed by direct analysis of the recorder traces, or by computer analysis of data collected by automatic data collection equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Analyze the smoke trace by means of the following procedure:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Starting at the beginning of the first acceleration, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and stopping at the end of the second acceleration, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, divide the smoke trace into half-second intervals. Similarly, subdivide into half-second intervals the third acceleration mode and the lugging mode as defined by paragraphs (a) (5) and (7) respectively, of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine the average smoke reading during each half-second interval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Locate and record the 15 highest half-second readings during the acceleration mode of each dynamometer cycle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Locate and record the five highest half-second readings during the lugging mode of each dynamometer cycle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Examine the average half-second values which were determined in paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section and record the three highest values for each dynamometer cycle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> This smoke trace analysis may be performed by direct analysis of the recorder traces, or by computer analysis of data collected by automatic data collection equipment.
