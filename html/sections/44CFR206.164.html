                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Legal services, including legal advice, counseling, and  representation in non fee-generating cases, except as provided in  paragraph (b) of this section, may be provided to low-income individuals  who require them as a result of a major disaster. For the purpose of  this section, low-income individuals means those disaster victims who  have insufficient resources to secure adequate legal services, whether  the insufficiency existed prior to or results from the major disaster.  In cases where questions arise about the eligibility of an individual  for legal services, the Regional Administrator or his/her representative  shall make a determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disaster legal services shall be provided free to such  individuals. Fee-generating cases shall not be accepted by lawyers  operating under these regulations. For purposes of this section, a fee- generating case is one which would not ordinarily be rejected by local  lawyers as a result of its lack of potential remunerative value. Where  any question arises as to whether a case is fee-generating as defined in  this section, the Regional Administrator or his/her representative,  after any necessary consultation with local or State bar associations,  shall make the determination. Any fee-generating cases shall be referred  by the Regional Administrator or his/her representative to private  lawyers, through existing lawyer referral services, or, where that is  impractical or impossible, the Regional Director may provide a list of  lawyers from which the disaster victim may choose. Lawyers who have  rendered voluntary legal assistance under these regulations are not  precluded from taking fee-generating cases referred to them in this  manner while in their capacity as private lawyers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When the Regional Administrator determines after any necessary  consultation with the State Coordinating Officer, that implementation of  this section is necessary, provision of disaster legal services may be  accomplished by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use of volunteer lawyers under the terms of appropriate  agreements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use of Federal lawyers, provided that these lawyers do not  represent an eligible disaster victim before a court or Federal agency  in a matter directly involving the United States, and further provided  that these lawyers do not act in a way which will violate the standards  of conduct of their respective agencies or departments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use of private lawyers who may be paid by the Federal Emergency  Management Agency when the Regional Administrator has determined that  there is no other means of obtaining adequate legal assistance for  qualified disaster victims; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any other arrangement the Regional Administrator deems  appropriate.</p><p class="depth3">The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate  shall coordinate with appropriate Federal agencies and the appropriate  national,   state and local bar associations, as necessary, in the implementation of  the disaster legal services programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the event it is necessary for FEMA to pay lawyers for the  provision of legal services under these regulations, the Regional  Administrator, in consultation with State and local bar associations,  shall determine the amount of reimbursement due to the lawyers who have  provided disaster legal services at the request of the Regional  Administrator. At the Regional Administrator 's discretion,  administrative costs of lawyers providing legal services requested by  him or her may also be paid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Provision of disaster legal services is confined to the securing  of benefits under the Act and claims arising out of a major disaster.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any disaster legal services shall be provided in accordance with  subpart A of these regulations, Non-discrimination in disaster  assistance.
