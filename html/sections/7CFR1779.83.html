                            <p class="depth0">Protective advances can only be added to the loan account for purposes of requirements to preserve the value of the security. Protective advances constitute an indebtedness of the borrower to the lender and must be secured by collateral to the same extent as principal and interest. Protective advances include, but are not limited to, advances made for taxes, annual assessments, ground rent, hazard and flood insurance premiums affecting the collateral (including any other expenses necessary to protect the collateral). Attorney fees are not a protective advance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agency approval. The Agency must approve, in writing, all protective advances on loans within its loan approval authority which exceed a total cumulative advance amount of $5,000 to the same borrower. Protective advances must be reasonable when associated with the value of the collateral being preserved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preserving collateral. When considering protective advances, sound judgment must be exercised in determining that the additional funds advanced will actually preserve collateral and recovery is actually enhanced by making the advance.</p>
