                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rules. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Not later than the first Monday in June, each  MA organization must submit to CMS an aggregate monthly bid amount for  each MA plan (other than an MSA plan) the organization intends to offer  in the upcoming year in the service area (or segment of such an area if  permitted under Sec. 422.262(c)(2)) that meets the requirements in  paragraph (b) of this section. With each bid submitted, the MA  organization must provide the information required in paragraph (c) of  this section and, for plans with rebates as described at  Sec. 422.266(a), the MA organization must provide the information  required in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CMS has the authority to determine whether and when it is  appropriate to apply the bidding methodology described in this section  to ESRD MA enrollees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the bid submission described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of  this section is not complete, timely, or accurate, CMS has the authority  to impose sanctions under subpart O of this part or may choose not to  renew the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Substantial differences between bids. An MA organization's bid  submissions must reflect differences in benefit packages or plan costs  that CMS determines to represent substantial differences relative to a  sponsor's other bid submissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> CMS may decline to accept any or every otherwise qualified bid  submitted by an MA organization or potential MA organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bid requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The monthly aggregate bid amount submitted  by an MA organization for each plan is the organization's estimate of  the revenue required for the following categories for providing coverage  to an MA eligible beneficiary with a national average risk profile for  the factors described in Sec. 422.308(c):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The unadjusted MA statutory non-drug monthly bid amount, which  is the MA plan's estimated average monthly required revenue for  providing benefits under the original Medicare fee-for-service program  option (as defined in Sec. 422.252).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount to provide basic prescription drug coverage, if any  (defined at section 1860D-2(a)(3) of the Act).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The amount to provide supplemental health care benefits, if  any.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each bid is for a uniform benefit package for the service area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each bid submission must contain all estimated revenue required  by the plan, including administrative costs and return on investment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The bid amount is for plan payments only but must be based on  plan assumptions about the amount of revenue required from enrollee  cost-sharing. The estimate of plan cost-sharing for the unadjusted MA  statutory non-drug monthly bid amount for coverage of original Medicare  benefits must reflect the requirement that the level of cost sharing MA  plans charge to enrollees must be actuarially equivalent to the level of  cost sharing (deductible, copayments, or coinsurance) charged to  beneficiaries under the original Medicare program option. The  actuarially equivalent level of cost sharing reflected in a regional  plan's unadjusted MA statutory non-drug monthly bid amount does not  include cost sharing for out-of-network Medicare benefits, as described  at Sec. 422.101(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Actuarial valuation. The bid must be prepared in accordance with  CMS actuarial guidelines based on generally accepted actuarial  principles.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A qualified actuary must certify the plan's actuarial valuation  (which may be prepared by others under his or her direction or review).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To be deemed a qualified actuary, the actuary must be a member  of the American Academy of Actuaries.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Applicants may use qualified outside actuaries to prepare  their bids.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Information required for coordinated care plans and MA private  fee-for-service plans. MA organizations' submission of bids for  coordinated care plans, including regional MA plans and specialized MA  plans for special needs beneficiaries (described at  Sec. 422.4(a)(1)(iv)), and for MA private fee-for-service plans must  include the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The plan type for each plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The monthly aggregate bid amount for the provision of all items  and services under the plan, as defined in Sec. 422.252 and discussed in  paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The proportions of the bid amount attributable to-</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The provision of benefits under the original Medicare fee-for- service program option (as defined at Sec. 422.100(c));</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The provision of basic prescription drug coverage (as defined  at section 1860D-2(a)(3) of the Act; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The provision of supplemental health care benefits (as defined  Sec. 422.102).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The projected number of enrollees in each MA local area used in  calculation of the bid amount, and the enrollment capacity, if any, for  the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The actuarial basis for determining the amount under paragraph  (c)(2) of this section, the proportions under paragraph (c)(3) of this  section, the amount under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and  additional information as CMS may require to verify actuarial bases and  the projected number of enrollees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A description of deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments  applicable under the plan and the actuarial value of the deductibles,  coinsurance, and copayments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For qualified prescription drug coverage, the information  required under section 1860D-11(b) of the Act with respect to coverage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> For the purposes of calculation of risk corridors under  Sec. 422.458, MA organizations offering regional MA plans in 2006 and/or  2007 must submit the following information developed using the  appropriate actuarial bases.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Projected allowable costs (defined in Sec. 422.458(a)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The portion of projected allowable costs attributable to  administrative expenses incurred in providing these benefits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The total projected costs for providing rebatable integrated  benefits (as defined in Sec. 422.458(a)) and the portion of costs that  is attributable to administrative expenses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> For regional plans, as determined by CMS, the relative cost  factors for the counties in a plan's service area, for the purposes of  adjusting payment under Sec. 422.308(d) for intra-area variations in an  MA organization's local payment rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Beneficiary rebate information. In the case of a plan required  to provide a monthly rebate under Sec. 422.266 for a year, the MA  organization offering the plan must inform CMS how the plan   will distribute the beneficiary rebate among the options described at  Sec. 422.266(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Information required for MSA plans. MA organizations intending  to offer MA MSA plans must submit--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The enrollment capacity (if any) for the plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount of the MSA monthly premium for basic benefits under  the original Medicare fee-for-service program option;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amount of the plan deductible; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The amount of the beneficiary supplemental premium, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Separate bids must be submitted for Part A and Part B enrollees  and Part B-only enrollees for each MA plan offered.
