A request to review a disputed debt  must be submitted to the Commission official who provided notification  within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the written notice described  in Sec. 505.4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the debtor requests an opportunity to inspect or copy the  Commission's records concerning the disputed claim, 10 business days  will be granted for the review.

Depending on the type of transaction the  suspension could preclude its payment, removal, or transfer, as well as  prevent the payment of interest or discount due thereon. Should the  dispute be resolved in the debtor's favor, the suspension will be  immediately lifted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> During the review period, interest, penalties, and  administrative costs authorized under the Federal Claims Collection Act  of 1996, as amended, will continue to accrue.</p>
