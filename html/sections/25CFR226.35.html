Upon finding that the interests of the Osage mineral estate require that the tract be developed, the Superintendent will endeavor to have the parties agree upon the terms under which operations on the homestead may be conducted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the event the allottee and lessee cannot reach an agreement, the matter must be presented by all parties before the Osage Minerals Council, and the Council will make its recommendations. Such recommendations will be considered as final and binding upon the allottee and lessee. A guardian may represent the allottee. Where no one is authorized or where no person is deemed by the Superintendent to be a proper party to speak for a person of unsound mind or feeble understanding, the Principal Chief of the Osage Nation will represent him.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the allottee or his/her representative does not appear before the Osage Minerals Council when notified by the Superintendent, or if the Council fails to act within 10 calendar days after the matter is referred to it, the Superintendent may authorize the lessee to proceed with operations in conformity with the provisions of his/her lease and the regulations in this part.</p>
