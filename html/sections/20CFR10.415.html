                            <p class="depth0">The circumstances under which compensation on account of death shall  be terminated are described in 5 U.S.C. 8133(b). A beneficiary in a  claim for death benefits should promptly notify OWCP of any event which  would affect his or her entitlement to continued compensation. The terms  ``marriage'' and ``remarriage'' include common-law marriage as  recognized and defined by State law in the State where the beneficiary  resides. If a beneficiary, or someone acting on his or her behalf,  receives a check or electronic payment which includes payment of  compensation for any period after the date when entitlement ended, he or  she must promptly return such funds to OWCP.</p>
