Thereafter, regulated  articles may be moved interstate from that area only in accordance with  this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area will be added to the  list in paragraph (a) of this section, or the Administrator will  terminate the designation. The owner or person in possession of an area  for which designation is terminated will be given written notice as soon  as practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any State or portion of a State where an infestation is detected  will be designated as a quarantined area and will remain so until the  area has been without infestation for 2 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Less than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined  area only if all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Survey. No area has been designated a survey area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Intrastate movement of regulated articles. The State enforces  restrictions on the intrastate movement of regulated articles from the  quarantined area that are at least as stringent as those on the  interstate movement of regulated articles from the quarantined area,  except as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Regulated fruit may be moved intrastate from a quarantined area  for processing into a product other than fresh fruit if all of the  following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The regulated fruit is accompanied by a document that states the  location of the grove in which the regulated fruit was produced, the  variety and quantity of regulated fruit being moved intrastate, the  address to which the regulated fruit will be delivered for processing,  and the date the intrastate movement began,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The regulated fruit and any leaves and litter are completely  covered, or enclosed in containers or in a compartment of a vehicle,  during the intrastate movement.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The vehicles, covers, and any containers used to carry the  regulated fruit intrastate are treated in accordance with part 305 of  this chapter before leaving the premises where the regulated fruit is  unloaded for processing, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> All leaves, litter, and culls collected from the shipment of  regulated fruit at the processing facility are either incinerated at the  processing facility or buried at a public landfill that is fenced,  prohibits the removal of dumped material, and covers dumped material  with dirt at the end of every day that dumping occurs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Regulated fruit may be moved intrastate from a quarantined area  for packing, either for subsequent interstate movement with a limited  permit or for export from the United States, if all of the following  conditions are met:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The regulated fruit is accompanied by a document that states the  location of the grove in which the regulated fruit was produced, the  variety and quantity of regulated fruit being moved intrastate, the  address to which the regulated fruit will be delivered for packing, and  the date the intrastate movement began.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The regulated fruit and any leaves and litter are completely  covered, or enclosed in containers or in a compartment of a vehicle,  during the intrastate movement.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The vehicles, covers, and any containers used to carry the  regulated fruit intrastate are treated in accordance with part 305 of  this chapter before leaving the premises where the regulated fruit is  unloaded for packing.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em>Any equipment that comes in contact with the regulated fruit at  the packing plant is treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter  before being used to handle any fruit eligible for interstate movement  to commercial citrus-producing areas, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> All leaves and litter collected from the shipment of regulated  fruit at the packing plant are either incinerated at the packing plant  or buried at a public landfill that is fenced, prohibits the removal of  dumped material, and covers dumped material with dirt at the end of  every day that dumping occurs. All culls collected from the shipment of  regulated fruit are either processed into a product other than fresh  fruit, incinerated at the packing plant, or buried at a public landfill  that is fenced, prohibits the removal of dumped material, and covers  dumped material with dirt at the end of every day that dumping occurs.  Any culls moved intrastate for processing must be completely covered, or  enclosed in containers or in a compartment of a vehicle, during the  intrastate movement, and the vehicles, covers, and any containers used  to carry the regulated fruit must be treated in accordance with part 305  of this chapter before leaving the premises where the regulated fruit is  unloaded for processing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Grass, tree, and plant clippings may be moved intrastate from  the quarantined area for disposal in a public landfill or for composting  in a recycling facility, if all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The public landfill or recycling facility is located within the  survey area described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The grass, tree, or plant clippings are completely covered  during the movement from the quarantined area to the public landfill or  recycling facility, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Any public landfill used is fenced, prohibits the removal of  dumped material, and covers dumped material with dirt at the end of  every day that dumping occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inspections. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the quarantined area, every regulated plant  and regulated tree, except indoor houseplants and regulated plants and  regulated trees at nurseries, is inspected for citrus canker at least  once a year, between May 1 through December 31, by an inspector.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the quarantined area, every regulated plant and regulated  tree at every nursery containing regulated plants or regulated trees is  inspected for citrus canker by an inspector at intervals of no more than  45 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Treatment of personnel, vehicles, and equipment. In the  quarantined area, all vehicles, equipment, and other articles used in  providing inspection, maintenance, harvesting, or related services in  any grove containing regulated plants or regulated trees, or in  providing landscaping or lawn care services on any premises containing  regulated plants or regulated trees, must be treated in accordance with  part 305 of this chapter upon leaving the grove or premises. All  personnel who enter the grove or premises to provide these services must  be treated in   accordance with part 305 of this chapter upon leaving the grove or  premises.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Destruction of infected plants and trees.
