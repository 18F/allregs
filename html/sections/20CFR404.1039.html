                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You and your employer (or, if the employer is a partnership,  each of its partners) may file applications with the Internal Revenue  Service for exemption from your respective shares of the Federal  Insurance Contributions Act taxes on your wages paid by that employer if  you and your employer (or, if the employer is a partnership, each of its  partners)--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Are members of a recognized religious sect or division of the  sect; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adhere to the tenets or teachings of the sect or division of the  sect and for that reason are conscientiously opposed to receiving  benefits from any private or public insurance that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Makes payment in the event of death, disability, old-age, or  retirement; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Makes payment for the cost of, or provides services for,  medical care including the benefits of any insurance system established  by the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Both your application and your employer's application (or, if  your employer is a partnership, each partner's application) must be  filed with and approved by the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to  section 3127 of the Internal Revenue Code. An application must contain  or be accompanied by the applicant's waiver of all benefits and payments  under title II and part A of title XVIII of the Act. See Sec. 404.305  for the effect of the filing of the waiver and the granting of the  exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Regardless of whether the applicant meets all these conditions,  the application will not be approved unless we find that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The sect or division of the sect has established tenets or  teachings which cause the applicant to be conscientiously opposed to the  types of insurance benefits described in paragraph (a)(2) of this  section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a substantial period of time it has been the practice for  members of the sect or division of the sect to make provision for their  dependent members   that is reasonable in view of their general level of living; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The sect or division of the sect has been in existence  continuously since December 31, 1950.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An application for exemption will be approved by the Internal  Revenue Service only if no benefit or payment under title II or part A  of title XVIII of the Act became payable (or, but for section 203 or  section 222(b) of the Act, would have become payable) to the applicant  at or before the time of the filing of the application for exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The tax exemption ceases to be effective with respect to wages  paid beginning with the calendar quarter in which either the employer  (or if the employer is a partnership, any of its partners) or the  employee involved does not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of  this section or the religious sect or division of the sect is found by  us to no longer meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.  If the tax exemption ceases to be effective, the waiver of the right to  receive Social Security and Medicare Part A benefits will also no longer  be effective. Benefits may be payable based upon the wages of the  individual, whose exempt status was terminated, for and after the  calendar year following the calendar year in which the event occurred  upon which the cessation of the exemption is based. Benefits may be  payable based upon the self-employment income of the individual whose  exempt status was terminated for and after the taxable year in which the  event occurred upon which the cessation of the exemption is based.
