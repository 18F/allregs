                                Sec.  601.204  Changes in accounting periods and in methods of accounting.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Accounting periods. A taxpayer who changes his accounting period shall, before using the new period for income tax purposes, comply with the provisions of the income tax regulations relating to changes in accounting periods. In cases where the regulations require the taxpayer to secure the consent of the Commissioner to the change, the application for permission to change the accounting period shall be made on Form 1128 and shall be submitted to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20224, within the period of time prescribed in such regulations. See section 442 of the Code and regulations thereunder. If the change is approved by the Commissioner, the taxpayer shall thereafter make his returns and compute his net income upon the basis of the new accounting period. A request for permission to change the accounting period will be considered by the Corporation Tax Division. However, in certain instances, Form 1128 may be filed with the Director of the Internal Revenue Service Center in which the taxpayer files its return. See, for example, Rev. Proc. 66-13, 1966-1 C.B. 626; Rev. Proc. 66-50, 1966-2 C.B. 1260, and Rev. Proc. 68-41, 1968-2 C.B. 943. With respect to partnership adoptions, see Sec.  1.706-1(b) of the Income Tax Regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Methods of accounting. A taxpayer who changes the method of accounting employed in keeping his books shall, before computing his income upon such method for purposes of income taxation, comply with the provisions of the income tax regulations relating to changes in accounting methods. The regulations require that, in the ordinary case, the taxpayer secure the consent of the Commissioner to the change. See section 446 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. Application for permission to change the method of accounting employed shall be made on Form 3115 and shall be submitted to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC, 20224, during the taxable year in which it is desired to make the change. Permission to change the method of accounting will not be granted unless the taxpayer and the Commissioner agree to the terms and conditions under which the change will be effected. The request will be considered by the Corporation Tax Division. However, in certain instances, Form 3115 may be filed with the Director of the Internal Revenue Service Center. See, for example, Rev. Proc. 74-11, 1974-1 C.B. 420.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Verification of changes. Written permission to a taxpayer by the National Office consenting to a change in his annual accounting period or to a change in his accounting method is a ``ruling''. Therefore, in the examination of returns involving changes of annual accounting periods and methods of accounting, district directors must determine whether the representations upon which the permission was granted reflect an accurate statement of the material facts, and whether the agreed terms, conditions, and adjustments have been substantially carried out as proposed. An application, Form 3115, filed with the Director of the Internal Revenue Service Center is also subject to similar verification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Instructions to taxpayers. The person seeking to secure the consent of the Commissioner with respect to a change of accounting periods or methods pursuant to section 442 or 446(e) of the Code need not submit the statement of proposed deletions described in Sec.  601.201(e)(5) at the time the request is made. If, however, the person seeking the consent of the Commissioner receives from the National Office a notice that proposed deletions should be submitted because the resulting ruling will be open to public inspection under section 6110, the statement of proposed deletions must be submitted within 20 days after such notice is mailed.
