                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An agricultural lease negotiated by Indian landowners may cover more than one tract of Indian land, but the minimum consent requirements for leases granted by Indian landowners under subparts B through D of this part will apply to each tract separately. We may combine multiple tracts into a unit for leases negotiated or advertised by us, if we determine that unitization is in the Indian landowners' best interests and consistent with the efficient administration of the land.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unless otherwise provided in the agricultural lease, the rent or other consideration derived from a unitized agricultural lease will be distributed based on the size of each landowner's interest in proportion to the acreage within the entire unit.
