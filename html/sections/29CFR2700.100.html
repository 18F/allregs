                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The purpose of this Simplified Proceedings subpart is to provide simplified procedures for resolving civil penalty contests under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, so that parties before the Commission may reduce the time and expense of litigation while being assured due process and a hearing that meets the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 554. These procedural rules will be applied to accomplish this purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures under this subpart are simplified in a number of ways. The major differences between these procedures and those that would otherwise apply in subparts A, C, G, H, and I of this part are as follows.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Answers to petitions for assessment of penalty are not required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Motions are eliminated to the greatest extent practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Early discussions among the parties and the Administrative Law Judge are required to narrow and define the disputes between the parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The parties are required to provide certain materials early in the proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Discovery is not permitted except as ordered by the Administrative Law Judge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Interlocutory appeals are not permitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The administrative process is streamlined, but hearings will be full due process hearings. The parties will argue their case orally before the Judge at the conclusion of the hearing

instead of filing briefs. In many instances, the Judge will render a decision from the bench.</p>
