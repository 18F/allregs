                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. This section establishes procedures and guidelines for referenda to be conducted on Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) program proposals developed by the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) and the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (GMFMC). These procedures and guidelines also apply to IFQ program proposals developed by NMFS for fisheries under the jurisdiction of the NEFMC or GMFMC, except for certain provisions that only apply to a fishery management council. This section provides guidance on developing voter eligibility and vote weighting, and establishes general procedures to ensure referenda are conducted in a fair and equitable manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initiating IFQ referenda. (1) The NEFMC and the GMFMC shall not submit, and the Secretary shall not approve, an FMP or FMP amendment that would create an IFQ program until the IFQ program proposal, as ultimately developed, has been approved by a referendum of eligible voters. Paragraph (h) of this section provides criteria for determining the outcome of IFQ referenda.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The NEFMC and the GMFMC shall not submit, and the Secretary shall not approve, an FMP or FMP amendment that would create an IFQ program until the IFQ program proposal, as ultimately developed, has been approved by a referendum of eligible voters. Paragraph (h) of this section provides criteria for determining the outcome of IFQ referenda.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To initiate a referendum on a proposed IFQ program:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The relevant Council must have held public hearings on the FMP or FMP amendment in which the IFQ program is proposed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The relevant Council must have considered public comments on the proposed IFQ program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The relevant Council must have selected preferred alternatives for the proposed IFQ program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The chair of the Council with jurisdiction over such proposed IFQ fishery must request a referendum on the proposed IFQ program in a letter to the appropriate NMFS Regional Administrator;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The letter requesting initiation of a referendum must recommend voter eligibility criteria that are consistent with the applicable requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section and may also include recommended criteria for vote weighting. The letter must provide the rationale supporting the Council's recommendation, as well as such additional information and analyses as needed, consistent with applicable law and provisions of this section. If a Council recommends vote weighting criteria, the letter should fully describe the rationale for and the expected effects of such weighting on the referendum;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> NEFMC referenda initiation letters must: recommend criteria that are consistent with paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section for NMFS to use in determining the eligibility of other fishery participants to vote in the referendum; include the minimum percentage of a crew member's total income that must have been earned during the eligibility periods in the proposed IFQ fishery as discussed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section; and include criteria for ``referendum eligible vessels'' as described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> GMFMC letters initiating referenda of multispecies permit holders in the Gulf of Mexico must include recommended criteria to be used in identifying those permit holders who have substantially fished the species to be included in the proposed IFQ program, along with alternatives to the recommendation, and supporting analyses. Guidelines for developing such recommendations are provided at paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Following a referendum that has failed to approve the IFQ proposal, any request from a Council for a new referendum in the same fishery must include an explanation of the substantive changes to the proposed IFQ program or the changes of circumstances in the fishery that would warrant initiation of an additional referendum.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Referenda voter eligibility--(1) Permit holders and other fishery participants. (i) To be eligible to vote in IFQ referenda, permit holders and other fishery participants must meet voter eligibility criteria.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Permit holders and other fishery participants.

When developing criteria for identifying those multispecies permit holders who have substantially fished the species to be included in the IFQ program proposal, the Council or Secretary must consider, but is not limited to considering:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Current and historical harvest and participation in the fishery;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The economic value of and employment practices in the fishery; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any other factors determined by the Council with jurisdiction over the fishery for which an IFQ program is proposed to be relevant to the fishery and the proposed IFQ program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Council-recommended criteria under paragraph (c) of this section may include, but are not limited to, levels of participation or reliance on the fishery as represented by landings, sales, expenditures, or other considerations. A Council may also apply the same criteria for weighting eligible referendum votes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Actions by NMFS: Review of Council referendum criteria and Secretarial IFQ plans. (1) NMFS shall determine whether Council recommended referendum criteria will provide for a fair and equitable referendum and will be consistent with national standards and other provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable legal standards. The Secretary's considerations shall include, but shall not be limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NMFS shall determine whether Council recommended referendum criteria will provide for a fair and equitable referendum and will be consistent with national standards and other provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable legal standards.
