                            <p class="depth0">The payment by a State or local committee of a political party of  the costs of voter registration and get-out-the-vote activities  conducted by such committee on behalf of the Presidential and Vice  Presidential nominee(s) of that party is not an expenditure for the  purpose of influencing the election of such candidates provided that the  following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exemption not applicable to general public communication or  political advertising. Such payment is not for the costs incurred in  connection with any broadcasting, newspaper, magazine, billboard, direct  mail, or similar type of general public communication or political  advertising. For purposes of this paragraph, the term direct mail means  any mailing(s) by a commercial vendor or any mailing(s) made from  commercial lists.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Allocation. The portion of the costs of such activities  allocable to Federal candidates is paid from contributions subject to  the limitations and prohibitions of the Act. But see 11   CFR 100.24, 104.17(a), and part 300, subpart B for exempt activities  that also constitute Federal election activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contributions designated for Federal candidates. Such payment is  not made from contributions designated to be spent on behalf of a  particular candidate or candidates for Federal office. For the purposes  of this paragraph, a contribution shall not be considered a designated  contribution if the party committee disbursing the funds makes the final  decision regarding which candidate(s) shall receive the benefit of such  disbursement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> References to House or Senate candidates. For purposes of this  section, if such activities include references to any candidate(s) for  the House or Senate, the costs of such activities that are allocable to  that candidate(s) shall be an expenditure on behalf of such candidate(s)  unless the mention of such candidate(s) is merely incidental to the  overall activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Phone banks. For purposes of this section, payment of the costs  incurred in the use of phone banks in connection with voter registration  and get-out-the-vote activities is not an expenditure when such phone  banks are operated by volunteer workers. The use of paid professionals  to design the phone bank system, develop calling instructions and train  supervisors is permissible. The payment of the costs of such  professional services is not an expenditure but shall be reported as a  disbursement in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3 if made by a political  committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Reporting of payments for voter registration and get-out-the- vote activities. If made by a political committee, such payments for  voter registration and get-out-the-vote activities shall be reported by  that committee as disbursements, in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3 but  such payments need not be allocated to specific candidates in committee  reports except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Exemption not applicable to donations by a national committee of  a political party to a State or local party committee for voter  registration and get-out-the-vote activities. Payments made from funds  donated by a national committee of a political party to a State or local  party committee for voter registration and get-out-the-vote activities  shall not qualify under this exemption. Rather, such funds shall be  subject to the limitations of 52 U.S.C. 30116(d) and 11 CFR 109.32.
