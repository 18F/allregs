Until such time as non-DoD systems operating in the  1710-1755 MHz and 1755-1761 MHz bands are relocated to other spectrum,  AWS licensees shall protect such systems by satisfying the appropriate  provisions of TIA Telecommunications Systems Bulletin 10-F,  ``Interference Criteria for Microwave Systems,'' May, 1994 (TSB 10-F).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Protection of Federal operations in the 1675-1710 MHz band--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  27 Protection Zones. Within 27 Protection Zones, prior to operating a  base station that enables mobile or portable stations to transmit in the  1695-1710 MHz band, licensees must successfully coordinate such base  station operations with Federal Government entities operating  meteorological satellite Earth-station receivers in the 1675-1710 MHz  band. See 47 CFR 2.106, footnote US 88, for the 27 Protection Zones and  other details.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Operation outside of 27 Protection Zones. Non-Federal  operations, for mobile and portable stations operating at a maximum EIRP  of 20 dBm, are permitted outside of the protection zones without  coordination. All non-Federal operations for mobile and portables  operating at a maximum EIRP of greater than 20 dBm and up to 30 dBm must  be coordinated nationwide. All such operations may not cause harmful  interference to the Federal operations protected in 47 CFR 2.106,  footnote US 88.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Interference. If protected Federal operations receive harmful  interference from AWS operations in the 1695-1710 MHz band, an AWS  licensee must, upon notification, modify its operations and/or technical  parameters as necessary to eliminate the interference.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Point of contact. AWS licensees in the 1695-1710 MHz band must  provide and maintain a point of contact at all times so that immediate  contact can be made should interference against protected Federal sites  occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Coordination procedures. Federal use of the radio spectrum is  generally governed by the National Telecommunications and Information  Administration (NTIA) while non-Federal use is governed by the  Commission. As such, any guidance or details concerning Federal/non- Federal coordination must be issued jointly by NTIA and the Commission.  The Commission may jointly issue with NTIA one or more public notices  with guidance or details concerning the coordination procedures for the  1695-1710 MHz band.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Requirements for licensees operating in the 1710-1755 MHz band.  AWS licensees operating fixed stations in the 1710-1755 MHz band, if  notified that such stations are causing interference to radiosonde  receivers operating in the Meteorological Aids Service in the 1675-1700  MHz band or a meteorological-satellite earth receiver operating in the  Meteorological-Satellite Service in the 1675-1710 MHz band, shall be  required to modify the stations' location and/or technical parameters as  necessary to eliminate the interference.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Recognition of NASA Goldstone facility operations in the 2110- 2120 MHz band. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)  operates the Deep Space Network (DSN) in the 2110-2120 MHz band at  Goldstone, California (see Table 3). NASA will continue its operations  of high power transmitters (nominal EIRP of 105.5 dBW with EIRP up to  119.5 dBW used under emergency conditions) in this band at this  location. AWS licensees must accept any interference received from the  Goldstone DSN facility in this band.</p><p class="depth0">Table 3--Location of the NASA Goldstone Deep Space Facility ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Maximum transmitter output</p><p class="depth0">Location                                 Coordinates                            power ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Goldstone, California...................  35[deg]18[min] N 116[deg]54[min] W        500 kW ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Protection of Federal operations in the 2200-2290 MHz band--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Default emission limits. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this  section, the following default out-of-band emissions limits shall apply  for AWS-4 operations in the 2180-2200 MHz band.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For these AWS-4 operations, the power of any emissions on all  frequencies between 2200 and 2290 MHz shall not exceed an EIRP of -100.6  dBW/4 kHz.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No AWS-4 base station operating in the 2180-2200 MHz band shall  be located less than 820 meters from a U.S. Earth Station facility  operating in the 2200-2290 MHz band.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Agreements between AWS-4 operators and Federal government  entities. The out-of-band emissions limits in paragraph (e)(1) of this  section may be modified by the private contractual agreement of  licensees of AWS-4 operating authority and Federal government entities  operating in the 2200-2290 MHz band. Such agreement shall be transmitted  to the Commission by the National Telecommunications and Information  Administration (NTIA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce. A licensee of  AWS-4 operating authority who is a party to such an agreement must  maintain a copy of the agreement in its station files and disclose it,  upon request, to prospective AWS-4 assignees, transferees, or spectrum  lessees, to Federal operators, and to the Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Protection of Federal operations in the 1755-1780 MHz band. The  Federal Government operates communications systems in the 1755-1780 MHz  band. Certain systems are expected to continue to operate in the band  indefinitely. All other operations will be relocating to other  frequencies or otherwise cease operations in the 1755-1780 MHz band in  accordance with 47 CFR part 301. Until such a time as Federal operations  in the 1755-1780 MHz bands vacate this spectrum, AWS licensees shall  protect such systems and must accept any interference received from  these Federal operations. See 47 CFR 2.106, footnote US 91, for details.  AWS licensees must successfully coordinate proposed operations with all  Federal incumbents prior to operation as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Protection Zone(s). A protection zone is established for each  Federal operation pursuant to 47 CFR 2.106, footnote US 91. Unless  otherwise specified in later Commission actions, the default protection  zone is nationwide. A base station which enables mobile or portable  stations to transmit in the 1755-1780 MHz band may not operate within  the Protection Zone(s) of a Federal operation until the licensee  successfully coordinates such base station operations with Federal  Government entities as follows depending on the type of Federal  incumbent authorization:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Federal US&P; Assignments. Each AWS licensee must coordinate with  each Federal agency that has U.S. and Possessions (US&P;) authority prior  to its first operations in its licensed area to reach a coordination  arrangement with each US&P; agency on an operator-to-operator basis.  (Agencies with U.S. and Possessions (US&P;) authority do not operate  nationwide and may be able to share, prior to relocation, in some  areas.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other Federal Assignments. Each AWS licensee must successfully  coordinate all base station operations within a Protection Zone with the  Federal incumbents. The default requirement is a nationwide coordination  zone with possible revisions to the Protection Zone and other details to  be announced in a Joint FCC/NTIA public notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interference. If protected Federal operations receive harmful  interference from AWS operations in the 1755-1780 MHz band, an AWS  licensee must, upon notification, modify its operations and/or technical  parameters as   necessary to eliminate the interference.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Point of contact. AWS licensees in the 1755-1780 MHz band must  provide and maintain a point of contact at all times so that immediate  contact can be made should interference against protected Federal  operations occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Coordination procedures. Federal use of the radio spectrum is  generally governed by the National Telecommunications and Information  Administration (NTIA) while non-Federal use is governed by the  Commission. As such, any guidance or details concerning Federal/non- Federal coordination must be issued jointly by NTIA and the Commission.  The Commission may jointly issue with NTIA one or more public notices  with guidance or details concerning the coordination procedures for the  1755-1780 MHz band.
