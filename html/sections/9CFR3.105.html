                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The food for marine mammals must be wholesome, palatable, and  free from contamination and must be of sufficient quantity and nutritive  value to maintain marine mammals in a state of good health. The diet  must be prepared with consideration for factors such as age, species,  condition, and size of the marine mammal being fed. Marine mammals must  be offered food at least once a day, except as directed by the attending  veterinarian.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Food receptacles, if used, must be located so as to be  accessible to all marine mammals in the same primary enclosure and must  be placed so as to minimize contamination of the food they contain. Such  food receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized after each use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Food, when given to each marine mammal individually, must be  given by an employee or attendant responsible to management who has the  necessary knowledge to assure that each marine mammal receives an  adequate quantity of food to maintain it in good health. Such employee  or attendant is required to have the ability to recognize deviations  from a normal state of good health in each marine mammal so that the  food intake can be adjusted accordingly. Inappetence exceeding 24 hours  must be reported immediately to the attending veterinarian. Public  feeding may be permitted only in the   presence and under the supervision of a sufficient number of  knowledgeable, uniformed employees or attendants. Such employees or  attendants must assure that the marine mammals are receiving the proper  amount and type of food. Only food supplied by the facility where the  marine mammals are kept may be fed to the marine mammals by the public.  Marine mammal feeding records noting the estimated individual daily  consumption must be maintained at the facility for a period of 1 year  and must be made available for APHIS inspection. For marine mammals that  are individually fed and not subject to public feeding, the feeding  records should reflect an accurate account of food intake; for animals  fed, in part, by the public, and for large, group-fed colonies of marine  mammals where individual rations are not practical or feasible to  maintain, the daily food consumption should be estimated as precisely as  possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Food preparation and handling must be conducted so as to assure  the wholesomeness and nutritive value of the food. Frozen fish or other  frozen food must be stored in freezers that are maintained at a maximum  temperature of -18 [deg]C (0 [deg]F). The length of time food is stored  and the method of storage, the thawing of frozen food, and the  maintenance of thawed food must be conducted in a manner that will  minimize contamination and that will assure that the food retains  nutritive value and wholesome quality until the time of feeding. When  food is thawed in standing or running water, cold water must be used.  All foods must be fed to the marine mammals within 24 hours following  the removal of such foods from the freezers for thawing, or if the food  has been thawed under refrigeration, it must be fed to the marine  mammals within 24 hours of thawing.
