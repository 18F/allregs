                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After receiving concurrence from the Commissioner, ACYF, a grantee's application for refunding may be denied by the responsible HHS official for circumstances described in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When an intention to deny a grantee's application for refunding is arrived at on a basis to which this subpart applies, the responsible HHS official will provide the grantee as much advance notice thereof as is reasonably possible, in no event later than 30 days after the receipt by ACYF of the application. The notice will inform the grantee that it has the opportunity for a full and fair hearing on whether refunding should be denied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Such appeals shall be governed by 45 CFR part 16, except as otherwise provided in the Head Start appeals regulations. Any grantee which requests a hearing shall be afforded one, as mandated by 42 U.S.C. 9841.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any such appeals must be filed within 30 days after the grantee receives notice of the decision to deny refunding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Refunding of a grant may be denied for any or all of the reasons for which a grant may be terminated, as set forth in Sec. 1303.14(b) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Decisions to deny refunding shall be in writing, signed by the responsible HHS official, dated, and sent in compliance with Sec. 1303.5 of this part or by telegram, or by any other mode establishing the date sent and received by the addressee, or the date it was determined delivery could not be made, or the date delivery was refused. A Notice of Decision shall contain:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The legal basis for the denial of refunding under paragraph (c) of this section, the factual findings on which the denial of refunding is based or references to specific findings in another document that form the basis for the denial of refunding (such as reference to item numbers in an on-site review report or instrument), and citation to any statutory provisions, regulations or policy issuances on which ACF is relying for its determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The identity of the delegate agency, if the activities of that delegate agency are the basis, in whole or in part, for the proposed denial of refunding; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the responsible HHS official has initiated denial of refunding proceedings because of the activities of a delegate agency, the delegate agency may participate in the hearing as a matter of right. Any other delegate agency, person, agency or organization that wishes to participate in the hearing may request permission to do so from the Departmental Appeals Board. Any request for participation, including a request by a delegate agency, must be filed within 30 days of the grantee's appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement that failure of the notice of denial of refunding to meet the requirements of this paragraph may result in the dismissal of the denial of refunding action without prejudice, or the remand of that action for the purpose of reissuing it with the necessary corrections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The appeal may be made only by the Board of Directors of the grantee or by an official acting on behalf of such Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the responsible HHS official has initiated denial of refunding proceedings because of the activities of a delegate agency, that delegate agency may participate in the hearing as a matter of right. Any other delegate agency, person, agency or organization that wishes to participate in the hearing may request permission to do so from the Departmental Appeals Board. Any request for participation, including a request by a delegate agency, must be filed within 30 days of the grantee's appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Paragraphs (i), (j), and (k) of 45 CFR 1303.14 shall apply to appeals of denials of refunding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The Departmental Appeals Board sanctions with respect to a grantee's appeal of denial of refunding are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If in the judgment of the Departmental Appeals Board a grantee has failed to substantially comply with the provisions of the preceding paragraphs of this section, its appeal must be dismissed with prejudice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Departmental Appeals Board concludes that the grantee's failure to comply is not substantial, but is confined to one or a few specific instances, it shall bar the submittal of an omitted document, or preclude the raising of an argument or objection not timely raised in the appeal, or deny a request for a document or other ``discovery'' request not timely made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The sanctions set forth in paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) of this section shall not apply if the Departmental Appeals Board determines that a grantee has shown good cause for its failure to comply with the relevant requirements. Delays in obtaining representation shall not constitute good cause. Matters within the control of its agents and attorneys shall be deemed to be within the control of the grantee.
