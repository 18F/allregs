                                Sec. 42.24  Adoption under the Hague Convention on Protection of   the Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as described in paragraph (n), for purposes of this  section, the definitions in 22 CFR 96.2 apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)(F)</em> if Form I-600A or I-600 was filed  before the Convention effective date. Although this part 42 generally  applies to the issuance of immigrant visas, this section 42.24 may also  provide the basis for issuance of a nonimmigrant visa to permit a  Convention adoptee to travel to the United States for purposes of  naturalization under INA section 322.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The provisions of this section govern the operations of consular  officers in processing cases involving children for whom classification  is sought under INA section 101(b)(1)(G), unless the Secretary of State  has personally waived any requirement of the IAA or these regulations in  a particular case in the interests of justice or to prevent grave  physical harm to the child, to the extent consistent with the  Convention.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An alien child shall be classifiable under INA section  101(b)(1)(G) only if, before the child is adopted or legal custody for  the purpose of adoption is granted, a petition for the child has been  received and provisionally approved by a DHS officer or, where  authorized by DHS, by a consular officer, and a visa application for the  child has been received and annotated in accordance with paragraph (h)  of this section by a consular officer. No alien child shall be issued a  visa pursuant to INA section 101(b)(1)(G) unless the petition and visa  application are finally approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a petition for a child under INA section 101(b)(1)(G) is  properly filed with a consular officer, the consular officer will review  the petition for the purpose of determining whether it can be  provisionally approved in accordance with applicable DHS requirements.  If a properly completed application for waiver of inadmissibility is  received by a consular officer at the same time that a petition for a  child under INA section 101(b)(1)(G) is received, provisional approval  cannot take place unless the waiver is approved, and therefore the  consular officer, pursuant to 8 CFR 204.313(i)(3) and 8 CFR 212.7, will  forward the petition and the waiver application to DHS for decisions as  to approval of the waiver and provisional approval of the petition. If a  petition for a child under INA section 101(b)(1)(G) is received by a DHS  officer, the consular officer will conduct any reviews, determinations  or investigations requested by DHS with   regard to the petition and classification determination in accordance  with applicable DHS procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A petition shall be provisionally approved by the consular  officer if, in accordance with applicable DHS requirements, it appears  that the child will be classifiable under INA section 101(b)(1)(G) and  that the proposed adoption or grant of legal custody will be in  compliance with the Convention. If the consular officer knows or has  reason to believe the petition is not provisionally approvable, the  consular officer shall forward it to DHS pursuant to 8 CFR  204.313(i)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> After a petition has been provisionally approved, a completed  visa application form, any supporting documents required pursuant to  Sec. 42.63 and Sec. 42.65, and any required fees must be submitted to  the consular officer in accordance with Sec. 42.61 for a provisional  review of visa eligibility. The requirements in Sec. Sec. 42.62, 42.64,  42.66 and 42.67 shall also be satisfied to the extent practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A consular officer shall provisionally determine visa  eligibility based on a review of the visa application, submitted  supporting documents, and the provisionally approved petition. In so  doing, the consular officer shall follow all procedures required to  adjudicate the visa to the extent possible in light of the degree of  compliance with Sec. Sec. 42.62 through 42.67. If it appears, based on  the available information, that the child would not be ineligible under  INA section 212 or other applicable law to receive a visa, the consular  officer shall so annotate the visa application. If evidence of an  ineligibility is discovered during the review of the visa application,  and the ineligibility was not waived in conjunction with provisional  approval of the petition, the prospective adoptive parents shall be  informed of the ineligibility and given an opportunity to establish that  it will be overcome. If the visa application cannot be annotated as  described above, the consular officer shall deny the visa in accordance  with Sec. 42.81, regardless of whether the application has yet been  executed in accordance with Sec. 42.67(a); provided however that, in  cases in which a waiver may be available under the INA and the consular  officer determines that the visa application appears otherwise  approvable, the consular officer shall inform the prospective adoptive  parents of the procedure for applying to DHS for a waiver. If in  addition the consular officer comes to know or have reason to believe  that the petition is not clearly approvable as provided in 8 CFR  204.313(i)(3), the consular officer shall forward the petition to DHS  pursuant to that section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> If the petition has been provisionally approved and the visa  application has been annotated in accordance with subparagraph (h), the  consular officer shall notify the country of origin that the steps  required by Article 5 of the Convention have been taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> After the consular officer has received appropriate notification  from the country of origin that the adoption or grant of legal custody  has occurred and any remaining requirements established by DHS or  Sec. Sec. 42.61 through 42.67 have been fulfilled, the consular  officer, if satisfied that the requirements of the IAA and the  Convention have been met with respect to the adoption or grant of legal  custody, shall affix to the adoption decree or grant of legal custody a  certificate so indicating. This certificate shall constitute the  certification required by IAA section 301(a) and INA section 204(d)(2).  For purposes of determining whether to issue a certificate, the fact  that a consular officer notified the country of origin pursuant to  paragraph (i) of this section that the steps required by Article 5 of  the Convention had been taken and the fact that the country of origin  has provided appropriate notification that the adoption or grant of  legal custody has occurred shall together constitute prima facie  evidence of compliance with the Convention and the IAA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> If the consular officer is unable to issue the certificate  described in paragraph (j) of this section, the consular officer shall  notify the country of origin of the consular officer's decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> After the consular officer determines whether to issue the  certificate described in paragraph (j) of this section, the consular  officer shall finally adjudicate the petition and visa application in  accordance with standard procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> If the consular officer is unable to give final approval to the  visa application or the petition, then the consular officer shall  forward the petition to DHS, pursuant to Sec. 42.43 or 8 CFR  204.313(i)(3), as applicable, for appropriate action in accordance with  applicable DHS procedures, and/or refuse the visa application in  accordance with Sec. 42.81. The consular officer shall notify the  country of origin that the visa has been refused.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)(1)</em> of this section may qualify for visa  status under INA section 101(b)(1)(G)(iii) without meeting the  requirements set forth in paragraphs (d) through (m) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(G)(iii)(III)</em>, provided that a petition is filed for  such child in accordance with DHS requirements not later than November  30, 2012.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For any alien described in paragraph (n)(1) of this section, the  ``competent authority'' referred to in INA section  101(b)(1)(G)(i)(V)(aa) is a court or governmental agency of a foreign  country of origin having jurisdiction and authority to make decisions in  matters of child welfare, including adoption. If the competent authority  over matters of child welfare no longer has jurisdiction or authority  over the alien due to his or her age, then the passport issuing  authority of the country of origin may be considered the competent  authority for the purposes of INA section 101(b)(1)(G)(i)(V)(aa).
