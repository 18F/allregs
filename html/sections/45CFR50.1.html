                            <p class="depth0">Under the authority of Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act  of 1961 (75 Stat. 527) and the Immigration and Nationality Act as  amended (84 Stat. 116), the Department of Health and Human Services is  an ``interested United States Government agency'' with the authority to  request the Department of State to recommend to the Attorney General  waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement for Exchange  Visitors under the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Program. HHS  eligibility requirement criteria for waivers are in addition to and  independent of the existing waiver and visa criteria established by the  Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), the Department of State,  and the Department of Labor. The waiver regulations described in this  part do not relieve alien physicians seeking a waiver of the 2-year  foreign residence requirement from complying with the terms and  conditions imposed on their admission to the United States.
