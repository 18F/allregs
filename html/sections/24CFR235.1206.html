                            <p class="depth0">As used in this subpart, the following terms shall have the meaning  indicated:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Adjusted annual income means the annual family income remaining  after making certain exclusions from gross annual income. The following  items shall be excluded, in the order listed, from family gross annual  income:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 5 percent of such gross annual income, in lieu of amounts to be  withheld   (social security, retirement, health insurance, etc.) regardless of the  actual amount of such withholdings;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any unusual income or temporary income, such as overtime pay  which will be discontinued, income of a secondary wage earner which will  terminate, unemployment compensation which does not occur regularly, or  other income of a temporary nature which will be or has been  discontinued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The earnings of each minor in the family who is living with such  family, plus the sum of $300 for each such minor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Family means: (1) Two or more persons related by blood,  marriage, or operation of law, who occupy the same unit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A handicapped person who has a physical impairment which is  expected to be of a continued duration and which impedes his ability to  live independently unless suitable housing is available; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A single person, 62 years of age or older.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Gross annual income means the total income, before taxes and  other deductions, received by all members of the mortgagor's household.  There shall be included in this total income all wages, social security  payments, retirement benefits, military and veteran's disability  payments, unemployment benefits, welfare benefits, interest and dividend  payments, and such other income items as the Secretary considers  appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Minor means a person under the age of 21. As used in this  subpart, minor shall not include a mortgagor or his or her spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Substantial rehabilitation means the improvement of a unit in  substandard condition to a decent, safe and sanitary level, meeting  FHA's standards for mortgage insurance. Units are in substandard  condition when, while they may be structurally sound, they do not  provide safe and adequate shelter, and in their present condition  endanger the health, safety, or well-being of the occupants. Such  housing has one or more defects, or a combination of potential defects  in sufficient number or extent to require considerable repair or  rebuilding, or is of inadequate original construction. The defects are  either so critical or so widespread that the structure should be  extensively repaired. The estimated cost of the rehabilitation should  normally not be less than 25 percent of the value of the property  (including land) after rehabilitation. The rehabilitation should be of  such scope that, when completed, all the components in the house are  operable and should not be anticipated to require any work or major  expense over and above normal maintenance for the first one-fourth to  one-third of the mortgage term.
