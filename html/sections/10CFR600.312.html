                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Methods available. Payment methods for awards with for-profit  organizations are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reimbursement. Under this method, the recipient requests  reimbursement for costs incurred during a particular time period. In  cases where the recipient submits requests for payment to the  contracting officer, the DOE payment office reimburses the recipient by  electronic funds transfer after approval of the request by the  designated contracting officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(iii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Selecting a method. (1) The preferred payment method is the  reimbursement method, as described in paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this  section, may be used in exceptional circumstances, subject to the  following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The contracting officer, in consultation with the program  official, determines in writing that advance payments are necessary or  will materially contribute to the probability of success of the project  contemplated under the award (e.g., as startup funds for a project  performed by a newly formed company).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Cash advances must be limited to the minimum amounts needed to  carry out the program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Recipients and DOE must maintain procedures to ensure that the  timing of cash advances is as close as is administratively feasible to  the recipients' disbursements of the funds for program purposes,  including direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of  any allowable indirect costs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Recipients must maintain advance payments of Federal funds in  interest-bearing accounts, and remit annually the interest earned to the  contracting officer for return to the Department of Treasury's  miscellaneous receipts account, unless one of the following applies:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per  year.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not  be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash  balances.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The depository would require an average or minimum balance so  high that establishing an interest bearing account would not be  feasible, given the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Frequency of payments. For either reimbursements or advance  payments, recipients may submit requests for payment monthly, or more  often if authorized by the contracting officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Forms for requesting payment. DOE may authorize recipients to  use the SF-270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement;'' the SF-271,  ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction  Programs;'' or prescribe other forms or formats as necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Timeliness of payments. Payments normally will be made within 30  calendar days of the receipt of a recipient's request for reimbursement  or advance by the office designated to receive the request, unless the  billing is improper.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Precedence of other available funds. Recipients must disburse  funds available from program income, rebates, refunds, contract  settlements, audit recoveries, credits, discounts, and interest earned  on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Withholding of payments. Unless otherwise required by statute,  contracting officers may not withhold payments for proper charges made  by recipients during the project period for reasons other than the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A recipient failed to comply with project objectives, the terms  and conditions of the award, or Federal reporting requirements, in which  case the contracting officer may suspend payments in accordance with  Sec. 600.352.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The recipient is delinquent on a debt to the United States (see  definitions of ``debt'' and ``delinquent debt'' in 32 CFR 22.105). In  that case, the contracting officer may, upon reasonable notice, withhold  payments to the recipient until the debt owed is resolved.</p>
