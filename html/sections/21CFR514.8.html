Any such protocols, if not included in the approved application, or changes to an approved protocol, must be submitted as a supplement requiring approval from FDA prior to distribution of the drug produced with the manufacturing change. The supplement, if approved, may subsequently justify a reduced reporting category for the particular change because the use of the protocol for that type of change reduces the potential risk of an adverse effect. A comparability protocol supplement must be labeled ``Prior Approval Supplement--Comparability Protocol.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Changes requiring submission of a supplement at least 30 days prior to distribution of the drug made using the change (moderate changes).
