We will determine the child poverty rate in each State  based on estimates from either the Census Bureau or the State, as  described in this section. Each year we will use these data to determine  the change in the State's child poverty rate over a two-year period,  beginning with calendar years 1996 and 1997.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Estimates from the Census Bureau. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Annually, we will obtain  from the Census Bureau and provide to each State the estimate of the  number and percentage of children in poverty in each State. The estimate  will be based on the Census Bureau methodology.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In 2000, and annually thereafter, we will determine for each  State, at the 90-percent confidence level, the percentage change in the  child poverty rate and provide this information to the State. The  determination of percentage change in 2000 will cover the change between  calendar years 1996 and 1997.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Estimates from the State. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As an alternative to the Census  Bureau estimates provided to the State under paragraph (b) of this  section, the State may provide to us data on child poverty in the State  derived from an independent source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the State provides data on child poverty as described in  paragraph (c)(1) of this section, it must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provide an estimate of the child poverty rate for the same two  calendar years as the Census Bureau estimates provided to the State  under paragraph (b)(2) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide the change in the child poverty rate for the applicable  two-calendar-year period at the 90-percent confidence level;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Use the official definition of poverty as used by the Census  Bureau; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Describe the methodology used to develop its independent  estimates, the sources of data and methodology for collecting the data,  any known problems associated with making estimates of this type, the  estimate of the standard error, and the power of the sample to detect a  five percent change in the child poverty rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State must submit its independent estimates and supporting  information within 45 days of the date the State receives the Census  Bureau estimates as described in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determination of the State's child poverty rate. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If we  determine that the State's independent estimates of the child poverty  rate are more reliable than the Census Bureau estimates, we will accept  these estimates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For all other States, we will determine the State's child  poverty rate based on the Census Bureau's estimates.</p>
