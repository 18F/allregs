FNS will evaluate whether the State agency has actively taken steps to ensure that school food authorities comply with the provisions of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State agency compliance.

When administrative or follow-up review activity conducted by FNS in accordance with the provisions

of paragraph (d)(2) of this section results in the denial of all or part of a Claim for Reimbursement or withholding of payment, a school food authority may appeal the FNS findings by filing a written request with the Chief, Administrative Review Branch, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service, 3101 Park Center Drive, Alexandria, Virginia, 22302, in accordance with the appeal procedures specified in this paragraph:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The written request for a review of the record shall be postmarked within 15 calendar days of the date the appellant received the notice of the denial of all or a part of the Claim for Reimbursement or withholding payment and the envelope containing the request shall be prominently marked ``REQUEST FOR REVIEW''.
