                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Certification requirements. For any qualified biobased product offered for preferred procurement, manufacturers and vendors must certify that the product meets the biobased content requirements for the designated product category or designated intermediate

ingredient or feedstock category within which the qualified biobased product falls. Paragraph (c) of this section addresses how to determine biobased content. Upon request, manufacturers and vendors must provide USDA and Federal agencies information to verify biobased content for products certified to qualify for preferred procurement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Minimum biobased content. Unless specified otherwise in the designation of a particular product category or intermediate ingredient or feedstock category, the minimum biobased content requirements in a specific category designation refer to the organic carbon portion of the product, and not the entire product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determining biobased content. Verification of biobased content must be based on third party ASTM/ISO compliant test facility testing using the ASTM Standard Method D6866, ``Standard Test Methods for Determining the Biobased Content of Solid, Liquid, and Gaseous Samples Using Radiocarbon Analysis.'' ASTM Standard Method D6866 determines biobased content based on the amount of biobased carbon in the material or product as percent of the weight (mass) of the total organic carbon in the material or product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Biobased products, intermediate ingredients or feedstocks. Biobased content will be based on the amount of biobased carbon in the product or material as a percent of the weight (mass) of the total organic carbon in the product or material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Final products composed of designated intermediate ingredient or feedstock materials. The biobased content of final products composed of designated intermediate ingredient or feedstock materials will be determined by calculating the percentage by weight (mass) that the biobased component of each designated intermediate ingredient or feedstock material represents of the total organic carbon content of the final product and summing the results (if more than one designated intermediate ingredient or feedstock is used). If the final product also contains biobased content from intermediate ingredient or feedstock material that is not designated, the percentage by weight that these biobased ingredients represent of the total organic carbon content should be included in the calculation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Complex assemblies. The biobased content of a complex assembly product, where the product has ``n'' components whose biobased and organic carbon content can be experimentally determined, will be calculated using the following equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01AU14.001
Where:
Mi = mass of the nth componentBCCi = biobased carbon content of the nth component (%)OCCi = organic carbon content of the nth component (%)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Products and intermediate ingredients or feedstocks with the same formulation. In the case of products and intermediate ingredients or feedstocks that are essentially the same formulation, but marketed under more than one brand name, biobased content test data need not be brand-name specific.
