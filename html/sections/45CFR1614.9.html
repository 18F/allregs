that is, the Corporation may waive all or some of the required expenditure for a fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applications for waivers of any requirement under this Part may be for the current or next fiscal year. All such applications must be in writing. Applications for waivers for the current fiscal year must be received by the Corporation during the current fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At the expiration of a waiver a recipient may seek a similar or identical waiver.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> All waiver requests shall be addressed to LSC. The Corporation shall make a written response to each such request postmarked not later than thirty (30) days after its receipt. If the request is denied, the Corporation will provide the recipient with an explanation and statement of the grounds for denial. If the waiver is to be denied because the information submitted is insufficient, the Corporation will inform the recipient as soon as possible, both orally and in writing, about what additional information is needed. Should the Corporation fail to so respond, the request shall be deemed to be granted.</p>
