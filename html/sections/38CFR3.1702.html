If no executor or administrator has been appointed then by some person acting for such estate who will make distribution of the burial allowance to the person or persons entitled under the laws governing the distribution of interstate estates in the State of the decedent's personal domicile.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Claims for the plot or interment allowance (except for claims filed by a State or an agency or political subdivision thereof), under Sec.  3.1707 may be executed by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The funeral director, if he or she provided the plot or interment services, or advanced funds to pay for them, and if the entire bill for such or any balance thereof is unpaid (if the unpaid bill or the unpaid balance is less than the statutory plot or interment allowance, only the unpaid amount may be claimed by the funeral director); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The person(s) whose personal funds were used to defray the cost of the plot or interment expenses; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The person or entity from whom the plot was purchased or who provided interment services if the bill for such is unpaid in whole or in part.

Any remaining balance of the plot or interment allowance may then be applied to interment expenses; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The executor or administrator of the estate of the veteran or the estate of the person who bore the expense of the plot or interment expenses. If no executor or administrator has been appointed, claim for the plot or interment allowance may be filed as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section for the burial allowance.
