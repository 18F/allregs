                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The lender is responsible for ensuring that proper  and adequate security is obtained and maintained to fully secure the  loan, protect the interest of the lender and the Agency, and assure  repayment of the loan or line of credit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The lender will obtain a lien on additional security when  necessary to protect the Agency's interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Guaranteed and unguaranteed portions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All security must  secure the entire loan or line of credit. The lender may not take  separate security to secure only that portion of the loan or line of  credit not covered by the guarantee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The lender may not require compensating balances or certificates  of deposit as means of eliminating the lender's exposure on the  unguaranteed portion of the loan or line of credit. However,  compensating balances or certificates of deposit as otherwise used in  the ordinary course of business are allowed for both the guaranteed and  unguaranteed portions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Identifiable security. The guaranteed loan must be secured by  identifiable collateral. To be identifiable, the lender must be able to  distinguish the collateral item and adequately describe it in the  security instrument.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Type of security. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Guaranteed loans may be secured by any  property if the term of the loan and expected life of the property will  not cause the loan to be undersecured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For loans with terms greater than 7 years, a lien must be taken  on real estate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Loans can be secured by a mortgage on leasehold properties if  the lease has a negotiable value and is subject to being mortgaged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The lender or Agency may require additional personal and  corporate guarantees to adequately secure the loan. These guarantees are  separate from, and in addition to, the personal obligations arising from  members of an entity signing the note as individuals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Lien position. All guaranteed loans will be secured by the best  lien obtainable. Provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any chattel-secured guaranteed loan must have a higher lien  priority (including purchase money interest) than an unguaranteed loan  secured by the same chattels and held by the same lender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Junior lien positions are acceptable only if the total amount of  debt with liens on the security, including the debt in junior lien  position, is less than or equal to 85 percent of the value of the  security. Junior liens on crops or livestock products will not be relied  upon for security unless the lender is involved in multiple guaranteed  loans to the same borrower and also has the first lien on the  collateral.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When taking a junior lien, prior lien instruments will not  contain future advance clauses (except for taxes, insurance, or other  reasonable costs to protect security), or cancellation, summary  forfeiture, or other clauses that jeopardize the Government's or the  lender's interest or the borrower's ability to pay the guaranteed loan,  unless any such undesirable provisions are limited, modified, waived or  subordinated by the lienholder for the benefit of the Agency and the  lender.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Additional security, or any loan of $10,000 or less may be  secured by the best lien obtainable on real estate   without title clearance or legal services normally required, provided  the lender believes from a search of the county records that the  applicant can give a mortgage on the farm and provided that the lender  would, in the normal course of business, waive the title search. This  exception to title clearance will not apply when land is to be  purchased.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Multiple owners. If security has multiple owners, all owners  must execute the security documents for the loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Exceptions. The Deputy Administrator for Farm Loan Programs has  the authority to grant an exception to any of the requirements involving  security, if the proposed change is in the best interest of the  Government and the collection of the loan will not be impaired.
