                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The monitor system must act to ensure that any of the following conditions do not persist for longer than the periods specified when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There is a change in the ground component contribution to the mean glidepath error component such that the path following error on any glidepath exceeds the limits specified in Sec. 171.317(d) for a period of more than one second.</p><p class="depth3">Note: The above requirement and the requirement to limit the ground equipment mean error to 0.067 degree can be satisfied by the following procedure. The integral monitor alarm limit should be set to 0.067 degree. This will limit the electrical component of mean glidepath error to 0.067 degree. The field monitor alarm limit should be set such that with the mean glidepath error at the alarm limit the total allowed PFE is not exceeded on any commissioned glidepath from the limit of coverage to an altitude of 100 feet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is a reduction in the radiated power to a level not less than that specified in Sec. 171.317(a)(4) for a period of more than one second.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There is an error in the preamble DPSK transmission which occurs more than once in any one second period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> There is an error in the time division multiplex synchronization of a particular elevation function such that the requirement specified in Sec. 171.311(e) is not satisfied and this condition persists for more than one second.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A failure of the monitor is detected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The period during which erroneous guidance information is radiated must not exceed the periods specified in Sec. 171.319(a). If the fault is not cleared within the time allowed, radiation shall cease. After shutdown, no attempt must be made to restore service until a period of 20 seconds has elapsed.</p>
