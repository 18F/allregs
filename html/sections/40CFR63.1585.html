                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An existing industrial POTW treatment plant demonstrates compliance by operating treatment and control devices which meet all requirements specified in the appropriate industrial NESHAP(s). Requirements may include performance tests, routine monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you have a new or reconstructed industrial POTW plant, you must first determine whether the control requirements set forth in the applicable industrial NESHAP(s) or the control requirements applicable to a new or reconstructed nonindustrial POTW under Sec. 63.1586 would require more stringent overall control of HAP emissions. You must then meet whichever set of requirements is more stringent. If you determine that the controls required by the applicable industrial NESHAP(s) are more stringent, you demonstrate compliance by operating treatment and control devices which meet all requirements specified in those industrial NESHAP(s). If you determine that the controls required for a new or reconstructed nonindustrial POTW are more stringent, you demonstrate compliance by meeting all requirements in Sec. Sec. 63.1586 through 63.1590.</p><p class="depth2">Non-industrial POTW Treatment Plant Requirements</p>
