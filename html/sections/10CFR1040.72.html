                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Accessibility. A recipient shall operate any program or activity  to which this subpart applies so that when each part is viewed in its  entirety it is readily accessible and usable by handicapped persons.  This paragraph does not require a recipient to make each of its existing  facilities or every part of a facility accessible to and useable by  handicapped persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Methods. A recipient may comply with the requirements of  paragraph (a) of this section through such means as redesign of  equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible  buildings, assignment of aids to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of  health, welfare, or other social services at alternate accessible sites,  alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities in  conformance with the requirements of Sec. 1040.73 or any other methods  that result in making its program or activity accessible to handicapped  persons. A recipient is not required to make structural changes in  existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving  compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing among  available methods for   meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient  shall give priority to those methods that serve handicapped persons in  the most integrated setting appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time period. A recipient shall comply with the requirement of  paragraph (a) of this section within 60 days of the effective date of  this subpart except that where structural changes in facilities are  necessary, the changes are to be made as expeditiously as possible, but  in no event later than three years after the effective date of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to  facilities are necessary to meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of  this section, a recipient shall develop, within 6 months of the  effective date of this subpart, a transition plan setting forth the  steps necessary to complete the changes. The plan is to be developed  with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons  or organizations representing handicapped persons, and the plan is to  meet with the approval of the Director, Federally Assisted Programs  Division, Office of Equal Opportunity, DOE. A copy of the transition  plan is to be made available for public inspection. At a minimum, the  plan is to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that  limit the accessibility to and usability by handicapped persons of its  program or activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the  facilities accessible;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve  full accessibility under Sec. 1040.72(a) and, if the time period or the  transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be  taken during each year of the transition period; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice. The recipient shall adopt and implement procedures to  ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision  or hearing, can obtain information concerning the existence and location  of services, activities, and facilities that are accessible to, and  useable by, handicapped persons.
