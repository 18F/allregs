                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before applying for discharge review, potential applicants or  their designated representatives may obtain copies of their military  personnel records by submitting a General Services Administration  Standard Form 180, ``Request Pertaining to Military Records,'' to the  National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), 9700 Page Boulevard, St.  Louis, MO 63132. Once the application for discharge review (DD Form 293)  is submitted, an applicant's military records are forwarded to the NDRB  where they cannot be reproduced. Submission of a request for an  applicant's military records, including a request under the Freedom of  Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) after the  DD Form 293 has been submitted, shall result automatically in the  temporary suspension of processing of the application for discharge  review until the requested records are sent to an appropriate location  for copying, are copied, and are returned to the headquarters of the  NDRB. Processing of the application shall then be resumed at whatever  stage of the discharge review process is practicable. Applicants are  encouraged to submit any request for their military records before  applying for discharge review rather than after submitting DD Form 293  to avoid delays in processing of applications and scheduling of reviews.  Applicants and their counsel may also examine their military personnel  records at the site of their scheduled review before the hearing. The  NDRB shall notify applicants of the dates the records are available for  examination in their standard scheduling information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the NDRB is not authorized to provide copies of documents  that are under the cognizance of another government department, office,  or activity, applications for such information must be made by the  applicant to the cognizant authority. The NDRB shall advise the  applicant of the mailing address of the government department, office,  or activity to which the request should be submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The NDRB may take steps to obtain additional evidence that is  relevant to the discharge under consideration beyond that found in the  official military records or submitted by the applicant, if a review of  available evidence suggests that it would be incomplete without the  additional information, or when the applicant presents testimony or  documents that require additional information to evaluate properly. Such  information shall be made available to the applicant, upon request, with  appropriate modifications regarding classified material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In any case heard on request of an applicant, the NDRB shall  provide the applicant and counsel or representative, if any, at a  reasonable time before initiating the decision process, a notice of the  availability of all regulations and documents to be considered in the  discharge review, except for documents in the official personnel or  medical records and any documents submitted by the applicant. The NDRB  shall also   notify the applicant or counsel or representative: (a) of the right to  examine such documents or to be provided with copies of the documents  upon request; (b) of the date by which such requests must be received;  and (c) of the opportunity to respond within a reasonable period of time  to be set by the NDRB.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When necessary to acquaint the applicant with the substance of a  classified document, the classifying authority, on the request of the  NDRB, shall prepare a summary of or an extract from the document,  deleting all references to sources of information and other matters, the  disclosure of which, in the opinion of the classifying authority, would  be detrimental to the national security interests of the United States.  Should preparation of such summary be deemed impracticable by the  classifying authority, information from the classified source shall not  be considered by the NDRB in its review of the case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Regulations of a military department may be obtained at many  installations under the jurisdiction of the Military Department  concerned or by writing to the following address: DA Military Review  Boards Agency, Attention: SFBA (Reading Room), Room 1E520, The Pentagon,  Washington, DC 20310.
