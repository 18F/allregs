With respect to the extradition process, Air Force personnel  have the same status as persons not in the Armed Forces. Accordingly, if  a state other than the state in which the member is located requests the  delivery of a military member, in the absence of a waiver of extradition  process by the member concerned, that state must use its normal  extradition procedures to make arrangements to take the individual into  custody in the state where he or she is located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Air Force will not transfer a military member from a base  within one state to a base within another state for the purpose of  making the member amenable to prosecution by civilian authorities.</p>
