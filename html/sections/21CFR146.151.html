                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Orange juice for manufacturing is the food prepared for further  manufacturing use. It is prepared from unfermented juice obtained from  oranges as provided in Sec. 146.135, except that the oranges may deviate  from the standards for maturity in that they are below the minimum for  Brix and Brix-acid ratio for such oranges, and to which juice may be  added not more than 10 percent by volume of the unfermented juice  obtained from oranges of the species Citrus reticulata or Citrus  reticulata hybrids (except that this limitation shall not apply to the  hybrid species described in Sec. 146.135). Seeds (except embryonic seeds  and small fragments of seeds that cannot be separated by good  manufacturing practice) are removed, and pulp and orange oil may be  adjusted in accordance with good manufacturing practice. If pulp is  added it shall be other than washed or spent pulp. The juice or portions  thereof may be so treated by heat as to reduce substantially the  enzymatic activity and number of viable microorganisms, and it may be  chilled or frozen, or it may be so treated by heat, either before or  after sealing in containers, as to prevent spoilage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The name of the food is ``Orange juice for manufacturing''.  [42 FR 14433, Mar. 15, 1977, as amended at 57 FR 57667, Dec. 7, 1992]</p>
