You may obtain a copy   of this guidance document by contacting the National Technical  Information Service (NTIS) at 800-553-6847.

You must use all the data collected during all other periods  in assessing compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not  reasonably preventable failure of the monitor to provide valid data.  Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or  careless operation are not malfunctions.  [67 FR 40491, June 12, 2002, as amended at 70 FR 40673, July 14, 2005]</p>
