                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Sponsorship and eligibility. In accordance with this part,  sponsorship shall incorporate the processes for confirming eligibility  for an ID card. The sponsor is the person affiliated with the DoD or  other Federal agency who takes responsibility for verifying and  authorizing the applicant's need for an ID card. Applicants for a CAC  shall be sponsored by a DoD Government official or employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The population categories and specific ID cards for which  applicants   are eligible are listed in Appendix 1 of this section. The majority of  these populations are eligible to be sponsored for an ID card based on  either their employment status with the DoD or their authorization to  receive DoD benefits and entitlements. Examples of these population  categories include, but are not limited to: Uniformed services  personnel; DoD civilian employees; military retirees; certain DoD  beneficiaries; and the eligible dependents for these categories.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> and (iii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Both physical access to a DoD facility and access, via logon, to  DoD networks on-site or remotely. Access to the DoD network must require  the use of a computer with Government-controlled configuration or use of  a DoD-approved remote access procedure in accordance with the Defense  Information Systems Agency Security Technical Implementation Guide,  ``Secure Remote Computing'' (available at http://iase.disa.mil/ stigs/a- z.html under ``Remote. . .'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Remote access, via logon, to a DoD network using DoD-approved  remote access procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Physical access to multiple DoD facilities or multiple non-DoD  federally controlled facilities on behalf of the DoD (applicable to DoD  contractors only) on a recurring basis for a period of 6 months or more.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The frequency of ``recurring basis'' for access shall be  determined by the DoD Component concerned in coordination with  installation security policies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> CAC eligibility for applicants requiring physical access to  multiple DoD facilities on a recurring basis for less than 6 months are  risk-based decisions that shall be made by the DoD Component concerned  in coordination with installation security policies. These applicants  may instead be eligible for local or regional base passes in accordance  with Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I))  and local installation security policies and procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Registration and enrollment. In accordance with this part,  sponsorship and enrollment information about the ID card applicant shall  be registered in the DEERS prior to card issuance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For uniformed services personnel and DoD civilians, all  submissions to DEERS must be made electronically via an authorized data  source feed (e.g., Civilian Personnel Management Service). Data source  feeds for additional population categories shall be approved and  incorporated by the Office of the USD(P&R;) (OUSD(P&R;)) as they become  available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The population categories that are not registered via an  authorized data source feed will be registered in DEERS via the RAPIDS  using the DD Form 1172-2 or via the TASS (formerly known as CVS, as  described in Sec. 161.8 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Background Investigation. In accordance with this subpart, a  background investigation is required for those individuals eligible for  a CAC. A background investigation is not currently required for those  eligible for other forms of DoD ID cards. The use of the CAC, as the DoD  Federal personal identity verification (PIV) card, is governed and  supported by additional policies when compared to non-CAC ID cards.  Sponsored CAC applicants shall not be issued a CAC without the required  background investigation stipulated in FIPS Publication 201-1,  ``Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and  Contractors'' (available at http://csrc.nist.gov/ publications/fips/  fips201-1/ FIPS-201-1-chng1.pdf).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A background investigation shall be initiated by the sponsoring  organization before a CAC can be issued. The mechanisms required to  verify completion of background investigation activities for DoD,  military, and civilian CAC populations are managed within the DoD human  resources and personnel security communities and are linked to the CAC  issuance process. An automated means is not currently in place to  confirm the vetting for populations other than DoD military and civilian  personnel such as CAC-eligible contractors and non-DoD Federal civilian  affiliates. When data is not available within the CAC issuance  infrastructure on the background investigation status for an applicant,  the sponsor shall be responsible for confirming that the required  background investigation procedures comply with the FIPS Publication  201-1 before a CAC is authorized for issuance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Initial issuance of a CAC requires, at a minimum, the completion  of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) fingerprint check with  favorable results and submission of a NACI (or investigation approved in  Federal Investigative Standards) to the USD(I) approved investigative  service provider. Completed NACI's for CAC issuance shall be adjudicated  in accordance with Office of Personnel Management Memorandum, ``Final  Credentialing Standards for Issuing Personal Identity Verification Cards  under HSPD-12'' (available at http://www.opm.gov/investigate/resources/ final_credentialing_standards.pdf).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(i)</em> or (ii) of this section prior to CAC issuance. CACs issued to  these non-U.S. persons shall display a blue stripe as described in  Appendix 2 of this section. Procedures for the acceptance of this CAC  shall be in accordance with DoD policy for physical and logical access.  The specific background investigation conducted on the non-U.S. person  may vary based on governing international agreements. Non-U.S. persons  must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Possess (as foreign military, employee, or contract support  personnel) a visit status and security assurance that has been  confirmed, documented, and processed in accordance with international  agreements pursuant to DoD Directive 5230.20, ``Visits and Assignments  of Foreign Nationals'' (available at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/ corres/pdf/523020p.pdf).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Meet (as direct or indirect DoD hire personnel overseas) the  investigative requirements for DoD employment as recognized through  international agreements pursuant to Volume 1231 of DoD Instruction  1400.25, ``DoD Civilian Personnel Management System: Employment of  Foreign Nationals'' (available at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/ corres/html/CPM_table2.html). In addition to these investigative  requirements, a fingerprint check against the FBI criminal history  database, an FBI investigations files (name check search), and a name  check against the Terrorist Screening Database shall be required prior  to CAC issuance in accordance with Office of Personnel Management  Memorandum, ``Final Credentialing Standards for Issuing Personal  Identity Verification Cards under HSPD-12.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Identity and eligibility verification. In accordance with this  part, identity and eligibility verification shall be completed at a  RAPIDS workstation. VOs shall inspect identity and eligibility  documentation and RAPIDS shall authenticate individuals to ensure that  ID cards are provided only to those sponsored and who have a current  affiliation with the DoD. RAPIDS shall also capture uniquely identifying  characteristics that bind an individual to the information maintained in  DEERS and to the ID card issued by RAPIDS. These characteristics may  include, but are not limited to, digital photographs and fingerprints.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(ii)</em> of  this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Children. Children under the age of 18 applying for a dependent  ID card are only required to provide documentation for the initial  verification of eligibility or proof of relationship to the sponsor  described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Documentation for non-U.S. persons. At foreign locations,  eligible non-U.S. persons may not possess identity documentation from  the Form I-9 required for ID card issuance. These individuals shall  still provide personal ID as required by the intent of this paragraph  (d)(1). Non-U.S. persons within the continental United States (CONUS)  shall present a valid (unexpired) foreign passport as the primary form  of identity source documentation. DoD organizations based outside the  CONUS should work with the local consular affairs office to determine  guidelines for the appropriate identity documentation for eligible non- U.S. persons in accordance with agreements with host nations. It is  recommended that a foreign passport be used as the primary form of  identity source documentation for these individuals. The requirement for  the primary identity document to have a photo cannot be waived.  Additional documentation used to verify identity must be original or  certified true copies. All documentation not in English must have a  certified English translation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Eligibility documents. ID card applicants may be required to  provide documentation as initial verification of eligibility for  benefits or proof of relationship to the sponsor. The eligibility  documents shall be inspected for authenticity by the VO and scanned and  stored in DEERS in accordance with the procedures in DMDC, ``Real-time  Automated Personnel Identification System (RAPIDS) User Guide.''  Specifications and the types of documents and how they are utilized to  verify eligibility for a member or dependent based on their status  (e.g., Retired, Reservist, spouse, former spouse, child) shall be  established by the uniformed services subject to the guidelines in this  subpart. All documentation used to verify eligibility must be original  or certified true copies. All documentation not in English must have a  certified English translation. Eligibility documentation is not required  when DEERS can verify eligibility via an authoritative source or  process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> DEERS verification. The VO shall utilize DEERS to verify  affiliation and eligibility for benefits as described in subpart C of  this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Biometrics. In accordance with DoD Directive 1000.25, ID card  applicants shall provide two fingerprint biometric scans and a facial  image, to assist with authenticating the applicant's identity and to  bind the information maintained on that individual in DEERS and to the  ID card issued by RAPIDS. These requirements shall be   integrated into the ID card issuance processes in the following manner:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A digitized, full-face passport-type photograph will be captured  for the facial image and stored in DEERS and shall have a plain white or  off-white background. No flags, posters, or other images shall appear in  the photo. All ID cards issued will display a photograph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Two fingerprints are captured for storage within DEERS for  applicable ID card applicants. The right and left index fingers shall  normally be designated as the primary and secondary finger,  respectively. However, if those fingers cannot be imaged, the primary  and secondary designations shall be taken in the following order of  priority: Right thumb, left thumb, right middle finger, left middle  finger, right ring finger, left ring finger, right little finger, left  little finger.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If two fingerprints cannot be captured, the facial image will  be the alternative for authenticating ID card applicants and ID card  holders during the issuance process. Additionally, when verification or  capture of biometrics is not possible, authorization will be provided by  the RAPIDS SSM's digital signature. This transaction shall be subject to  audit by DMDC and the uniformed services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Issuance. In accordance with this part, ID cards shall be issued  at the RAPIDS workstation after all sponsorship, enrollment and  registration, background investigation (CAC only), and identity and  eligibility verification requirements have been satisfied. Initial  issuance of an ID card to an applicant will be contingent on satisfying  the criteria in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> through (viii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Initial application for permanently incapacitated individuals  over age 21 and temporarily incapacitated children over age 21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All dependent parents and parents-in-law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Illegitimate child of a male sponsor, whose paternity has not  been judicially determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Illegitimate child of spouse or sponsor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Unremarried and unmarried former spouses applying for initial  issuance of an ID card.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Retiree from other services, and former members not currently  enrolled in DEERS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Surviving dependents of Reserve Retirees on the sponsor's 60th  birthday.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Abused dependents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Wards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(A)</em>  and (B) of this section, CACs shall be issued for a period not to exceed  3 years from the date of issuance or contract expiration date, whichever  is shorter. Unfunded contract options shall be considered in the  determination of the length of contract. For example, a contractor hired  under DoD contract with a base year plus 2 option years shall be issued  a CAC with a 3-year expiration. The expiration date of the PKI  certificates on the CAC shall match the expiration date on the card.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> DD Form 1173, ``United States Uniformed Services ID and  Privilege Card,'' or CACs issued to DoD civilian employees, contractors,  and other eligible personnel assigned overseas or deploying in support  of contingency operations shall have an expiration date coinciding with  their deployment period end date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Service Academy students shall be issued 4-year cards with 3- year certificates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Non-CAC ID cards shall be given expiration dates in accordance  with the guidance listed on http://www.cac.mil.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(iii)</em> of this section. To authenticate renewal or reissuance  applicants, the VO shall visually compare the applicant against the  facial image stored in DEERS. For applicants who have fingerprint  biometrics stored in DEERS, live fingerprint biometrics samples shall be  checked against the applicant's DEERS record. If the biometric check  confirms the identity of the renewal or reissuance applicant then no  additional documentation is required to verify identity other than the  ID card that is being renewed or reissued (documentation may still be  required to verify or re-verify eligibility as described in paragraph  (d)(2) of this section). As a general practice for renewal or re- issuance, two fresh fingerprint biometric captures may be stored for  applicable personnel through the initial procedures in paragraph  (d)(4)(ii) of this section to support DMDC's biometric update schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An ID card holder may apply for a renewal starting 90 days prior  to the expiration of a valid ID. The SPO can provide exceptions to this  requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An ID card shall be reissued when printed information requires  changes (e.g., pay grade, rank, change in eligibility), when any of the  media (including printed data, magnetic stripe, bar codes, or integrated  circuit chip) becomes illegible or inoperable, or when a CAC is known or  suspected to be compromised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(A)</em> of this section. The VO shall verify the  cardholder's identity against the biometric information stored in DEERS  and confirm the expiration date of the missing ID card. The individual  shall also be required to present documentation from the local security  office or ID card sponsor confirming that the ID card has been reported  lost or stolen. This documentation must be scanned and stored in DEERS.  For dependents, the DD Form 1172-2 serves as the supporting  documentation for a lost or stolen card. For individuals sponsored  through TASS, the replacement ID card shall have the same expiration  date as the lost or stolen card.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If no identity documentation is available but biometric  information (facial image or fingerprint when applicable) in the DEERS  database can be verified by the VO, an ID card can be reissued to the  individual upon the additional approval of a SSM. This transaction shall  be digitally signed and audited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If biometric information cannot be verified, the requirements  for initial issuance shall apply or a temporary card may be issued in  accordance with paragraph (e)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Temporary cards--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Temporary issuance of a CAC. During  contingency operations, in the event there is no communication with the  DEERS database or the certificate authority, a temporary CAC may be  issued with an abbreviated expiration date for a maximum of 10 days. The  temporary card will not have PKI certificates and will be replaced as  soon as the member can reach an online RAPIDS station or communications  have been restored. Additionally, the temporary CAC does not communicate  or imply eligibility to any DoD benefit. This capability will be enabled  only at affected RAPIDS sites and must have approval granted by DMDC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Temporary issuance of a Uniformed Services Identification card.  There are multiple scenarios under which a temporary Uniformed Services  Identification card may be issued. The uniformed services shall develop  standard processes and procedures for scenarios requiring issuance of a  temporary DD Forms 2765 ``Department of Defense/Uniformed Services  Identification and Privilege Card'' or DD 1173, including but not  limited to those situations where the applicant needs to obtain the  necessary legal documentation or the sponsor is unavailable to provide  an authorizing signature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Multiple cards. Individuals shall be issued a separate ID card  for each population category for which they qualify   as described in Appendix 1 of this section. In instances where an  individual has been issued more than one ID card (e.g., an individual  that is eligible for an ID card as both a Reservist and as a DoD  contractor employee), only the ID card that most accurately depicts the  capacity in which the individual is affiliated with the DoD should be  utilized at any given time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Use and maintenance. In accordance with this part, ID cards  shall be used as proof of identity and DoD affiliation to facilitate  access to DoD facilities and systems. Additionally, ID cards shall  represent authorization for entitled benefits and privileges in  accordance with DoD policies. The CAC, as the DoD Federal PIV card, is  governed and supported by additional policies and infrastructure when  compared to non-CAC ID cards. This section provides additional guidance  on CAC use and maintenance:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Access. The granting of access privileges is determined by the  facility or system owner as prescribed by the DoD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Accountability. CAC holders will maintain accountability of  their CAC at all times while affiliated with the DoD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> PKI. Using the RAPIDS platform, DoD PKI identity and PIV  authentication certificates will be issued on the CAC at the time of  card issuance in compliance with OPM Memorandum, ``Final Credentialing  Standards for Issuing Personal Identity Verification Cards under HSPD- 12.'' Email signature, email encryption, or PIV authentication  certificates may also be available on the CAC either upon issuance or at  a later time. If the person receiving a CAC does not have an  organization email address assigned to them, they may return to a RAPIDS  terminal or use milConnect to receive their email certificate when the  email address has been assigned. To help prevent inadvertent disclosure  of controlled information, email addresses assigned by an organization  shall comply with DoD Instruction 8500.2, ``Information Awareness (IA)  Implementation'' (available at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/ corres/pdf/850002p.pdf).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> milConnect. DoD has a self-service Web site available that  allows an authenticated CAC holder to add applets to the CAC, change the  email address, add/update Email Signature and Email Encryption  Certificates, and activate the Personal Identity Verification (PIV)  Authentication certificate. This capability can be utilized from any  properly configured UNCLASSIFED networked workstation. The milConnect  Web site is https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/milconnect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> CAC Personal ID Number (PIN) Reset. DoD has manned workstations  capable of resetting the PINs of a CAC holder with a locked card or  forgotten PIN. These workstations are intended to provide alternative  locations for CAC holders to service their cards other than RAPIDS  issuance locations. To authenticate cardholders, live biometric samples  shall be checked against the biometrics stored in DEERS prior to  resetting CACs. This process requires the presence of a CPR trusted  agent (CTA) or TASM or RAPIDS VO or SSM.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Retrieval and revocation. In accordance with this part, ID cards  shall be retrieved by the sponsor or sponsoring organization when the ID  card has expired, when it is damaged or compromised, or when the card  holder is no longer affiliated with the DoD or no longer meets the  eligibility requirements for the card. The active status of the card  shall be terminated within the DEERS and RAPIDS infrastructure. The CAC,  as the DoD Federal PIV card, is governed and supported by additional  policies and infrastructure when compared to non-CAC ID cards. This  section provides additional guidance on CAC retrieval and revocation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> CACs shall be retrieved as part of the normal organizational or  command-level check-out processes. The active status of the CAC shall  also be terminated in special circumstances (e.g., absent without leave,  unauthorized absence, missing in action) in accordance with organization  or command-level security policies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The DoD sponsor or sponsoring organization is ultimately  responsible for retrieving CACs from their personnel who are no longer  supporting their organization or activity. CAC retrieval   will be documented and treated as personally identifiable information,  in accordance with DoD Regulation 5200.1-R, and 32 CFR part 310 and  receipted to a RAPIDS site for disposition in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Upon loss, destruction, or revocation of the CAC, the  certificates thereon are revoked and placed on the certificate  revocation list in accordance with Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Networks and Information Integration Certificate Policy, ``X.509  Certificate Policy for the United States Department of Defense''  (available at http://jitc.fhu.disa.mil/ pki/documents/ dod_x509_  certificate_ policy_v9_0_9_ february_ 2005.pdf). All other situations  that pertain to the disposition of the certificates are handled in  accordance with Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and  Information Integration Certificate Policy, ``X.509 Certificate Policy  for the United States Department of Defense'' as implemented.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix 1 to Sec. 161.7--ID Card Descriptions and Population</p><p class="depth0">Eligibility Categories</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> of Sec. 161.7;  additional ID-card eligible categories are codified in subpart C of this  part. RAPIDS accesses DEERS information collected by the DD Form 1172-2  to generate all of the ID Cards identified in this appendix. The  benefits and entitlements that support ID card eligibility for  populations in this appendix are described in subpart C of this part.  Guidelines and restrictions that pertain to all forms of DoD ID cards  are included in this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Armed Forces of the United States Geneva Conventions ID Card-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Description. This CAC is the primary ID card for uniformed services  members and shall be used to identify the member's eligibility for  benefits and privileges administered by the uniformed services as  described in subpart C of this part. The CAC shall also be used to  facilitate standardized, uniform access to DoD facilities,  installations, and computer systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The card shall also serve as ID for purposes of Geneva  Convention requirements in accordance with DoD Instruction 1000.01.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a member is captured as a hostage, detainee, or prisoner of  war (POW), the card shall be shown to the capturing authorities, but,  insofar as possible, should not be surrendered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Eligibility. Those populations eligible for this type of CAC  include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Members of the regular components of the Military Services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Members of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve of the  Reserve Components.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Members of the IRR of the Ready Reserve authorized in  accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense to  perform duty in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 10147.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Uniformed services members of NOAA and USPHS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> U.S. DoD or Uniformed Services ID Card--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Description. This  CAC is the primary ID card for eligible civilian employees, contractors,  and foreign national affiliates and shall be used to facilitate  standardized, uniform access to DoD facilities, installations, and  computer systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Eligibility. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> DoD civilian employees are eligible for this  CAC, to include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Individuals appointed to appropriated fund and NAF positions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> USCG and NOAA civilian employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Permanent or time-limited employees on full-time, part-time, or  intermittent work schedules for 6 months or more.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> SES, Competitive Service, and Excepted Service employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Eligibility for additional populations shall be based on a  combination of the personnel category and the DoD Government sponsor's  determination of the type and frequency of access required to DoD  networks and facilities described in paragraph (a) of Sec. 161.7 of this  subpart. These personnel categories include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Non-DoD civilian employees to include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> State employees working in support of the National Guard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> IPA employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Non-DoD Federal employees that are working in support of DoD but  do not possess a Federal PIV card that is accepted by the sponsoring DoD  Component.
