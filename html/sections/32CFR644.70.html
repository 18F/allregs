                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Closing and Settlement Officers. Payment and closing of cases will be initiated immediately upon completion of curative action, by qualified Closing Officers employed by the Corps of Engineers. To be qualified, a Closing Officer must be employed in the Real Estate Division of a Division or District Office, or in a Real Estate Project or Suboffice, in an Attorney-Advisor position, or in a Realty Officer position if he is a member in good standing of the Bar of a State, Possession, or the District of Columbia, and has been instructed in Federal procedure and in the requirements for closing land acquisition transactions by a Division or District Closing Officer and has been approved by the Division or District Engineer to close land acquisition transactions independently. It is no longer necessary for Closing Officers to be individually bonded. Contracting for closing services will require prior approval of HQDA (DAEN-REA-P).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payment. Payment for land, or interests therein, will be made from funds available to the Division or District Engineer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General. The details of the closing necessarily differ according to the number of vendors and the outstanding interests, the number and variety of the encumbrances and title objections to be met, and miscellaneous other details resulting from complications in the particular title. Upon receipt of the check and title papers, the Closing Officer will review the entire file relating to the acquisition, fully acquaint himself with the terms and conditions of the sale, and with the condition of the title, and will ascertain whether there are any special conditions to be performed, or requirements to be met, on the part of the landowner or the Government and what objections to the title are to be eliminated before valid title may vest in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Curative data. The Closing Officer will determine the character and amount of all outstanding interests in, liens on, or claims against the land, which are to be satisfied out of the purchase price, and see that necessary curative action has been taken and curative data obtained to cure all defects in and meet all objections to the title. If the title evidence consists of a certificate of title of a title company, or a title guarantee policy, approval of the curative material, obtained to eliminate the title objections, must be obtained from the title company.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Continuation of title search. The Closing Officer will satisfy himself that no change has occurred in the land records from the date of the prior certification which will adversely affect the title to the real estate interest being acquired by the United States. Where deemed appropriate because of the complexities of the title, the amount of the purchase price, or other reason, the local representative of the title company or the abstracter will be requested to examine the title records for the purpose of making this determination, and a continuation of the title evidence should be obtained, if considered necessary. Otherwise, the interim title search may be made by the Closing Officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If no adverse change in the status of title has occurred since the date of the preliminary or the latest certification of the title by the abstracter or the title company, as the case may be, the Closing Officer will proceed to close the case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In case of change in ownership during the period, the Closing Officer will order a continuation of the abstract or an intermediate certificate of title or interim binder, as the case may be, and take such action as necessary to cure the title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Payment and Closing Sheet. ENG Form 1566, Payment and Closing Sheet and Receipt for United States Treasurer's Check, covering all charges to be eliminated by payment of money to be deducted from the purchase money check, will be prepared in advance of closing. This sheet will show, in detail, all disbursements of the purchase money, including all amounts to be expended for satisfaction of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Taxes and assessments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Outstanding judgments--State and Federal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Mortgages, deeds of trust, and other liens.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Amounts received under any contract or bond.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Landowner's balance after all charges are deducted from the purchase price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Division or District inspection of premises. The Closing Officer or other authorized Division or District employee will personally make an inspection of the premises to ascertain whether any person is occupying the property in whole or in part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Closing Officer or an authorized Division or District employee will prepare ENG Form 798, Certificate of Inspection and Possession.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If any person other than the vendor is found in possession, the Closing Officer will secure a disclaimer on ENG Form 1290, Disclaimer. The disclaimer will be modified to make allowance of any provision in the offer to sell permitting possession after closing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Closing Officer or an authorized Division or District employee will check to determine that the buildings, improvements, and crops listed on the appraisal report are still on the land being conveyed. Where buildings, improvements, and crops have been reserved by the landowner, it will be determined that only the items reserved have been removed. Whenever possession of land is surrendered to the Government before the time of payment and closing, and immediate inspection and report ENG Form 1567, Report on Vacation of Property, will have been made. The Closing Officer may rely upon this report for the inspection required in the first part of this paragraph unless he is aware of circumstances which would make a supplemental inspection and report proper. If no such inspection and report have been made and possession has been surrendered to the Government, the inspection and report must be made at this time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Closing Officer or an authorized Division or District employee will determine whether there have been repairs or improvements to or construction on the premises which might give rise to mechanics liens.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The ENG Form 798 will be executed and placed with the title papers. If executed by an employee other than the Project Manager or Closing Officer, it must be approved by the Project Manager or Closing Officer, to indicate that the Project Manager or Closing Officer has authorized the employee signing the certificate to make the inspection and is satisfied it has been properly done.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Deed to the United States. (1) The deed to the United States will be drafted in accordance with the ``Standards

for the Preparation of Title Evidence in Land Acquisition by the United States,'' issued by the Department of Justice in 1970.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The deed to the United States will be drafted in accordance with the ``Standards

for the Preparation of Title Evidence in Land Acquisition by the United States,'' issued by the Department of Justice in 1970.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where the landowner's name appears in various forms among the title papers, full use will be made of the ``also known as'' clause in identifying the grantor in the deed to the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The deed shall contain a quitclaim clause by which the grantor quitclaims to the United States all right, title, and interest which the grantor may have in the banks, beds, and waters of any streams bordering the said land to be conveyed, and also all interest in alleys, roads, streets, ways, strips, gores, or railroad rights-of-way abutting or adjoining said land and in any means of ingress or egress appurtenant thereto.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Recording fees, transfer taxes, and similar expenses incidental to conveying real property to the United States; penalty costs for prepayment of any preexisting recorded mortgage entered into in good faith encumbering such real property; and the pro rata portion of real property taxes paid which are allocable to a period subsequent to the date of vesting title in the United States, or the effective date of possession of such real property by the United States, whichever is the earlier, shall be paid by the Government pursuant to authority of section 303, Pub. L. 91-646, approved January 2, 1971.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Satisfaction of liens and encumbrances. All mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments, mechanics liens, and similar encumbrances will be satisfied and released or discharged of record. In the acquisition of easements, liens and encumbrances should be satisfied, released or subordinated to the Government's easement, except as provided in Sec. 644.69(a) or unless administratively waived under Sec. 644.69(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Payments to tenants and lessees. Amounts due lessees, or other tenants, under ENG Form 1564, Consent to Offer to Sell, will be paid from the purchase price or by the landowner direct. In either case, proper receipts and releases will be obtained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Satisfaction and release of liens of taxes and assessments. (1) Except as provided in Sec. 644.69(b) and paragraph (k)(6) of this section, all taxes and assessments which, under the law of the State where the land is located, are a lien on the property as of the date of the delivery and recordation of the deed to the United States must be paid at or before closing, unless provision for their payment is made as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 644.69(b) and paragraph (k)(6) of this section, all taxes and assessments which, under the law of the State where the land is located, are a lien on the property as of the date of the delivery and recordation of the deed to the United States must be paid at or before closing, unless provision for their payment is made as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where closing takes place before the completion of the assessment and levy of the taxes necessary to the determination of the amount of the taxes, or before the taxes are due and payable, a sufficient sum will be withheld from the purchase price to satisfy such taxes when the amount is later determined or they later become due and payable. In cases where the amount of taxes has not been determined, an estimate will be made, after consultation with the assessor and consideration of the amount of taxes paid on the land for the preceding year. The amount withheld should be at least 20 percent in excess of the amount of taxes assessed against the property for the preceding year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the taxes are not due and payable under State law, though the amount has been determined at the time of closing, payment will not be made to the collector or other official charged with the collection of taxes, unless he has authority to accept payment and receipt for them in advance of the due date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Funds withheld for the payment of taxes will be transmitted promptly to the Division or District Engineer in the form of cashier's check or money order payable to the Treasurer of the United States, unless the taxes are paid or held in escrow by the title company. The Closing Officer, in transmitting such payments, must clearly identify, by name, the vendor from whom the tax money was withheld, and must identify the land for which the taxes were withheld by its tract number in the project. He must also identify the taxes for payment of which the money has been withheld by specifying the type of taxes, such as county, city, or school. He will set forth the year each became or becomes due and fully explain the manner in which payment or withholding has been handled in order that proper payment will be effected by the Division or District Engineer when

the taxes are due and payable. Any balance of the amount withheld and not needed to satisfy the taxes will be refunded to the grantor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where payment of the taxes is not possible at the time of closing and funds are withheld for this purpose, the Closing Officer will immediately notify the local tax official that title to the particular tract has been conveyed to the United States and that funds have been withheld for the payment of taxes, specifying the taxes for which an amount has been withheld and stating that such funds are in the custody of the Division or District Engineer. In giving such notice, he will use ENG Form 894, Notice to Tax Official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the taxes become due and payable, the Division or District Engineer will pay such taxes from the funds withheld from the purchase price. Any excess between the amount of taxes actually paid and the amount withheld will be refunded to the grantor by the Division or District Engineer. Refund checks will be transmitted to the grantor only after it has been definitely determined that all taxes which were liens on the tract are shown as satisfied on the books of the tax collector. This is necessary to avoid the possibility of a refund being made before satisfaction of all tax liens. The tax receipt should be forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-REP-S) WASH DC 20314 for filing with the original title papers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where the evidence of title consists of certificates of title or title insurance, and funds are withheld for payment of taxes, the amount so withheld may be turned over to the title company, provided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The title company is financially responsible and will agree to issue a final certificate of title or title policy in which no tax liens or unpaid taxes will be noted or, if noted, will be followed by the statement:</p><p class="depth4">For the payment of which provision has been made by deposit of a sufficient sum with this company.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The title company will enter into an escrow agreement with the grantor to hold such sum for the satisfaction of the taxes when they become due, and to return to the grantor any excess remaining after their payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Agreements have been reached with the Department of Justice that, in the acquisition of easements, the following will apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No provision need be made for the payment of taxes which are a lien but are not due and payable, provided that the purchase price of the easement, including severance damage, is not in excess of 50 percent of the reasonable value of the entire contiguous property of the vendor. In the event the value of the easement has been determined by a ``before and after'' appraisal, the amount of the ``after'' appraisal will be utilized in making the necessary determination. In the event no such appraisal has been made, it will not be necessary to prepare a complete appraisal of the value of the contiguous property. In lieu thereof, a memorandum estimate by a qualified appraiser (staff or contract) will be obtained and placed in the tract file. In either case, the appropriate information will be inserted on ENG Form 3536, Statement Concerning Outstanding Encumbrances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It will not be necessary to withhold funds for payment of current taxes which are due and payable, if the purchase price of the easement is insufficient to pay such taxes. In such case, Item 4 of ENG Form 3536 and the third block of that form will be completed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> ENG Form 3536 will be signed by the Closing Officer and the original will appear as a separate document in the Final Title Assembly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Payment and Recordation of Deed. (1) No disbursement of the purchase price shall be made until:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No disbursement of the purchase price shall be made until:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A duly executed deed has been accepted;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All outstanding charges, liens, or encumbrances on the land have been satisfied and discharged, or a sufficient sum has been withheld from the purchase price to satisfy and discharge such charges, liens and encumbrances; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The title is sufficient for the purposes for which it is being acquired, and all objections thereto have been eliminated or administratively waived in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the requirements of paragraph (l)(i) of this section have been satisfied, the balance of the purchase

price shall be delivered to the landowners.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The deed and all instruments which release liens or encumbrances on the property shall be promptly recorded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Closing of easements acquisitions--(1) Easement costing in excess of $1,000. Closing requirements and procedures with respect to easements costing in excess of $1,000 are the same as in fee acquisitions, except as to mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments, vendors' liens, and similar title infirmities (Sec. 644.69(a)), and as to taxes which are liens but which are not due and payable (paragraph (k)(6) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Easement costing in excess of $1,000. Closing requirements and procedures with respect to easements costing in excess of $1,000 are the same as in fee acquisitions, except as to mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments, vendors' liens, and similar title infirmities (Sec. 644.69(a)), and as to taxes which are liens but which are not due and payable (paragraph (k)(6) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Easements costing not in excess of $1,000. Closing requirements and procedures with respect to easements costing not in excess of $1,000 are the same as a fee acquisition except that title infirmities may be waived as provided in Sec. 644.69(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Payment and closing under power of attorney. Where the landowner is unable or unwilling to be present personally or to pay from his own funds the amount necessary to satisfy all encumbrances and expenses, the following steps may be taken:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Obtain a power of attorney from the landowner. Standard Form 232, Power of Attorney by Individual for the Collection of a Specified Check Drawn on the United States Treasury, will be used. If the landowner is a corporation, Standard Form 236, Power of Attorney by a Corporation for the Collection of a Specified Check Drawn on the Treasurer of the United States, and Standard Form 237, Resolution by Corporation Conferring Authority Upon an Officer to Execute a Power of Attorney for the Collection of Checks Drawn on the Treasurer of the United States, will be used. The power of attorney will be drawn in favor of the Closing Officer making the payment and closing. Immediately after the post office address of the Closing Officer, the following will be inserted, ``Agent for the Disbursing Officer.'' This insertion must be initialed by the person(s) executing the power of attorney. (Above forms are available through the local GSA Regional Office.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Obtain from the landowner ENG Form 1569, Order to Disburse Under Power of Attorney. It will be noted that this form specifically recites types of indebtedness or expense, the names of the persons to be paid under the power of attorney, and the estimated, but not necessarily the exact, amounts thereof. It is important that all items (including cost of revenue stamps, recordation fees for curative material, and bank service charges) be itemized on the form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Closing Officer then will take the necessary action for and on behalf of the landowner to discharge the indebtedness and pay expenses under the ENG Form 1569.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If it is possible to have all interested parties, other than the landowner, present at one time and to make all payments simultaneously, a round table closing will be conducted. The Closing Officer, under the power of attorney and order to disburse, will endorse and cash the Treasurer's check and will make the individual disbursements in actual cash.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If it is possible to determine definitely all items of payment simultaneously, but it is not possible to have all interested parties present at one time, the Closing Officer will, under the power of attorney and order to disburse, endorse and cash the Treasurer's check, obtain separate cashier's checks for all items of payment (including the bank services charge for the issuance of such checks), and deliver the checks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Where it is not possible to determine definitely all items of payment simultaneously, the Closing Officer, under power of attorney and order to disburse, will endorse and cash the Treasurer's check and will obtain separate cashier's checks for all items of payment for which disbursements may be properly made and for any balance representing the total of any items, the amounts of which cannot be definitely determined; in other words, for the residue of the amount of the United States Treasurer's check. In every instance, the cashier's checks will be drawn to provide for endorsement by the Closing Officer or landowner as later determined to be appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Curative material which requires recordation will be recorded for and on behalf of the landowner and will then be placed with the title papers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The usual tax receipts, mortgage releases, judgment satisfactions, etc., will be obtained for each monetary encumbrance which has been discharged. These instruments will be placed with the title papers, unless the landowner wishes to retain them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Separate receipts on ENG Form 1571, Receipt for Payment Under Power of Attorney, must be obtained for each disbursement made under the power of attorney and order to disburse, including a receipt for the balance of the purchase price paid to the landowner. One copy of such receipt will be placed in the project files.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The Closing Officer will prepare an original and two copies of ENG Form 1570, Report of Disbursement Under Power of Attorney, showing the exact amount of each disbursement made under the power of attorney and order to disburse. The Closing Officer will prepare an original and two copies of appropriate certification thereon. The original and two copies will be signed by the landowner, who will retain one copy. The Closing Officer will place one copy in the files of the project office and will place the original with the title papers. The separate receipts on ENG Form 1571 for each disbursement made will be attached to the original ENG Form 1570.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Procurement of check. (1) After acceptance and distribution of the offer assembly and the acquisition is ready for closing, the following instruments and supporting data will be transmitted to the Finance and Accounting Officer for scheduling of SF 1166, Voucher and Schedule of Payments, and issuance of check:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After acceptance and distribution of the offer assembly and the acquisition is ready for closing, the following instruments and supporting data will be transmitted to the Finance and Accounting Officer for scheduling of SF 1166, Voucher and Schedule of Payments, and issuance of check:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Two true copies of the preliminary opinion of the Attorney General, where required; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Two true copies of a preliminary certificate of title or title guarantee policy where the preliminary opinion of the Attorney General is not required; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Two copies of ENG Form 909, Attorney's Preliminary Certificate of Title, in easements acquisition which cost less than $1,000; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Two true copies of other supporting data evidencing amount due and payable, such as statement of closing attorney; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Two true copies of the offer assembly or deed executed by the vendor, if offer form has not been utilized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following statement, appropriately modified, signed by the Chief, Real Estate Division, may be transmitted in lieu of the above listed certificates:</p><p class="depth3">I certify that the check requested hereby is to pay an obligation of the United States as reflected on the attached (Offer to Sell) (easement or deed). I further certify that the parties signatory to this document and shown on the voucher as payees are the same parties reflected in a preliminary certificate of title issued by the _____ Title Company in the possession of the Real Estate Division of this office. The completion of the transaction will be in accordance with existing regulations pertaining to the closing of real estate acquisitions.

The landowner's signature on a voucher is not necessary. On payments involving civil funds, paragraph 3-7g, ER 37-2-10, will be followed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Procedure after payment. When the above closing requirements have been met, the Closing Officer will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Immediately order a final continuation of the type of title evidence which has been contracted for. The final title evidence must be dated as of the date of recordation of the deed to the United States, or a subsequent date, to show a valid title vested in the United States of America subject only to those title defects which have been administratively waived or to those liens and encumbrances for which sufficient funds were withheld from the purchase price to satisfy and discharge them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Check carefully ENG Form 1566, Payment and Closing Sheet and Receipt for United States Treasurer's Check, to see that funds have been properly disbursed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Review the continued abstract, final certificate of title, or title insurance policy, as soon as they are prepared and determine that the proper preliminary and final title evidence and related papers on the case have been completed in proper order. Thereupon a Final Title Opinion will be prepared.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Transmit as the Final Title Assembly to HQDA (DAEN-REA-P) WASH DC 20314, the Final Title Opinion, title

evidence and related papers. This Final Title Assembly must be chronologically arranged and securely fastened for permanent filing, and should include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Abstract of title, properly continued through time of closing; or preliminary, intermediate, and original of final certificate of title; or interim binder and original of the Title Guarantee (Insurance) Policy.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Curative instruments and material pertaining to title defects appearing in the abstract, the final certificate of title, or the title guarantee or insurance policy.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Deed to the United States, executed, stamped, acknowledged, and recorded.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Copy of the accepted offer to sell (ENG Form 42 or ENG Form 2970).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Completed ENG Form 798.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Completed ENG Form 1566.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Statement regarding payment of taxes or amount withheld to pay the taxes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Where required, completed ENG Form 1290.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> If the power of attorney procedure is followed, power of attorney on proper Department of the Treasury Form and completed ENG Forms 1569 and 1571.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Certified copy of any waiver letter or certificate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Any other papers relating to the title or closing of the case.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> An additional copy of the deed and the Attorney's Final Title Opinion for review by the Attorney General.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A copy of the executed and recorded deed will be retained by the Division or District Engineer for the project files.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Similar action will be taken by the Closing Officer in acquisition of easements costing not in excess of $1,000.</p>
