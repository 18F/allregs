When a requested record contains both  discloseable and nondiscloseable information, only that portion which is  reasonably segregable after deletion of the nondiscloseable portions,  will be released. If the information in the discloseable portion is  readily available from another source and that source is made known to  the person making the request, the Corporation need not disclose the  requested record. In all cases where a deletion is made, an explanation  of the deletion shall be attached to the record made available for  inspection, distribution, or copying. Appeal of deletions shall be made  in accordance with subpart H of this part.</p>
