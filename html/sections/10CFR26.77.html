                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section defines management actions that licensees and other  entities who are subject to this subpart must take when an individual  who is subject to this subpart shows indications that he or she may not  be fit to safely and competently perform his or her duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an individual appears to be impaired or the individual's  fitness is questionable, except as permitted under Sec. Sec.  26.27(c)(3), 26.207, and 26.209, the licensee or other entity shall take  immediate action to prevent the individual from performing the duties  that require him or her to be subject to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an observed behavior or physical condition creates a  reasonable suspicion of possible substance abuse, the   licensee or other entity shall perform drug and alcohol testing. The  results must be negative before the individual returns to performing the  duties that require the individual to be subject to this subpart.  However, if the physical condition is the smell of alcohol with no other  behavioral or physical indications of impairment, then only an alcohol  test is required and the results must be negative before the individual  returns to performing his or her duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a licensee or C/V who is subject to subpart I of this part is  certain that the observed behavior or physical condition is the result  solely of fatigue, the licensee or C/V shall ensure that a fatigue  assessment is conducted under Sec. 26.211. If the results of the  fatigue assessment confirm that the observed behavior or physical  condition is the result solely of fatigue, the licensee or C/V need not  perform drug and alcohol tests or implement the determination of fitness  process otherwise required by Sec. 26.189.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For other indications of possible impairment that do not create  a reasonable suspicion of substance abuse (or fatigue, in the case of  licensees and C/Vs who are subject to subpart I of this part), the  licensee or other entity may permit the individual to return to  performing his or her duties only after the impairing or questionable  conditions are resolved and a determination of fitness indicates that  the individual is fit to safely and competently perform his or her  duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a licensee or other entity has a reasonable belief that an  NRC employee or NRC contractor may be under the influence of any  substance, or is otherwise unfit for duty, the licensee or other entity  may not deny access but shall escort the individual. In any such  instance, the licensee or other entity shall immediately notify the  appropriate Regional Administrator by telephone, followed by written  notification (e.g., e-mail or fax) to document the oral notification. If  the Regional Administrator cannot be reached, the licensee or other  entity shall notify the NRC Operations Center.</p>
