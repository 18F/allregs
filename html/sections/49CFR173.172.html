Primary containment of the fuel within  this vessel must consist of a welded aluminum bladder having a maximum  internal volume of 46 L (12 gallons). The outer vessel must have a  minimum design gauge pressure of 1,275 kPa (185 psig) and a minimum  burst gauge pressure of 2,755 kPa (400 psig). Each vessel must be leak- checked during manufacture and before shipment and must be found  leakproof. The complete inner unit must be securely packed in non- combustible cushioning material, such as vermiculite, in a strong outer  tightly closed metal packaging which will adequately protect all  fittings.
