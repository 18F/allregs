                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Written approval. A PHA shall obtain written HUD approval for  all Capital Fund financing transactions that pledge, encumber, or  otherwise provide a security interest in public housing assets or other  property, including Capital Funds, and use Capital Funds for the payment  of debt service or other financing costs. HUD approval shall be based  on:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The ability of the PHA to complete the financing transaction  along with the associated improvements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The reasonableness of the provisions in the Capital Fund  Financing Proposal considering the other pledges or commitments of  public housing assets, the PHA's capital needs, and the pledge being  proposed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the PHA meets the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Antideficiency. Any pledge of future year Capital Fund grants  under this section is subject to the availability of appropriations by  Congress for that year. All financing documents related to future year  Capital Fund amounts must include a statement that the pledging of funds  is subject to the availability of appropriations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conditions on use--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Development. Any public housing that is  developed using amounts under this part (including proceeds from  financing authorized under this part) shall be operated under the terms  and conditions applicable to public housing during the 40-year period  that begins on the date on which the project becomes available for  occupancy, except as otherwise provided in the 1937 Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Modernization. Any public housing or portion of public housing  that is modernized using amounts under this part (including proceeds  from financing authorized under this part) shall be maintained and  operated during the 20-year period that begins on the latest date on  which the modernization is completed, except as otherwise provided in  the 1937 Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Applicability of latest expiration date. Public housing subject  to the use conditions described in paragraph (c) of this section, or to  any other provision of law mandating the operation of housing as public  housing for a specific length of time, shall be maintained and operated  as required until the latest such expiration date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Declaration of Trust. All public housing rental projects must  show evidence satisfactory to HUD of an effective Declaration of Trust  being recorded in first position, meeting the requirements of paragraph  (c) of this section and covering the term of the financing. If part of a  mixed-finance project, this evidence will be with the mixed-finance  evidentiary documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS) designation. Generally,  a PHA shall be designated a standard performer or high performer under  PHAS (24 CFR part 902), and must be a standard performer or higher on  the management and financial condition indicators. HUD will consider  requests from a PHA designated as troubled under PHAS when the PHA is  able to show that it has developed appropriate management and financial  capability and controls that demonstrate its ability to successfully  undertake the Capital Fund Financing Proposal. The PHA must comply with  all applicable fair housing and civil rights requirements in 24 CFR  5.105(a). If a PHA has received a letter of findings, charge, or lawsuit  involving ongoing systemic noncompliance under Title VI of the Civil  Rights Act of 1964, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the  Fair Housing Act, or Section 109 of the Housing and Community  Development Act of 1974, and the letter of findings, charge, or lawsuit  has not been resolved to HUD's satisfaction, then unless the Capital  Fund Financing Proposal is part of a plan to address such findings,  charge, or lawsuit, the PHA will not be eligible for financing pursuant  to the CFFP. HUD will determine if actions to resolve the charge,  lawsuit, or letter of findings taken are sufficient to resolve the  matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Management capacity. A PHA shall have the capacity to undertake  and administer private financing and construction or modernization of  the size and type contemplated. In order to determine capacity, HUD may  require the PHA to submit a management assessment conducted by an  independent third party, in a form and manner prescribed by HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Existing financing. A PHA shall identify the nature and extent  of any existing encumbrances, pledges, or other financing commitments of  public housing funds undertaken by the PHA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Need for financing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A PHA must complete a physical needs  assessment at the project level, in the form and manner prescribed by  HUD that covers the PHA's entire public housing portfolio for the term  of the financing and that takes into consideration existing needs and  the lifecycle repair and replacement of major building components. The  activity to be financed must be identified as a need in the physical  needs assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Based on the assessment under paragraph (g)(1) of this section,  the PHA must demonstrate that the financing will not negatively impact  the ability of the PHA to meet the ongoing needs of its public housing  portfolio over the term of the financing. In making this demonstration,  PHAs must reduce any projected future Capital Fund grants to account for  planned or anticipated activities that would have the effect of reducing  or otherwise limiting the availability of future Capital Fund grants.  PHA projections must be detailed on the portfolio schedule form  prescribed by HUD, and shall project a stabilized number of units  (Stabilized Base Unit Count) to be reached in no more than 5 years after  all planned or anticipated activities have been completed that would  reduce future Capital Fund grants. PHAs must also take into  consideration projected use of Capital Funds for other eligible  activities under part 905, and may take into consideration alternative  sources of financing that are available to help meet its needs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For PHAs that are proposing to borrow more than $2 million on a  cumulative basis, to the extent that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Capital and other eligible Capital Fund needs exceed projected  Capital Fund program funding amounts, and the PHA is not leveraging non- public housing funds as part of its Capital Fund Financing Proposal  transaction, then</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The PHA must demonstrate that it has considered leveraging non- public housing funds, and state why the proposed financing is  appropriate in light of alternative sources available.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Notwithstanding paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section,  PHAs that size their financing by utilizing only replacement housing  factor (RHF) funds, or PHAs that propose to use their Capital Fund  Financing Proposal proceeds as part of a mixed-finance modernization  transaction, are not required to comply with Sec. 905.505(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> CFP Plan. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The use of the CFFP proceeds shall be included in  a form and manner as required by HUD for CFP planning and budgeting and  in a same manner as a Capital Fund grant. The CFFP proceeds shall be  included as a separate Capital Fund grant to the same extent that PHAs  are required to plan and budget Capital Fund grants. The use of Capital  Funds for the payment of debt service and related costs shall be planned  and budgeted as would other eligible uses of Capital Funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As part of its Capital Fund Financing Proposal, the PHA shall  submit a Capital Fund financing budget, in the form and manner required  by HUD, detailing the proposed use of the Capital Fund Financing  Proposal proceeds. There shall be no requirement for PHAs to submit a  Capital Fund financing budget as part of their Capital Fund financing  proceeds where the sizing of the financing is based upon the use of RHF  funds for debt service, or where the Capital Fund Financing Proposal  proceeds are being used as part of a mixed-finance transaction. Approval  letters for mixed-finance and RHF-related Capital Fund financing  transactions shall be conditioned upon the approval of the mixed-finance  proposal, or, in the case of conventional development, upon the approval  of the development proposal and the execution of an associated  construction contract with which the Capital Fund financing proceeds  would be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The work financed with Capital Funds and described in the  Capital Fund financing budget will be based on the physical needs  assessment. The Capital Fund financing budget shall list the work items  (e.g., roof replacement, window replacement, accessibility  modifications) by development. These work items will constitute  performance measures upon which the   PHA's performance will be evaluated. A general representation of the  work (e.g., ``rehabilitation of the development'') is not sufficient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The CFP Plan (submission (as described in paragraph (h) of this  section) shall include a copy of the physical needs assessment described  in Sec. 905.505(g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Financing proceeds under this part may be used only for the  modernization or development of public housing and related costs  including the modernization or development of non-dwelling space.  Financing proceeds may not be used for administration or central office  cost center costs (except for mixed-finance projects), management  improvements, or upon non-viable projects, such as those subject to  required conversion. Financing proceeds may be used to reimburse  predevelopment costs, but only to the extent they were incurred in  conformance with applicable regulatory requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Debt Coverage Percentage. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as stated in Sec.  905.505(i)(2), a PHA shall not pledge more than 33 percent of its annual  future Capital Fund grants for debt service payments, assuming level  Capital Fund appropriations over the term of the debt obligation and any  reduction attributable to activities projected by the PHA to occur  during the term of the financing such as demolition, disposition, or  conversion of public housing units or other occurrences that could limit  the availability of Capital Funds, including a voluntary compliance  agreement. This percentage of Capital Funds dedicated for debt service,  taking into account adjustments for activities that would reduce the  receipt of Capital Funds, is called the ``Debt Coverage Percentage.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A PHA may pledge up to 100 percent of any projected replacement  housing factor (RHF) grants for debt service payments, provided that the  pledge extends to the formula fund portion of its Capital Fund grants  also, but that not more than 50 percent of its overall projected Capital  Fund grants (including formula funds and RHF funds) are pledged. RHF  projections shall account for any projected reductions in RHF over the  term of the financing. Unless otherwise approved by HUD, PHAs shall be  limited to sizing their loans based upon increments of RHF currently  being received by the PHA. CFFP transactions pledging RHF funds shall  include accelerated amortization provisions, requiring all RHF funds  received by the PHA to pay debt service as those RHF funds are received.  A RHF grant shall be used only to develop or pay financing costs for the  development of replacement public housing units in accordance with Sec.  905.10.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subject to the reasonableness test in Sec. 905.505(a)(2), PHAs  may exceed 33 percent when pledging existing Capital Fund grants and RHF  grants for the payment of debt service. Existing grants are grants that  have been received by the PHA at the time of HUD's approval of the  Capital Fund Financing Proposal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Terms and conditions of financing. The terms and conditions of  all financing shall be reasonable based on current market conditions.  The financing documents shall include the following, as applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Term. The term of the Capital Fund financing transaction shall  not be more than 20 years. All Capital Fund financing transactions shall  be fully amortizing. Bridge loans and other short-term loans are  permitted; however, unless otherwise approved by HUD, the CFFP Financing  transaction may not be structured in a manner that generates program  income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acceleration. Unless otherwise approved by HUD, the financing  documents shall provide that HUD approval is required before a lender  may accelerate a PHA's debt obligation, for default or otherwise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Public housing assets. A PHA may not pledge any public housing  assets unless specifically approved in writing by HUD. PHAs seeking  approval of a pledge of public housing assets must submit documentation  to HUD that details the nature and priority of the pledge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Variable interest rate. All variable-rate transactions shall  include an interest-rate cap. The financing documents must specify that  the PHA shall not be liable to pay debt service with public housing  funds, and that there   shall be no recourse to public housing assets, beyond the interest-rate  cap. The limitation on the pledge of Capital Funds specified in Sec.  905.505(i) shall be calculated based on the interest-rate cap.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other pledges or commitments. PHAs seeking approval of a pledge  of public housing assets must describe the nature and extent of existing  commitments or pledges of public housing assets, providing documentation  of such other commitments or pledges to the extent required by HUD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Terms and conditions. Financing documents must include any other  terms and conditions as required by HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Fairness opinion. The PHA shall provide an opinion, in a form  and manner prescribed by HUD, from a qualified, independent, third-party  financial advisor attesting that the terms and conditions of the  proposed financing transaction are reasonable given current market  conditions with respect to such matters as interest rate, fees, costs of  issuance, call provisions, and reserve fund requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Financial controls and construction management. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The PHA  shall have a financial control and construction management plan  describing how the PHA will ensure that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Adequate controls are in place regarding the use of the Capital  Fund financing proceeds; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The improvements will be developed and completed in a timely  manner consistent with the contract documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This plan shall contain protocols and financial control  mechanisms that address the design of the improvements, construction  inspections, construction draws, and requisition approval checks and  balances. A PHA that is designated troubled under PHAS, or other PHAs as  determined by HUD, may be required to institute risk mitigation measures  to ensure that the funds are used properly and for the purposes  intended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Work items. To the extent that any changes in work items  financed by Capital Fund financing proceeds meet or exceed the following  threshold requirements determined by HUD, PHAs must obtain written  approval of amendments to their Capital Fund financing budget from HUD:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A change in the type of activity being financed (for example, if  the approved Capital Fund financing budget contemplated the proceeds  being used for modernization, but after the proposal is approved, the  PHA decides instead to pursue development);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A change in the project being modernized or developed with the  proceeds;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A reduction in 20 percent or more in the number of public  housing units being modernized; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An increase of 20 percent or more of the cost of non-dwelling  space.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Applicability of other Federal requirements. The proceeds of the  Capital Fund financing are subject to all laws, regulations, and other  requirements applicable to the use of Capital Fund grants made under 24  CFR part 905, unless otherwise approved by HUD in writing. PHAs  undertaking CFFP transactions shall be subject to the following  requirements, which shall be further enumerated in a Capital Fund  Financing Amendment to the Annual Contributions Contract (CFF ACC  Amendment):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amounts payable to the PHA by HUD pursuant to the CFFP and  pledged to the payment of debt service by the PHA shall be used  exclusively for debt service in accordance with the debt service  schedule approved by HUD and shall not be available for any other  purpose;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The financing does not constitute a debt or liability of HUD or  the United States, the full faith and credit of the United States are  not pledged to the payment of debt service, and debt service is not  guaranteed by HUD or the United States;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nothing in this CFF ACC Amendment or 24 CFR part 905 is intended  to diminish HUD's authority to administer, monitor, and regulate the  public housing program, including HUD's authority to exercise any  administrative sanction or remedy provided by law; provided, however,  that except as required by law, HUD will not assert any claim or right  under the ACC, including the exercise of administrative sanctions and  remedies, if and to the extent that the effect of such claim or right   would be to reduce the payment of Capital Fund moneys to the PHA below  the level necessary to pay debt service or delay the time for payment of  such moneys such that required amounts would not be available to pay  debt service when due;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The financing is subject to mandatory prepayment prior to the  obligation end date and expenditure end date of the Capital Fund  financing proceeds to the extent necessary for the Capital Fund  Financing Proposal proceeds to comply with section 9(j) of the 1937 Act  (42 U.S.C. 1437g(j)). Bond and loan documents shall include appropriate  provisions such that prepayment shall be made by the lender, trustee, or  appropriate third-party servicer approved by HUD, without any action by  HUD post-approval;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> HUD agrees, subject to the availability of appropriations, to  approve immediately upon receipt from the PHA (subject to any legal  requirements or constraints applicable at the time), a CFP Plan document  (as described in 24 CFR 905.505(h)) and/or an annual CFF ACC Amendment,  to the extent and in an amount sufficient to make the applicable debt  service payment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Prior to cumulatively reducing its inventory of public housing  units by more than 5 percent of the Stabilized Base Unit Count, if,  after the removal of units from inventory, the Debt Coverage Percentage  under Sec. 905.505(i)(1) would constitute more than 33 percent of  future Capital Funds, the PHA shall prepay the financing such that the  reduction in inventory shall not cause the Debt Coverage Percentage to  increase. If the reduction in inventory is required by law or public  housing requirements, the prepayment is not required to be made prior to  the reduction in inventory, but instead shall be made as soon as  possible after the PHA becomes aware of the requirement of law or public  housing requirements, but only to the extent that Capital Funds are not  otherwise needed by the PHA to address the health and safety issues or  other requirements of law in the PHA's public housing portfolio, all as  determined by HUD. For PHAs that size their loans based upon the  projected receipt of RHF funds, prior to undertaking an activity that  will reduce its RHF units below the number of units projected in the  Capital Fund Financing Proposal as required by Sec. 905.505(i)(3), the  PHA shall prepay its loan such that debt service does not exceed 100  percent of projected RHF after accounting for the reduction in RHF  units, all as determined by HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Performance measures. Pursuant to 24 CFR 905.505(h) a PHA is  required to identify in its CFP Plan documents specific items of work  that will be accomplished using the proceeds of the proposed financing.  The identified items, which shall be quantifiable, shall be the basis on  which HUD evaluates a PHA's performance. HUD may also utilize the  Capital Fund financing budget, and Capital Fund Financing Proposal  approval documents as the basis to evaluate a PHA's performance. Failure  to meet performance measures may result in:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Failure to receive HUD approval for future financing  transactions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failure to be considered for future competitive grant programs;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other sanctions HUD deems appropriate and authorized by law or  regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Reporting requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The use of the CFFP proceeds shall  be reported in the same manner as a Capital Fund grant. The PHA shall  submit a performance and evaluation report on a quarterly basis. PHAs  that utilize their Capital Fund financing proceeds as part of a mixed- finance transaction, and PHAs that size their financing based upon RHF  in their Capital Fund financing transactions, are not required to submit  quarterly reports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each CFFP transaction and/or development project is subject to  fiscal closeout in the same manner of a Capital Fund grant. Fiscal  closeout includes the submission of an Actual Modernization Cost  Certificate (AMCC) or Actual Development Cost Certificate (ADCC), an  audit, if applicable, a final quarterly report, and a final Performance  and Evaluation report.</p>
