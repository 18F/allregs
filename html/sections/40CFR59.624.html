                            <p class="depth0">Before we issue you a certificate of conformity, you may amend your application to include new or modified configurations, subject to the provisions of this section. After we have issued your certificate of conformity, you may send us an amended application requesting that we include new or modified configurations within the scope of the certificate, subject to the provisions of this section. You must amend your application if any changes occur with respect to any information included in your application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must amend your application before you take either of the following actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Add a configuration to an emission family. In this case, the configuration added must be consistent with other configurations in the emission family with respect to the criteria listed in Sec. 59.625.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Change a configuration already included in an emission family in a way that may affect emissions, or change any of the components you described in your application for certification. This includes production and design changes that may affect emissions any time during the portable fuel containers' lifetime.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To amend your application for certification, send the Designated Compliance Officer the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Describe in detail the addition or change in the configuration you intend to make.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include engineering evaluations or data showing that the amended emission family complies with all applicable requirements. You may do this by showing that the original emission data are still appropriate with respect to showing compliance of the amended family with all applicable requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the original emission data for the emission family are not appropriate to show compliance for the new

or modified configuration, include new test data showing that the new or modified configuration meets the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We may ask for more test data or engineering evaluations. You must give us these within 30 days after we request them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For emission families already covered by a certificate of conformity, we will determine whether the existing certificate of conformity covers your new or modified configuration. You may ask for a hearing if we deny your request (see Sec. 59.699).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For emission families already covered by a certificate of conformity and you send us a request to amend your application, you may sell and distribute the new or modified configuration before we make a decision under paragraph (d) of this section, subject to the provisions of this paragraph. If we determine that the affected configurations do not meet applicable requirements, we will notify you to cease production of the configurations and any containers from the new or modified configuration will not be considered covered by the certificate. In addition, we may require you to recall any affected containers that you have already distributed, including those sold to the ultimate purchasers. Choosing to produce containers under this paragraph (e) is deemed to be consent to recall all containers that we determine do not meet applicable emission standards or other requirements and to remedy the nonconformity at no expense to the owner. If you do not provide information required under paragraph (c) of this section within 30 days, you must stop producing the new or modified containers.</p>
