                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Unless specified otherwise in the Letter of Authorization, the USAF must notify the Administrator, West Coast Region, NMFS, by letter or telephone, at least 2 weeks prior to activities possibly involving the taking of marine mammals. If the authorized activity identified in Sec.  217.60(a) is thought to have resulted in the mortality or injury of any marine mammals or in any take of marine mammals not identified in Sec.  217.62(c), then the USAF must notify the Director, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, or designee, by telephone (301-427-8401), within 48 hours of the discovery of the injured or dead animal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To conduct monitoring of launch activities, the USAF must designate qualified, on-site individuals approved in advance by NMFS, as specified in the Letter of Authorization, to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conduct observations on pinniped activity in the vicinity of the rookery nearest the launch platform or, in the absence of pinnipeds at that location, at another nearby haul-out, for at least 72 hours prior to any planned launch occurring during the harbor seal pupping season (1 March through 30 June) and continue for a period of time not less than 48 hours subsequent to launching.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For launches during the harbor seal pupping season (March through June), conduct follow-up surveys within 2 weeks of the launch to ensure that there were no adverse effects on any marine mammals,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Monitor haul-out sites on the Northern Channel Islands, if it is determined by modeling that a sonic boom of greater than 1 psf is predicted to impact one of the Islands between March 1 and June 30, greater than 1.5 psf between July 1 and September 30, and greater than 2 psf between October 1 and February 28. Monitoring will be conducted at the haul-out site closest to the predicted sonic boom impact area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Investigate the potential for spontaneous abortion, disruption of effective female-neonate bonding, and other reproductive dysfunction,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Supplement observations on Vandenberg and on the Northern Channel Islands with video-recording of mother-pup seal responses for daylight launches during the pupping season,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Conduct acoustic measurements of those launch vehicles that have not had sound pressure level measurements made previously, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Include multiple surveys each day that surveys are required that record the species, number of animals, general behavior, presence of pups, age class, gender and reaction to launch noise, sonic booms or other natural or human caused disturbances, in addition to recording environmental conditions such as tide, wind speed, air temperature, and swell.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To conduct monitoring of harbor activities, the USAF must designate qualified, on-site individuals approved in advance by NMFS, as specified in the Letter of Authorization. During nighttime activities, the harbor area will be illuminated, and the observer will use a night vision scope. Monitoring activities will consist of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conducting baseline observation of pinnipeds in the project area prior to initiating project activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conducting and recording observations on pinnipeds in the vicinity of the harbor for the duration of the activity occurring when tides are low enough (less than or equal to 2 ft (0.61 m) for pinnipeds to haul out.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Conducting post-construction observations of pinniped haul-outs in the project area to determine whether animals disturbed by the project activities return to the haul-out.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Holders of Letters of Authorization must conduct additional monitoring as required under a Letter of Authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The USAF must submit a report to the West Coast Regional Administrator, NMFS, within 90 days after each launch. This report must contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Date(s) and time(s) of the launch,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Design of the monitoring program, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Results of the monitoring program, including, but not necessarily limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Numbers of pinnipeds present on the haul-out prior to commencement of the launch,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Numbers of pinnipeds that may have been harassed as noted by the number of pinnipeds estimated to have entered the water as a result of launch noise,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The length of time pinnipeds remained off the haul-out or rookery,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Numbers of pinniped adults, juveniles or pups that may have been injured or killed as a result of the launch, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Behavioral modifications by pinnipeds that were likely the result of launch noise or the sonic boom.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An annual report must be submitted on March 1 of each year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A final report must be submitted at least 180 days prior to expiration of these regulations. This report will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Summarize the activities undertaken and the results reported in all previous reports,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assess the impacts at each of the major rookeries,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Assess the cumulative impacts on pinnipeds and other marine mammals from the activities specified in Sec.  217.60(a), and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> State the date(s), location(s), and findings of any research activities related to monitoring the effects on launch noise, sonic booms, and harbor activities on marine mammal populations.</p>
