Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the importer number of the importer of record and the consignee number of the ultimate consignee must be reported for each entry summary and for each drawback entry. When the importer of record and the ultimate consignee are the same, the importer number may be entered in both spaces provided on CBP Form 7501 (boxes 10 and 12) or the importer number may be entered in the space provided for the importer (box 12) and the word ``SAME'' may be entered in the space provided for the ultimate consignee (box 10).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception. In the case of a consolidated entry summary covering the merchandise of more than one ultimate consignee, the importer number must be reported on CBP Form 7501 (box 12) and the notation ``CONSOLIDATED'' must be made in the space provided for the consignee number (box 10).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When refunds, bills, or notices of liquidation are to be mailed to agent.

For each class or kind of merchandise subject to a separate statistical reporting number, the applicable information required by the General Statistical Notes, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), must be shown on the entry summary, CBP Form 7501; the transportation entry and manifest of goods, CBP Form 7512, when used to document an incoming vessel shipment proceeding to a third country by means of an entry for transportation and exportation, or immediate exportation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where form provides space--(A) Single invoice. For each class or kind of merchandise subject to a separate statistical reporting number, the applicable information required by the General Statistical Notes, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), must be shown on the entry summary, CBP Form 7501; the transportation entry and manifest of goods, CBP Form 7512, when used to document an incoming vessel shipment proceeding to a third country by means of an entry for transportation and exportation, or immediate exportation.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Single invoice. For each class or kind of merchandise subject to a separate statistical reporting number, the applicable information required by the General Statistical Notes, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), must be shown on the entry summary, CBP Form 7501; the transportation entry and manifest of goods, CBP Form 7512, when used to document an incoming vessel shipment proceeding to a third country by means of an entry for transportation and exportation, or immediate exportation.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Multiple invoices. If a class or kind of merchandise from the same country of origin subject to the same statistical

reporting number is included in more than one invoice, the importer may, at his option (1) list each invoice separately on the appropriate form listed under paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A) of this section and for each class or kind of merchandise within each invoice subject to a separate statistical reporting number, report the applicable information required by the General Statistical Notes, HTSUS; or (2) combine the information for each class or kind of merchandise and report it under one statistical reporting number for all invoices. When consolidating information from several invoices under one reporting number, a worksheet itemizing the entered value of the merchandise from each invoice in the manner prescribed in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section must be attached to the appropriate form.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where form does not provide space. In addition to the information required by paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, statistical information for which spaces are not provided on the appropriate form, must be shown as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The name, the abbreviated designation or 4 digit code of the country of registry (flag) of the vessel expressed in terms of Annex B, HTSUS, must be placed in the block on the entry document for the name of the importing vessel or carrier.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The notation ``Y'' or ``N'' as appropriate, must be placed in column 33 of CBP Form 7501, and in the top right hand portion of CBP Form 7519, to identify the transaction as one between a buyer and a seller who are related in any manner, or as one between a buyer and a seller who are not so related.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The charges (aggregate cost of freight, insurance and all other charges), must be listed on CBP Form 7501 in column 33. The charges must be listed on CBP Form 7519 in the rate column.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Responsibility. The person filing the form is responsible for providing the information required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section. If the information required by subparagraph General Statistical Note 1(a)(xiv)(xvii), HTSUS, cannot be obtained readily, the person filing the form must provide reasonable estimates of the required information. The acceptance of an estimate for a particular transaction does not relieve the person filing the form from obtaining the necessary information for similar future transactions. The port director may require additional documentation to substantiate the statistical information required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The importer must give an appropriate bond for the production of the required documentation, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except for merchandise entered for warehouse, the documentation must be produced within 50 days after the entry summary (or the entry, if there is no entry summary) is required to be filed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If merchandise is entered for warehouse, the documentation must be produced within 2 months after the date of withdrawal, except that if an invoice is part of the documentation, the invoice must be produced within 50 days after the entry summary for warehouse is required to be filed.
The port director may grant a reasonable extension of time to produce the required documentation for good cause shown. (See Sec. 141.91(d) for bond requirements relating to failure to produce an invoice.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Estimates of statistical information. When the person filing the form estimates any of the values or charges, as provided for in General Statistical Note 1(b)(ii), HTSUS, except Canadian rail and truck charges, he must place either ``(estimate)'', ``(est)'', or (``E'') after the amount of each value or charge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Rejection of form. The port director will reject a form for failure to provide required statistical information if the information is omitted or if the information provided clearly appears on its face, or is known to the CBP officer, to be erroneous.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Penalty procedures; when not invoked. Penalty procedures relating to erroneous statistical information will not be invoked against any person who in good faith attempts to comply with the statistical requirements of the General Statistical Note, HTSUS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Value of each invoice--(1) Single invoice. If the entry, entry summary, or

withdrawal documentation, as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, covers a single invoice, the invoice information must be restated to show:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Single invoice. If the entry, entry summary, or

withdrawal documentation, as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, covers a single invoice, the invoice information must be restated to show:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Gross amount of the invoice;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Deduction of the aggregate amount of any non-dutiable charges involved in the amount;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Further deduction of the aggregate of any deductions from the invoice values to make entered values; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Addition of the aggregate of any dutiable charges not included in the gross amount of the invoice and of any other additions to the invoice values to make entered values. The final amount in the summary computations must represent the aggregate of the entered values of all the merchandise covered by the invoice. The required information must be shown on a worksheet attached to the form or placed across columns 30 and 31 on CBP Form 7501 and in the same general location on CBP Forms 7505, 7506.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Multiple invoices. (i) If the importer or his agent elects the first option specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the information required to be restated by paragraph (f)(1) of this section for a single invoice must be restated for each invoice. The required information must be shown on a worksheet attached to the form or placed across columns 30 and 31 on CBP Form 7501.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the importer or his agent elects the first option specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the information required to be restated by paragraph (f)(1) of this section for a single invoice must be restated for each invoice. The required information must be shown on a worksheet attached to the form or placed across columns 30 and 31 on CBP Form 7501.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the importer or his agent elects the second option specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the information required to be restated by paragraph (f)(1) of this section for a single invoice must be restated for each invoice.
