                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Documents, except electronic filings, filed with the Board must  be on white paper not larger than 8\1/2\ by 11 inches, including any  tables, charts, or other documents that may be included. Ink must be  dark enough to provide substantial contrast for scanning and  photographic reproduction. Text must be double-spaced (except for  footnotes and long quotations, which may be single-spaced), using type  not smaller than 12 point. Printing may appear only on one side of the  paper for original documents, but copies of filings may be printed on  both sides of the paper.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In order to facilitate automated processing in document sheet  feeders, original documents of more than one page may not be bound in  any permanent form (no metal, plastic, or adhesive staples or binders)  but must be held together with removable metal clips or similar  retainers. Original documents may not include divider tabs, but copies  must if workpapers or expert witness testimony are submitted. All pages  of original documents, and each side of pages that are printed on both  sides, must be paginated continuously, including cover letters and  attachments. Where, as a result of assembly processes, such pagination  is impractical, documents may be numbered within the logical sequences  of volumes or sections that make up the filing and need not be  renumbered to maintain a single numbering sequence throughout the entire  filing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Some filings or portions of filings will not conform to the  standard paper specifications set forth in paragraph (a) of this section  and may not be scannable. For example, electronic spreadsheets are not  susceptible to scanning, but oversized documents, such as oversized maps  and blueprints, may or may not be scannable. Filings that are not  scannable will be referenced on-line and made available to the public at  the Board's offices. If parties file oversized paper documents, they are  encouraged to file, in addition to the oversized documents,  representations of them that fit on the standard paper, either through  reductions in size that do not undermine legibility, or through division  of the oversized whole into multiple sequential pages. The standard  paper representations must be identified and placed immediately behind  the oversized documents they represent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Color printing may not be used for textual submissions. Use of  color in filings is limited to images such as graphs, maps and  photographs. To facilitate automated processing of color pages, color  pages may not be inserted among pages containing text, but may be filed  only as appendices or attachments to filings. Also, the original of any  filing that includes color images must bear an obvious notation, on the  cover sheet, that the filing contains color.
