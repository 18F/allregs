                                Sec. 1.1348-1  Fifty-percent maximum tax on earned income.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Section 1348 provides generally that for taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1971, the maximum tax rate applicable to the earned  taxable income of an individual, estate, or trust is not to exceed 50  percent. In the case of an estate or trust, earned income includes only  amounts which constitute income in respect of a decedent within Sec.  1.1348-3(a)(4). For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1970, and  before January 1, 1972, the maximum rate is 60 percent. Section 1348  does not apply if the taxpayer chooses the benefits of income averaging  under sections 1301 through 1305. Section 1348 does not apply to a  married individual who does not file a joint return with his spouse for  the taxable year. For purposes of section 1348, an individual's marital  status shall be determined under section 153 and the regulations  thereunder.  [T.D. 7446, 41 FR 55337, Dec. 20, 1976]</p>
