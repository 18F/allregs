                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An intentional or unintentional radiator shall be constructed in  accordance with good engineering design and manufacturing practice.  Emanations from the device shall be suppressed as much as practicable,  but in no case shall the emanations exceed the levels specified in these  rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as follows, an intentional or unintentional radiator must  be constructed such that the adjustments of any control that is readily  accessible by or intended to be accessible to the user will not cause  operation of the device in violation of the regulations. Access BPL  equipment shall comply with the applicable standards at the control  adjustment that is employed. The measurement report used in support of  an application for Certification and the user instructions for Access  BPL equipment shall clearly specify the user-or installer-control  settings that are required for conformance with these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Parties responsible for equipment compliance should note that  the limits specified in this part will not prevent harmful interference  under all circumstances. Since the operators of part 15 devices are  required to cease operation should harmful interference occur to  authorized users of the radio frequency spectrum, the parties  responsible for equipment compliance are encouraged to employ the  minimum field strength necessary for communications, to provide greater  attenuation of unwanted emissions than required by these regulations,  and to advise the user as to how to resolve harmful interference  problems (for example, see Sec. 15.105(b)).
