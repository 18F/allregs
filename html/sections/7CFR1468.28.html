agricultural land easement plan is insufficient or is not provided annually, the United States has evidence of an unaddressed violation, or to remedy deficiencies or easement violations as it relates to the agricultural land easement plan. In the event of an emergency, the entry may be made at the discretion of NRCS when the actions are deemed necessary to prevent, terminate or mitigate a potential or unaddressed violation with notification to the landowner and eligible entity provided at the earliest practicable time.

If the eligible entity fails to cure within the 60-day period, NRCS will take the action specified under the notice.
