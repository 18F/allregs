                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For transport charges computed in accordance with this subpart, the DS3-to-DS1 benchmark ratio shall be calculated as follows: the telephone company shall calculate the ratio of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The total charge for a 1.609 km (1 mi) channel termination, 16.09 km (10 mi) of interoffice transmission, and one DS3 multiplexer using the telephone company's DS3 special access rates to;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The total charge for a 1.609 km (1 mi) channel termination plus 16.09 km (10 mi) of interoffice transmission using the telephone company's DS1 special access rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial transport rates will generally be presumed reasonable if they are based on special access rates with a DS3-to-DS1 benchmark ratio of 9.6 to 1 or higher.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a telephone company's initial transport rates are based on special access rates with a DS3-to-DS1 benchmark ratio of less than 9.6 to 1, those initial transport rates will generally be suspended and investigated absent a substantial cause showing by the telephone company. Alternatively, the telephone company may adjust its initial transport rates so that the DS3-to-DS1 ratio calculated as described in paragraph (a) of this section of those rates is 9.6 or higher. In that case, initial transport rates that depart from existing special access rates effective on September 1, 1992 so as to be consistent with the benchmark will be presumed reasonable only so long as the ratio of revenue recovered through the interconnection charge to the revenue recovered through facilities-based charges is the same as it would be if the telephone company's existing special access rates effective on September 1, 1992 were used.
