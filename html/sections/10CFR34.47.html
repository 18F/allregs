At permanent radiography installations where other appropriate alarming  or warning devices are in routine use, the wearing of an alarming  ratemeter is not required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pocket dosimeters must have a range from zero to 2 millisieverts  (200 millirems) and must be recharged at the start of each shift.

In addition, the individual  may not resume work associated with licensed material use until a  determination of the individual's radiation exposure has been made.
