The written submission must include a justification, an  explanation as to why the overrun occurred, and the amount of additional  funding required with supporting cost data. If approved by FHWA, the  request will be placed at the top of the appropriate queue (with a  contract modification request having a higher priority than a request  for additional funds for a project award) and funding may be provided if  available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Project cost overruns may also be funded out of the Tribe's  regular IRR Program construction funding.</p>
