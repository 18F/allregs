                            <p class="depth0">Consistent with the objectives of section 219 of the Immigration and  Nationality Act, as amended (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1189), and section 303 of  the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act 1996, as amended  (Anti-Terrorism Act) (18 U.S.C. 2339B) (Public Law 104-132. 110 Stat.  1214-1319), BIS maintains restrictions on exports and reexports to  organizations designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs)  pursuant to section 219 of the INA. The Department of the Treasury,  Office of Foreign Assets Control, maintains 31 CFR part 597, the Foreign  Terrorist Organizations Sanctions Regulations, requiring U.S. financial  institutions to block all financial transactions involving assets of  designated FTOs within the possession or control of such U.S. financial  institutions. Section 303 of the Anti-Terrorism Act prohibits persons  within the United States or subject to U.S. jurisdiction from knowingly  providing material support or resources to a designated FTO and makes  violations punishable by criminal penalties under title 18, United  States Code. These designated FTOs are listed in Appendix A to 31 CFR  Chapter V and identified by the bracketed initials [FTO]. A designation  of a foreign organization determined to meet the criteria of section 219  of the INA takes effect upon publication in the Federal Register by the  Secretary of State, or the Secretary's designee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> License requirement(s). </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A license requirement applies to the  export or reexport to an FTO of any item subject to the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> U.S. persons must seek authorization from BIS for the export or  reexport to an FTO of any item subject to the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Non-U.S. persons must seek authorization from BIS for the export  from abroad or reexport to an FTO of any item subject to the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any export or reexport to an FTO by any person of any item  subject to the EAR and not authorized by BIS is a violation of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> These licensing requirements supplement any other requirements  set forth elsewhere in the EAR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions.
