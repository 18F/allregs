                                Sec. 97.7  Deposit of Voucher Specimen.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Voucher specimen types. As regards the deposit of voucher  specimen material for purposes of plant variety protection applications  under 7 U.S.C. 2321 et seq., the term voucher specimen shall include  material that is capable of self-replication either directly or  indirectly. Representative examples include seeds, plant tissue cells,  cell lines, and plots of vegetative material of self-incompatible  parental lines of hybrids. Seed samples should not be treated with  chemicals or coatings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Need to make a deposit. Applications for plant variety  protection require deposit of a voucher specimen of the variety. The  deposit shall be acceptable if made in accordance with these  regulations. Sample packages shall meet the packaging and deposit  requirements of the depository. Samples and correspondence about samples  shall be identified, minimally, by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The application number assigned by the Office;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The crop kind, genus and species, and variety denomination; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The name and address of the depositor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acceptable depository. A deposit shall be recognized for the  purposes of these regulations if made in:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation, ARS,  USDA, 1111 South Mason Street, Fort Collins, CO 80521-4500, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any other depository recognized to be suitable by the Office.  Suitability will be determined by the Commissioner on the basis of the  administrative and technical competence, and agreement of the depository  to comply with the terms and conditions applicable to deposits for plant  variety protection purposes. The Commissioner may seek the advice of  impartial consultants on the suitability of a depository. The depository  must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Have a continuous existence;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exist independent of the control of the depositor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Possess the staff and facilities sufficient to examine the  viability and quantity of a deposit, and store the deposit in a manner  which ensures that it is kept viable and uncontaminated;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Provide for sufficient safety measures to minimize the risk of  losing biological material deposited with it;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Be impartial and objective;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Refrain from distributing samples while the application is  being examined and during the term of protection but, after control of  the sample is transferred by the Office to the depository, furnish  samples of the deposited material in an expeditious and proper manner;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Have the capability to destroy samples or return samples to  the Office when requested by the Office; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Promptly notify the Office of low viability or low quantity  of the sample.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A depository seeking status under paragraph (c)(2) of this  section must direct a communication to the Commissioner which shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Indicate the name and address of the depository to which the  communication relates;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contain detailed information as to the capacity of the  depository to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this  section, including information on its legal status, scientific standing,  staff, and facilities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Indicate that the depository intends to be available, for the  purposes of deposit, to any depositor under these same conditions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Where the depository intends to accept for deposit only certain  kinds of biological material, specify such kinds; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Indicate the amount of any fees that the depository will, upon  acquiring the status of suitable depository under paragraph (c)(2) of  this section, charge for storage, viability statements and furnishings  of samples of the deposit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A depository having status under paragraph (c)(2) of this  section limited to certain kinds of biological material may extend such  status to additional kinds of biological material by directing a  communication to the Commissioner in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of  this section. If a previous communication under paragraph (c)(3) of this  section is of record, items in common with the previous communication  may be incorporated by reference.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Once a depository is recognized to be suitable by the  Commissioner or has defaulted or discontinued its performance under this  section, notice thereof will be published in the Official Journal of the  Plant Variety Protection Office or by other methods typically used for  dissemination of information related to the procedures of the Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time of making an original deposit. An original deposit of  materials for seed-reproduced plants shall be made within three months  of the filing date of the application or prior to issuance of the  certificate, whichever occurs first. A waiver may be granted for good  cause, such as delays in obtaining a phytosanitary certificate for the  importation of voucher sample materials. When the original deposit is  made, the applicant must promptly submit a statement from a person in a  position to corroborate the fact, stating that the voucher specimen  material which is deposited is the variety specifically identified in  the application as filed. Such statement must be filed in the  application and must contain the identifying information listed in  paragraph (b) of this section and:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name and address of the depository;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date of deposit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The accession number given by the depository; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement that the deposit is capable of reproduction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Replacement or supplement of deposit. If the depository  possessing a deposit determines either that the sample viability is low  or that the sample quantity is low, and if this finding is made during  the pendency of an application or during the term of protection of the  certificate, the Office shall notify the depositor of the need for  making a replacement or supplemental deposit. Such deposits will be  governed by the same considerations governing the need for making an  original deposit under the provisions set forth in Sec. 97.7(d).  Notification to the Office concerning deposit of the replacement or  supplemental sample shall contain a statement from a person in a  position to corroborate the fact, stating that the replacement or  supplemental deposit is of a biological material which is identical to  that originally deposited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Term of deposit. A voucher specimen deposit made in support of  an application for plant variety protection shall be made for a term of  at least twenty (20) years. In any case, samples must be stored under  agreements that would make them available to the Office during the  enforceable life of the certificate for which the deposit was made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Viability of deposit. A deposit of biological material that is  capable of self-replication either directly or indirectly must be viable  at the time of deposit and during the term of deposit. Viability may be  tested by the depository periodically. The test must conclude only that  the deposited material is capable of reproduction. No evidence  necessarily is required regarding the ability of the deposited material  to perform any function described in the application. If a viability  test indicates that the deposit is not viable upon receipt or that the  quantity of material is insufficient, the examiner shall proceed as if  no deposit was made. The examiner will accept the conclusion set forth  in a viability statement issued by a depository recognized under  paragraph 97.7(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Furnishing of samples. A deposit must be made under conditions  that assure that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Public access to the deposit will not be available during  pendency of the application or during the term of protection, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All restrictions on the availability to the public of the  deposited material will be irrevocably removed upon the abandonment,  cancellation, expiration, or withdrawal of the certificate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Examination procedures. The examiner shall determine, prior to  issuance of the certificate, in each application if a voucher sample  deposit actually made is acceptable for plant variety protection  purposes.
