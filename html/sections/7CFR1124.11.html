                            <p class="depth0">Cooperative reserve supply unit means any cooperative association or  its agent that is a handler pursuant to Sec. 1000.9(c) that does not  own or operate a plant, if such cooperative has been qualified to  receive payments pursuant to Sec. 1124.73 and has been a handler of  producer milk under the order in this part or its predecessor order  during each of the 12 previous months, and if a majority of the  cooperative's member producers are located within 125 miles of a plant  described in Sec. 1124.7(a). A cooperative reserve supply unit shall be  subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The cooperative shall file a request with the market  administrator for cooperative reserve supply unit status at least 15  days prior to the first day of the month in which such status is desired  to be effective. Once qualified as a cooperative reserve supply unit  pursuant to this paragraph, such status shall continue to be effective  unless the cooperative requests termination prior to the first day of  the month that change of status is requested, or the cooperative fails  to meet all of the conditions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The cooperative reserve supply unit supplies fluid milk products  to pool distributing plants located within 125 miles of a majority of  the cooperative's member producers in compliance with any announcement  by the market administrator requesting a minimum level of shipments as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The market administrator may require such supplies of bulk fluid  milk from cooperative reserve supply units whenever the market  administrator finds that milk supplies for Class I use are needed for  plants defined in Sec. 1124.7(a) or (b). Before making such a finding,  the market administrator shall investigate the need for such shipments  either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of  interested persons if the request is made in writing at least 15 days  prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired  effective. If the market administrator's investigation shows that such  shipments might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a  notice stating that a shipping announcement is being considered and  inviting data, views and arguments with respect to the proposed shipping  announcement. Any decision   on the required shipment of bulk fluid milk from cooperative reserve  supply units must be made in writing at least one day before the  effective date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failure of a cooperative reserve supply unit to comply with any  announced shipping requirements, including making any significant change  in the unit's marketing operation that the market administrator  determines has the impact of evading or forcing such an announcement,  shall result in immediate loss of cooperative reserve supply unit status  until such time as the unit has been a handler pursuant to Sec.  1000.9(c) for at least 12 consecutive months.</p>
