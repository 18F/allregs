                                Sec. 1.1012-1  Basis of property.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. In general, the basis of property is the cost thereof. The cost is the amount paid for such property in cash or other property. This general rule is subject to exceptions stated in subchapter O (relating to gain or loss on the disposition of property), subchapter C (relating to corporate distributions and adjustments), subchapter K (relating to partners and partnerships), and subchapter P (relating to capital gains and losses), chapter 1 of the code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Real estate taxes as part of cost. In computing the cost of real property, the purchaser shall not take into account any amount paid to the seller as reimbursement for real property taxes which are treated under section 164(d) as imposed upon the purchaser. This rule applies whether or not the contract of sale calls for the purchaser to reimburse the seller for such real estate taxes paid or to be paid by the seller. On the other hand, where the purchaser pays (or assumes liability for) real estate taxes which are treated under section 164(d) as imposed upon the seller, such taxes shall be considered part of the cost of the property. It is immaterial whether or not the contract of sale specifies that the sale price has been reduced by, or is in any way intended to reflect, real estate taxes allocable to the seller under section 164(d). For illustrations of the application of this paragraph, see paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1001-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Sale of stock--(1) In general. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section (dealing with stock for which the average basis method is permitted), if a taxpayer sells or transfers shares of stock in a corporation that the taxpayer purchased or acquired on different dates or at different prices and the taxpayer does not adequately identify the lot from which the stock is sold or transferred, the stock sold or transferred is charged against the earliest lot the taxpayer purchased or acquired to determine the basis and holding period of the stock. If the earliest lot purchased or acquired is held in a stock certificate that represents multiple lots of stock, and the taxpayer does not adequately identify the lot from which the stock is sold or transferred, the stock sold or transferred is charged against the earliest lot included in the certificate. See paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section for rules on what constitutes an adequate identification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section (dealing with stock for which the average basis method is permitted), if a taxpayer sells or transfers shares of stock in a corporation that the taxpayer purchased or acquired on different dates or at different prices and the taxpayer does not adequately identify the lot from which the stock is sold or transferred, the stock sold or transferred is charged against the earliest lot the taxpayer purchased or acquired to determine the basis and holding period of the stock. If the earliest lot purchased or acquired is held in a stock certificate that represents multiple lots of stock, and the taxpayer does not adequately identify the lot from which the stock is sold or transferred, the stock sold or transferred is charged against the earliest lot included in the certificate. See paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section for rules on what constitutes an adequate identification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section (dealing with stock for which the average basis method is permitted), if a taxpayer sells or transfers shares of stock in a corporation that the taxpayer purchased or acquired on different dates or at different prices and the taxpayer does not adequately identify the lot from which the stock is sold or transferred, the stock sold or transferred is charged against the earliest lot the taxpayer purchased or acquired to determine the basis and holding period of the stock. If the earliest lot purchased or acquired is held in a stock certificate that represents multiple lots of stock, and the taxpayer does not adequately identify the lot from which the stock is sold or transferred, the stock sold or transferred is charged against the earliest lot included in the certificate. See paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section for rules on what constitutes an adequate identification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A taxpayer must determine the basis of identical stock (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4) of this section) by averaging the cost of each share if the stock is purchased at separate times on the same calendar day in executing a single trade order and the broker executing the trade provides a single confirmation that reports an aggregate total cost or an average cost per share. However, the taxpayer may determine the basis of the stock by the actual cost per share if the taxpayer notifies the broker in writing of this intent. The taxpayer must notify the broker by the earlier of the date of the sale of any of the stock for which the taxpayer received the confirmation or one year after the date of the confirmation. A broker may extend the one-year period but the taxpayer must notify

the broker no later than the date of sale of any of the stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identification of stock. An adequate identification is made if it is shown that certificates representing shares of stock from a lot which was purchased or acquired on a certain date or for a certain price were delivered to the taxpayer's transferee. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (3) or (4) of this paragraph, such stock certificates delivered to the transferee constitute the stock sold or transferred by the taxpayer. Thus, unless the requirements of subparagraph (3) or (4) of this paragraph are met, the stock sold or transferred is charged to the lot to which the certificates delivered to the transferee belong, whether or not the taxpayer intends, or instructs his broker or other agent, to sell or transfer stock from a lot purchased or acquired on a different date or for a different price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Identification on confirmation document. (i) Where the stock is left in the custody of a broker or other agent, an adequate identification is made if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> At the time of the sale or transfer, the taxpayer specifies to such broker or other agent having custody of the stock the particular stock to be sold or transferred, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Within a reasonable time thereafter, confirmation of such specification is set forth in a written document from such broker or other agent.
Stock identified pursuant to this subdivision is the stock sold or transferred by the taxpayer, even though stock certificates from a different lot are delivered to the taxpayer's transferee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where a single stock certificate represents stock from different lots, where such certificate is held by the taxpayer rather than his broker or other agent, and where the taxpayer sells a part of the stock represented by such certificate through a broker or other agent, an adequate identification is made if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> At the time of the delivery of the certificate to the broker or other agent, the taxpayer specifies to such broker or other agent the particular stock to be sold or transferred, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Within a reasonable time thereafter, confirmation of such specification is set forth in a written document from such broker or agent.
Where part of the stock represented by a single certificate is sold or transferred directly by the taxpayer to the purchaser or transferee instead of through a broker or other agent, an adequate identification is made if the taxpayer maintains a written record of the particular stock which he intended to sell or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Stock held by a trustee, executor, or administrator. (i) A trustee or executor or administrator of an estate holding stock (not left in the custody of a broker) makes an adequate identification if the trustee, executor, or administrator--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Specifies in writing in the books and records of the trust or estate the particular stock to be sold, transferred, or distributed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the case of a distribution, furnishes the distributee with a written document identifying the particular stock distributed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In the case of a sale or transfer through a broker or other agent, specifies to the broker or agent the particular stock to be sold or transferred, and within a reasonable time thereafter the broker or agent confirms the specification in a written document.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The stock the trust or estate identifies under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section is the stock treated as sold, transferred, or distributed, even if the trustee, executor, or administrator delivers stock certificates from a different lot.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Subsequent sales. If stock identified under subparagraph (3) or (4) of this paragraph as belonging to a particular lot is sold, transferred, or distributed, the stock so identified shall be deemed to have been sold, transferred, or distributed, and such sale, transfer, or distribution will be taken into consideration in identifying the taxpayer's remaining stock for purposes of subsequent sales, transfers, or distributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Bonds. Paragraphs (1) through (5), (8), and (9) of this section apply to the sale or transfer of bonds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Book-entry securities. (i) In applying the provisions of subparagraph (3)(i)(a) of this paragraph in the case of

a sale or transfer of a book-entry security (as defined in subdivision (iii) (a) of this subparagraph) which is made after December 31, 1970, pursuant to a written instruction by the taxpayer, a specification by the taxpayer of the unique lot number which he has assigned to the lot which contains the securities being sold or transferred shall constitute specification as required by such subparagraph. The specification of the lot number shall be made either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In such written instruction, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the case of a taxpayer in whose name the book entry by the Reserve Bank is made, in a list of lot numbers with respect to all book-entry securities on the books of the Reserve Bank sold or transferred on that date by the taxpayer, provided such list is mailed to or received by the Reserve Bank on or before the Reserve Bank's next business day.
This subdivision shall apply only if the taxpayer assigns lot numbers in numerical sequence to successive purchases of securities of the same loan title (series) and maturity date, except that securities of the same loan title (series) and maturity date which are purchased at the same price on the same date may be included within the same lot.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In applying paragraph (c)(3)(i)(b) of this section to a sale or transfer of a book-entry security pursuant to a taxpayer's written instruction, a confirmation is made by furnishing to the taxpayer a written advice of transaction from the Reserve Bank or other person through whom the taxpayer sells or transfers the securities. The confirmation document must describe the securities and specify the date of the transaction and amount of securities sold or transferred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (c)(7):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The term book-entry security means a transferable Treasury bond, note, certificate of indebtedness, or bill issued under the Second Liberty Bond Act (31 U.S.C. 774(2)), as amended, or other security of the United States (as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(iii)(b) of this section) in the form of an entry made as prescribed in 31 CFR Part 306, or other comparable Federal regulations, on the records of a Reserve Bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The term other security of the United States means a bond, note, certificate of indebtedness, bill, debenture, or similar obligation which is subject to the provisions of 31 CFR part 306 or other comparable Federal regulations and which is issued by (1) any department or agency of the Government of the United States, or (2) the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Banks, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal Land Banks, the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, the Banks for Cooperatives, or the Tennessee Valley Authority;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The term serially-numbered advice of transaction means the confirmation (prescribed in 31 CFR 306.116) issued by the Reserve Bank which is identifiable by a unique number and indicates that a particular written instruction to the Reserve Bank with respect to the deposit or withdrawal of a specified book-entry security (or securities) has been executed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The term Reserve Bank means a Federal Reserve Bank and its branches acting as Fiscal Agent of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Time for making identification. For purposes of this paragraph (c), an adequate identification of stock is made at the time of sale, transfer, delivery, or distribution if the identification is made no later than the earlier of the settlement date or the time for settlement required by Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 17 CFR 240.15c6-1 (or its successor). A standing order or instruction for the specific identification of stock is treated as an adequate identification made at the time of sale, transfer, delivery, or distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Method of writing. (i) A written confirmation, record, document, instruction, notification, or advice includes a writing in electronic format.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A written confirmation, record, document, instruction, notification, or advice includes a writing in electronic format.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A broker or agent may include the written confirmation required under this paragraph (c) in an account statement or other document the broker or agent periodically provides to the taxpayer if the broker or agent provides the statement or other document within a reasonable time after the sale or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Method for determining basis of stock. A method of determining the basis of stock, including a method of identifying stock sold under this paragraph (c) and the average basis method described in paragraph (e) of this section, is not a method of accounting. Therefore, a change in a method of determining the basis of stock is not a change in method of accounting to which sections 446 and 481 apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Effective/applicability date. Paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(4), (c)(6), (c)(7)(ii), (c)(7)(iii)(a), (c)(8), (c)(9), and (c)(10) of this section apply for taxable years beginning after October 18, 2010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Obligations issued as part of an investment unit. For purposes of determining the basis of the individual elements of an investment unit (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(a) of Sec. 1.1232-3) consisting of an obligation and an option (which is not an excluded option under paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(c) of Sec. 1.1232-3), security, or other property, the cost of such investment unit shall be allocated to such individual elements on the basis of their respective fair market values. In the case of the initial issuance of an investment unit consisting of an obligation and an option, security, or other property, where neither the obligation nor the option, security, or other property has a readily ascertainable fair market value, the portion of the cost of the unit which is allocable to the obligation shall be an amount equal to the issue price of the obligation as determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(a) of Sec. 1.1232-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Election to use average basis method--(1) In general. Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, and except as provided in paragraph (e)(8) of this section, a taxpayer may use the average basis method described in paragraph (e)(7) of this section to determine the cost or other basis of identical shares of stock if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, and except as provided in paragraph (e)(8) of this section, a taxpayer may use the average basis method described in paragraph (e)(7) of this section to determine the cost or other basis of identical shares of stock if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer leaves shares of stock in a regulated investment company (as defined in paragraph (e)(5) of this section) or shares of stock acquired after December 31, 2010, in connection with a dividend reinvestment plan (as defined in paragraph (e)(6) of this section) with a custodian or agent in an account maintained for the acquisition or redemption, sale, or other disposition of shares of the stock; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The taxpayer acquires identical shares of stock at different prices or bases in the account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of method. (i) If a taxpayer places shares of stock described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section acquired on or after January 1, 2012, in the custody of a broker (as defined by section 6045(c)(1)), including by transfer from an account with another broker, the basis of the shares is determined in accordance with the broker's default method, unless the taxpayer notifies the broker that the taxpayer elects another permitted method. The taxpayer must report gain or loss using the method the taxpayer elects or, if the taxpayer fails to make an election, the broker's default method. See paragraphs (e)(9)(i) and (e)(9)(v), Example 2, of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a taxpayer places shares of stock described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section acquired on or after January 1, 2012, in the custody of a broker (as defined by section 6045(c)(1)), including by transfer from an account with another broker, the basis of the shares is determined in accordance with the broker's default method, unless the taxpayer notifies the broker that the taxpayer elects another permitted method. The taxpayer must report gain or loss using the method the taxpayer elects or, if the taxpayer fails to make an election, the broker's default method. See paragraphs (e)(9)(i) and (e)(9)(v), Example 2, of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of this paragraph (e)(2) are illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In connection with a dividend reinvestment plan, Taxpayer B acquires 100 shares of G Company in 2012 and 100 shares of G Company in 2013, in an account B maintains with R Broker. B notifies R in writing that B elects to use the average basis method to compute the basis of the shares of G Company. In 2014, B transfers the shares of G Company to an account with S Broker. B does not notify S of the basis determination method B chooses to use for the shares of G Company, and S's default method is first-in, first-out. In 2015, B purchases 200 shares of G Company in the account with S. In 2016, B instructs S to sell 150 shares of G Company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because B does not notify S of a basis determination method for the shares of G Company, under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the basis of the 150 shares of G Company S sells for B in 2016 must be determined under S's default method, first-in, first-out.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Shares of stock. For purposes of this paragraph (e), securities issued by unit investment trusts described in paragraph (e)(5) of this section are treated as shares of stock and the term share or shares includes fractions of a share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Identical stock. For purposes of this paragraph (e), identical shares of stock means stock with the same Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures (CUSIP) number or other security identifier number as

permitted in published guidance of general applicability, see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Regulated investment company. (i) For purposes of this paragraph, a regulated investment company means any domestic corporation (other than a personal holding company as defined in section 542) which meets the limitations of section 851(b) and Sec. 1.851-2, and which is registered at all times during the taxable year under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 to 80b-2), either as a management company, or as a unit investment trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of this paragraph, a regulated investment company means any domestic corporation (other than a personal holding company as defined in section 542) which meets the limitations of section 851(b) and Sec. 1.851-2, and which is registered at all times during the taxable year under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 to 80b-2), either as a management company, or as a unit investment trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notwithstanding subdivision (i), this paragraph shall not apply in the case of a unit investment trust unless it is one--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Substantially all of the assets of which consist (1) of securities issued by a single management company (as defined in such Act) and securities acquired pursuant to subdivision (b) of this subdivision (ii), or (2) securities issued by a single other corporation, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Which has no power to invest in any other securities except securities issued by a single other management company, when permitted by such Act or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Dividend reinvestment plan--(i) In general. For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term dividend reinvestment plan means any written plan, arrangement, or program under which at least 10 percent of every dividend (within the meaning of section 316) on any share of stock is reinvested in stock identical to the stock on which the dividend is paid. A plan is a dividend reinvestment plan if the plan documents require that at least 10 percent of any dividend paid is reinvested in identical stock even if the plan includes stock on which no dividends have ever been declared or paid or on which an issuer ceases paying dividends. A plan that holds one or more different stocks may permit a taxpayer to reinvest a different percentage of dividends in the stocks held. A dividend reinvestment plan may reinvest other distributions on stock, such as capital gain distributions, non-taxable returns of capital, and cash in lieu of fractional shares. The term dividend reinvestment plan includes both issuer administered dividend reinvestment plans and non-issuer administered dividend reinvestment plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term dividend reinvestment plan means any written plan, arrangement, or program under which at least 10 percent of every dividend (within the meaning of section 316) on any share of stock is reinvested in stock identical to the stock on which the dividend is paid. A plan is a dividend reinvestment plan if the plan documents require that at least 10 percent of any dividend paid is reinvested in identical stock even if the plan includes stock on which no dividends have ever been declared or paid or on which an issuer ceases paying dividends. A plan that holds one or more different stocks may permit a taxpayer to reinvest a different percentage of dividends in the stocks held. A dividend reinvestment plan may reinvest other distributions on stock, such as capital gain distributions, non-taxable returns of capital, and cash in lieu of fractional shares. The term dividend reinvestment plan includes both issuer administered dividend reinvestment plans and non-issuer administered dividend reinvestment plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Acquisition of stock. Stock is acquired in connection with a dividend reinvestment plan if the stock is acquired under that plan, arrangement, or program, or if the dividends and other distributions paid on the stock are subject to that plan, arrangement, or program. Shares of stock acquired in connection with a dividend reinvestment plan include the initial purchase of stock in the dividend reinvestment plan, transfers of identical stock into the dividend reinvestment plan, additional periodic purchases of identical stock in the dividend reinvestment plan, and identical stock acquired through reinvestment of the dividends or other distributions paid on the stock held in the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Dividends and other distributions paid after reorganization. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(6), dividends and other distributions declared or announced before or pending a corporate action (such as a merger, consolidation, acquisition, split-off, or spin-off) involving the issuer and subsequently paid and reinvested in shares of stock in the successor entity or entities are treated as reinvested in shares of stock identical to the shares of stock of the issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Withdrawal from or termination of plan. If a taxpayer withdraws stock from a dividend reinvestment plan or the plan administrator terminates the dividend reinvestment plan, the shares of identical stock the taxpayer acquires after the withdrawal or termination are not acquired in connection with a dividend reinvestment plan. The taxpayer may not use the average basis method after the withdrawal or termination but may use any other permissible basis determination method. See paragraph (e)(7)(v) of this section for the basis of the shares after withdrawal or termination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Computation of average basis--(i) In general. Average basis is determined by averaging the basis of all shares of identical stock in an account regardless of holding period. However, for this purpose, shares of stock in a dividend reinvestment plan are not identical to

shares of stock with the same CUSIP number that are not in a dividend reinvestment plan. The basis of each share of identical stock in the account is the aggregate basis of all shares of that stock in the account divided by the aggregate number of shares. Unless a single-account election is in effect, see paragraph (e)(11) of this section, a taxpayer may not average together the basis of identical stock held in separate accounts that the taxpayer sells, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of on or after January 1, 2012.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Average basis is determined by averaging the basis of all shares of identical stock in an account regardless of holding period. However, for this purpose, shares of stock in a dividend reinvestment plan are not identical to

shares of stock with the same CUSIP number that are not in a dividend reinvestment plan. The basis of each share of identical stock in the account is the aggregate basis of all shares of that stock in the account divided by the aggregate number of shares. Unless a single-account election is in effect, see paragraph (e)(11) of this section, a taxpayer may not average together the basis of identical stock held in separate accounts that the taxpayer sells, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of on or after January 1, 2012.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Order of disposition of shares sold or transferred. In the case of the sale or transfer of shares of stock to which the average basis method election applies, shares sold or transferred are deemed to be the shares first acquired. Thus, the first shares sold or transferred are those with a holding period of more than 1 year (long-term shares) to the extent that the account contains long-term shares. If the number of shares sold or transferred exceeds the number of long-term shares in the account, the excess shares sold or transferred are deemed to be shares with a holding period of 1 year or less (short-term shares). Any gain or loss attributable to shares held for more than 1 year constitutes long-term gain or loss, and any gain or loss attributable to shares held for 1 year or less constitutes short-term gain or loss. For example, if a taxpayer sells 50 shares from an account containing 100 long-term shares and 100 short-term shares, the shares sold or transferred are all long-term shares. If, however, the account contains 40 long-term shares and 100 short-term shares, the taxpayer has sold 40 long-term shares and 10 short-term shares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Transition rule from double-category method. This paragraph (e)(7)(iii) applies to stock for which a taxpayer uses the double-category method under Sec. 1.1012-1(e)(3) (April 1, 2010), that the taxpayer acquired before April 1, 2011, and that the taxpayer sells, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of on or after that date. The taxpayer must calculate the average basis of this stock by averaging together all identical shares of stock in the account on April 1, 2011, regardless of holding period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Wash sales. A taxpayer must apply section 1091 and the associated regulations (dealing with wash sales of substantially identical securities) in computing average basis regardless of whether the stock or security sold or otherwise disposed of and the stock acquired are in the same account or in different accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Basis after change from average basis method. Unless a taxpayer revokes an average basis method election under paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this section, if a taxpayer changes from the average basis method to another basis determination method (including a change resulting from a withdrawal from or termination of a dividend reinvestment plan), the basis of each share of stock immediately after the change is the same as the basis immediately before the change. See paragraph (e)(9)(iv) of this section for rules for changing from the average basis method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The provisions of this paragraph (e)(7) are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In 2011, Taxpayer C acquires 100 shares of H Company and enrolls them in a dividend reinvestment plan administered by T Custodian. C elects to use the average basis method for the shares of H Company enrolled in the dividend reinvestment plan. T also acquires for C's account 50 shares of H Company and does not enroll these shares in the dividend reinvestment plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section, the 50 shares of H Company not in the dividend reinvestment plan are not identical to the 100 shares of H Company enrolled in the dividend reinvestment plan, even if they have the same CUSIP number. Accordingly, under paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(7)(i) of this section, C may not average the basis of the 50 shares of H Company with the basis of the 100 shares of H Company.

A taxpayer makes an election to use the average basis method for shares of stock described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section that are covered securities (within the meaning of section 6045(g)(3)) by notifying the custodian or agent in writing by any reasonable means. For purposes of this paragraph (e), a writing may be in electronic format. A taxpayer has not made an election within the meaning of this section if the taxpayer fails to notify a broker of the taxpayer's basis determination method and basis is determined by the broker's default method under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. A taxpayer may make the average basis method election at any time, effective for sales or other dispositions of stock occurring after the taxpayer notifies the custodian or agent. The election must identify each account with that custodian or agent and each stock in that account to which the election applies. The election may specify that it applies to all accounts with a custodian or agent, including accounts the taxpayer later establishes with the custodian or agent. If the election applies to gift shares, the taxpayer must provide the statement required by paragraph (e)(8)(ii) of this section, if applicable, to the custodian or agent with the taxpayer's election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A taxpayer makes an election to use the average basis method for shares of stock described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section that are covered securities (within the meaning of section 6045(g)(3)) by notifying the custodian or agent in writing by any reasonable means. For purposes of this paragraph (e), a writing may be in electronic format. A taxpayer has not made an election within the meaning of this section if the taxpayer fails to notify a broker of the taxpayer's basis determination method and basis is determined by the broker's default method under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

A taxpayer makes an election to use the average basis method for shares of stock described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section that are noncovered securities (as described in Sec. 1.6045-1(a)(16)) on the taxpayer's income tax return for the first taxable year for which the election applies. A taxpayer may make the election on an amended return filed no later than the time prescribed (including extensions) for filing the original return for the taxable year for which the election applies. The taxpayer must indicate on the return that the taxpayer used the average basis method in reporting gain or loss on the sale or other disposition. A taxpayer must attach to the return the statement described in paragraph (e)(8)(ii) of this section, if applicable. A taxpayer making the election must maintain records necessary to substantiate the average basis reported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Revocation of election. A taxpayer may revoke an election under paragraph (e)(9)(i) of this section by the earlier of one year after the taxpayer makes the election or the date of the first sale, transfer, or disposition of that stock following the election. A custodian or agent may extend the one-year period but a taxpayer may not revoke an election after the first sale, transfer, or disposition of the stock. A revocation applies to all stock the taxpayer holds in an account that is identical to the shares of stock for which the taxpayer revokes the election. A revocation is effective when the taxpayer notifies, in writing by any reasonable means, the custodian or agent holding the stock to which the revocation applies. After revocation, the taxpayer's basis in the shares of stock to which the revocation applies is the basis before averaging.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Change from average basis method. A taxpayer may change basis determination methods from the average basis method to another method prospectively at any time. A change from the average basis method applies to all identical stock the taxpayer sells or otherwise disposes of before January 1, 2012, that was held in any account. A change from the average basis method applies on an account by account basis (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(10) of this section) to all identical stock the taxpayer sells or otherwise

disposes of on or after January 1, 2012. The taxpayer must notify, in writing by any reasonable means, the custodian or agent holding the stock to which the change applies.

Therefore, F's notification to W on May 8, 2012, is not an effective revocation under paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this section. F's attempted revocation is, instead, notification of a change from the average basis method under paragraph (e)(9)(iv) of this section.

For sales, exchanges, or other dispositions on or after January 1, 2012, of stock described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the average basis method applies on an account by account basis. A taxpayer may use the average basis method for stock in a regulated investment company or stock acquired in connection with a dividend reinvestment plan in one account but use a different basis determination method for identical stock in a different account. If a taxpayer uses the average basis method for a stock described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the taxpayer must use the average basis method for all identical stock within that account. The taxpayer may use different basis determination methods for stock within an account that is not identical.

For sales, exchanges, or other dispositions on or after January 1, 2012, of stock described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the average basis method applies on an account by account basis.

Because stock purchased in 2010 is a noncovered security under Sec. 1.6045-1(a)(16), under paragraph (e)(10)(iii) of this section, the 2010 stock and the 2012 stock must be treated as held in separate accounts. Under paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section, the basis of the 2010 shares may not be averaged with the basis of the 2012 shares.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7.

However, under Sec. 1.6045-1(a)(15)(iv)(A), the stock purchased in January 2011 becomes a noncovered security after it is transferred to the dividend reinvestment plan. Because all the shares in the dividend reinvestment plan in September 2011 are noncovered securities, when K sells stock in 2012, the January 2011

Paragraph (e)(10)(iii) of this section does not apply if a regulated investment company or dividend reinvestment plan elects to treat all identical shares of stock described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section as held in a single account (single-account election). The single-account election applies only to stock for which a taxpayer elects to use the average basis method that is held in separate accounts or treated as held in separate accounts maintained for the taxpayer and only to accounts with the same ownership. If a broker (as defined by section 6045(c)(1)) holds the stock as a nominee, the broker, and not the regulated investment company or dividend reinvestment plan, makes the election. The single-account election is irrevocable, but is void if the taxpayer revokes the average basis election under paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Paragraph (e)(10)(iii) of this section does not apply if a regulated investment company or dividend reinvestment plan elects to treat all identical shares of stock described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section as held in a single account (single-account election). The single-account election applies only to stock for which a taxpayer elects to use the average basis method that is held in separate accounts or treated as held in separate accounts maintained for the taxpayer and only to accounts with the same ownership. If a broker (as defined by section 6045(c)(1)) holds the stock as a nominee, the broker, and not the regulated investment company or dividend reinvestment plan, makes the election. The single-account election is irrevocable, but is void if the taxpayer revokes the average basis election under paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Scope of election. A company, plan, or broker may make a single-account election for one or more taxpayers for which it maintains an account, and for one or more stocks it holds for a taxpayer. The company, plan, or broker may make the election only for the shares of stock for which it has accurate basis information. A company, plan, or broker has accurate basis information if the company, plan, or broker neither knows nor has reason to know that the basis information is inaccurate. See also section 6724 and the associated regulations regarding standards for relief from information reporting penalties. Stock for which accurate basis information is unavailable may not be included in the single-account election and must be treated as held in a separate account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effect of single-account election. If a company, plan, or broker makes the single-account election, the basis of all identical shares of stock to which the election applies must be averaged together regardless of when the taxpayer acquires the shares, and all the shares are treated as covered securities. The single-account election applies to all identical stock a taxpayer later acquires in the account that is a covered security (within the meaning of section 6045(g)(3)). A company, plan, or broker may make another single-account election if, for example, the broker later acquires accurate basis information for a stock, or a taxpayer acquires identical stock in the account that is a noncovered security (as described in Sec. 1.6045-1(a)(16)) for which the company, plan, or broker has accurate basis information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Time and manner for making the single-account election. A company, plan, or broker makes the single-account election by clearly noting it on its books and records. The books and records must reflect the date of the election; the taxpayer's name, account number, and taxpayer identification number; the stock subject to the election; and the taxpayer's basis in the stock. The company, plan, or broker must provide copies of the books and records regarding the election to the taxpayer upon request. A company, plan, or broker may make the single-account election at any time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Notification to taxpayer. A company, plan, or broker making the single-account election must use reasonable means to notify the taxpayer of the election. Reasonable means include mailings, circulars, or electronic mail sent separately to the taxpayer or included with the taxpayer's account statement, or other means reasonably calculated to provide actual notice to the taxpayer. The notice must identify the securities subject to the election and advise the taxpayer that the securities will be treated as covered securities regardless of when acquired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Examples.

E makes a single-account election for M's T Company stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The shares of T Company in Accounts A and B are held in separate accounts. Under section 6045(g)(3) and Sec. 1.6045-1(a)(16), of the shares purchased in Account A, the 100 shares purchased in 2011 are noncovered securities and the 150 shares purchased in 2012 are covered securities. Under paragraph (e)(10)(iii) of this section, the 100 shares are treated as held in a separate account from the 150 shares. Under paragraph (e)(11)(i) of this section, the single-account election applies to all 330 shares of T Company in Accounts A and B. Thus, under paragraph (e)(11)(iii) of this section, the basis of the 330 shares of stock is averaged together and all the shares are treated as covered securities.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that M owns Account B jointly with Taxpayer N. E may make a single-account election for the 250 shares of stock in M's Account A. However, under paragraph (e)(11)(i) of this section, E may not make a single-account election for Accounts A and B because the accounts do not have the same ownership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> C Broker maintains an account for Taxpayer K for the acquisition and disposition of shares of T Company, a regulated investment company, and shares of V Company that K enrolls in C's dividend reinvestment plan. In 2011, C purchases for K's account 100 shares of T Company in multiple lots and 80 shares of V Company in multiple lots that are enrolled in the dividend reinvestment plan. C has accurate basis information for all 100 shares of T Company and 80 shares of V Company. In 2012, C acquires for K's account 150 shares of T Company and 160 shares of V Company that are enrolled in the dividend reinvestment plan. K elects to use the average basis method for all the shares of T Company and V Company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraphs (e)(11)(i) and (ii) of this section, C may make a single-account election for the T Company stock or the V Company stock, or both. After making a single-account election for each stock, under paragraph (e)(11)(iii) of this section, the basis of all T Company stock is averaged together and the basis of all V Company stock is averaged together, regardless of when acquired, and all the shares of T Company and V Company are treated as covered securities.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that K transfers the 100 shares of T Company acquired in 2011 from an account with another broker into K's account with C. C does not have accurate basis information for 30 of the 100 shares of T Company, which K had acquired in two lots. Under paragraph (e)(11)(ii) of this section, C may make the single-account election only for the 70 shares of T Company stock for which C has accurate basis information. C must treat the 30 shares of T Company for which C does not have accurate basis information as held in a separate account. K may use the average basis method for the 30 shares of T Company, but must make a separate average basis method election for these shares and must average the basis of these shares separately from the 70 shares subject to C's single-account election.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that C has made the single-account election and in 2013 K acquires additional shares of T Company that are covered securities in K's account with C. Under paragraph (e)(11)(iii) of this section, these shares of T Company are subject to C's single-account election.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that C has made the single-account election and in 2013 K inherits shares of T Company that are noncovered securities and transfers the shares into the account with C. C has accurate basis information for these shares. Under paragraph (e)(11)(iii) of this section, C may make a second single-account election to include the inherited T Company shares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Between 2002 and 2011, Taxpayer L acquires 1,500 shares of W Company, a regulated investment company, in an account with D Broker, for which L uses the average basis method, and sells 500 shares. On January 5, 2012, based on accurate basis information, the averaged basis of L's remaining 1,000 shares of W Company is $24 per share. On January 5, 2012, L acquires 100 shares of W Company for $28 per share and makes an average basis election for those shares under paragraph (e)(9)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On February 1, 2012, D makes a single-account election that includes all 1,100 of L's shares in W Company. Thereafter, the basis of L's shares of W Company is $24.36 per share (($24,000 + $2,800)/1,100). On September 12, 2012, under paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this section, L revokes the average basis election for the 100 shares acquired on January 5, 2012.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (e)(11)(i) of this section, D's single-account election is void. Therefore, the basis of the 1,000 shares of W Company that L acquires before 2012 is $24 per share and the basis of the 100 shares of W Company that L acquires in 2012 is $28 per share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Effective/applicability date. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(7), (e)(9), and (e)(10) of this section, this paragraph (e) applies for taxable years beginning after October 18, 2010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Special rules.
