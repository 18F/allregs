If a sample is not provided pursuant to paragraph (a) of this

section, the Host Team Leader will notify, in writing, the owner or operator, occupant or agent in charge of an inspected premises of any requirement, under paragraph (c) or (e) of this section, to provide a sample pursuant to a request, made in accordance with paragraph (k) of this section, of an Inspection Team of the Technical Secretariat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Requirement to provide a sample. Pursuant to section 304(f)(1) of the CWCIA, unless a lead agency advises the United States National Authority pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, the owner or operator, occupant or agent in charge of the premises to be inspected is hereby required to provide a sample pursuant to a request, made in accordance with paragraph (k) of this section, of an Inspection Team of the Technical Secretariat that a sample be taken in accordance with the applicable provisions contained in the Chemical Weapons Convention and the CWCIA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Consultations with the United States National Authority. After consulting with the Host Team Leader, a lead agency that finds that any of the following conditions, as modified pursuant to paragraph (j) of this section if applicable, may not have been satisfied shall promptly advise the United States National Authority, which, in coordination with the interagency group designated by the President in section 2 of Executive Order 13128, shall make a decision:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The taking of a sample is consistent with the inspection aims under the Convention and with its Confidentiality Annex;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The taking of a sample does not unnecessarily hamper or delay the operation of a facility or affect its safety, and is arranged so as to ensure the timely and effective discharge of the Inspection Team's functions with the least possible inconvenience and disturbance to the facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The taking of a sample is consistent with the applicable facility agreement. In particular:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any sample will be taken at sampling points agreed to in the relevant facility agreement; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any sample will be taken according to procedures agreed to in the relevant facility agreement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In the absence of a facility agreement, due consideration is given to existing sampling points used by the owner or operator, occupant or agent in charge of the premises, consistent with any procedures developed pursuant to the CWCR (15 CFR parts 710 through 722);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The taking of a sample does not affect the safety of the premises and will be consistent with safety regulations established at the premises, including those for protection of controlled environments within a facility and for personal safety;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The taking of a sample does not pose a threat to the national security interests of the United States; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The taking of a sample is consistent with any conditions negotiated pursuant to paragraph (j) of this section, if applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Determination by United States National Authority. (1) If, after being advised by the lead agency pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, the United States National Authority, in coordination with the interagency group designated by the President to implement the provisions of the CWCIA, determines that all of the conditions of paragraph (d) are satisfied and that a sample shall be required, then the owner or the operator, occupant or agent in charge of the premises shall provide a sample pursuant to a request of the Inspection Team of the Technical Secretariat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If, however, after being advised by the lead agency pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, the United States National Authority, in coordination with the interagency group designated by the President to implement the provisions of the CWCIA, determines that any of the conditions of paragraph (d) are not satisfied and that a sample shall not be required, then the owner or the operator, occupant or agent in charge of the premises shall not be required to provide a sample pursuant to a request of the Inspection Team of the Technical Secretariat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Person to take a sample. If a sample is required, the owner or the operator,

occupant or agent in charge of the inspected premises will determine whether the sample will be taken by a representative of the premises, the Inspection Team, or any other individual present.

It is the policy of the United States Government that Inspection Team requests for samples should be in written form from the head of the Inspection Team. When necessary, before a sample is required to be provided, the Host Team Leader should seek a written request from the head of the Inspection Team.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Requirement to provide a sample in the band around the outside of the perimeter during a challenge inspection.
