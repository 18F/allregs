If a discharge or release affects areas covered by two  or more ACPs or RCPs, the response mechanisms of each applicable plan  may be activated. In this case, response actions of all regions  concerned shall be fully coordinated as detailed in the RCPs and ACPs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> There shall be only one OSC and/or RPM at any time during the  course of a response operation. Should a discharge or release affect two  or more areas, EPA, the USCG, DOD, DOE, or other lead agency, as  appropriate, shall give prime consideration to the area vulnerable to  the greatest threat, in determining which agency should provide the OSC  and/or RPM. The RRT shall designate the OSC and/or RPM if the RRT member  agencies who have response authority within the affected areas are  unable to agree on the designation. The NRT shall designate the OSC and/ or RPM if members of one RRT or two adjacent RRTs are unable to agree on  the designation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where the USCG has initially provided the OSC for response to a  release from hazardous waste management facilities located in the  coastal zone, responsibility for response action shall shift to EPA or  another federal agency, as appropriate.</p>
