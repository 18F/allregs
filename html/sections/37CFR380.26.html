                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section prescribes procedures by which any  Copyright Owner or Performer may verify the royalty distributions made  by the Collective; provided, however, that nothing contained in this  section shall apply to situations where a Copyright Owner or Performer  and the Collective have agreed as to proper verification methods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Frequency of verification. A Copyright Owner or Performer may  conduct a single audit of the Collective upon reasonable notice and  during reasonable business hours, during any given calendar year, for  any or all of the prior 3 calendar years, but no calendar year shall be  subject to audit more than once.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of intent to audit. A Copyright Owner or Performer must  file with the Copyright Royalty Board a notice of intent to audit the  Collective, which shall, within 30 days of the filing of the notice,  publish in the Federal Register a notice announcing such filing. The  notification of intent to audit shall be served at the same time on the  Collective. Any audit shall be conducted by an independent Qualified  Auditor identified in the notice, and shall be binding on all Copyright  Owners and Performers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Acquisition and retention of report. The Collective shall use  commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or to provide access to any  relevant books and records maintained by third parties for the purpose  of the audit. The Copyright Owner or Performer requesting the  verification procedure shall retain the report of the verification for a  period of not less than 3 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Acceptable verification procedure. An audit, including  underlying paperwork, which was performed in the ordinary course of  business according to generally accepted auditing standards by an  independent Qualified Auditor, shall serve as an acceptable verification  procedure for all parties with respect to the information that is within  the scope of the audit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Consultation. Before rendering a written report to a Copyright  Owner or Performer, except where the auditor has a reasonable basis to  suspect fraud and disclosure would, in the reasonable opinion of the  auditor, prejudice the investigation of such suspected fraud, the  auditor shall review the tentative written findings of the audit with  the appropriate agent or employee of the Collective in order to remedy  any factual errors and clarify any issues relating to the audit;  Provided that the appropriate agent or employee of the Collective  reasonably cooperates with the auditor to remedy promptly any factual  errors or clarify any issues raised by the audit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Costs of the verification procedure. The Copyright Owner or  Performer requesting the verification procedure shall pay the cost of  the procedure, unless it is finally determined that there was an  underpayment of 10% or more, in which case the Collective shall, in  addition to paying the amount of any underpayment, bear the reasonable  costs of the verification procedure.</p>
