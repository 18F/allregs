                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. OSTP shall waive part or all of the fees assessed under Sec. 2402.8 if the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disclosure is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Clarification. Where OSTP has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, OSTP may seek clarification from the requester before assigning the request to a specific category for fee assessment purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Partial waiver of fees. If the two conditions stated in paragraph (a) of this section are met, OSTP will ordinarily waive all fees. In exceptional cases and provided that the requester does not meet the conditions stated in paragraph (a), however, a partial waiver may be granted if the request for records would impose an exceptional burden on OSTP or require an exceptional expenditure of OSTP resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Failure to comply. OSTP will not assess fees under Sec. 2402.8 if the Agency fails to comply with any time limit and no exceptional circumstances apply to processing the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Waivers. OSTP may waive fees in other circumstances solely at its discretion, consistent with 5 U.S.C. 552 and the Fee Waiver Policy Guidance issued by the Department of Justice.</p>
