The Deputy Administrator, in the supplemental regulation, may divide any regulated area into a suppressive area or a generally infested area in accordance with the

definitions thereof in Sec.  301.85-1. Less than an entire quarantined State will be designated as a regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator is of the opinion that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under this subpart; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the interstate spread of the golden nematode.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Temporary designation of regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas.
