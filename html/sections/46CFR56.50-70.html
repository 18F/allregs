                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Material. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fuel supply piping to the engines shall be of  seamless drawn annealed copper pipe or tubing, nickel copper, or copper  nickel pipe or tubing meeting the requirements of subpart 56.60.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Thicknesses of tubing walls must not be less than the larger of  that shown in Table 56.50-70(a) of this section or that required by 46  CFR 56.07-10(e) and 104.1.2 of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference;  see 46 CFR 56.01-2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Tubing fittings shall be of nonferrous drawn or forged metal and  of the flared type except that the flareless fittings of the nonbite  type may be used when the tubing system is of nickel copper or copper  nickel. Tubing shall be cut square and flared by suitable tools. Tube  ends shall be annealed before flaring. Pipe fittings shall be of  nonferrous material. Pipe thread joints shall be made tight with a  suitable compound.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Valves for fuel lines shall be of nonferrous material of the  union bonnet type with ground seats except that cocks may be used if  they are the solid bottom type with tapered plugs and union bonnets.</p><p class="depth3">Table 56.50-70(a)--Tubing Wall Thickness ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Thickness</p><p class="depth3">Outside diameter of tubing in inches        ---------------------</p><p class="depth3">B.W.G.

The piping shall run in sight  wherever practicable, protected against mechanical injury, and  effectively secured against excessive movement and vibration by the use  of soft nonferrous metal liners or straps without sharp edges. Where  passing through steel decks or bulkheads, fuel lines shall be protected  by close fitting ferrules or stuffing boxes. Refer to Sec. 56.30-25 for  tubing joint installations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Either a short length of suitable metallic or nonmetallic  flexible tubing or hose or a loop of annealed copper tubing must be  installed in the fuel-supply line at or near the engine to prevent  damage by vibration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If nonmetallic flexible hose is used, it must meet the  requirements of 46 CFR 56.60-25(b) for fuel service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Flexible hose connections should maintain metallic contact  between the sections of the fuel-supply lines; however, if they do not,  the fuel tank must be grounded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Valves in fuel lines shall be installed to close against the  flow.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Shutoff valves. Shutoff valves of a suitable type shall be  installed in the fuel supply lines, one as close to each tank as  practicable, and one as close to each carburetor as practicable. Where  fuel tanks are installed below the weather deck, arrangements shall be  provided for operating all shutoff valves at the tanks from outside the  compartments in which they are located, preferably from an accessible  position on the weather deck. The operating gear for the shutoff valves  at the tanks shall be accessible at all times and shall be suitably  marked.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Strainers. A suitable twin strainer shall be fitted in the fuel  supply line in the engine compartment. Strainers shall be of the type  opening on top for cleaning screens. A drip pan shall be fitted under  the strainer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Outlets and drains. Outlets in fuel lines for drawing gasoline  for any purpose are prohibited. Valved openings in the bottom of fuel  tanks are prohibited; however, openings fitted with threaded plug or cap  can be used for cleaning purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Fuel suction connections. All fuel suction and return lines  shall enter the top of the fuel tanks and connections shall be fitted  into spuds. Such lines shall extend nearly to the bottom of the tank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Filling and sounding pipes. Filling and sounding pipes shall be  so arranged that vapors or possible overflow when filling cannot escape  to the inside of the vessel but will discharge overboard. Such pipes  shall terminate on the weather deck clear of any coamings and shall be  fitted with suitable shutoff valves or deck plugs. Filling and sounding  pipes shall extend to within one-half of their diameter from the bottom  of the tank or from the surface of the striking plate in case of a  sounding pipe. A flame screen of noncorrodible wire mesh shall be fitted  in the throat of the filling pipe. Sounding pipes shall be kept closed  at all times except during sounding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Vent pipes. Each tank shall be fitted with a vent, the cross- sectional area of which shall not be less than that of the filling pipe.  The vent pipes shall terminate at least 2 feet above the weather deck  and not less than 3 feet from any opening into living quarters or other  below deck space. The ends of vent pipes shall terminate with U-bends  and shall be fitted with flame screens or flame arresters. The flame  screens shall consist of a single screen of corrosion resistant wire of  at least 30 by 30 mesh.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Gasoline tanks. For requirements pertaining to independent  gasoline fuel tanks see subpart 58.50 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Fuel pumps. Each fuel pump must be equipped with controls as  required by Sec. 58.01-25 of this subchapter.
