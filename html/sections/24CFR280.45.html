                                Sec. 280.45  Sales contract and downpayment requirements.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sales contract. The recipient and each family purchasing a home  constructed or substantially rehabilitated under the program must  execute a sales contract. The sales contract shall contain appropriate  terms and conditions covering the purchase of the home and must contain:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The downpayment provisions described in paragraph (b) of this  section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The repayment provisions described in Sec. 280.55 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Such other terms and conditions as HUD may require.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Downpayment. Each family purchasing a home constructed or  substantially rehabilitated under the program must provide a  downpayment. A governmental entity or instrumentality may not provide  funds for the family's downpayment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amount. The amount of the downpayment includes all cash  contributions made by the family (e.g., contributions for settlement and  closing costs). The total amount of the downpayment must be equal to 10  percent of the sales price of the home except:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The recipient may require a downpayment that is greater than 10  percent of the sales price of the home, if the recipient has determined  that a higher downpayment is appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The recipient may require a downpayment that is less than 10  percent of the sales price of the home, if the first mortgage on the  home is to be held by a State or a unit of general local government  under a home loan program provided by the State or unit of general local  government, and the program provides for a lower downpayment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Date of downpayment. The downpayment must be made on the date  required by the recipient. Under Sec. 280.35, however, no construction  or rehabilitation may be begun until at least 25 percent of the homes  constructed or substantially rehabilitated under the program are  contracted for sale to purchasers who intend to live in the homes and  the downpayments are made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Interest. The recipient shall deposit the downpayment in an  account with a federally insured bank, savings and loan institution or  credit union. The recipient shall pay interest on the downpayment to the  family from the date that downpayment is made through the date of  settlement, at the actual rate of interest earned on the account. Under  no circumstances may the interest rate paid to the family be lower than  the lowest passbook rate of interest paid by a federally insured bank,  savings and loan institution or credit union conducting business within  the State in which the program is located.
