After the initial review, subsequent periodic reviews may be  limited to changes in the Contractor's internal control guidelines.   However, a limited review does not diminish the Contractor's obligation  to apply the full internal control system.  [58 FR 40380, July 28, 1993, as amended at 70 FR 41153, July 18, 2005]</p>
