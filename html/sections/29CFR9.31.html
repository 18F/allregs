Upon completion of an investigation under Sec. 9.23 of this part, and provided that a resolution is not reached that is consistent with the requirements of this part and acceptable to both the complainant(s) and the successor contractor, the Administrator will issue a written determination of whether a violation has occurred. The determination shall contain a statement of the investigation findings and conclusions. A determination that a violation occurred shall address appropriate relief and the issue of ineligibility sanctions where appropriate. The Administrator will notify any complainant(s); employee representative(s); contractor, including the prime contractor if a subcontractor is implicated; and contractor representative(s) by personal service or by registered or certified mail to the last known address, of the investigation findings. Where service by certified mail is not accepted by the party, the Administrator may exercise discretion to serve the determination by regular mail.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice to parties and effect.
