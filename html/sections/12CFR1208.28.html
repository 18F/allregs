                                Sec. 1208.28  Procedures for salary offset where FHFA is the paying
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Generally. FHFA shall coordinate salary deductions under this  section and shall determine the amount of an employee's disposable pay  and the amount of the salary offset subject to the requirements in this  section. Deductions shall begin the pay period following the issuance of  the certification by FHFA or the receipt by FHFA of the certification  from another agency, or as soon thereafter as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon issuance of a proper certification by FHFA for debts owed  to FHFA, or upon receipt of a proper certification from a creditor  agency, FHFA shall send the employee a written notice of salary offset.  Such notice shall advise the employee:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That certification has been issued by FHFA or received from  another creditor agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Of the amount of the debt and of the deductions to be made; and  provided for in the certification, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Of the initiation of salary offset at the next officially  established pay interval or as otherwise provided for in the  certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where appropriate, FHFA shall provide a copy of the notice to  the creditor agency and advise such agency of the dollar amount to be  offset and the pay period when the offset will begin.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Types of collection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Lump-sum payment. If the amount of the  debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of the employee's disposable  pay, such debt ordinarily will be collected in one lump-sum payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Installment deductions. Installment deductions will be made over  a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size  and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation  to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the  amount deducted for any pay period will not exceed 15 percent of the  disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the employee has  agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. The installment  payment should normally be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate  the debt in no more than three years. Installment payments of less than  $50 should be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Lump-sum deductions from final check. In order to liquidate a  debt, a lump-sum deduction exceeding 15 percent of disposable pay may be  made pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 from any final salary payment due a  former employee, whether the former employee was separated voluntarily  or involuntarily.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Lump-sum deductions from other sources. Whenever an employee  subject to salary offset is separated from FHFA, and the balance of the  debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary check, FHFA may  offset any later payments of any kind to the   former employee to collect the balance of the debt pursuant to 31 U.S.C.  3716.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Multiple debts--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where two or more creditor agencies are  seeking salary offset, or where two or more debts are owed to a single  creditor agency, FHFA may, at its discretion, determine whether one or  more debts should be offset simultaneously within the 15 percent  limitation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the event that a debt owed FHFA is certified while an  employee is subject to salary offset to repay another agency, FHFA may,  at its discretion, determine whether the debt to FHFA should be repaid  before the debt to the other agency is repaid, repaid simultaneously  with the other debt, or repaid after the debt to the other agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall take  precedence over other deductions under this section, as provided in 5  U.S.C. 5514(d).</p>
