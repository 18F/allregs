                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each agency shall make available to the public in accordance  with the provisions of this section those public reports filed with the  agency by reporting individuals described under subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This section does not require public availability of those  reports filed by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any individual in the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense  Intelligence Agency, or the National Security Agency, or any individual  engaged in intelligence activities in any agency of the United States,  if the President finds or has found that, due to the nature of the  office or position occupied by that individual, public disclosure of the  report would, by revealing the identity of the individual or other  sensitive information, compromise the national interest of the United  States. Individuals referred to in this paragraph who are exempt from  the public availability requirement may also be authorized,  notwithstanding Sec. 2634.701, to file any additional reports necessary  to protect their identity from public disclosure, if the President finds  or has found that such filings are necessary in the national interest;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An independent counsel whose identity has not been disclosed by  the Court under 28 U.S.C chapter 40, or any person appointed by that  independent counsel under such chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each agency shall, within thirty days after any public report is  received by the agency, permit inspection of the report by, or furnish a  copy of the report to, any person who makes written application as  provided by agency procedure. Agency reviewing officials and the support  staffs who maintain the files, the staff of the Office of Government  Ethics, and Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who  are conducting a criminal inquiry into possible conflict of interest  violations need not submit an application. The agency may utilize Office  of Government Ethics Form 201 for such applications. An application  shall state:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The requesting person's name, occupation, and address;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The name and address of any other person or organization on  whose behalf the inspection or copy is requested; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That the requesting person is aware of the prohibitions on  obtaining or using the report set forth in paragraph (f) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applications for the inspection of or copies of public reports  shall also be made available to the public throughout the period during  which the report itself is made available, utilizing the procedures in  paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> of this section do not require approval  pursuant to Sec. 2634.103.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> It is unlawful for any person to obtain or use a public report:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For any unlawful purpose;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For any commercial purpose, other than by news and  communications media for dissemination to the general public;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For determining or establishing the credit rating of any  individual; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For use, directly or indirectly, in the solicitation of money  for any political, charitable, or other purpose.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. The deputy general counsel of Agency X is responsible for  reviewing the public financial disclosure reports filed by persons  within that agency. The agency personnel director, who does not exercise  functions within the ethics program, wishes to review the disclosure  report of an individual within the agency. The personnel director must  file an application to review the report. However, the supervisor of an  official with whom the deputy general counsel consults concerning  matters arising in the review process need not file such an application.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. A state law enforcement agent is conducting an  investigation which involves the private financial dealings of an  individual who has filed a public financial disclosure report. The agent  must complete a written application in order to inspect or obtain a  copy.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. A financial institution has received an application for a  loan from an official which indicates her present financial status. The  official has filed a public financial disclosure statement with her  agency. The financial institution cannot be given access to the  disclosure form for purposes of verifying the information contained on  the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any public report filed with an agency or transmitted to the  Director of the Office of Government Ethics under this section shall be  retained by the agency, and by the Office of Government Ethics when it  receives a copy. The report shall be made available to the public for a  period of six years after receipt. After the six-year period, the report  shall be destroyed unless needed in an ongoing investigation, except  that in the case of an individual who filed the report pursuant to  Sec. 2634.201(c) as a nominee and was not subsequently confirmed by the  Senate, or who filed the report pursuant to Sec. 2634.201(d) as a  candidate and was not subsequently elected, the report, unless needed in  an ongoing investigation, shall be destroyed one year after the  individual either is no longer under consideration by the Senate or is  no longer a candidate for nomination or election to the Office of  President or Vice President. See also the OGE/GOVT-1 Governmentwide  executive branch Privacy Act system of records (available for inspection  at the Office of Government Ethics), as well as any applicable agency  system of records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, in the case of  a reporting individual with respect to whom a trust has been certified  under subpart D of this part, a copy of the qualified trust agreement,  the list of assets initially placed in the trust, and all other publicly  available documents relating to the trust shall be retained and made  available to the public until the periods for retention of all other  reports of the individual have lapsed under paragraph (g)(1) of this  section.
