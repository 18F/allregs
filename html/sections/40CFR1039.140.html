                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An engine configuration's maximum engine power is the maximum  brake power point on the nominal power curve for the engine  configuration, as defined in this section. Round the power value to the  nearest whole kilowatt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The nominal power curve of an engine configuration is the  relationship between maximum available engine brake power and engine  speed for an engine, using the mapping procedures of 40 CFR part 1065,  based on the manufacturer's design and production specifications for the  engine. This information may also be expressed by a torque curve that  relates maximum available engine torque with engine speed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The nominal power curve must be within the range of the actual  power curves of production engines considering normal production  variability. If after production begins it is determined that your  nominal power curve does not represent production engines, we may  require you to amend your application for certification under Sec.   1039.225.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Throughout this part, references to a specific power value or a  range of power values for an engine are based on maximum engine power.  For example, the group of engines with maximum engine power above 560 kW  may be referred to as engines above 560 kW.</p>
