The terms U.S. No. 1, U.S. No. 2, not seriously damaged by dirt, fairly clean, slightly skinned, and moderately skinned shall have the same meaning as when used in the United States Standards for Grades of Potatoes (7 CFR 51.1540-51.1566), including the tolerances set forth in it. The term prepeeling means the commercial preparation in the prepeeling plant of clean, sound, fresh tubers by washing, peeling or otherwise removing the outer skin, trimming, sorting, and properly treating to prevent discoloration preparatory to sale in one or more of the styles of peeled potatoes described in Sec. 52.2422 United States Standards for Grades of Peeled Potatoes (7 CFR 52.2421-52.2433). The term other processing has the same meaning as the term appearing in the Act and includes, but is not restricted to, potatoes for dehydration, chips, shoestrings, starch, and flour. It includes the application of heat or cold to such an extent that the natural form or stability of the commodity undergoes a substantial change. The act of peeling, cooling, slicing, dicing, or applying material to prevent oxidation does not constitute ``other processing.'' Other terms used in this section have the

same meaning as when used in the marketing agreement, as amended, and this part.
