                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Separation of energetic liquids and explosives and determination of distances. A launch site operator must separate each explosive hazard facility from each other explosive hazard facility, each public traffic route, and each public area in accordance with the minimum separation distance determined under this section for each explosive hazard facility where division 1.1 and 1.3 explosives are co-located with liquid propellants. A launch site operator must determine each minimum separation distance from an explosive hazard facility where division 1.1 and 1.3 explosives and liquid propellants are to be located together, to each other explosive hazard facility, public traffic route, and public area as described in paragaphs (b) through (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Liquid propellants and division 1.1 explosives located together. For liquid propellants and division 1.1 explosives located together, a launch site operator must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine the explosive equivalent weight of the liquid propellants by following Sec. 420.67(c);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Add the explosive equivalent weight of the liquid propellants and the net explosive weight of division 1.1 explosives to determine the combined net explosive weight;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use the combined net explosive weight to determine the distance to each public area, public traffic route, and each other explosive hazard facility by following tables E-1, E-2, and E-3 of appendix E of this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Separate each public area containing any member of the public in the open by a distance equal to -1133.9 + [389 *ln(NEW)], where the net explosive weight is greater than 450 pounds and less than 501,500 pounds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Liquid propellants and division 1.3 explosives located together. For liquid propellants and division 1.3 explosives located together, a launch site operator must separate each explosive hazard facility from each other explosive hazard facility, public area, and public traffic route using either of the following two methods:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Method 1. (i) Determine the explosive equivalent weight of the liquid propellants by following Sec. 420.67(c);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determine the explosive equivalent weight of the liquid propellants by following Sec. 420.67(c);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Add to the explosive equivalent weight of the liquid propellants, the net explosive weight of each division 1.3 explosive, treating division 1.3 explosives as division 1.1 explosives;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Use the combined net explosive weight to determine the minimum separation distance to each public area, public traffic route, and each other explosive hazard facility by following tables E-1, E-2, and E-3 of appendix E of this part; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Separate each public area containing any member of the public in the open by a distance equal to -1133.9 + [389 *ln(NEW)], where the net explosive weight is greater than 450 pounds and less than 501,500 pounds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Method 2. (i) Determine the explosive equivalent weight of each liquid propellant by following Sec. 420.67(c);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determine the explosive equivalent weight of each liquid propellant by following Sec. 420.67(c);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Add to the explosive equivalent weight of the liquid propellants, the net explosive weight of each division 1.3 explosive to determine the combined net explosive weight;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Use the combined net explosive weight to determine the minimum separation distance to each public area, public traffic route, and each other explosive hazard facility by following tables E-1, E-2, and E-3 of appendix E of this part; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Separate each public area containing any member of the public in the open by a distance equal to -1133.9 + [389 *ln(NEW)], where the net explosive weight is greater than 450 pounds and less than 501,500 pounds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Liquid propellants and division 1.1 and 1.3 explosives located together. For liquid propellants and division 1.1 and 1.3 explosives located together, a launch site operator must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine the explosive equivalent weight of the liquid propellants by following Sec. 420.67(c);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine the total explosive quantity of each division 1.1 and 1.3 explosive by following Sec. 420.65(a)(2);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Add the explosive equivalent weight of the liquid propellants to the total explosive quantity of division 1.1 and 1.3 explosives together to determine the combined net explosive weight;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use the combined net explosive weight to determine the distance to each public area, public traffic route, and each other explosive hazard facility by following tables E-1, E-2, and E-3 of appendix E of this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Separate each public area containing any member of the public in the open by a distance equal to -1133.9 + [389 *ln(NEW)], where the net explosive weight is greater than 450 pounds and less than 501,500 pounds</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Use of maximum credible event analysis. If a launch site operator does not want to employ paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section, the launch site operator must analyze the maximum credible event (MCE) or the worst case explosion expected to occur. If the MCE shows there will be no simultaneous explosion reaction of the liquid propellant tanks and the solid propellant motors, the minimum distance between the explosive hazard facility and all other explosive hazard facilities and public areas must be based on the MCE.
