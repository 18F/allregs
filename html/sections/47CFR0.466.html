                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For the purpose of Secs. 0.467 and 0.468, the following  definitions shall apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term direct costs means those expenditures which the  Commission actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in case  of commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA  request. Direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the  work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus twenty percent of that  rate to cover benefits), and the cost of operating duplicating  machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses, such as  costs of space, and heating or lighting the facility in which the  records are stored.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term search includes all time spent looking for material  that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line  identification of material contained within documents. Such activity  should be distinguished, however, from ``review'' of material in order  to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure (see  paragraph (a)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The term review refers to the process of examining documents  located in response to a commercial use request (see paragraph (a)(4) of  this section) to determine whether any portion of a document located is  exempt from disclosure. It also includes processing any documents for  disclosure, e.g., performing such functions that are necessary to excise  them or otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time  spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application  of FOIA exemptions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The term commercial use request refers to a request from or on  behalf of   one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the  commercial interests of the requester. In determining whether a  requester properly falls within this category, the Commission shall  determine the use to which a requester will put the documents requested.  Where the Commission has reasonable cause to question the use to which a  requester will put the documents sought, or where that use is not clear  from the request itself, the Commission shall seek additional  clarification before assigning the request to a specific category. The  dissemination of records by a representative of the news media (see  Sec. 0.466(a)(7)) shall not be considered to be for a commercial use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The term educational institution refers to a preschool, a public  or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate  higher education, an institution of professional education and an  institution of vocational education, which operates a program or  programs of scholarly research.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The term non-commercial scientific institution refers to an  institution that is not operated on a commercial basis as that term is  referenced in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and which is operated  solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of  which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The term representative of the news media refers to any person  or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of  the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a  distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. In this clause,  the term news means information that is about current events or that  would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news-media  entities are television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at  large and publishers of periodicals (but only if such entities qualify  as disseminators of news) who make their products available for purchase  or subscription by, or free distribution to, the general public. These  examples are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery  evolve (for example, the adoption of electronic dissemination of  newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media  shall be considered to be news-media entities. A freelance journalist  shall be regarded as working for a news-media entity if the journalist  can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that  entity, whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the  entity. A publication contract would present a solid basis for such an  expectation; the Commission may also consider the past publication  record of the requester in making such a determination. See 5 U.S.C.  552(a)(4)(A)(ii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The term all other requester refers to any person not within the  definitions in paragraphs (a)(4) through (a)(7) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]  [74 FR 14078, Mar. 30, 2009, as amended at 76 FR 24389, May 2, 2011]</p>
