If owner's identification numbers are used and the manufacturer's are available, the owner shall keep records correlating the owner's identification numbers used with the manufacturer's number. If a container marked with owner's identification numbers changes ownership, and the owner's identification number is changed as a result, the new owner must add the new owner's identification number, following the original owner's identification number on line 3 of the safety approval plate. In the event that the new owner's identification number cannot be legibly added to line 3 of the safety approval plate following the original owner's identification number, the new owner is authorized to put a new safety approval plate on the freight container provided that all the information contained on the original safety approval plate is retained in the owners files.</p>
