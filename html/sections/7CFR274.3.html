                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Retailer participation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All authorized retailers must be  afforded the opportunity to participate in the EBT system. An authorized  food retailer shall not be required to participate in an EBT system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Retailers who do not have immediate access to telephones at the  time   of authorization shall be accommodated by an alternative system (e.g.,  manual vouchers with preliminary or delayed telephone verification) for  redeeming Program benefits from eligible SNAP customers. These retailers  include stationary food stores which opt to make home deliveries to SNAP  households, house-to-house trade routes which operate on standing orders  from customers, e.g. milk and bread delivery routes, food buying  cooperatives authorized to participate as well as other food retailers  authorized under Sec. 278.1 of this chapter. Prior to delivery or upon  returning to the store, the retailer shall telephone the EBT central  computer or hotline number to log the transaction and obtain an  authorization number. If authorization cannot be obtained before or at  the time of purchase, the retailer assumes the risk for sufficient  benefits being available in the household's account. Any alternate  method cannot be burdensome on either the household or the retailer, and  it must include acceptable privacy and security features. Such systems  shall only be available to retailers that cannot be equipped with a POS  terminal at the time of authorization.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Newly authorized retailers shall have access to the EBT system  within 2 weeks after the receipt of the FNS authorization notice.  However, whenever a retailer chooses to employ a third party processor  to drive its terminals or elects to drive its own terminals, access to  the system shall be accomplished within a 30 day period or a mutually  agreed upon time to enable the third party interface specifications and  any State required functional certification to be performed by the State  agency and/or its contractor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Authorized retailers shall not be required to pay costs  essential to and directly attributable to EBT system operations as long  as the equipment or services are provided by the State agency or its  contractor and are utilized solely for SNAP. In addition, if Program  equipment is deployed under contract to the State agency, the State  agency may, with USDA approval, share appropriate costs with retailers  if the equipment is also utilized for commercial purposes. The State  agency may choose to charge retailers reasonable fees in the following  circumstances:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Cost for the replacement of lost, stolen or damaged equipment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The cost of materials and supplies for POS terminals not  provided by the State agency;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Telecommunication costs for all non-EBT use by retailers when  lines are provided by the State agency. In addition, State agencies may  remove phone lines from retailers in instances where there is  significant misuse of the lines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State agency shall ensure that the EBT system provides  credits to the financial institution holding the accounts for retailers  or third party processors within two business days of the daily cut-over  period for retailer settlement. The cut-over period is the time of day  established by the system to define the end of a transaction day for  settlement and reconciliation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> POS deployment. POS terminals shall be deployed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For an FNS authorized retailer with Program benefit redemption  amounting to 15 percent or more of total food sales, all checkout lanes  shall be equipped;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For an FNS authorized retailer with Program benefit redemptions  representing less than 15 percent of total food sales, superstores and  supermarkets shall, at a minimum, receive one terminal for every $11,000  in monthly redemption activity up to the number of lanes per store. All  other food retailers shall receive one terminal for every $8,000 in  monthly redemption activity up to the number of lanes per store.  However, a State agency may utilize an alternative deployment formula  that permits equipment deployment at higher levels than required by this  paragraph up to the number of lanes in each store. The State agency  shall review terminal deployment on a yearly basis and shall be  authorized to remove excess terminals if actual redemption activity  warrants a reduction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For newly authorized retailers, the State agency and retailer  shall negotiate a mutually agreed level of terminal deployment up to the  number of lanes per store. The State agency may   consult with the appropriate FNS field office in order to determine the  previous SNAP redemption activity that could be utilized in determining  the initial number of terminals to deploy in newly authorized retailer  firms. State agencies will also need to make accommodations for border  stores that are deemed necessary for client access. To do so, State  agencies must ensure that procedures are in place to process manual  vouchers in instances when the system is down or for those retailers  that do not have POS equipment. Redemption information shall remain  confidential. Unauthorized release of redemption information is subject  to penalties defined in Section 15 of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008  (7 U.S.C. 2024).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any FNS authorized retailer shall be able to submit further  evidence that it warrants additional terminals after the initial POS  terminals are deployed. SNAP households may also submit evidence to the  State agency that additional POS terminals are needed. State agencies  may provide retailers with additional terminals above the minimum number  required by this paragraph at customer service booths or other locations  if appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Retailer agreements. The State agency shall enter into an  agreement with each authorized retailer. The retailer agreement shall  describe the terms and conditions of participation in the SNAP EBT  system. At a minimum, the agreement shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Describe all terms and conditions with respect to equipment  ownership, lease arrangements, handling and maintenance for which the  State agency and merchant are liable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Describe the agreed upon procedures and policies for  participation and withdrawal from the EBT system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Comply with all Program regulations with respect to retailer  participation in the Program and treatment of SNAP households. This  shall include specific requirements with respect to the deployment of  terminals and the identification of checkout lanes for SNAP customers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Delineate the liabilities during system downtime and the  associated responsibilities of each party with respect to the use of  off-line and/or manually entered data, paper vouchers, and re-presented  vouchers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Third party processors are financial institutions, cardholder  authorization processors other than the party with which the State  agency has contracted for EBT services, and food retailers driving their  own terminals that are capable of relaying electronic transactions to a  central database computer for authorization. The State agency shall  afford retailers the opportunity to use third party processors and shall  provide interface specifications and certification standards in order  for the third party processor to participate in the EBT system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In order to participate in a SNAP EBT system, a third party  processor must be able to meet all third party interface specifications  and certification standards associated with Sec. 274.8. The State agency  shall make available to third party processors the third party interface  specifications prior to implementation of the EBT system to enable third  party processors to access the database. Third party processors shall  undergo functional and acceptance tests as specified by the State  agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Third party processors shall be liable for transactions until  the transaction has been electronically accepted by the contracted  vendor or an intermediate processing facility;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State agency shall ensure that third party processors and  food retailers driving their own terminals comply with this section and  all applicable Program regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Managing retailer participation. The State agency shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Convey retailer authorization information provided by FNS to the  system operator using the Retailer EBT Data Exchange (REDE) system. The  State agency must access the REDE files to ensure that the FNS retailer  files used to authorize valid EBT SNAP transactions are updated on a  daily basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Follow-up on actions taken regarding any disqualification or  withdrawal of an authorized retailer from the Program must occur within  two business days after receipt;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Add newly authorized retailers or third party processors to the  EBT system as prescribed under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Ensure that only currently authorized retailers can access the  system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Monitor retailers to ensure that equipment deployment complies  with paragraph (b) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Ensure that equipment and supplies are maintained in working  order for retail stores equipped by the State agency or its contractor.  Equipment shall be replaced or repaired within 48 hours;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Ensure that retail store employees are trained in system  operation prior to redeeming benefits. Retailer training shall be  offered by the State agency and include the provision of appropriate  written and program specific materials. Retailers have the option to  waive instruction by the State agency if they desire. State agencies  shall direct retailers to confirm in writing that they are waiving their  option to training;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Conduct adjustments as prescribed under Sec. 274.2(g) of this  chapter;</p>
