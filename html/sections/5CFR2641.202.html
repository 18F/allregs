                                Sec. 2641.202  Two-year restriction on any former employee's for which the employee had official responsibility.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em>. For two years after  his Government service terminates, no former employee shall knowingly,  with the intent to influence, make any communication to or appearance  before an employee of the United States on behalf of any other person in  connection with a particular matter involving a specific party or  parties, in which the United States is a party or has a direct and  substantial interest, and which such person knows or reasonably should  know was actually pending under his official responsibility within the  one-year period prior to the termination of his Government service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions and waivers. The prohibition of 18 U.S.C. 207(a)(2)  does not apply to a former employee who is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Acting on behalf of the United States. See Sec. 2641.301(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acting as an elected State or local government official. See  Sec. 2641.301(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Communicating scientific or technological information pursuant  to procedures or certification. See Sec. 2641.301(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Testifying under oath. See Sec. 2641.301(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Acting on behalf of an international organization pursuant to a  waiver. See Sec. 2641.301(h).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Acting as an employee of a Government-owned, contractor-operated  entity pursuant to a waiver. See Sec. 2641.301(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Commencement and length of restriction. 18 U.S.C. 207(a)(2) is a  two-year restriction that commences upon an employee's termination from  Government service. See example 9 to paragraph (j) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> United States is a party or has a direct and substantial  interest. See Sec. 2641.201(j).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Official responsibility--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition. ``Official  responsibility'' means the direct administrative or operating authority,  whether intermediate or final, and either exercisable alone or with  others, and either personally or through subordinates, to approve,  disapprove, or otherwise direct Government action. Ordinarily, the scope  of an employee's official responsibility is determined by those  functions assigned by statute, regulation, Executive order, job  description, or delegation of authority. All particular matters under  consideration in an agency are under the official responsibility of the  agency head and each is under that of any intermediate supervisor who  supervises a person, including a subordinate, who actually participates  in the matter or who has been assigned to participate in the matter  within the scope of his official duties. A nonsupervisory employee does  not have official responsibility for his own assignments within the  meaning of section 207(a)(2). Authority to direct Government action  concerning only ancillary or nonsubstantive aspects of a matter, such as  budgeting, equal employment, scheduling, or format requirements does  not, ordinarily, constitute official responsibility for the matter as a  whole.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Actually pending. A matter is actually pending under an  employee's official responsibility if it has been referred to the  employee for assignment or has been referred to or is under  consideration by any person he supervises, including a subordinate. A  matter remains pending even when it is not under ``active''  consideration. There is no requirement that the matter must have been  pending under the employee's official responsibility for a certain  length of time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Temporary duties. An employee ordinarily acquires official  responsibility for all matters within the scope of his position  immediately upon assuming the position. However, under certain  circumstances, an employee who is on detail (or other temporary  assignment) to a position or who is serving in an ``acting'' status  might not be deemed to have official responsibility for any matter by  virtue of such temporary duties. Specifically, an employee performing  such temporary duties will not thereby acquire official responsibility  for matters within the scope of the position where he functions only in  a limited ``caretaker'' capacity, as evidenced by such factors as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the employee serves in the position for no more than 60  consecutive calendar days;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether there is actually another incumbent for the position,  who is temporarily absent, for example, on travel or leave;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether there has been no event triggering the provisions of 5  U.S.C. 3345(a); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether there are any other circumstances indicating that,  given the temporary nature of the detail or acting status, there was no  reasonable expectation of the full authority of the position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Effect of leave status. The scope of an employee's official  responsibility is not affected by annual leave, terminal leave, sick  leave, excused absence, leave without pay, or similar absence from  assigned duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Effect of disqualification. Official responsibility for a matter  is not eliminated through self-disqualification or avoidance of personal  participation in a matter, as when an employee is disqualified from  participating in a matter in accordance with subparts D, E, or F of 5  CFR part 2635 or part 2640. Official responsibility for a matter can be  terminated by a formal modification of an employee's responsibilities,  such as by a change in the employee's position description.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> One-year period before termination. 18 U.S.C. 207(a)(2) applies  only with respect to a particular matter that was actually pending under  the former employee's official responsibility:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At some time when the matter involved a specific party or  parties; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Within his last year of Government service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Knowledge of official responsibility. A communication or  appearance is not prohibited unless, at the time of the proposed post- employment communication or appearance, the former employee knows or  reasonably should know that the matter was actually pending under his  official responsibility within the one-year period prior to his  termination from Government service. It is not necessary that a former  employee have known during his Government service that the matter was  actually pending under his official responsibility.</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (j):</p><p class="depth3">18 U.S.C. 207(a)(2) requires only that the former employee  ``reasonably should know'' that the matter was pending under his  official responsibility. Consequently, when the facts suggest that a  particular matter involving specific parties could have been actually  pending under his official responsibility, a former employee should seek  information from an agency ethics official or other Government official  to clarify his role in the matter. See Sec. 2641.105 concerning advice.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1 to paragraph (j): The position description of an Assistant  Secretary of Housing and Urban Development specifies that he is  responsible for a certain class of grants. These grants are handled by  an office under his supervision. As a practical matter, however, the  Assistant Secretary has not become involved with any grants of this  type. The Assistant Secretary has official responsibility for all such  grants as specified in his position description.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2 to paragraph (j): A budget officer at the National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is asked to review NOAA's budget  to determine if there are funds still available for the purchase of a  new hurricane tracking device. The budget officer does not have official  responsibility for the resulting contract even though she is responsible  for all budget matters within the agency. The identification of funds  for the contract is an ancillary aspect of the contract.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3 to paragraph (j): An Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  auditor worked in the office responsible for the tax-exempt status of  nonprofit organizations. Subsequently, he was transferred to the IRS  office concerned with public relations. When contacted by an employee of  his former office for advice concerning a matter involving a certain  nonprofit organization, the auditor provides useful suggestions. The  auditor's supervisor in the public relations office does not have  official responsibility for the nonprofit matter since it does not fall  within the scope of the auditor's current duties.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4 to paragraph (j): An information manager at the Central  Intelligence Agency (CIA) assigns a nonsupervisory subordinate to  research an issue concerning a request from a news organization for  information concerning past agency activities. Before she commences any  work on the assignment, the subordinate terminates employment with the  CIA. The request was not pending under the subordinate's official  responsibility since a non-supervisory employee does not have official  responsibility for her own assignments. (Once the subordinate commences  work on the assignment, she may be participating ``personally and  substantially'' within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 207(a)(1) and  Sec. 2641.201(i).)</p><p class="depth3">Example 5 to paragraph (j): A regional employee of the Federal  Emergency Management Agency requests guidance from the General Counsel  concerning a contractual dispute with Baker Company. The General Counsel  immediately assigns the matter to a staff attorney whose workload can  accommodate the assignment, then retires from Government two days later.  Although the staff attorney did not retrieve the assignment from his in- box prior to the General Counsel's departure, the Baker matter was  actually pending under the General Counsel's official responsibility  from the time the General Counsel received the request for guidance.</p><p class="depth3">Example 6 to paragraph (j): A staff attorney in the Federal  Emergency Management Agency's Office of General Counsel is consulted by  procurement officers concerning the correct resolution of a contractual  matter involving Able Company. The attorney renders an opinion resolving  the question.   The same legal question arises later in several contracts with other  companies but none of the disputes with such companies is referred to  the Office of General Counsel. The General Counsel had official  responsibility for the determination of the Able Company matter, but the  subsequent matters were never actually pending under his official  responsibility.</p><p class="depth3">Example 7 to paragraph (j): An employee of the National Endowment  for the Humanities becomes ``acting'' Division Director of the Division  of Education Programs when the Division Director is away from the office  for three days to attend a conference. During those three days, the  employee has authority to direct Government action in connection with  many matters with which she ordinarily would have no involvement.  However, in view of the brief time period and the fact that there  remains an incumbent in the position of Division Director, the agency  ethics official properly may determine that the acting official did not  acquire official responsibility for all matters then pending in the  Division.</p><p class="depth3">Example 8 to paragraph (j): A division director at the Food and Drug  Administration disqualified himself from participating in the review of  a drug for Alzheimer's disease, in accordance with subpart E of 5 CFR  part 2635, because his brother headed the private sector team which  developed the drug. The matter was instead assigned to the division  director's deputy. The director continues to have official  responsibility for review of the drug. The division director also would  have retained official responsibility for the matter had he either asked  his supervisor or another division director to oversee the matter.</p><p class="depth3">Example 9 to paragraph (j): The Deputy Secretary of a department  terminates Government service to stay home with her newborn daughter.  Four months later, she returns to the department to serve on an advisory  committee as a special Government employee (SGE). After three months,  she terminates Government service once again in order to accept a part- time position with a public relations firm. The 18 U.S.C. 207(a)(2) bar  commences when she resigns as Deputy Secretary and continues to run for  two years. (Any action taken in carrying out official duties as a member  of the advisory committee would be undertaken on behalf of the United  States and would, therefore, not be restricted by 18 U.S.C. 207(a)(2).  See Sec. 2641.301(a).) A second two-year restriction commences when she  terminates from her second period of Government service but it applies  only with respect to any particular matter actually pending under her  official responsibility during her three-month term as an SGE.</p>
