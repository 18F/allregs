Transactions, including the travel-related transactions set forth in Sec. 515.560(c), that are related to the humanitarian projects in or related to Cuba that are designed to directly benefit the Cuban people as set forth in paragraph (b) are authorized, provided that the traveler's schedule of activities does not include free time or recreation in excess of that consistent with a full-time schedule.</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec. 515.575(a):</p><p class="depth2">Each person relying on the general authorization in this paragraph must retain specific records related to the authorized travel transactions. See Sec. Sec. 501.601 and 501.602 of this chapter for applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Authorized humanitarian projects.

Provided that the medical professionals in the group maintain a full-time schedule related to disease education and prevention, these activities qualify for the general license.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An entire group does not qualify for the general license in paragraph (a) of this section merely because some members of the group qualify individually.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Specific licenses.
