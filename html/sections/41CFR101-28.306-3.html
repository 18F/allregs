                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agencies shall establish internal controls to ensure that the  use of the CSC account by the agency or other authorized activities is  limited to the purchase of items for official Government use. The  controls shall include written instructions that contain a statement  prohibiting the use of the CSC account in acquiring items for other than  Government use. When an agency makes a purchase of more than $500 per  line item from a GSA customer supply center which is other than a  similar lowest priced item available from a multiple-award schedule, GSA  will assume that a justification has been prepared and made a part of  the   buying agency's purchase file. Availability of products, regardless of  the total amount of the line item price, does not relieve an agency of  the responsibility to select the lowest priced item commensurate with  needs of the agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Office supplies needed by Members of Congress and the Delegate  of the District of Columbia for use in their offices in the House or  Senate Office Buildings should be obtained from the Senate and Houses  Representatives supply rooms, as appropriate. Members of Congress,  except for the Delegate of the District of Columbia, should limit their  use of the CSCs to those located outside of the District of Columbia.  The Delegate of the District of Columbia may obtain office supplies for  the use of his or her district offices from the CSC serving the District  of Columbia.</p>
