                            <p class="depth0">The following examples show how the rules in Secs. 4022.91 through 4022.94 apply. For examples on how these rules apply in the case of a certain-and-continuous annuity, see Sec. 4022.104.</p><p class="depth0">At the time of his death, Charlie was receiving payments under a joint-and-survivor annuity. Charlie designated Ellen to receive survivor benefits under his joint-and-survivor annuity. We underpaid Charlie for periods before his death. At the time of his death, we owed Charlie a back payment to reimburse him for those underpayments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Example 1: where surviving beneficiary is alive at participant's death. Ellen survived Charlie. As explained in Sec. 4022.91(b), because Ellen is entitled to survivor benefits under the joint-and-survivor annuity, we would pay Ellen the back payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Example 2: where surviving beneficiary predeceases participant. Ellen died before Charlie. As explained in Secs. 4022.91(b) and 4022.93, because benefits do not continue after Charlie's death under the joint-and-survivor annuity, we would pay the back payment to the person(s) Charlie designated to receive any payments we might owe him at the time of his death. If Charlie did not designate anyone to receive those payments or his designee died before him, we would pay the back payment to the person(s) surviving Charlie in the following order: spouse, children, parents, estate and next of kin.</p>
