                                Sec. 905.306  Obligation and expenditure of Capital Fund grants.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Obligation. A PHA shall obligate each Capital Fund grant,  including formula grants, Replacement Housing Factor (RHF) grants,  Demolition and Disposition Transitional Funding (DDTF) grants, and  natural disaster grants, no later than 24 months after, and emergency  grants no later than 12 months after, the date on which the funds become  available to the PHA for obligation, except as provided in paragraphs  (c) and (d) of this section. However, a PHA with unobligated funds from  a grant shall disregard this requirement for up to not more than 10  percent of the originally allocated funds from that grant. The funds  become available to the PHA when HUD executes the CF ACC Amendment. With  HUD approval, and subject to the availability of appropriations, the PHA  can accumulate RHF grants for up to 5   years or until it has adequate funds to undertake replacement housing.  The PHA shall obligate 90 percent of the RHF grant within 24 months from  the date that the PHA accumulates adequate funds, except as provided in  paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Items and costs. For funds to be considered obligated, all items  and costs must meet the definition of ``obligation'' in Sec. 905.108 of  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Extension to obligation requirement. The PHA may request an  extension of the obligation deadline, and HUD may grant an extension for  a period of up to 12 months, based on:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The size of the PHA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The complexity of the CFP of the PHA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any limitation on the ability of the PHA to obligate the amounts  allocated for the PHA from the Capital Fund in a timely manner as a  result of state or local law; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any other factors that HUD determines to be relevant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> HUD extension for other reasons. HUD may extend the obligation  deadline for a PHA for such a period as HUD determines to be necessary,  if HUD determines that the failure of the PHA to obligate assistance in  a timely manner is attributable to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Litigation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Delay in obtaining approvals from the Federal Government or a  state or local government that is not the fault of the PHA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compliance with environmental assessment and abatement  requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Relocating residents;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An event beyond the control of the PHA; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any other reason established by HUD by notice in the Federal  Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Failure to obligate. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For any month during the fiscal year,  HUD shall withhold all new Capital Fund grants from any PHA that has  unobligated funds in violation of paragraph (a) of this section. The  penalty will be imposed once the violations of paragraph (a) are known.  The PHA may cure the noncompliance by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requesting in writing that HUD recapture the unobligated balance  of the grant; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Continuing to obligate funds for the grant in noncompliance  until the noncompliance is cured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After the PHA has cured the noncompliance, HUD will release the  withheld Capital Fund grant(s) minus a penalty of one-twelfth of the  grant for each month of noncompliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Expenditure. The PHA shall expend all grant funds within 48  months after the date on which funds become available, as described in  paragraph (a) of this section. The deadline to expend funds may be  extended only by the period of time of a HUD-approved extension of the  obligation deadline. No other extensions of the expenditure deadline  will be granted. All funds not expended will be recaptured.</p>
