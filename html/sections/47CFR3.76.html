                            <p class="depth0">The U.S. ship station licensee bears ultimate responsibility for  final payment of its accounts. This responsibility cannot be superseded  by the contractual agreement between the ship station licensee and the  accounting authority. In the event that an accounting authority does not  remit proper and timely payments on behalf of the ship station licensee:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The ship station licensee will make arrangements for another  accounting authority to perform future settlements, and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ship station licensee will settle any outstanding accounts  due to foreign entities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Commission will, upon request, take all possible steps,  within the limits of applicable national law, to ensure settlement of  the accounts of the ship station licensee. As circumstances warrant,  this may include issuing warnings to ship station licensees when it  becomes apparent that an accounting authority is failing to settle  accounts. See also Secs. 3.70 through 3.74.</p>
