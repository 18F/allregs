                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirements for classification as a NAFTA professional. An  alien shall be classifiable under the provisions of INA 214(e) if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The consular officer is satisfied that the alien qualifies under  the provisions of that section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The alien shall have presented to the consular officer  sufficient evidence of an offer of employment in the United States  requiring employment of a person in a professional capacity consistent  with NAFTA Chapter 16 Annex 1603 Appendix 1603.D.1 and sufficient  evidence that the alien possesses the credentials of that profession as  listed in said appendix; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The alien is the spouse or child of an alien so classified in  accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section and is accompanying or  following to join the principal alien.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Visa validity. The period of validity of a visa issued pursuant  to paragraph (a) of this section may not exceed the period established  on a reciprocal basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Temporary entry. Temporary entry means an entry into the United  States without the intent to establish permanent residence. The alien  must satisfy the consular officer that the proposed stay is temporary. A  temporary period has a reasonable, finite end that does not equate to  permanent residence. The circumstances surrounding an application should  reasonably and convincingly indicate that the alien's temporary work  assignment in the United States will end predictably and that the alien  will depart upon completion of the assignment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Labor disputes. Citizens of Canada or Mexico shall not be  entitled to classification under this section if the Secretary of  Homeland Security and the Secretary of Labor have certified that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There is in progress a strike or lockout in the course of a  labor dispute in the occupational classification at the place or  intended place of employment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The alien has failed to establish that the alien's entry will  not affect adversely the settlement of the strike or lockout or the  employment of any person who is involved in the strike or lockout.
