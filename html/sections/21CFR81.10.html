                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ext. D&C; Yellow Nos. 9 and 10. These colors cannot be produced  with any assurance that they do not contain [beta]-naphthylamine as an  impurity. While it has been asserted that the two colors can be produced  without the impurity named, no method of analysis has been suggested to  establish the fact. [beta]-Naphthylamine is a known carcinogen;  therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a safe  tolerance for these colors in products to be used in contact with the  skin. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, having concluded that such  action is necessary to protect the public health, hereby terminated the  provisional listing of Ext. D&C; Yellow No. 9 and Ext. D&C; Yellow No. 10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> FD&C; Red No. 1. Results of recent feeding tests of this color  additive have demonstrated it to be toxic upon ingestion:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Groups of 50 rats are being fed diets containing FD&C; Red No. 1  at levels of 5 percent, 2 percent, 1 percent, 0.5 percent, and 0  percent. At this stage of the tests, which have now been in progress for  from 15 months to 18 months, 116 animals from the 250 being fed FD&C; Red  No. 1 at various levels and 27 of the 100 controls have died. Of these,  11 being fed at the 5 percent level, 16 being fed at the 2 percent  level, 11 being fed at the 1 percent level, and 2 being fed at the 0.5  percent level, have shown liver damage. None of the controls that have  died have shown liver damage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Groups of 100 mice are being fed diets containing 2 percent, 1  percent, 0.5 percent, and 0.1 percent FD&C; Red No. 1, with 400 mice as  controls. All mice on dosage levels of 2 percent and 1 percent died  before the seventieth week. Gross liver damage has been observed in all  groups fed at the 0.5 percent diet and above.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Groups of 4 dogs are being fed diets containing 2 percent, 1  percent, 0.25 percent, and 0 percent FD&C; Red No. 1. Three of the dogs  on the 2 percent dosage level died before 32 weeks; the other is living.  Three of the dogs on the 1 percent dosage level died or were sacrificed  within 13 months. All deceased or sacrificed dogs have shown liver  damage grossly and/or microscopically. Deceased dogs on the 1 percent  and 2 percent dosage level showed poor physical condition.  The Commissioner of Food and Drugs having concluded that ingestion of  this color additive over a long period of time would be unsafe, and in  order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional  listing of FD&C; Red No. 1 for use in foods, drugs, and cosmetics.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> FD&C; Red No. 4. Feeding tests of this color additive have been  conducted with three species:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rats of the Osborne-Mendel and Sprague-Dawley strains were fed  FD&C;   Red No. 4 for 2 years at levels of 5 percent, 2 percent, 1 percent, and  0.5 percent of the diet. No effect was found.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mice of the C3Hf and C57BL strains were fed FD&C; Red No. 4 for 2  years at levels of 2 percent and 1 percent of the diet. No effect was  found.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dogs were fed FD&C; Red No. 4 at levels of 2 percent and 1  percent of the diet. Adverse effects were found at both levels in the  urinary bladder and in the adrenals. Three dogs of five fed on the 2- percent level died after 6 months, 9 months, and 5\1/2\ years on the  test. Two of the dogs on the 2-percent level and all five of the dogs on  the 1-percent level survived to the completion of the 7 year study.  The Commissioner of Food and Drugs has concluded that available data do  not permit the establishment of a safe level of use of this color  additive in food, ingested drugs and ingested cosmetics. In order to  protect the public health, the Commissioner hereby terminates the  provisional listing of FD&C; Red No. 4 for use in food and ingested  drugs. The Commissioner has previously terminated the provisional  listing of FD&C; Red No. 4 for use in ingested cosmetics. FD&C; Red No. 4  is listed for use in externally applied drugs and cosmetics by  Sec. Sec. 74.1304 and 74.2304 of this chapter, respectively. Section  82.304 of this chapter is retained in part 82 of this chapter to permit  the use of lakes of FD&C; Red No. 4 in externally applied drugs and  cosmetics.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> FD&C; Violet No. 1. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order  to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing  of FD&C; Violet No. 1 for use in foods, drugs, and cosmetics.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> FD&C; Red No. 2. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to  protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of  FD&C; Red No. 2 for use in food, drugs, and cosmetics.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Carbon black (prepared by the ``impingement'' or ``channel''  process). The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the  public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of carbon black  (prepared by the impingement or channel process) for use in food, drugs,  and cosmetics.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> D&C; Red Nos. 10, 11, 12, and 13. The petition for these color  additives was withdrawn so that there no longer exists a basis for their  continued provisional listing. In addition, the Commissioner has learned  of the possible contamination of D&C; Red No. 10, D&C; Red No. 11, D&C; Red  No. 12, and D&C; Red No. 13 with [beta]-naphthyl-amine. The Commissioner  concludes that these colors cannot be produced with any reasonable  assurance that they will not contain [beta]-naphthylamine as an impurity  or not yield [beta]-naphthylamine from the metabolism of subsidiary  colors present in them. [beta]-Naphthylamine is a known carcinogen;  therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a safe  tolerance for these colors in drugs or cosmetics. The Commissioner of  Food and Drugs, upon withdrawal of the petition for their use and in  order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional  listing of D&C; Red No. 10, D&C; Red No. 11, D&C; Red No. 12, and D&C; Red  No. 13 for use in drugs and cosmetics, effective December 13, 1977.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Ext. D&C; Yellow No. 1. The Commissioner has learned of the  contamination of Ext. D&C; Yellow No. 1 with 4-aminobiphenyl. The  Commissioner concludes that this color cannot be produced with any  reasonable assurance that it will not contain 4-aminobiphenyl as an  impurity or not yield benzidine from the decomposition of a subsidiary  reaction product that might be present in the color. 4-Aminobiphenyl and  benzidine are known carcinogens; therefore, there is no scientific  evidence that will support a safe tolerance for these colors in drugs or  cosmetics. In addition, insufficient data have been submitted to permit  establishment of appropriate specifications for the batch certification  of the color. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect  the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of Ext. D&C;  Yellow No. 1 for use in externally applied drugs and cosmetics,  effective December 13, 1977.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Graphite. Data have been developed that show the contamination  of graphite with polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PNA's). There is no  reasonable assurance this color can be produced so that it will not  contain PNA's   as an impurity. The presence of certain PNA's in graphite would indicate  that PNA's known to be carcinogenic to animals and humans may also be  present. Therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a  safe tolerance for this color in drugs or cosmetics. The Commissioner of  Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates  the provisional listing of graphite for use in externally applied  cosmetics, effective November 29, 1977.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Ext. D&C; Green No. 1. The Commissioner concludes that there are  inadequate analytical methods to permit certification of the color  additive Ext. D&C; Green No. 1. In addition, the Commissioner has found  that there was a failure to comply with the conditions attached to the  postponement of the closing date in accordance with section 203(a)(2) of  the transitional provisions of the Color Additive Amendments of 1960.  The Commissioner of Food and Drugs hereby terminates the provisional  listing of Ext. D&C; Green No. 1 for use in externally applied drugs and  cosmetics, effective November 29, 1977.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> D&C; Orange Nos. 10 and 11. In the absense of a petition to list  D&C; Orange No. 10 and D&C; Orange No. 11 for use in ingested drugs and  cosmetics, there no longer exists a basis for provisional listing for  such uses. Therefore, FDA is terminating the provisional listing of D&C;  Orange No. 10 and D&C; Orange No. 11 for use in ingested drugs and  cosmetics, effective April 28, 1981.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> D&C; Blue No. 6. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, having  concluded that unresolved questions remain concerning the chemistry of  unidentified minor components, hereby terminates the provisional listing  of D&C; Blue No. 6 for use in drugs and cosmetics.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> D&C; Green No. 6. In the absence of a petition to list D&C; Green  No. 6 for use in ingested drugs and cosmetics, there no longer exists a  basis for provisional listing for such uses. Accordingly, the  Commissioner of Food and Drugs hereby terminates the provisional listing  of D&C; Green No. 6 for use in ingested drugs and cosmetics, effective  March 27, 1981.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> D&C; Red No. 19 and D&C; Red No. 37. Having concluded that,  when ingested, D&C; Red No. 19 causes cancer in rats and mice, the agency  hereby terminates the provisional listings of D&C; Red No. 19 and  chemically related D&C; Red No. 37 for use in ingested drugs and ingested  cosmetics, effective February 4, 1983.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> D&C; Red No. 37. In the absence of a petition to list D&C; Red No.  37 for external uses, there no longer exists a basis for provisional  listing for such uses. Accordingly, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs  hereby terminates the provisional listings of D&C; Red No. 37 for use in  externally applied drugs and cosmetics, effective June 6, 1986.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> D&C; Orange No. 17. Having concluded that, when ingested, D&C;  Orange No. 17 causes cancer in rats and mice, the agency has terminated  the provisional listing of D&C; Orange No. 17 for use in ingested drugs  and ingested cosmetics, effective March 31, 1983.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> D&C; Red No. 8 and D&C; Red No. 9. In the absence of a petition to  list D&C; Red No. 8 and D&C; Red No. 9 for mouthwash, dentifrices, and  ingested drugs, except ingested drug lip products, there no longer  exists a basis for provisional listing for such uses. Accordingly, the  Commissioner of Food and Drugs hereby terminates the provisional  listings of D&C; Red No. 8 and D&C; Red No. 9 for use in mouthwash,  dentifrices, and ingested drugs, except ingested drug lip products,  effective January 6, 1987.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> FD&C; Red No. 3. Having concluded that FD&C; Red No. 3 causes  cancer in rats, the agency hereby terminates the provisional listing of  FD&C; Red No. 3 for use in cosmetics and externally applied drugs and the  provisional listing of the lakes of FD&C; Red No. 3 for use in food,  drug, and cosmetic products, effective January 29, 1990.
