Computations shall include the last day of the time period, unless the day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. When the last day is a Saturday, Sunday or Federal holiday, the period of time shall run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays and Federal holidays are included in the computation of time. However, when the time period within which an act is to be performed is 10 days or less, not including any additional time allowed for in paragraph (c) of this section, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays and Federal holidays are not included.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When papers are deemed to be filed or served.

Whenever a time limit is measured by a prescribed period from the service of any notice, pleading or paper, the applicable time limits shall be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If service was made by delivery to the U.S. Postal Service for longer than overnight delivery service by first class, registered, or certified mail, add three calendar days to the prescribed

period for the responsive pleading or other filing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If service was personal, or was made by delivery to the U.S. Postal Service or any reliable commercial delivery service for overnight delivery, add one calendar-day to the prescribed period for the responsive pleading or other filing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If service was made by electronic media transmission or facsimile, add one calendar-day to the prescribed period for the responsive pleading or other filing--unless otherwise determined by the Director or the presiding officer sua sponte, or upon motion of a party in the case of filing or by prior agreement among the parties in the case of service.</p>
