The report shall

present an annual (and seasonal, where practicable) depiction of non-major training exercises geographically across NWTRC. The Navy shall include (in the NWTRC annual report) a brief annual progress update on the status of the development of an effective and unclassified method to report this information until an agreed-upon (with NMFS) method has been developed and implemented.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Sinking Exercises (SINKEXs)--This section shall include the following information for each SINKEX completed that year:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Exercise Info:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Location;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Date and time exercise began and ended;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Total hours of observation by watchstanders before, during, and after exercise;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Total number and types of rounds expended/explosives detonated;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Number and types of passive acoustic sources used in exercise;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Total hours of passive acoustic search time;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Number and types of vessels, aircraft, etc., participating in exercise;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Wave height in feet (high, low and average during exercise); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Narrative description of sensors and platforms utilized for marine mammal detection and timeline illustrating how marine mammal detection was conducted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Individual marine mammal observation during SINKEX (by Navy lookouts) information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Location of sighting;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Species (if not possible--indication of whale/dolphin/pinniped);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Number of individuals;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Calves observed (y/n);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Initial detection sensor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Length of time observers maintained visual contact with marine mammal;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Wave height;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Visibility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Whether sighting was before, during, or after detonations/exercise, and how many minutes before or after;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Distance of marine mammal from actual detonations (or target spot if not yet detonated)--use four categories to define distance:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> the modeled injury threshold radius for the largest explosive used in that exercise type in that OPAREA (662 m for SINKEX in NWTRC);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> the required exclusion zone (1 nm for SINKEX in NWTRC);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> the required observation distance (if different than the exclusion zone (2 nm for SINKEX in NWTRC)); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> greater than the required observed distance.
