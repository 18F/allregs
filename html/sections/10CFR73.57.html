                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each licensee who is authorized to engage in an  activity subject to regulation by the Commission shall comply with the  requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each applicant for a license to engage in an activity subject to  regulation by the Commission, as well as each entity who has provided  written notice to the Commission of intent to file an application for  licensing, certification, permitting, or approval of a product subject  to regulation by the Commission shall submit fingerprints for those  individuals who will have access to Safeguards Information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Before receiving its operating license under 10 CFR part 50 or  before the Commission makes its finding under Sec. 52.103(g) of this  chapter, each   applicant for a license to operate a nuclear power reactor (including an  applicant for a combined license) or a non-power reactor may submit  fingerprints for those individuals who will require unescorted access to  the nuclear power facility or non-power reactor facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General performance objective and requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except those  listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, each licensee subject to the  provisions of this section shall fingerprint each individual who is  permitted unescorted access to the nuclear power facility, the non-power  reactor facility in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, or  access to Safeguards Information. The licensee will then review and use  the information received from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  and, based on the provisions contained in this section, determine either  to continue to grant or to deny further unescorted access to the nuclear  power facility, the non-power reactor facility, or access to Safeguards  Information for that individual. Individuals who do not have unescorted  access or access to Safeguards Information shall be fingerprinted by the  licensee and the results of the criminal history records check shall be  used before making a determination for granting unescorted access to the  nuclear power facility, non-power reactor facility, or to Safeguards  Information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Licensees need not fingerprint in accordance with the  requirements of this section for the following categories:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For unescorted access to the nuclear power facility or the non- power reactor facility (but must adhere to provisions contained in  Sec. Sec. 73.21 and 73.22): NRC employees and NRC contractors on  official agency business; individuals responding to a site emergency in  accordance with the provisions of Sec. 73.55(a); offsite emergency  response personnel who are responding to an emergency at a non-power  reactor facility; a representative of the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) engaged in activities associated with the U.S./IAEA  Safeguards Agreement at designated facilities who has been certified by  the NRC; law enforcement personnel acting in an official capacity;  Federal, State or local government employees who have had equivalent  reviews of FBI criminal history data; and individuals employed at a  facility who possess ``Q'' or ``L'' clearances or possess another active  government granted security clearance (i.e., Top Secret, Secret, or  Confidential);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For access to Safeguards Information only but must adhere to  provisions contained in Sec. Sec. 73.21, 73.22, and 73.23: the  categories of individuals specified in 10 CFR 73.59.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any licensee currently processing criminal history requests  through the FBI pursuant to Executive Order 10450 need not also submit  such requests to the NRC under this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Upon further notice to licensees and without further  rulemaking, the Commission may waive certain requirements of this  section on a temporary basis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Individuals who have a valid unescorted access authorization to  a non-power reactor facility on November 7, 2012 are not required to  undergo a new fingerprint-based criminal history records check pursuant  to paragraph (g) of this section, until such time that the existing  authorization expires, is terminated, or is otherwise to be renewed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The licensee shall notify each affected individual that the  fingerprints will be used to secure a review of his/her criminal history  record, and inform the individual of proper procedures for revising the  record or including explanation in the record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Fingerprinting is not required if the licensee is reinstating  the unescorted access to the nuclear power facility, the non-power  reactor facility, or access to Safeguards Information granted an  individual if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The individual returns to the same nuclear power utility or non- power reactor facility that granted access and such access has not been  interrupted for a continuous period of more than 365 days; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The previous access was terminated under favorable conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Fingerprints need not be taken, in the discretion of the  licensee, if an individual who is an employee of a licensee, contractor,  manufacturer, or supplier has been granted unescorted   access to a nuclear power facility, a non-power reactor facility, or to  Safeguards Information by another licensee, based in part on a criminal  history records check under this section. The criminal history records  check file may be transferred to the gaining licensee in accordance with  the provisions of paragraph (f)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> All fingerprints obtained by the licensee under this section  must be submitted to the Attorney General of the United States through  the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The licensee shall review the information received from the  Attorney General and consider it in making a determination for granting  unescorted access to the individual or access to Safeguards Information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A licensee shall use the information obtained as part of a  criminal history records check solely for the purpose of determining an  individual's suitability for unescorted access to the nuclear power  facility, the non-power reactor facility, or access to Safeguards  Information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prohibitions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A licensee may not base a final determination  to deny an individual unescorted access to the nuclear power facility,  the non-power reactor facility, or access to Safeguards Information  solely on the basis of information received from the FBI involving:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An arrest more than 1 year old for which there is no information  of the disposition of the case; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An arrest that resulted in dismissal of the charge or an  acquittal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A licensee may not use information received from a criminal  history check obtained under this section in a manner that would  infringe upon the rights of any individual under the First Amendment to  the Constitution of the United States, nor shall the licensee use the  information in any way which would discriminate among individuals on the  basis of race, religion, national origin, sex, or age.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedures for processing of fingerprint checks. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the  purpose of complying with this section, licensees shall, using an  appropriate method listed in Sec. 73.4, submit to the NRC's Division of  Facilities and Security, Mail Stop TWB 05B32M, one completed, legible  standard fingerprint card (Form FD-258, ORIMDNRCOOOZ) or, where  practicable, other fingerprint records for each individual requiring  unescorted access to the nuclear power facility, the non-power reactor  facility, or access to Safeguards Information, to the Director of the  NRC's Division of Facilities and Security, marked for the attention of  the Division's Criminal History Check Section. Copies of these forms may  be obtained by writing the Office of Information Services, U.S. Nuclear  Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, by calling 301-415- 5877, or by email to FORMS.Resource@nrc.gov. Guidance on what  alternative formats might be practicable is referenced in Sec. 73.4.  The licensee shall establish procedures to ensure that the quality of  the fingerprints taken results in minimizing the rejection rate of  fingerprint cards due to illegible or incomplete cards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission will review applications for criminal history  checks for completeness. Any Form FD-258 or other fingerprint record  containing omissions or evident errors will be returned to the licensee  for corrections. The fee for processing fingerprint checks includes one  free resubmission if the initial submission is returned by the FBI  because the fingerprint impressions cannot be classified. The one free  resubmission must have the FBI Transaction Control Number reflected on  the resubmission. If additional submissions are necessary, they will be  treated as an initial submittal and require a second payment of the  processing fee. The payment of a new processing fee entitles the  submitter to an additional free resubmittal, if necessary. Previously  rejected submissions may not be included with the third submission  because the submittal will be rejected automatically.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fees for the processing of fingerprint checks are due upon  application. Licensees shall submit payment with the application for the  processing of fingerprints through corporate check, certified check,  cashier's check, money order, or electronic payment, made payable to  ``U.S. NRC.'' (For guidance on making electronic payments, contact the  Security Branch, Division of Facilities and Security, at   (301) 415-7404). Combined payment for multiple applications is  acceptable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The application fee is the sum of the user fee charged by the  FBI for each fingerprint card or other fingerprint record submitted by  the NRC on behalf of a licensee, and an administrative processing fee  assessed by the NRC. The NRC processing fee covers administrative costs  associated with NRC handling of licensee fingerprint submissions. The  Commission publishes the amount of the fingerprint records check  application fee on the NRC public Web site. (To find the current fee  amount, go to the Electronic Submittals page at http://www.nrc.gov/site- help/e-submittals.html and see the link for the Criminal History  Program.) The Commission will directly notify licensees who are subject  to this regulation of any fee changes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Commission will forward to the submitting licensee all data  received from the FBI as a result of the licensee's application(s) for  criminal history checks, to include the FBI fingerprint record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Right to correct and complete information. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to any  final adverse determination, the licensee shall make available to the  individual the contents of records obtained from the FBI for the purpose  of assuring correct and complete information. Confirmation of receipt by  the individual of this notification must be maintained by the licensee  for a period of 1 year from the date of the notification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If after reviewing the record, an individual believes that it is  incorrect or incomplete in any respect and wishes changes, corrections,  or updating (of the alleged deficiency), or to explain any matter in the  record, the individual may initiate challenge procedures. These  procedures include direct application by the individual challenging the  record to the agency, i.e., law enforcement agency, that contributed the  questioned information or direct challenge as to the accuracy or  completeness of any entry on the criminal history record to the  Assistant Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation Identification  Division, Washington, DC 20537-9700 as set forth in 28 CFR 16.30 through  16.34. In the latter case, the FBI then forwards the challenge to the  agency that submitted the data requesting that agency to verify or  correct the challenged entry. Upon receipt of an official communication  directly from the agency that contributed the original information, the  FBI Identification Division makes any changes necessary in accordance  with the information supplied by that agency. Licensees must provide at  least 10 days for an individual to initiate action to challenge the  results of an FBI criminal history records check after the record being  made available for his/her review. The licensee may make a final adverse  determination based upon the criminal history record, if applicable,  only upon receipt of the FBI's confirmation or correction of the record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In addition to the right to obtain records from the FBI in  paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the right to initiate challenge  procedures in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, an individual  participating in an NRC adjudication and seeking to obtain Safeguards  Information for use in that adjudication may appeal a final adverse  determination by the NRC Office of Administration to the presiding  officer of the proceeding. The request may also seek to have the Chief  Administrative Judge designate an officer other than the presiding  officer of the proceeding to review the adverse determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Protection of information. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each licensee who obtains a  criminal history record on an individual under this section shall  establish and maintain a system of files and procedures for protection  of the record and the personal information from unauthorized disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The licensee may not disclose the record or personal information  collected and maintained to persons other than the subject individual,  his/her representative, or to those who have a need to have access to  the information in performing assigned duties in the process of granting  or denying unescorted access to the nuclear power facility, the non- power reactor facility or access to Safeguards Information. No  individual authorized to have access to the information may re- disseminate the information to any other individual who does not have a  need to know.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The personal information obtained on an individual from a  criminal history record check may be transferred to another licensee:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Upon the individual's written request to the licensee holding  the data to re-disseminate the information contained in his/her file;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The gaining licensee verifies information such as name, date of  birth, social security number, sex, and other applicable physical  characteristics for identification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The licensee shall make criminal history records obtained under  this section available for examination by an authorized representative  of the NRC to determine compliance with the regulations and laws.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The licensee shall retain all fingerprint and criminal history  records received from the FBI, or a copy if the individual's file has  been transferred, on an individual (including data indicating no record)  for one year after termination or denial of unescorted access to the  nuclear power facility, the non-power reactor facility, or access to  Safeguards Information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Fingerprinting requirements for unescorted access for non-power  reactor licensees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No person shall be permitted unescorted access to  a non-power reactor facility unless that person has been determined by  an NRC-approved reviewing official to be trustworthy and reliable based  on the results of an FBI fingerprint-based criminal history records  check obtained in accordance with this paragraph. The reviewing official  is required to have unescorted access in accordance with this section or  access to Safeguards Information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each non-power reactor licensee subject to the requirements of  this section shall obtain the fingerprints for a criminal history  records check for each individual who is seeking or permitted:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Unescorted access to vital areas of the non-power reactor  facility; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unescorted access to special nuclear material in the non-power  reactor facility provided the individual who is seeking or permitted  unescorted access possesses the capability and knowledge to make  unauthorized use of the special nuclear material in the non-power  reactor facility or to remove the special nuclear material from the non- power reactor in an unauthorized manner.
