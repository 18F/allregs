                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Evidence of guaranty or insurance shall be issued in respect to a loan for any of the purposes specified in 38 U.S.C. 3710(a) only if all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The proceeds of such loan have been used to pay for the property purchased, constructed, repaired, refinanced, altered, or improved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as to refinancing loans pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8), (a)(9)(B)(i), (a)(11), or (b)(7) and energy efficient mortgages pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(d), the loan (including any scheduled deferred interest added to principal) does not exceed the reasonable value of the property or projected reasonable value of a new home which is security for a graduated payment mortgage loan, as appropriate, as determined by the Secretary. For the purpose of determining the reasonable value of a graduated payment mortgage loan to purchase a new home, the reasonable value of the property as of the time the loan is made shall be calculated to increase at a rate not in excess of 2.5 percent per year, but in no event may the projected value of the property exceed 115 percent of the initially established reasonable value.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(d)(2))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The veteran has certified, in such form as the Secretary may prescribe, that the veteran has paid in cash from his or her own resources on account of such purchase, construction, alteration, repair, or improvement a sum equal to the difference, if any, between the purchase price or cost of the property and its reasonable value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A loan guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3710(d) which includes the cost of energy efficient improvements may exceed the reasonable value of the property. The cost of the energy efficient improvements that may be financed may not exceed $3,000; provided, however, that up to $6,000 in energy efficient improvements may be financed if the increase in the monthly payment for principal and interest does not exceed the likely reduction in monthly utility costs resulting from the energy efficient improvements.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3710)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notwithstanding that the aggregate of the loan amount in the case of loans for the purposes specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and the amount remaining unpaid on taxes, special assessments, prior mortgage indebtedness, or other obligations of any character secured by enforceable superior liens or a right to such lien existing as of the date the loan is closed exceeds the reasonable value of such

property as of said date and that evidence of guaranty or insurance credit is issued in respect thereof, as between the holder and Secretary (for the purpose of computing the claim on the guaranty or insurance and for the purposes of Sec. 36.4323, and all accounting), the indebtedness which is the subject of the guaranty or insurance shall be deemed to have been reduced as of the date of the loan by a sum equal to such excess, less any amounts secured by liens released or paid on the obligations secured by such superior liens or rights by a holder or others without expense to or obligation on the debtor resulting from such payment, or release of lien or right; and all payments made on the loan shall be applied to the indebtedness as so reduced. Nothing in this paragraph affects any right or liability resulting from fraud or willful misrepresentation.
