This practice results in comparable grouping by subject area without establishment of subchapters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Parts 105-50 and above are used for GSPMR that supplement regulations in the FPMR and implement regulations of other agencies. Part numbers are assigned so as to accomplish a similar subject area grouping. Regulations on advisory committee management are recodified as part 105-54 to place them in the appropriate subject area category. Regulations on standards of conduct remain in part 105-735 because the number 735 identifies regulations of the U.S. Civil Service Commission and various civil agencies on this subject.</p>
