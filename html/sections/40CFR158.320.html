The following information is required for each active ingredient in the product:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the source of any active ingredient in the product is an EPA-registered product:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The chemical and common name (if any) of the active ingredient, as listed on the source product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The nominal concentration of the active ingredient in the product, based upon the nominal concentration of active ingredient in the source product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Upper and lower certified limits of the active ingredient in the product, in accordance with Sec. 158.350.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the source of any active ingredient in the product is not an EPA-registered product:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The chemical name according to Chemical Abstracts Society (CAS) nomenclature, the CAS Registry Number, and any common names.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The molecular, structural, and empirical formulae and the molecular weight or weight range.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The nominal concentration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Upper and lower certified limits of the active ingredient in accordance with Sec. 158.350.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The purpose of the ingredient in the formulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inert ingredients.

If the chemical identity or chemical composition of an ingredient is not known to the applicant because it is proprietary or trade secret information, the applicant must ensure that the supplier or producer of the ingredient submits to the Agency (or has on file with the Agency) information on the identity or chemical composition of the ingredient. Generally, it is not required that an applicant know the identity of each ingredient in a mixture that he uses in his product. However, in certain circumstances, the Agency may require that the applicant know the identity of a specific ingredient in such a mixture. If the Agency requires specific knowledge of an ingredient, it will notify the applicant in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The nominal concentration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upper and lower certified limits in accordance with Sec. 158.350.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The purpose of the ingredient in the formulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Impurities of toxicological significance associated with the active ingredient.
