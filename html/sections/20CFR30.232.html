                                Sec. 30.232  How does a claimant establish that the employee has been   impairment or disease as a consequence of a covered illness?

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To establish that the employee has been diagnosed with a covered  illness as required by Sec. 30.230(d), the employee, or his or her  survivor(s), must provide the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name and address of any licensed physician who is the source  of a diagnosis based upon documented medical information that the  employee has or had an illness and that the illness may have resulted  from exposure to a toxic substance while the employee was employed at a  DOE facility or a RECA section 5 facility, as appropriate, and, to the  extent practicable, a copy of the diagnosis and a summary of the  information upon which the diagnosis is based; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A signed medical release, authorizing the release of any  diagnosis, medical opinion and medical records documenting the diagnosis  or opinion that the employee has or had an illness and that the illness  may have resulted from exposure to a toxic substance while the employee  was employed at a DOE facility or RECA section 5 facility, as  appropriate; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To the extent practicable and appropriate, an occupational  history obtained by a physician, an occupational health professional, or  a DOE-sponsored Former Worker Program (if such an occupational history  is not reasonably available or is inadequate, and such history is deemed  by OWCP to be needed for the fair adjudication of the claim, then OWCP  may assist the claimant in developing this history); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any other information or materials deemed by OWCP to be  necessary to provide reasonable evidence that the employee has or had an  illness that may have arisen from exposure to a toxic substance while  employed at a DOE facility or RECA section 5 facility, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The employee, or his or her survivor(s), may also submit to OWCP  other evidence not described in paragraph (a) of this section showing  that the employee has or had an illness that   resulted from an exposure to a toxic substance during the course of  employment at either a DOE facility or a RECA section 5 facility, as  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An injury, illness, impairment or disease sustained as a  consequence of a covered illness (as defined in Sec. 30.5(r)) must be  established with a fully rationalized medical report by a physician that  shows the relationship between the injury, illness, impairment or  disease and the covered illness. Neither the fact that the injury,  illness, impairment or disease manifests itself after a diagnosis of a  covered illness, nor the belief of the claimant that the injury,  illness, impairment or disease was caused by the covered illness, is  sufficient in itself to prove a causal relationship.</p>
