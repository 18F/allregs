                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Sample site location. (1) By the applicable date for commencement of monitoring under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, each water system shall complete a materials evaluation of its distribution system in order to identify a pool of targeted sampling sites that meets the requirements of this section, and which is sufficiently large to ensure that the water system can collect the number of lead and copper tap samples required in paragraph (c) of this section. All sites from which first draw samples are collected shall be selected from this pool of targeted sampling sites. Sampling sites may not include faucets that have point-of-use or point-of-entry treatment devices designed to remove inorganic contaminants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> By the applicable date for commencement of monitoring under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, each water system shall complete a materials evaluation of its distribution system in order to identify a pool of targeted sampling sites that meets the requirements of this section, and which is sufficiently large to ensure that the water system can collect the number of lead and copper tap samples required in paragraph (c) of this section. All sites from which first draw samples are collected shall be selected from this pool of targeted sampling sites. Sampling sites may not include faucets that have point-of-use or point-of-entry treatment devices designed to remove inorganic contaminants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A water system shall use the information on lead, copper, and galvanized steel that it is required to collect under Sec.  141.42(d) of this part [special monitoring for corrosivity characteristics] when conducting a materials evaluation. When an evaluation of the information collected pursuant to Sec.  141.42(d) is insufficient to locate the requisite number of lead and copper sampling sites that meet the targeting criteria in paragraph (a) of this section, the water system shall review the sources of information listed below in order to identify a sufficient number of sampling sites. In addition, the system shall seek to collect such information where possible in the course of its normal operations (e.g., checking service line materials when reading water meters or performing maintenance activities):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All plumbing codes, permits, and records in the files of the building department(s) which indicate the plumbing materials that are installed within publicly and privately owned structures connected to the distribution system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All inspections and records of the distribution system that indicate the material composition of the service connections that connect a structure to the distribution system; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All existing water quality information, which includes the results of

all prior analyses of the system or individual structures connected to the system, indicating locations that may be particularly susceptible to high lead or copper concentrations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The sampling sites selected for a community water system's sampling pool (``tier l sampling sites'') shall consist of single family structures that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Contain copper pipes with lead solder installed after 1982 or contain lead pipes; and/or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Are served by a lead service line. When multiple-family residences comprise at least 20 percent of the structures served by a water system, the system may include these types of structures in its sampling pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any community water system with insufficient tier 1 sampling sites shall complete its sampling pool with ``tier 2 sampling sites'', consisting of buildings, including multiple-family residences that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Contain copper pipes with lead solder installed after 1982 or contain lead pipes; and/or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Are served by a lead service line.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any community water system with insufficient tier 1 and tier 2 sampling sites shall complete its sampling pool with ``tier 3 sampling sites'', consisting of single family structures that contain copper pipes with lead solder installed before 1983. A community water system with insufficient tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 sampling sites shall complete its sampling pool with representative sites throughout the distribution system. For the purpose of this paragraph, a representative site is a site in which the plumbing materials used at that site would be commonly found at other sites served by the water system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The sampling sites selected for a non-transient noncommunity water system (``tier l sampling sites'') shall consist of buildings that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Contain copper pipes with lead solder installed after 1982 or contain lead pipes; and/or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Are served by a lead service line.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A non-transient non-community water system with insufficient tier 1 sites that meet the targeting criteria in paragraph (a)(6) of this section shall complete its sampling pool with sampling sites that contain copper pipes with lead solder installed before 1983. If additional sites are needed to complete the sampling pool, the non-transient non-community water system shall use representative sites throughout the distribution system. For the purpose of this paragraph, a representative site is a site in which the plumbing materials used at that site would be commonly found at other sites served by the water system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Any water system whose distribution system contains lead service lines shall draw 50 percent of the samples it collects during each monitoring period from sites that contain lead pipes, or copper pipes with lead solder, and 50 percent of the samples from sites served by a lead service line. A water system that cannot identify a sufficient number of sampling sites served by a lead service line shall collect first-draw samples from all of the sites identified as being served by such lines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Sample collection methods. (1) All tap samples for lead and copper collected in accordance with this subpart, with the exception of lead service line samples collected under Sec.  141.84(c) and samples collected under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, shall be first-draw samples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All tap samples for lead and copper collected in accordance with this subpart, with the exception of lead service line samples collected under Sec.  141.84(c) and samples collected under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, shall be first-draw samples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each first-draw tap sample for lead and copper shall be one liter in volume and have stood motionless in the plumbing system of each sampling site for at least six hours. First-draw samples from residential housing shall be collected from the cold water kitchen tap or bathroom sink tap. First-draw samples from a nonresidential building shall be one liter in volume and shall be collected at an interior tap from which water is typically drawn for consumption. Non-first-draw samples collected in lieu of first-draw samples pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section shall be one liter in volume and shall be collected at an interior tap from which water is typically drawn for consumption. First-draw samples may be collected by the system or the system may allow residents to collect first-draw samples after instructing the residents of the sampling procedures specified in this paragraph. To avoid problems of residents handling nitric acid, acidification of first-draw samples may be done up to 14

days after the sample is collected. After acidification to resolubilize the metals, the sample must stand in the original container for the time specified in the approved EPA method before the sample can be analyzed. If a system allows residents to perform sampling, the system may not challenge, based on alleged errors in sample collection, the accuracy of sampling results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each service line sample shall be one liter in volume and have stood motionless in the lead service line for at least six hours. Lead service line samples shall be collected in one of the following three ways:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At the tap after flushing the volume of water between the tap and the lead service line. The volume of water shall be calculated based on the interior diameter and length of the pipe between the tap and the lead service line;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Tapping directly into the lead service line; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the sampling site is a building constructed as a single-family residence, allowing the water to run until there is a significant change in temperature which would be indicative of water that has been standing in the lead service line.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A water system shall collect each first draw tap sample from the same sampling site from which it collected a previous sample. If, for any reason, the water system cannot gain entry to a sampling site in order to collect a follow-up tap sample, the system may collect the follow-up tap sample from another sampling site in its sampling pool as long as the new site meets the same targeting criteria, and is within reasonable proximity of the original site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A non-transient non-community water system, or a community water system that meets the criteria of Sec.  141.85(b)(7), that does not have enough taps that can supply first-draw samples, as defined in Sec.  141.2, may apply to the State in writing to substitute non-first-draw samples. Such systems must collect as many first-draw samples from appropriate taps as possible and identify sampling times and locations that would likely result in the longest standing time for the remaining sites. The State has the discretion to waive the requirement for prior State approval of non-first-draw sample sites selected by the system, either through State regulation or written notification to the system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Number of samples. Water systems shall collect at least one sample during each monitoring period specified in paragraph (d) of this section from the number of sites listed in the first column (``standard monitoring'') of the table in this paragraph. A system conducting reduced monitoring under paragraph (d)(4) of this section shall collect at least one sample from the number of sites specified in the second column (``reduced monitoring'') of the table in this paragraph during each monitoring period specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. Such reduced monitoring sites shall be representative of the sites required for standard monitoring. A public water system that has fewer than five drinking water taps, that can be used for human consumption meeting the sample site criteria of paragraph (a) of this section to reach the required number of sample sites listed in paragraph (c) of this section, must collect at least one sample from each tap and then must collect additional samples from those taps on different days during the monitoring period to meet the required number of sites. Alternatively the State may allow these public water systems to collect a number of samples less than the number of sites specified in paragraph (c) of this section, provided that 100 percent of all taps that can be used for human consumption are sampled. The State must approve this reduction of the minimum number of samples in writing based on a request from the system or onsite verification by the State. States may specify sampling locations when a system is conducting reduced monitoring. The table is as follows:

After the State specifies the values for water quality control parameters under Sec.  141.82(f), the system shall monitor during each subsequent six-month monitoring period, with the first monitoring period to begin on the date the State specifies the optimal values under Sec.  141.82(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reduced monitoring. (i) A small or medium-size water system that meets the lead and copper action levels during each of two consecutive six-month monitoring periods may reduce the number of samples in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, and reduce the frequency of sampling to once per year. A small or medium water system collecting fewer than five samples as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, that meets the lead and copper action levels during each of two consecutive six-month monitoring periods may reduce the frequency of sampling to once per year. In no case can the system reduce the number of samples required below the minimum of one sample per available tap.

This sampling shall begin during the calendar year immediately following the end of the second consecutive six-month monitoring period. The State shall review monitoring, treatment, and other relevant information submitted by the water system in accordance with Sec.  141.90, and shall notify the system in writing when it determines the system is eligible to commence reduced monitoring pursuant to this paragraph. The State shall review, and where appropriate, revise its determination when the system submits new monitoring or treatment data, or when

other data relevant to the number and frequency of tap sampling becomes available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A small or medium-size water system that meets the lead and copper action levels during three consecutive years of monitoring may reduce the frequency of monitoring for lead and copper from annually to once every three years. Any water system that meets the lead action level and maintains the range of values for the water quality control parameters reflecting optimal corrosion control treatment specified by the State under Sec.  141.82(f) during three consecutive years of monitoring may reduce the frequency of monitoring from annually to once every three years if it receives written approval from the State. Samples collected once every three years shall be collected no later than every third calendar year. The State shall review monitoring, treatment, and other relevant information submitted by the water system in accordance with Sec.  141.90, and shall notify the system in writing when it determines the system is eligible to reduce the frequency of monitoring to once every three years. The State shall review, and where appropriate, revise its determination when the system submits new monitoring or treatment data, or when other data relevant to the number and frequency of tap sampling becomes available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A water system that reduces the number and frequency of sampling shall collect these samples from representative sites included in the pool of targeted sampling sites identified in paragraph (a) of this section.

Such a period shall be no longer than four consecutive months and must represent a time of normal operation where the highest levels of lead are most likely to occur. For a non-transient non-community water system that does not operate during the months of June through September, and for which the period of normal operation where the highest levels of lead are most likely to occur is not known, the State shall designate a period that represents a time of normal operation for the system. This sampling shall begin during the period approved or designated by the State in the calendar year immediately following the end of the second consecutive six-month monitoring period for systems initiating annual monitoring and during the three-year period following the end of the third consecutive calendar year of annual monitoring for systems initiating triennial monitoring.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Systems monitoring annually, that have been collecting samples during the months of June through September and that receive State approval to alter their sample collection period under paragraph (d)(4)(iv)(A) of this section, must collect their next round of samples during a time period that ends no later than 21 months after the previous round of sampling. Systems monitoring triennially that have been collecting samples during the months of June through September, and receive State approval to alter the sampling collection period as per paragraph (d)(4)(iv)(A) of this section, must collect their next round of samples during a time period that ends no later than 45 months after the previous round of sampling. Subsequent rounds of sampling must be collected annually or triennially, as required by this section. Small systems with waivers, granted pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, that have been collecting samples during the months of June through September and receive State approval to alter their sample collection period under paragraph (d)(4)(iv)(A) of this section must collect their next round of samples before the end of the 9-year period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Any water system that demonstrates for two consecutive 6-month monitoring periods that the tap water lead level computed under Sec.  141.80(c)(3) is less than or equal to 0.005 mg/L and the tap water copper level computed under Sec.  141.80(c)(3) is less than or equal

Such a system shall also conduct water quality parameter monitoring in accordance with Sec.  141.87(b), (c) or (d) (as appropriate) during the monitoring period in which it exceeded the action level. Any such system may resume annual monitoring for lead and copper at the tap at the reduced number of sites specified in paragraph (c) of this section after it has completed two subsequent consecutive six-month rounds of monitoring that meet the criteria of paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section and/or may resume triennial monitoring for lead and copper at the reduced number of sites after it demonstrates through subsequent rounds of monitoring that it meets the criteria of either paragraph (d)(4)(iii) or (d)(4)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A small or medium-size water system subject to reduced monitoring that exceeds the lead or copper action level shall resume sampling in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section and collect the number of samples specified for standard monitoring under paragraph (c) of this section. Such a system shall also conduct water quality parameter monitoring in accordance with Sec.  141.87(b), (c) or (d) (as appropriate) during the monitoring period in which it exceeded the action level. Any such system may resume annual monitoring for lead and copper at the tap at the reduced number of sites specified in paragraph (c) of this section after it has completed two subsequent consecutive six-month rounds of monitoring that meet the criteria of paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section and/or may resume triennial monitoring for lead and copper at the reduced number of sites after it demonstrates through subsequent rounds of monitoring that it meets the criteria of either paragraph (d)(4)(iii) or (d)(4)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any water system subject to the reduced monitoring frequency that fails to meet the lead action level during any four-month monitoring period or that fails to operate at or above the minimum value or within the range of values for the water quality parameters specified by the State under Sec.  141.82(f) for more than nine days in any six-month period specified in Sec.  141.87(d) shall conduct tap water sampling for lead and copper at the frequency specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, collect the number of samples specified for standard monitoring under paragraph (c) of this section, and shall resume monitoring for water quality parameters within the distribution system in accordance with Sec.  141.87(d). This standard tap water sampling shall begin no later than the six-month period beginning January 1 of the calendar year following the lead action level exceedance or water quality parameter excursion. Such a system may resume reduced monitoring for lead and copper at the tap and for water quality parameters within the distribution system under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The system may resume annual monitoring for lead and copper at the tap at the reduced number of sites specified in paragraph (c) of this section after it has completed two subsequent six-month rounds of monitoring that meet the criteria of paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section and the system has received written approval from the State that it is appropriate to resume reduced monitoring on an annual frequency.

The State must review and approve the addition of a new source or long-term change in water treatment before it is implemented by the water system. The State may require the system to resume sampling in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section and collect the number of samples specified for standard monitoring under paragraph (c) of this section or take other appropriate steps

such as increased water quality parameter monitoring or re-evaluation of its corrosion control treatment given the potentially different water quality considerations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Additional monitoring by systems.

A sample invalidated under this paragraph does not count toward determining lead or copper 90th percentile levels under Sec.  141.80(c)(3) or toward meeting the minimum monitoring requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The State may invalidate a lead or copper tap water sample at least if one of the following conditions is met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The laboratory establishes that improper sample analysis caused erroneous results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The State determines that the sample was taken from a site that did not meet the site selection criteria of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The sample container was damaged in transit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> There is substantial reason to believe that the sample was subject to tampering.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The system must report the results of all samples to the State and all supporting documentation for samples the system believes should be invalidated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To invalidate a sample under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the decision and the rationale for the decision must be documented in writing. States may not invalidate a sample solely on the grounds that a follow-up sample result is higher or lower than that of the original sample.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The water system must collect replacement samples for any samples invalidated under this section if, after the invalidation of one or more samples, the system has too few samples to meet the minimum requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. Any such replacement samples must be taken as soon as possible, but no later than 20 days after the date the State invalidates the sample or by the end of the applicable monitoring period, whichever occurs later. Replacement samples taken after the end of the applicable monitoring period shall not also be used to meet the monitoring requirements of a subsequent monitoring period. The replacement samples shall be taken at the same locations as the invalidated samples or, if that is not possible, at locations other than those already used for sampling during the monitoring period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Monitoring waivers for small systems. Any small system that meets the criteria of this paragraph may apply to the State to reduce the frequency of monitoring for lead and copper under this section to once every nine years (i.e., a ``full waiver'') if it meets all of the materials criteria specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section and all of the monitoring criteria specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. If State regulations permit, any small system that meets the criteria in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section only for lead, or only for copper, may apply to the State for a waiver to reduce the frequency of tap water monitoring to once every nine years for that contaminant only (i.e., a ``partial waiver'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Materials criteria. The system must demonstrate that its distribution system and service lines and all drinking water supply plumbing, including plumbing conveying drinking water within all residences and buildings connected to the system, are free of lead-containing materials and/or copper-containing materials, as those terms are defined in this paragraph, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Lead. To qualify for a full waiver, or a waiver of the tap water monitoring requirements for lead (i.e., a ``lead waiver''), the water system must provide certification and supporting documentation to the State that the system is free of all lead-containing materials, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> It contains no plastic pipes which contain lead plasticizers, or plastic service lines which contain lead plasticizers; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> It is free of lead service lines, lead pipes, lead soldered pipe joints, and leaded brass or bronze alloy fittings and fixtures, unless such fittings

and fixtures meet the specifications of any standard established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 300g-6(e) (SDWA section 1417(e)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Copper. To qualify for a full waiver, or a waiver of the tap water monitoring requirements for copper (i.e., a ``copper waiver''), the water system must provide certification and supporting documentation to the State that the system contains no copper pipes or copper service lines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Monitoring criteria for waiver issuance. The system must have completed at least one 6-month round of standard tap water monitoring for lead and copper at sites approved by the State and from the number of sites required by paragraph (c) of this section and demonstrate that the 90th percentile levels for any and all rounds of monitoring conducted since the system became free of all lead-containing and/or copper-containing materials, as appropriate, meet the following criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Lead levels. To qualify for a full waiver, or a lead waiver, the system must demonstrate that the 90th percentile lead level does not exceed 0.005 mg/L.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Copper levels. To qualify for a full waiver, or a copper waiver, the system must demonstrate that the 90th percentile copper level does not exceed 0.65 mg/L.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> State approval of waiver application. The State shall notify the system of its waiver determination, in writing, setting forth the basis of its decision and any condition of the waiver. As a condition of the waiver, the State may require the system to perform specific activities (e.g., limited monitoring, periodic outreach to customers to remind them to avoid installation of materials that might void the waiver) to avoid the risk of lead or copper concentration of concern in tap water. The small system must continue monitoring for lead and copper at the tap as required by paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(4) of this section, as appropriate, until it receives written notification from the State that the waiver has been approved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Monitoring frequency for systems with waivers. (i) A system with a full waiver must conduct tap water monitoring for lead and copper in accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section at the reduced number of sampling sites identified in paragraph (c) of this section at least once every nine years and provide the materials certification specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section for both lead and copper to the State along with the monitoring results. Samples collected every nine years shall be collected no later than every ninth calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A system with a full waiver must conduct tap water monitoring for lead and copper in accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section at the reduced number of sampling sites identified in paragraph (c) of this section at least once every nine years and provide the materials certification specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section for both lead and copper to the State along with the monitoring results. Samples collected every nine years shall be collected no later than every ninth calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A system with a partial waiver must conduct tap water monitoring for the waived contaminant in accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section at the reduced number of sampling sites specified in paragraph (c) of this section at least once every nine years and provide the materials certification specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section pertaining to the waived contaminant along with the monitoring results. Such a system also must continue to monitor for the non-waived contaminant in accordance with requirements of paragraph (d)(1) through (d)(4) of this section, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any water system with a full or partial waiver shall notify the State in writing in accordance with Sec.  141.90(a)(3) of any upcoming long-term change in treatment or addition of a new source, as described in that section. The State must review and approve the addition of a new source or long-term change in water treatment before it is implemented by the water system. The State has the authority to require the system to add or modify waiver conditions (e.g., require recertification that the system is free of lead-containing and/or copper-containing materials, require additional round(s) of monitoring), if it deems such modifications are necessary to address treatment or source water changes at the system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If a system with a full or partial waiver becomes aware that it is no longer free of lead-containing or copper-containing materials, as appropriate, (e.g., as a result of new construction or repairs), the system shall notify the State in writing no later than 60 days after becoming aware of such a change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Continued eligibility. If the system continues to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (g)(4) of this section, the waiver will be renewed automatically, unless any of the conditions listed in

paragraph (g)(5)(i) through (g)(5)(iii) of this section occurs. A system whose waiver has been revoked may re-apply for a waiver at such time as it again meets the appropriate materials and monitoring criteria of paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A system with a full waiver or a lead waiver no longer satisfies the materials criteria of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section or has a 90th percentile lead level greater than 0.005 mg/L.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A system with a full waiver or a copper waiver no longer satisfies the materials criteria of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section or has a 90th percentile copper level greater than 0.65 mg/L.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The State notifies the system, in writing, that the waiver has been revoked, setting forth the basis of its decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Requirements following waiver revocation. A system whose full or partial waiver has been revoked by the State is subject to the corrosion control treatment and lead and copper tap water monitoring requirements, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the system exceeds the lead and/or copper action level, the system must implement corrosion control treatment in accordance with the deadlines specified in Sec.  141.81(e), and any other applicable requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the system meets both the lead and the copper action level, the system must monitor for lead and copper at the tap no less frequently than once every three years using the reduced number of sample sites specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Pre-existing waivers. Small system waivers approved by the State in writing prior to April 11, 2000 shall remain in effect under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the system has demonstrated that it is both free of lead-containing and copper-containing materials, as required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section and that its 90th percentile lead levels and 90th percentile copper levels meet the criteria of paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the waiver remains in effect so long as the system continues to meet the waiver eligibility criteria of paragraph (g)(5) of this section. The first round of tap water monitoring conducted pursuant to paragraph (g)(4) of this section shall be completed no later than nine years after the last time the system has monitored for lead and copper at the tap.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the system has met the materials criteria of paragraph (g)(1) of this section but has not met the monitoring criteria of paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the system shall conduct a round of monitoring for lead and copper at the tap demonstrating that it meets the criteria of paragraph (g)(2) of this section no later than September 30, 2000. Thereafter, the waiver shall remain in effect as long as the system meets the continued eligibility criteria of paragraph (g)(5) of this section. The first round of tap water monitoring conducted pursuant to paragraph (g)(4) of this section shall be completed no later than nine years after the round of monitoring conducted pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
