                            <p class="depth0">The Administrator is authorized to provide for such public hearings  as he deems necessary to discharge the responsibility for action under  section 22 vested in him by Sec. Sec. 6.2 and 6.4(a). In view of the  need, however, for prompt action on requests for action under section  22, public hearings shall be held in connection with investigations  conducted under Sec. 6.4(a) only when the Administrator determines that  a public hearing is necessary to obtain supplementary information not  otherwise available. Any public hearing which is held shall be conducted  by representatives designated for the purpose by the Administrator;  shall be preceded by such public notice as, in the opinion of the  Administrator, will afford interested persons reasonable opportunity to  attend and present information; and minutes of the proceedings at such  hearing shall be obtained. Hearings shall be informal and technical  rules of evidence shall not apply. Such hearings are for the purpose of  obtaining information for the assistance of the Secretary. However, in  discharging his responsibilities under section 22, the Secretary is not  restricted to the information adduced at the hearings.</p>
