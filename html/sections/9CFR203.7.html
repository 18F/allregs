                                Sec. 203.7  Statement with respect to meat packer sales and purchase
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration  (Packers and Stockyards Programs) receives numerous complaints  concerning the failure or refusal of buyers to pay the full purchase  price for, or to accept delivery of, their purchases of meat and meat  food products and sellers failing to meet contractual specifications.  Most such complaints arise out of disputes concerning condition, grade,  weight, or shipping instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is believed that both seller and buyer should take the  following points into consideration when selling and buying meat and  meat food products:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Terms of shipment and time of arrival. Terms and conditions of  shipment and delivery should be specified in the contract and both  parties should understand fully all terms and conditions of the  contract. Any deviation from normal practices, such as a guaranty by the  shipper as to the date of arrival at destination, or a deviation from  the normal meaning of terms, should also be fully understood and made a  part of the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Quality and condition. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A seller has the responsibility of  making certain that the meat and meat food products shipped are in  accordance with the terms of the contract specifications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When a buyer believes that the shipment does not meet the terms  of the contract, he should immediately contact the seller or the  seller's agent and advise him of the nature of the complaint. This  affords the seller an opportunity to renegotiate the contract, to  personally inspect the meat or meat food products, or to have an  impartial party inspect or examine the meat or meat food products.  Inspection and examination service of this type is available nationally  through the USDA meat grading service and locally through various  impartial persons or agencies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> All terms of a transaction should be made clear in the  contract, whether written or verbal. If there is any chance of  misunderstanding, a written confirmation should be exchanged between the  parties. In any case where a contract dispute cannot be settled between  the parties and either party intends to file a complaint, such complaint  should be brought to the attention of the nearest Grain Inspection,  Packers and Stockyards Administration (Packers and Stockyards Programs)  area office as soon as possible. However, a concerted effort on the part  of both buyer and seller to negotiate clear and complete contracts will  greatly reduce misunderstandings which can result in the filing of  complaints with the Administration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration  (Packers and Stockyards Programs) has reason to believe that any packer  unjustifiably (1) has refused to pay the contractual price for meat or  meat food products purchased, (2) has refused to accept a shipment of  meat or meat food products, or (3) has failed to ship meat or meat food  products in accordance with the terms of the contract specifications,  consideration will be given to the issuance of a complaint charging the  packer with violation of section 202 of the Act. In the formal  administrative proceeding initiated by any such complaint, the Judicial  Officer of the Department will determine, upon the basis of the record  in the proceeding, whether the packer has violated the Act and should be  ordered to cease and desist from continuing such violation.  (Secs. 407(a), 4, 42 Stat. 169, 72 Stat. 1750; 7 U.S.C. 228(a).  Interprets or applies sec. 202, 42 Stat. 161 et seq., as amended; 7  U.S.C. 192)  [30 FR 14966, Dec. 3, 1965, as amended at 32 FR 7701, May 26, 1967]    Sec. Sec. 203.8-203.9  [Reserved]</p>
