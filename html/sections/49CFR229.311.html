The  notification shall provide a description of the product, and identify  the location where the complete SA documentation described in  Sec. 229.307, the testing records contained in Sec. 229.313, and the  training and qualification program described in Sec. 229.319 is  maintained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> FRA may review or audit the SA within 60 days of receipt of the  notification or anytime after the product is placed in use. If FRA has  not notified the railroad of its intent to review or audit the SA within  the 60-day period, the railroad may assume that FRA does not intend to  review or audit, and place the product in use. FRA reserves the right,  however, to conduct a review or audit at a later date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A railroad shall maintain and make available to FRA upon request  all railroad or vendor documentation used to demonstrate that the  product meets the safety requirements of the SA for the life-cycle of  the product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> After a product is placed in service, the railroad shall  maintain a database of all safety-relevant hazards encountered with the  product. The database shall include all hazards identified in the SA and  those that had not been previously identified in the SA. If the  frequency of the safety-relevant hazards exceeds the threshold set forth  in the SA, then the railroad shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Report the inconsistency by mail, facsimile, email, or hand  delivery to the Director, Office of Safety Assurance and Compliance,  FRA, 1200 New Jersey Ave. SE., Mail Stop 25, Washington, DC 20590,  within 15 days of discovery;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Take immediate countermeasures to reduce the frequency of the  safety-relevant hazard(s) below the threshold set forth in the SA; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide a final report to FRA's Director, Office of Safety  Assurance and Compliance, on the results of the analysis and  countermeasures taken to   reduce the frequency of the safety-relevant hazard(s) below the  calculated probability of failure threshold set forth in the SA when the  problem is resolved. For hazards not identified in the SA the threshold  shall be exceeded at one occurrence.</p>
