                            <p class="depth0">This subpart prescribes requirements, in addition to those contained  in parts 107, 171, 172, 173 and 178 of this subchapter, applicable to  any person responsible for the continuing qualification, maintenance, or  periodic retesting of an IBC. The following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Remanufactured IBCs are metal, rigid plastic or composite IBCs  produced as a UN type from a non-UN type, or are converted from one UN  design type to another UN design type. Remanufactured IBCs are subject  to the same requirements of this subchapter that apply to new IBCs of  the same type (also see Sec. 178.801(c)(1) of this subchapter for design  type definition).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Repaired IBCs are metal, rigid plastic or composite IBCs that,  as a result of impact or for any other cause (such as corrosion,  embrittlement or other evidence of reduced strength as compared to the  design type), are restored so as to conform to the design type and to be  able to withstand the design type tests. For the purposes of this  subchapter, the replacement of the rigid inner receptacle of a composite  IBC with one from the original manufacturer is considered a repair.  Routine maintenance of IBCs (see definition in paragraph (c) of this  section) is not considered repair. The bodies of rigid plastic IBCs and  the inner receptacles of composite IBCs are not repairable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Routine maintenance of IBCs is the routine performance on:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Metal, rigid plastic or composite IBCs of operations such as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Cleaning;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Removal and reinstallation or replacement of body closures  (including associated gaskets), or of service equipment conforming to  the original manufacturer's specifications provided that the  leaktightness of the IBC is verified; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Restoration of structural equipment not directly performing a  hazardous material containment or discharge pressure retention function  so as to conform to the design type (for example, the straightening of  legs or lifting attachments), provided the containment function of the  IBC is not affected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Plastics or textile flexible IBCs of operations, such as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Cleaning; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Replacement of non-integral components, such as non-integral  liners and closure ties, with components conforming to the original  manufacturer's specification; provided that these operations do not  adversely affect the containment function of the flexible IBC or alter  the design type.  [68 FR 45042, July 31, 2003, as amended at 69 FR 76186, Dec. 20, 2004;  76 FR 3389, Jan. 19, 2011]</p>
