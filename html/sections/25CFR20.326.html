                                Sec. 20.326  Does Burial Assistance cover transportation costs?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Transportation costs directly associated with burials are normally a  part of the established burial rate. If a provider adds an additional  transportation charge to the burial rate because of extenuating  circumstances, the social services worker can pay the added charge. To  do this, the social services worker must ensure and document in the case  plan that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The charges are reasonable and equitable;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The deceased was an eligible indigent Indian who was socially,  culturally, and economically affiliated with his or her tribe; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The deceased resided in the service area for at least the last 6  consecutive months of his/her life.</p><p class="depth2">Disaster Assistance</p>
