                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Imposition of tax--(1) In general. Section 4051(a)(1) imposes a tax on the first retail sale (as defined in Sec. 145.4052-1(a)) of the following articles (including in each case parts or accessories therefor sold on or in connection therewith or with the sale thereof):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 4051(a)(1) imposes a tax on the first retail sale (as defined in Sec. 145.4052-1(a)) of the following articles (including in each case parts or accessories therefor sold on or in connection therewith or with the sale thereof):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Automobile truck chassis and bodies;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Truck trailer and semitrailer chassis and bodies; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Tractors of the kind chiefly used for highway transportation in combination with a trailer or semitrailer.
A sale of an automobile truck, truck trailer or semitrailer, shall be considered to be a sale of a chassis and of a body enumerated in this paragraph (a)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special rule applicable to chassis and bodies. A chassis or body enumerated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is taxable under section 4051(a)(1) only if such chassis or body is sold for use as a component part of a highway vehicle (as defined in paragraph (d) of Sec. 48.4061(a)-1 (Regulations on Manufacturers and Retailers Excise Taxes)), which is an automobile truck, truck trailer or semitrailer, or a tractor of the kind chiefly used for highway transportation in combination with a trailer or semitrailer. Furthermore, a chassis or body which is not enumerated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is not taxable under section 4051(a)(1) even though such chassis or body is used as a component part of a highway vehicle (e.g., a chassis or body of a passenger automobile). See paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section for the definitions of a tractor and truck. See paragraphs (e) (1) through (5) of Sec. 145.4052-1 for other provisions applicable to this section. See paragraph (f) of this section, relating to tax-free sales of non-highway vehicles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Parts or accessories sold on or in connection with chassis, bodies, etc. The tax applies in respect of parts or accessories sold on or in connection with or with the sale of the vehicles specified in section 4051(a)(1). Thus, for example, if at the time the article is sold by the retailer, the part or accessory has been ordered from the retailer, the part or accessory will be considered as sold in connection with and with the sale of the vehicle. The tax applies in such a case whether or not the parts or accessories are billed separately by the retailer. If a taxable chassis, body, or tractor is sold by the retailer, without parts or accessories which are considered equipment essential for the operation or appearance of the taxable article, the sale of such parts or accessories by the retailer to the purchaser of the taxable article will be considered, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have been made in connection with the sale of the taxable article even though they are shipped separately, at the same time or on a different date. For example, if a retailer sells to any person a chassis and the bumpers for such chassis, or sells a taxable tractor and the fifth wheel and attachments, the tax applies to such parts or accessories regardless of the method of billing or the time at which the shipments were made. Parts and accessories that are spares or replacements are not subject to tax.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Exclusions. No tax is imposed by section 4051(a)(1) on the sale of automobile truck chassis and bodies, suitable for use with a vehicle which has a gross vehicle weight of 33,000 pounds or less, or truck trailer and semitrailer chassis and bodies, suitable for use with a trailer or semitrailer which has a gross vehicle weight of 26,000 pounds or less. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(4) the term suitable for use means practical and commercial fitness for such use. A chassis or body possesses practical fitness for use with a vehicle if it performs its intended function up to a generally acceptable standard of efficiency with the vehicle, and a chassis or body possesses commercial fitness for use with a vehicle if it is generally available for use with the vehicle at a price that is reasonably competitive with other articles that may be used for the same purpose. Thus, a truck chassis which is suitable for use with a vehicle having a gross vehicle weight of 33,000 pounds or less, is not subject to the tax imposed by section 4051(a)(1) regardless of the body actually mounted thereon. A truck trailer or semitrailer chassis suitable for use with a vehicle having a gross vehicle weight of 26,000 pounds or less, is not subject to tax regardless of the body actually mounted thereon. Where an exempt body is mounted on a taxable chassis, or a taxable body is mounted on an exempt chassis, the taxable chassis or body, as the case may be, nevertheless remains subject to such tax, if the resulting vehicle is a highway vehicle as defined in Sec. 48.4061(a)-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rate of tax. With respect to the articles enumerated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the rate of tax imposed by section 4051(a)(1) is 12 percent of the price for which the article is sold on or after April 1, 1983. See paragraph (d) of this section relating to vehicles on which a 10 percent tax was imposed under section 4061(a)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Separate purchase of truck or trailer and parts and accessories therefor--(1) In general. If the owner, lessee, or operator of any vehicle, which contains an article taxable under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, installs (or causes to be installed) any part or accessory on such vehicle, and such installation is not later than 6 months after the date such vehicle (as it contains such article) was first placed in service, section 4051(b)(1) imposes a tax on such installation equal to 12 percent of the price of such part or accessory and its installation. For purposes of the tax imposed by section 4051(b)(1) and this paragraph (c)(1) the term ``parts and accessories'' does not include those parts and accessories which were previously exempt from tax under sections 4061(b) (1) and (2) as in effect prior to January 7, 1983. Thus, for example, articles of general use are exempt from tax. See Sec. 48.4061(b)-2 (b). See paragraphs (d) (1) through (4) of Sec. 145.4052-1 for determination of price.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. If the owner, lessee, or operator of any vehicle, which contains an article taxable under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, installs (or causes to be installed) any part or accessory on such vehicle, and such installation is not later than 6 months after the date such vehicle (as it contains such article) was first placed in service, section 4051(b)(1) imposes a tax on such installation equal to 12 percent of the price of such part or accessory and its installation. For purposes of the tax imposed by section 4051(b)(1) and this paragraph (c)(1) the term ``parts and accessories'' does not include those parts and accessories which were previously exempt from tax under sections 4061(b) (1) and (2) as in effect prior to January 7, 1983. Thus, for example, articles of general use are exempt from tax. See Sec. 48.4061(b)-2 (b). See paragraphs (d) (1) through (4) of Sec. 145.4052-1 for determination of price.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Placed in service. For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a vehicle shall be considered placed in service on the date on which the owner of the vehicle took actual possession of the vehicle. This date can be established by the delivery ticket signed by the owner or other comparable document indicating delivery to and acceptance by the owner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exceptions. The tax imposed by section 4051(b)(1) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall not apply if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The part or accessory intalled is a replacement part or accessory, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The aggregate price of the parts and accessories (and their installation) described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to any vehicle does not exceed $200.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, a part is a replacement part, regardless of when it is ordered, if its use with a vehicle is as a replacement for a part on such vehicle. For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the term aggregate price of parts and accessories (and their installation) refers to all purchases and installation charges, not including replacement parts and accessories, made with respect to a vehicle within the 6 month period provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If the aggregate price of parts and accessories (and their installation) during the 6 month period exceeds $200, the tax imposed under section 4051(b)(1) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall apply to the cost of all parts and accessories (and their installation) during such period. For example, a vehicle is purchased and placed in service on July 1, 1983. On August 1, 1983, the owner purchases and has installed parts and accessories at a cost of $150. On September 1, 1983, the owner purchases and has installed parts and accessories at a cost of $300. On September 1, 1983 a tax of $54 will be imposed (12 percent x $450). Any costs of additional parts and accessories installed with respect to the vehicle before January 1, 1984 (and the cost of installation) will also be subject to the 12 percent tax.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transitional rule. In the case of an article taxable under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, on which a tax was imposed under section 4061(a)(1), the rate of tax set forth in paragraph (b) shall be applied by substituting ``2 percent'' for ``12 percent.'' For example, if a manufacturer sells a tractor to a dealer on February 1, 1983, for $20,000 (which includes the Federal excise tax), for which a 10 percent tax was paid, and the dealer sells the tractor on April 10, 1983 for $25,000, a tax of 2 percent will be imposed on the $25,000 sales price. See paragraphs (d) (1) through (4) of Sec. 145.4052-1 relating to determination of price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tractor. (i) The term ``tractor'' means a highway vehicle primarily designed to tow a vehicle, such as a trailer or semitrailer, but does not carry cargo on the same chassis as the engine. A vehicle equipped with air brakes and/or towing package will be presumed to be primarily designed as a tractor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The term ``tractor'' means a highway vehicle primarily designed to tow a vehicle, such as a trailer or semitrailer, but does not carry cargo on the same chassis as the engine. A vehicle equipped with air brakes and/or towing package will be presumed to be primarily designed as a tractor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An incomplete chassis cab shall be treated as a tractor if it is equipped with one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A device for supplying pressure from the chassis cab to the brake system (air or hydraulic) of the towed vehicle;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A mechanism for protecting the chassis cab brake system from the effects of a loss of pressure in the brake system of the towed vehicle;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A control linking the brake system of the chassis to the brake system of the towed vehicle;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> A control in the cab for operating the towed vehicle's brakes independently of the chassis cab's brakes; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Any other equipment designed to make it suitable for use as a tractor.
An incomplete chassis cab which is not equipped with any of the devices set forth in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) (A) through (E) of this section shall be treated as a truck if the purchaser certifies in writing that the vehicle will not be equipped for use as a tractor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Truck. The term ``truck'' refers to a highway vehicle that is primarily designed to transport its load on the same chassis as the engine even if it is also equipped to tow a vehicle, such as a trailer or semitrailer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Gross vehicle weight. (i) For purposes of this section the term ``gross vehicle weight'' means the maximum total weight of a loaded vehicle. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (e)(3) (ii) through (v) of this section, such maximum total weight shall be the gross vehicle weight rating of the article as specified by the manufacturer or established by the seller of the completed article, unless the Commissioner finds that such rating is unreasonable in light of the facts and circumstances in a particular case.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of this section the term ``gross vehicle weight'' means the maximum total weight of a loaded vehicle. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (e)(3) (ii) through (v) of this section, such maximum total weight shall be the gross vehicle weight rating of the article as specified by the manufacturer or established by the seller of the completed article, unless the Commissioner finds that such rating is unreasonable in light of the facts and circumstances in a particular case.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A seller must specify or establish a weight rating for each chassis, body, or vehicle sold on or after April 1, 1983 if such article requires no additional manufacture other than (A) the addition of readily attachable articles, such as tire or rim assemblies or minor accessories, (B) the performance of minor finishing operations, such as painting, or (C) in the case of a chassis, the addition of a body. If an article is specially equipped to the purchaser's specifications, such specifications may be used to establish the gross vehicle weight of the article.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A seller shall maintain a record of the gross vehicle weight rating of each truck, trailer and semitrailer sold and excluded from the tax imposed by section 4051(a)(1) by reason of sections 4051(a) (2), (3) and paragraphs (e)(3) (i) through (v) of this section. For this purpose, a record of the serial number of each such article shall be treated as a record of the gross vehicle weight rating of the article if such rating is indicated by the serial number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If (A) the seller's rating indicated in a label or identifying device affixed to an article, (B) the rating set forth in the sales invoice or warranty agreement, and (C) the advertised rating for that article (or two or more identical articles) are inconsistent, the highest of such ratings will be considered to be the seller's gross vehicle weight rating specified or established for purposes of the tax imposed by section 4051(a)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The seller's gross vehicle weight rating must take into account, among other things, the strength of the chassis frame and the axle capacity and placement. The Commissioner may exclude from the gross vehicle weight rating any readily attachable parts to the extent the Commissioner finds that the use of such parts in computing the gross vehicle weight rating is unreasonable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Tax-free sales. With respect to tax-free sales of a chassis or body for use as a component of a vehicle other than a highway vehicle, similar provisions to paragraphs (e)(2) (ii), (iii), and (iv) of Sec. 48.4061(a)-1 shall apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Effective date. The provisions of this section shall be effective for articles sold on or after April 1, 1983.
