                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If, after making final payment in accordance with Sec. 240.6, Treasury determines that any guarantor has breached a presentment guarantee listed in Sec. 240.4, the guarantor shall be liable to Treasury for the full amount of the check payment. Treasury may reclaim the amount of the check payment from any such guarantor prior to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The end of the 1-year period beginning on the date that a check is processed for payment by a Federal Reserve Processing Center; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The expiration of the 180-day period beginning on the close of the period described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section if a timely claim under 31 U.S.C. 3702 is presented to the certifying agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Treasury will not reclaim on a check that bears a forged or unauthorized drawer's signature unless it has evidence that the reclamation debtor had knowledge of the forged or unauthorized drawer's signature.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Treasury will not reclaim on a counterfeit check unless the reclamation debtor has failed to make all reasonable efforts to ensure that a check is an authentic check and not a counterfeit check. Guidance on the key security features found on U.S. Treasury checks is available on the Fiscal Service website at: http://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/checkclaims/check--security--new.pdf. Institutions may contact the Fiscal Service Questioned Documents Branch at (202) 874-7640 for additional information about these security features or to request training.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reclamation debts are due to be paid upon receipt of the reclamation by the reclamation debtor. Interest, penalties, and administrative costs associated with unpaid balances will accrue as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interest. Treasury will assess interest on the unpaid principal of the reclamation debt beginning on the 61st day following the reclamation date, and will calculate interest based on the rate published annually by Treasury in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717. Interest will continue to accrue until the full amount of the reclamation is paid or Treasury determines that payment is not required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Penalties. Treasury will assess a penalty beginning on the 91st day following the reclamation date. The penalty will be assessed in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717 on the unpaid principal of the reclamation debt, and will continue to accrue until the full amount of the reclamation debt is paid or Treasury determines that payment is not required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Administrative costs. Treasury will assess administrative costs associated with the unpaid reclamation debt beginning on the 61st day following the reclamation date. Administrative costs will continue to accrue until the full amount of the reclamation debt is paid or Treasury determines that payment is not required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If Treasury is unable to fully collect a reclamation debt from a reclamation debtor, after pursuing all appropriate means of collection (including, but not limited to, administrative offset in accordance with Sec. 240.10 and Treasury Check Offset in accordance with Sec. 240.11), Treasury will discharge the unpaid reclamation debt. See 31 CFR 903.5 (Discharge of indebtedness; reporting requirements). Treasury or the certifying agency will report the amount of the unpaid reclamation debt to the Internal Revenue Service in accordance with the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6050P and 26 CFR 1.6050P-1.</p>
