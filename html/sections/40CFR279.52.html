                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Preparedness and prevention. Owners and operators of used oil  processing and re-refining facilities must comply with the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Maintenance and operation of facility. Facilities must be  maintained and operated to minimize the possibility of a fire,  explosion, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of used oil to  air, soil, or surface water which could threaten human health or the  environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> through (iv) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An internal communications or alarm system capable of providing  immediate emergency instruction (voice or signal) to facility personnel;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A device, such as a telephone (immediately available at the  scene of operations) or a hand-held two-way radio, capable of summoning  emergency assistance from local police departments, fire departments, or  State or local emergency response teams;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Portable fire extinguishers, fire control equipment (including  special extinguishing equipment, such as that using foam, inert gas, or  dry chemicals), spill control equipment and decontamination equipment;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Water at adequate volume and pressure to supply water hose  streams, or foam producing equipment, or automatic sprinklers, or water  spray systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Testing and maintenance of equipment. All facility  communications or alarm systems, fire protection equipment, spill  control equipment, and decontamination equipment, where required, must  be tested and maintained as necessary to assure its proper operation in  time of emergency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Access to communications or alarm system. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whenever used oil  is being poured, mixed, spread, or otherwise handled, all personnel  involved in the operation must have immediate access to an internal  alarm or emergency communication device, either directly or through  visual or voice contact with another employee, unless such a device is  not required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If there is ever just one employee on the premises while the  facility is operating, the employee must have immediate access to a  device, such as a telephone (immediately available at the scene of  operation) or a hand-held two-way radio, capable of summoning external  emergency assistance, unless such a device is not required in paragraph  (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Required aisle space. The owner or operator must maintain aisle  space to allow the unobstructed movement of personnel, fire protection  equipment, spill control equipment, and decontamination equipment to any  area of facility operation in an emergency, unless aisle space is not  needed for any of these purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Arrangements with local authorities. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator  must attempt to make the following arrangements, as appropriate for the  type of used oil handled at the facility and the potential need for the  services of these organizations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Arrangements to familiarize police, fire departments, and  emergency response teams with the layout of the facility, properties of  used oil handled at the facility and associated hazards, places where  facility personnel would normally be working, entrances to roads inside  the facility, and possible evacuation routes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Where more than one police and fire department might respond to  an emergency, agreements designating   primary emergency authority to a specific police and a specific fire  department, and agreements with any others to provide support to the  primary emergency authority;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Agreements with State emergency response teams, emergency  response contractors, and equipment suppliers; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Arrangements to familiarize local hospitals with the properties  of used oil handled at the facility and the types of injuries or  illnesses which could result from fires, explosions, or releases at the  facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where State or local authorities decline to enter into such  arrangements, the owner or operator must document the refusal in the  operating record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Contingency plan and emergency procedures. Owners and operators  of used oil processing and re-refining facilities must comply with the  following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Purpose and implementation of contingency plan. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each owner  or operator must have a contingency plan for the facility. The  contingency plan must be designed to minimize hazards to human health or  the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non- sudden release of used oil to air, soil, or surface water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of the plan must be carried out immediately  whenever there is a fire, explosion, or release of used oil which could  threaten human health or the environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Content of contingency plan. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The contingency plan must  describe the actions facility personnel must take to comply with  paragraphs (b) (1) and (6) of this section in response to fires,  explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of used oil to  air, soil, or surface water at the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the owner or operator has already prepared a Spill  Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan in accordance with  part 112 of this chapter, or part 1510 of chapter V of this title, or  some other emergency or contingency plan, the owner or operator need  only amend that plan to incorporate used oil management provisions that  are sufficient to comply with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The plan must describe arrangements agreed to by local police  departments, fire departments, hospitals, contractors, and State and  local emergency response teams to coordinate emergency services,  pursuant to paragraph (a)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The plan must list names, addresses, and phone numbers (office  and home) of all persons qualified to act as emergency coordinator (see  paragraph (b)(5) of this section), and this list must be kept up to  date. Where more than one person is listed, one must be named as primary  emergency coordinator and others must be listed in the order in which  they will assume responsibility as alternates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The plan must include a list of all emergency equipment at the  facility (such as fire extinguishing systems, spill control equipment,  communications and alarm systems (internal and external), and  decontamination equipment), where this equipment is required. This list  must be kept up to date. In addition, the plan must include the location  and a physical description of each item on the list, and a brief outline  of its capabilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The plan must include an evacuation plan for facility personnel  where there is a possibility that evacuation could be necessary. This  plan must describe signal(s) to be used to begin evacuation, evacuation  routes, and alternate evacuation routes (in cases where the primary  routes could be blocked by releases of used oil or fires).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Copies of contingency plan. A copy of the contingency plan and  all revisions to the plan must be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Maintained at the facility; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Submitted to all local police departments, fire departments,  hospitals, and State and local emergency response teams that may be  called upon to provide emergency services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Amendment of contingency plan. The contingency plan must be  reviewed, and immediately amended, if necessary, whenever:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Applicable regulations are revised;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The plan fails in an emergency;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The facility changes--in its design, construction, operation,  maintenance, or other circumstances--in a way that materially increases  the potential for fires, explosions, or releases   of used oil, or changes the response necessary in an emergency;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The list of emergency coordinators changes; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The list of emergency equipment changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Emergency coordinator. At all times, there must be at least one  employee either on the facility premises or on call (i.e., available to  respond to an emergency by reaching the facility within a short period  of time) with the responsibility for coordinating all emergency response  measures. This emergency coordinator must be thoroughly familiar with  all aspects of the facility's contingency plan, all operations and  activities at the facility, the location and characteristic of used oil  handled, the location of all records within the facility, and facility  layout. In addition, this person must have the authority to commit the  resources needed to carry out the contingency plan.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance: The emergency coordinator's responsibilities are more  fully spelled out in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. Applicable  responsibilities for the emergency coordinator vary, depending on  factors such as type and variety of used oil handled by the facility,  and type and complexity of the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Emergency procedures. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whenever there is an imminent or  actual emergency situation, the emergency coordinator (or the designee  when the emergency coordinator is on call) must immediately:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Activate internal facility alarms or communication systems,  where applicable, to notify all facility personnel; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Notify appropriate State or local agencies with designated  response roles if their help is needed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whenever there is a release, fire, or explosion, the emergency  coordinator must immediately identify the character, exact source,  amount, and areal extent of any released materials. He may do this by  observation or review of facility records or manifests and, if  necessary, by chemical analyses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Concurrently, the emergency coordinator must assess possible  hazards to human health or the environment that may result from the  release, fire, or explosion. This assessment must consider both direct  and indirect effects of the release, fire, or explosion (e.g., the  effects of any toxic, irritating, or asphyxiating gases that are  generated, or the effects of any hazardous surface water run-offs from  water or chemical agents used to control fire and heat-induced  explosions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the emergency coordinator determines that the facility has  had a release, fire, or explosion which could threaten human health, or  the environment, outside the facility, he must report his findings as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If his assessment indicated that evacuation of local areas may  be advisable, he must immediately notify appropriate local authorities.  He must be available to help appropriate officials decide whether local  areas should be evacuated; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> He must immediately notify either the government official  designated as the on-scene coordinator for the geographical area (in the  applicable regional contingency plan under part 1510 of this title), or  the National Response Center (using their 24-hour toll free number 800/ 424-8802). The report must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Name and telephone number of reporter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Name and address of facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Time and type of incident (e.g., release, fire);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Name and quantity of material(s) involved, to the extent known;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The extent of injuries, if any; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The possible hazards to human health, or the environment,  outside the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> During an emergency, the emergency coordinator must take all  reasonable measures necessary to ensure that fires, explosions, and  releases do not occur, recur, or spread to other used oil or hazardous  waste at the facility. These measures must include, where applicable,  stopping processes and operation, collecting and containing released  used oil, and removing or isolating containers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> If the facility stops operation in response to a fire,  explosion, or release, the emergency coordinator must monitor for leaks,  pressure buildup, gas generation, or ruptures in valves,   pipes, or other equipment, wherever this is appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Immediately after an emergency, the emergency coordinator must  provide for recycling, storing, or disposing of recovered used oil,  contaminated soil or surface water, or any other material that results  from a release, fire, or explosion at the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The emergency coordinator must ensure that, in the affected  area(s) of the facility:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> No waste or used oil that may be incompatible with the released  material is recycled, treated, stored, or disposed of until cleanup  procedures are completed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All emergency equipment listed in the contingency plan is  cleaned and fit for its intended use before operations are resumed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The owner or operator must notify the Regional Administrator,  and appropriate State and local authorities that the facility is in  compliance with paragraphs (b)(6)(viii)(A) and (B) of this section  before operations are resumed in the affected area(s) of the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> The owner or operator must note in the operating record the  time, date and details of any incident that requires implementing the  contingency plan. Within 15 days after the incident, he must submit a  written report on the incident to the Regional Administrator. The report  must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Name, address, and telephone number of the owner or operator;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Name, address, and telephone number of the facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Date, time, and type of incident (e.g., fire, explosion);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Name and quantity of material(s) involved;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The extent of injuries, if any;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> An assessment of actual or potential hazards to human health or  the environment, where this is applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Estimated quantity and disposition of recovered material that  resulted from the incident.
