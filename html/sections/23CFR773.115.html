                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A State that intends to renew its participation in the Program must notify the appropriate Operating Administration(s) at least 12 months before the expiration of the MOU.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prior to requesting renewal, the State must coordinate with the appropriate Operating Administration(s) to determine if significant changes have occurred or new assignment responsibilities are being sought that would warrant statewide notice and opportunity for public comment prior to the State's submission of the renewal package. The Operating Administration is responsible for making the final decision on whether the State should engage in statewide notification prior to its submittal. The Operating Administration will make this determination based on the magnitude of the change(s) in the information and/or circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The renewal package must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Describe changes to the information submitted in the initial Program application;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide up-to-date certifications required in Sec. 773.109(a)(6) and (7) of this part for the applicable Operating Administration(s), if up-to-date certifications are needed or if the necessary State laws have termination dates that would occur before the end of a renewal period;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide evidence of the statewide public notification, if one was required under paragraph (b) of this section, and include copies of all comments received, responses to substantive comments, and note the changes, if any, that were made to the renewal package in response to the comments; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Include the State Governor's (or in the case of District of Columbia, the Mayor's) signature approving the renewal package. For the Secretary's responsibilities with respect to highway projects, the top ranking transportation official in the State who is charged with responsibility for highway construction may sign the renewal package instead of the Governor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A State must submit a renewal package no later than 180 days prior to the expiration of the MOU.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Operating Administration(s) may request that the State provide additional information to address any deficiencies in the renewal application or to provide clarifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Operating Administration(s) must provide Federal Register notification and solicit public comment on the renewal request and must consider comments received before approving the State's renewal application. Materials made available for this public review will include the State's original application, the renewal package, a draft of the renewal MOU, a list of responsibilities sought by the State that the Operating Administration proposes to retain, and auditing and monitoring reports developed as part of the Program. The notification may be a joint notification if two or more Operating Administrations are involved in the assignment for a project or a class of projects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In determining whether to approve the State's renewal request, the Operating Administration will take into account the renewal package, comments received if an opportunity for public comments was provided in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, the auditing and monitoring reports, and the State's overall performance in the Program. If the Operating Administration(s) approves the renewal request, then the Operating Administration(s) will invite the State to execute the renewal MOU. The Administrator for the appropriate Operating Administration will be responsible for approving the application and executing the renewal MOU on behalf of the Operating Administration. The renewal MOU must have a term of not more than 5 years, and the State must publish it on the State's DOT Web site and other relevant State Web site(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> At the discretion of the Operating Administration, a State may retain temporarily its assigned and assumed responsibilities under a MOU after the expiration of the MOU, where the relevant Operating Administration(s) determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State made a timely submission of a complete renewal application in accordance with the provisions of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Operating Administration(s) determines that all reasonable efforts have been made to achieve a timely execution of the renewal; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Operating Administration(s) determines that it is in the best interest of the public to grant the continuance.</p>
