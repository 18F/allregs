                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. HUD shall determine whether a GSE shall receive full, partial, or no credit for a transaction toward achievement of any of the housing goals. In this determination, HUD will consider whether a transaction or activity of the GSE is substantially equivalent to a mortgage purchase and either creates a new market or adds liquidity to an existing market, provided however that such mortgage purchase actually fulfills the GSE's purposes and is in accordance with its Charter Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Not counted. The following transactions or activities shall not count toward achievement of any of the housing goals and shall not be included in the denominator in calculating either GSE's performance under the housing goals:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Equity investments in housing development projects;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Purchases of State and local government housing bonds except as provided in 81.16(c)(8);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Purchases of non-conventional mortgages except:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Where such mortgages are acquired under a risk-sharing arrangement with a Federal agency;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Mortgages insured under HUD's Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (``HECM'') insurance program, 12 U.S.C. 1715z-20; mortgages guaranteed under the Rural Housing Service's Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program, 42 U.S.C. 1472; mortgages on properties on lands insured under FHA's Section 248 program, 12 U.S.C. 1715z-13, or HUD's Section 184 program, 12 U.S.C. 1515z-13a, or Title VI of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996, 25 U.S.C. 4191-4195; and mortgages with expiring assistance contracts as defined at 42 U.S.C. 1737f;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Mortgages under other mortgage programs involving Federal guarantees, insurance or other Federal obligation where the Department determines in writing that the financing needs addressed by the particular mortgage program are not well served and that the mortgage purchases under such program should count under the housing goals, provided the GSE submits documentation to HUD that supports eligibility and that HUD makes such a determination, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> As provided in Sec. 81.14(e)(3)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Commitments to buy mortgages at a later date or time;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Options to acquire mortgages;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Rights of first refusal to acquire mortgages;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Any interests in mortgages that the Secretary determines, in writing, shall not be treated as interests in mortgages;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Mortgage purchases to the extent they finance any dwelling units that are secondary residences; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Single family mortgage refinancings that result from conversion of balloon notes to fully amortizing notes, if the GSE already owns or has an interest in the balloon note at the time conversion occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Any combination of factors in paragraphs (b)(1) through (9) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Other special rules. Subject to HUD's primary determination of whether a GSE shall receive full, partial, or no credit for a transaction toward achievement of any of the housing goals as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the following supplemental rules apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Credit enhancements. (i) Dwelling units financed under a credit enhancement entered into by a GSE shall be treated as mortgage purchases and count toward achievement of the housing goals when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The GSE provides a specific contractual obligation to ensure timely payment of amounts due under a mortgage or mortgages financed by the issuance of housing bonds (such bonds may be issued by any entity, including a State or local housing finance agency);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The GSE assumes a credit risk in the transaction substantially equivalent to the risk that would have been assumed by the GSE if it had securitized the mortgages financed by such bonds; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Such dwelling units otherwise qualify under this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When a GSE provides a specific contractual obligation to ensure timely payment of amounts due under any mortgage originally insured by a public purpose mortgage insurance entity or fund, the GSE may, on a case-by-case basis, seek approval from the Secretary for such activities to count toward achievement of the housing goals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Real estate mortgage investment conduits (``REMICs''). (i) A GSE's purchase or guarantee of all or a portion of a REMIC shall be treated as a mortgage purchase and receive credit toward the achievement of the housing goals provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The underlying mortgages or mortgage-backed securities for the REMIC were not:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Previously counted toward any housing goal by the GSE; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The GSE has the information necessary to support counting the dwelling units financed by the REMIC, or that part of the REMIC purchased or guaranteed by the GSE, toward the achievement of a particular housing goal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For REMICs that meet the requirements in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section and for which the GSE purchased or guaranteed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The whole REMIC, all of the units financed by the REMIC shall be treated as a mortgage purchase and count toward achievement of the housing goals; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A portion of the REMIC, the GSE shall receive partial credit toward achievement of the housing goals. This credit shall be equal to the percentage of the REMIC purchased or guaranteed by the GSE (the dollar amount of the purchase or guarantee divided by the total dollar amount of the REMIC) multiplied by the number of dwelling units that would have counted toward the goal(s) if the GSE had purchased or guaranteed the whole REMIC. In calculating performance under the housing goals, the denominator shall include the number of dwelling units included in the whole REMIC multiplied by the percentage of the REMIC purchased or guaranteed by the GSE.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Risk-sharing. Mortgage purchases under risk-sharing arrangements between the GSEs and any Federal agency where the units would otherwise count toward achievement of the housing goal under which the GSE is responsible for a substantial amount (50 percent or more) of the risk shall be treated as mortgage purchases and count toward achievement of the housing goal or goals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Participations. Participations purchased by a GSE shall be treated as mortgage purchases and count toward the achievement of the housing goals, if the GSE's participation in the mortgage is 50 percent or more.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Cooperative housing and condominium projects. (i) The purchase of a mortgage on a cooperative housing unit (``a share loan'') or a condominium unit is a mortgage purchase. Such a purchase is counted toward achievement of a housing goal in the same manner as a mortgage purchase of single-family owner-occupied units, i.e., affordability is based on the income of the owner(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The purchase of a mortgage on a cooperative building (``a blanket loan'') or a condominium project is a mortgage purchase and shall count toward achievement of the housing goals. Where a GSE purchases both ``a blanket loan'' and mortgages for units in the same building (``share loans''), both the blanket loan and the share loan(s) are mortgage purchases and shall count toward achievement of the housing goals. Where a GSE purchases both a condominium project mortgage and mortgages on condominium dwelling units in the same project, both the condominium project mortgages and the mortgages on condominium dwelling units are mortgage purchases and shall count toward achievement of the housing goals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Seasoned mortgages. A GSE's purchase of a seasoned mortgage shall be treated as a mortgage purchase for purposes of these goals and shall be included in the numerator, as appropriate, and the denominator in calculating the GSE's performance under the housing goals, except where:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The GSE has already counted the mortgage under a housing goal applicable to 1993 or any subsequent year; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> HUD determines, based upon a written request by a GSE, that a seasoned mortgage or class of such mortgages should be excluded from the numerator and the denominator in order to further the purposes of the Special Affordable Housing Goal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Purchase of refinanced mortgages. Except as otherwise provided in this part, the purchase of a refinanced mortgage by a GSE is a mortgage purchase and shall count toward achievement of the housing goals to the extent the mortgage qualifies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Mortgage revenue bonds. (i) The purchase of a state or local mortgage revenue bond shall be treated as a mortgage purchase and units financed under such MRB shall count toward achievement of the goals where:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The MRB is to be repaid only from the principal and interest of the underlying mortgages originated with funds made available by the MRB; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The MRB is not a general obligation of a state or local government or agency or is not credit enchanced by any government or agency, third party guarantor or surety.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Dwelling units financed by a mortgage revenue bond meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section shall count toward a housing goal to the extent such dwelling units otherwise qualify under this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Expiring assistance contracts. In accordance with 12 U.S.C. 4565(a)(5), actions that assist in maintaining the affordability of assisted units in eligible multifamily housing projects with expiring contracts shall receive credit under the housing goals as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) and in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c)(1) through (c)(9) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For restructured (modified) multifamily mortgage loans with an expiring assistance contract where a GSE holds the loan in portfolio and facilitates modification of loan terms that results in lower debt service to the project's owner, the GSE shall receive full credit under any of the housing goals for which the units covered by the mortgage otherwise qualify.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where a GSE undertakes more than one action to assist a single project or where a GSE engages in an activity that it believes assists in maintaining the affordability of assisted units in eligible multifamily housing projects but which is not otherwise covered in paragraph (c)(9)(i) of this section, the GSE must submit the transaction to HUD for a determination on appropriate goals counting treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)-(11)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> HOEPA mortgages and mortgages with unacceptable terms and conditions. HOEPA mortgages and mortgages with unacceptable terms or conditions as defined in Sec. 81.2 will not receive credit toward any of the three housing goals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Mortgages contrary to good lending practices. The Secretary will monitor the practices and processes of the GSEs to ensure that they are not purchasing loans that are contrary to good lending practices as defined in Sec. 81.2. Based on the results of such monitoring, the Secretary may determine in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section that mortgages or categories of mortgages where a lender has not engaged in good lending practices will not receive credit toward the three housing goals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Seller dissolution option. (i) Mortgages acquired through transactions involving seller dissolution options shall be treated as mortgage purchases, and receive credit toward the achievement of the housing goals, only when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The terms of the transaction provide for a lockout period that prohibits the exercise of the dissolution option for at least one year from the date on which the transaction was entered into by the GSE and the seller of the mortgages; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The transaction is not dissolved during the one-year minimum lockout period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Secretary may grant an exception to the one-year minimum lockout period described in paragraph (c)(14)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, in response to a written request from an enterprise, if the Secretary determines that the transaction furthers the purposes of FHEFSSA and the GSE's charter act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (c)(14), ``seller dissolution option''

means an option for a seller of mortgages to the GSEs to dissolve or otherwise cancel a mortgage purchase agreement or loan sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> HUD review of transactions. HUD will determine whether a class of transactions counts as a mortgage purchase under the housing goals. If a GSE seeks to have a class of transactions counted under the housing goals that does not otherwise count under the rules in this part, the GSE may provide HUD detailed information regarding the transactions for evaluation and determination by HUD in accordance with this section. In making its determination, HUD may also request and evaluate additional information from a GSE with regard to how the GSE believes the transactions should be counted. HUD will notify the GSE of its determination regarding the extent to which the class of transactions may count under the goals.
