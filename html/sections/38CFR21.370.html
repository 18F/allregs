VA may authorize a veteran to travel at government expense within the regional territory of the VA field station of jurisdiction when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> VA determines that the travel is necessary in the discharge of the government's obligation to the veteran; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The veteran is instructed to travel for any of the following reasons:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To report to the chosen school or training facility for the purpose of starting training;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To report to a prospective employer-trainer for an interview prior to induction into training, when there is definite assurance in advance of approving the travel that, upon interview, the employer will start the veteran in training, if the employer finds the veteran acceptable, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To report to the chosen school for a personal interview prior to induction into training when:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The school requires the interview as a condition of admission,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> There is assurance before the travel is approved that the veteran's records (school, counseling, etc.) show he or she meets all basic requirements for induction under Sec. 21.282; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The veteran submits to the school a transcript of his or her high school credits and a transcript from any school he or she attended following high school.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> To report to a rehabilitation facility or sheltered workshop;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> To return to his or her home from the training or rehabilitation facility when:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Services are not available for a period of 30 days or more (including summer vacation periods), and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Travel from his or her home to the training or rehabilitation facility was at government expense;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> To return to the training or rehabilitation facility from his or her home, when:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The purpose of the travel is to continue the rehabilitation program, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Travel from the training or rehabilitation facility to the veteran's home was at government expense;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> To return to the point from which he or she was transported at government expense, upon being placed in ``discontinued'' or ``interrupted'' status for any reason, except abandonment of training by the veteran without good reason;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> To report to a place of prearranged satisfactory employment upon completion of vocational rehabilitation for the purpose of beginning work;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> To return to his or her home from the place of training following rehabilitation to the point of employability, when suitable employment is not available;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> To return from the place of training to the veteran's prior location, when VA could have approved travel to the place of training at government expense, but did not issue the necessary travel authorization; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> To report to a place to take a scheduled examination required to practice the trade or profession for which the veteran has been trained. This travel shall be limited to points within the state in which the veteran has pursued his or her training or, if the veteran returned to the state from which he or she was sent to pursue training, he or she may be sent at government expense to a place within that state to take the examination. If there is more than one place within the state at which the veteran may take the examination, travel shall be limited to the nearest place.
