                            <p class="depth0">When establishing drug testing programs, contractors who are parties to collective bargaining agreements will negotiate with employee representatives, as appropriate, under labor relations laws or negotiated agreements. Such negotiation, however, cannot change or alter the requirements of this rule because DOE security requirements themselves are non-negotiable under the security provisions of DOE contracts. Employees covered under collective bargaining agreements will not be subject to the provisions of this rule until those agreements have been modified, as necessary; provided, however, that if one year after commencement of negotiation the parties have failed to reach agreement, an impasse will be determined to have been reached and the contractor will unilaterally implement the requirements of this rule.</p>
