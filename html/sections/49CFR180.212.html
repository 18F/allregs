Approval is not required  for the following specific repairs:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The removal and replacement of a neck ring or foot ring on a DOT  3A, 3AA or 3B cylinder or a UN pressure receptacle that does not affect  a pressure part of the cylinder when the repair is performed by a repair  facility or a cylinder manufacturer of these types of cylinders. The  repair may be made by welding or brazing in conformance with the  original specification. After removal and before replacement, the  cylinder must be visually inspected and any defective cylinder must be  rejected. The heat treatment, testing and inspection of the repair must  be performed under the supervision of an inspector and must be performed  in accordance with the original specification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> External re-threading of DOT 3AX, 3AAX or 3T specification  cylinders or a UN pressure receptacle mounted in a MEGC; or the internal  re-threading of a DOT-3 series cylinder or a seamless UN pressure  receptacle when performed by a cylinder manufacturer of these types of  cylinders. The repair work must be performed under the supervision of an  independent inspection agency. Upon completion of the re-threading, the  threads must be gauged in accordance with Federal Standard H-28 or an  equivalent standard containing the same specification limits. The re- threaded cylinder must be stamped clearly and legibly with the words  ``RETHREAD'' on the shoulder, top head, or neck. No DOT specification  cylinder or UN cylinder may be re-threaded more than one time without  approval of the Associate Administrator.
