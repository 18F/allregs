                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Incident report. The discipline process starts when staff  witness or reasonably believe that you committed a prohibited act. A  staff member will issue you an incident report describing the incident  and the prohibited act(s) you are charged with committing. You will  ordinarily receive the incident report within 24 hours of staff becoming  aware of your involvement in the incident.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Investigation. After you receive an incident report, a Bureau  staff member will investigate it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information: The investigator will specifically inform you:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(A)</em> of the charge(s) against you; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(B)</em> that you may remain silent at all stages of the discipline  process, but that your silence may be used to draw an adverse inference  against you at any stage of the process. Your silence alone, however,  cannot be the basis for finding you committed the prohibited act(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Statement: When the investigator asks for your statement, you  may give an explanation of the incident, request any witnesses be  interviewed, or request that other evidence be obtained and reviewed.  However, the staff investigation of the incident report may be suspended  before requesting your statement if it is being investigated for  possible criminal prosecution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Informally resolving the incident report. The incident report  may be informally resolved at any stage of the disciplinary process,  except for prohibited acts in the Greatest and High severity levels, or  as otherwise required by law or these regulations. If the incident  report is informally resolved, it will be removed from your records.</p>
