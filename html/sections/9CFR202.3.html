Any interested person desiring to complain  of the lawfulness of any rate or charge made or proposed to be made for  any stockyard service furnished at a stockyard by a stockyard owner or  market agency, or rule, regulation or practice affecting any such rate  or charge, may file an informal complaint with the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Investigation. If there appears to be any reasonable ground for  doing so, the Administrator will investigate the matter complained of.  If the Administrator reasonably believes that there are not sufficient  facts to form the basis for further proceeding, the matter may be  dropped. If it is dropped, the person filing the informal complaint will  be informed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Status of person filing. A person filing an informal complaint  will be a party to a rate proceeding if the Administrator files such  person's informal complaint as a formal complaint, or if the Judge  permits such person to intervene upon written application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Formal complaint. A rate proceeding may be instituted only upon  filing of a formal complaint by the Administrator. A formal complaint  may be filed on the initiative of the Administrator, or on the basis of  an informal complaint, or by filing the informal complaint as a formal  complaint. A formal complaint filed by the Administrator, or a summary  thereof, will be published in the Federal Register, together with notice  of the time by which, and the place where, any interested person may  file a written request to be heard.</p>
