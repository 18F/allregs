The county committee shall provide measurement  service if the producer requests such service and pays the cost, except  that service shall not be provided to determine total acreage or  production of a crop when the request is made:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After the established final reporting date for the applicable  crop, unless a late filed report is accepted as provided in Sec.  718.103;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After the farm operator has furnished production evidence when  required for program administration purposes except as provided in this  subpart; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In connection with a late-filed report of acreage, unless there  is evidence of the crop's existence in the field and use made of the  crop, or the lack of the crop due to a disaster condition affecting the  crop.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The acreage requested to be measured by staking and referencing  shall not exceed the effective farm allotment for marketing quota crops  or acreage of a crop that is limited to a specific number of acres to  meet any program requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When a producer requests, pays for, and receives written notice  that measurement services have been furnished, the measured acreage  shall be guaranteed to be correct and used for all program purposes for  the current year even though an error is later discovered in the  measurement thereof, if the producer has taken action with an economic  significance based on the measurement service, and the entire crop  required for the farm was measured. If the producer has not taken action  with an economic significance based on the measurement service, the  producer shall be notified in writing that an error was discovered and  the nature and extent of such error. In such cases, the corrected  acreage will be used for determining program compliance for the current  year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When a measurement service reveals acreage in excess of the  permitted acreage and the allowable tolerance as defined in this part,  the producer must destroy the excess acreage and pay for FSA to verify  destruction, in order to keep the measurement service guarantee.</p>
