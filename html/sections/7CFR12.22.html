                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Predominance. Highly erodible land shall be considered to be  predominant on a field if either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 33.33 percent or more of the total field acreage is identified  as soil map units which are highly erodible; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 50 or more acres in such field are identified as soil map units  which are highly erodible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Modification of field boundaries. A person may request the  modification of field boundaries for the purpose of excluding highly  erodible land from a field. Such a request must be submitted to, and is  subject to the approval of, FSA. FSA shall use the technical  determination of NRCS in approving this request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Impact of changing field boundaries. When field boundaries are  changed to include areas of land that were included in a field that was  previously determined to be predominately highly erodible according to  paragraph (a) of this section, such areas shall continue to be subject  to the requirements for predominately highly erodible fields, except as  provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Small area of noncropland. Small areas of noncropland within or  adjacent to the boundaries of existing highly erodible crop fields such  as abandoned farmsteads, areas around filled or capped wells, rock  piles, trees, or brush which are converted to cropland are considered to  meet the requirement of Sec. 12.5(a)(2) if they are included in an   approved conservation plan for the entire highly erodible field.
