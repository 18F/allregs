Release of personal information to individuals under this part is not considered public release of the information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Make available to the individual to whom the record pertains all of the personal information contained in the system of records except where access may be denied pursuant to an exemption claimed for the system (see subpart F to this part). However, when the access provisions of this subpart are not available to the individual due to a claimed exemption, the request shall be processed to provide information that is disclosable pursuant to the DoD Freedom of Information Act program (see 32 CFR, part 286).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Individual requests for access. Individuals shall address requests for access to personal information in a system of records to the system manager or to the office designated in the DoD Component procedural rules or the system notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Verification of identity.

If the information sought is of a sensitive nature, additional identifying data may be required. An unsworn declaration under penalty of perjury (28 U.S.C. 1746, ``Unsworn Declaration under Penalty of Perjury'') or notarized signatures are acceptable as a means of proving the identity of the individual.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If an unsworn declaration is executed within the United States, its territories, possessions, or commonwealths, it shall read ``I declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

(1) Grant the individual access to the original record or an exact copy of the original record without any changes or deletions, except when deletions have been made in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section.

Such refusal of access is not considered a denial under the Privacy Act (see paragraph (a) of Sec. 310.18).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If records are provided the designated physician, but the physician declines or refuses to provide the records to the individual, the DoD Component is under an affirmative duty to take action to deliver the records to the individual by whatever means deemed appropriate. Such action should be taken expeditiously especially if there has been a significant delay between the time the records were furnished the physician and the decision by the physician not to release the records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Access to a minor's medical records may be granted to his or her parents or legal guardians. However, access is subject to the restrictions as set forth at paragraph C9.7.3 of DoD 6025.18-R.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> All members of the Military Services and all married persons are not considered minors regardless of age, and the parents of these individual do not have access to their medical records without written consent of the individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Access to information compiled in anticipation of civil action (see Sec. 310.27).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Non-Agency records. (1) Certain documents under the physical control of DoD personnel and used to assist them in performing official functions, are not considered ``Agency records'' within the meaning of this part. Uncirculated personal notes and records that are not disseminated or circulated to any person or organization (for example, personal telephone lists or memory aids) that are retained or discarded at the author's discretion and over which the Component exercises no direct control are not considered Agency records. However, if personnel are officially directed or encouraged, either in writing or orally, to maintain such records, they may become ``Agency records,'' and may be subject to this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certain documents under the physical control of DoD personnel and used to assist them in performing official functions, are not considered ``Agency records'' within the meaning of this part.

Such notes are an extension of the individual's memory. These notes, however, must be maintained and discarded at the discretion of the individual supervisor and not circulated to others. Any established requirement to maintain such notes (such as, written or oral directives, regulations, or command policy) may transform these notes into ``Agency records'' and they then must be made a part of a system of records. If the notes are circulated, they must be made a part of a system of records. Any action that gives personal notes the appearance of official Agency records is prohibited, unless the notes have been incorporated into a system of records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Relationship between the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) and the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552). Not all requesters are knowledgeable of the appropriate statutory authority to cite when requesting records. In some instances, they may cite neither Act, but will imply one or both Acts. The below guidelines are provided to ensure requesters are given the maximum amount of information as authorized under both statutes.

Conversely, if the records are required to be released under the FOIA, the Privacy Act does not bar disclosure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Requesters who seek records about themselves contained in a Privacy Act system of records, and who cite or imply only the Privacy Act, will have their records processed under the provisions of this part and the FOIA (32 CFR part 286). If the system of records is exempt from the access provisions of this part, and if the records, or any portion thereof, are exempt under the FOIA, the requester shall be advised and informed of the appropriate Privacy and FOIA exemption. Only if the records can be denied under both statutes may the Department withhold the records from the individual. Appeals shall be processed under both Acts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Requesters who seek records about themselves that are not contained in a Privacy Act system of records, and who cite or imply only the Privacy Act, will have their requests processed under the provisions of the FOIA (32 CFR part 286), because the access provisions of this part do not

apply. Appeals shall be processed under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Requesters who seek records about themselves that are contained in a Privacy Act system of records, and who cite or imply the FOIA or both Acts, will have their requests processed under the provisions of this part and the FOIA (32 CFR part 286). If the system of records is exempt from the access provisions of this part, and if the records, or any portion thereof, are exempt under the FOIA, the requester shall be advised and informed of the appropriate Privacy and FOIA exemption.

Appeals shall be processed under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Do not deny individuals' access to personal information concerning themselves that would otherwise be releasable to them under either Act solely because they fail to cite or imply either Act or cite the wrong Act or part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Explain to the requester which Act(s) was(were) used when granting or denying access under either Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Time limits. DoD Components normally shall acknowledge requests for access within 10 working days after receipt and provide access within 30 working days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Privacy case file. Establish a Privacy Act case file when required. (See paragraph (p) of Sec. 310.19.)</p>
