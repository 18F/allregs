If any trigger has been exceeded, systems must  complete assessments as required by Sec.  141.859.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Seasonal systems. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Beginning April 1, 2016, all seasonal  systems must demonstrate completion of a State-approved start-up  procedure, which may include a requirement for start-up sampling prior  to serving water to the public.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The State may exempt any seasonal system from some or all of  the requirements for seasonal systems if the entire distribution system  remains pressurized during the entire period that the system is not  operating.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Monitoring frequency for total coliforms.

A subpart H system of this part  that does not practice filtration in compliance with subparts H, P, T,  and W must collect at least one total coliform sample near the first  service connection each day the turbidity level of the source water,  measured as specified in Sec.  141.74(b)(2), exceeds 1 NTU. When one or  more turbidity measurements in any day exceed 1 NTU, the system must  collect this coliform sample within 24 hours of the first exceedance,  unless the State determines that the system, for logistical reasons  outside the system's control, cannot have the sample analyzed within 30  hours of collection and identifies an alternative sample collection  schedule. Sample results from this coliform monitoring must be included  in determining whether the coliform treatment technique trigger in Sec.   141.859 has been exceeded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reduced monitoring. Systems may not reduce monitoring, except  for non-community water systems using only ground water (and not ground  water under the direct influence of surface water) serving 1,000 or  fewer people in some months and more than 1,000 persons in other months.  In months when more than 1,000 persons are served, the systems must  monitor at the frequency specified in paragraph (a) of this section. In  months when 1,000 or fewer people are served, the State may reduce the  monitoring frequency, in writing, to a frequency allowed under Sec.   141.854 for a similarly situated system that always serves 1,000 or  fewer people, taking into account the provisions in Sec.  141.854(e)  through (g).</p>
