                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Library buildings and grounds are designated as limited public  forums, except for those areas designated as nonpublic forums. However,  only Library grounds (defined in 2 U.S.C. 167j), not buildings, may be  utilized for demonstrations, including assembling, marching, picketing,  or rallying. In addition, as the need for the determination of other  matters arises, the Librarian will determine what additional First  Amendment activities may not be permitted in a limited public forum. In  making such determination, The Librarian will consider only whether the  intended activity is incompatible with the primary purpose and intended  use of that area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Director, Integrated Support Services, shall designate  certain Library grounds as available for demonstrations. Persons seeking  to use such designated areas for the purpose of demonstrations shall  first secure written permission from the Director, Integrated Support  Services. An application for such permission shall be filed with  Facility Services no later than four business days before the time of  the proposed demonstration and shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name of the organization(s) or sponsor(s) of the  demonstration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contact person's name and telephone number;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The proposed purpose of the demonstration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The proposed location of the demonstration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The date and hour(s) planned for the demonstration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The anticipated number of demonstrators;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A concise statement detailing arrangements for the prompt  cleanup of the site after the demonstration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Any request for permission to use loudspeakers, microphones, or  other amplifying devices, hand held or otherwise; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> A signed agreement by the applicant(s) to comply with Library  regulations and terms and conditions established for the demonstration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon receipt of an application, Facility Services shall forward  the application, along with any comments and recommendations, to the  Director, Integrated Support Services, within one business day of the  office's receipt of said application. The Director, Integrated Support  Services, shall respond to the request within three business days of his  or her receipt of said application. The Director, Integrated Support  Services, shall request advice from the Office of the General Counsel on  any legal questions arising from said application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Permission to demonstrate shall be based upon:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The availability of the requested location;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The likelihood that the demonstration will not interfere with  Library operations or exceed city noise limitations as defined by  District of Columbia regulations; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The likelihood that the demonstration will proceed peacefully in  the event that a volatile situation in the United States or abroad might  lead to a potentially harmful threat toward the Capitol complex,  including Library buildings and grounds.</p>
