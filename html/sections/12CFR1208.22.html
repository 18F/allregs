                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Request for review. An employee who desires to inspect or copy  FHFA records related to a debt owed by the employee to FHFA must send a  letter to the individual designated in the Notice of Intent requesting  access to the relevant records. The letter must be received in the  office of that individual within 15 calendar days after the employee's  receipt of the Notice of Intent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Review location and time. In response to a timely request  submitted by the employee, the employee shall be notified of the  location and time when the employee may inspect and copy records related  to his or her debt that are not exempt from disclosure. If the employee  is unable personally to inspect such records as the result of  geographical or other constraints, FHFA shall arrange to send copies of  such records to the employee. The debtor shall pay copying costs unless  they are waived by FHFA. Copying costs shall be assessed pursuant to  FHFA's Freedom of Information Act Regulation, 12 CFR part 1202.</p>
