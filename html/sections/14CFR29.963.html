                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each fuel tank must be able to withstand, without failure, the vibration, inertia, fluid, and structural loads to which it may be subjected in operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each flexible fuel tank bladder or liner must be approved or shown to be suitable for the particular application and must be puncture resistant. Puncture resistance must be shown by meeting the TSO-C80, paragraph 16.0, requirements using a minimum puncture force of 370 pounds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each integral fuel tank must have facilities for inspection and repair of its interior.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The maximum exposed surface temperature of all components in the fuel tank must be less by a safe margin than the lowest expected autoignition temperature of the fuel or fuel vapor in the tank. Compliance with this requirement must be shown under all operating conditions and under all normal or malfunction conditions of all components inside the tank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each fuel tank installed in personnel compartments must be isolated by fume-proof and fuel-proof enclosures that are drained and vented to the exterior of the rotorcraft. The design and construction of the enclosures must provide necessary protection for the tank, must be crash resistant during a survivable impact in accordance with Sec. 29.952, and must be adequate to withstand loads and abrasions to be expected in personnel compartments.
