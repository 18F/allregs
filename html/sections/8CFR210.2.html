                                Sec. 210.2  Application for temporary resident status.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Application for temporary resident status. An alien  agricultural worker who believes that he or she is eligible for  adjustment of status under the provisions of Sec. 210.3 of this part  may file an application for such adjustment at a qualified designated  entity, at a legalization office, or at an overseas processing office  outside the United States. Such application must be filed within the  application period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application for Group 1 status. An alien who believes that he or  she qualifies for Group 1 status as defined in Sec. 210.1(f) of this  part and who desires to apply for that classification must so endorse  his or her application at the time of filing. Applications not so  endorsed will be regarded as applications for Group 2 status as defined  in Sec. 210.1(g) of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Numerical limitations. The numerical limitations of sections 201  and 202   of the Act do not apply to the adjustment of aliens to lawful temporary  or permanent resident status under section 210 of the Act. No more than  350,000 aliens may be granted temporary resident status in the Group 1  classification. If more than 350,000 aliens are determined to be  eligible for Group 1 classification, the first 350,000 applicants (in  chronological order by date the application is filed at a legalization  or overseas processing office) whose applications are approved for Group  1 status shall be accorded that classification. Aliens admitted to the  United States under the transitional admission standard placed in effect  between July 1, 1987, and November 1, 1987, and under the preliminary  application standard at Sec. 210.2(c)(4) who claim eligibility for  Group 1 classification shall be registered as applicants for that  classification on the date of submission to a legalization office of a  complete application as defined in Sec. 210.1(c) of this part. Other  applicants who may be eligible for Group 1 classification shall be  classified as Group 2 aliens. There is no limitation on the number of  aliens whose resident status may be adjusted from temporary to permanent  in Group 2 classification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Filing date of application--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. The date the alien  submits an application to a qualified designated entity, legalization  office or overseas processing office shall be considered the filing date  of the application, provided that in the case of an application filed at  a qualified designated entity the alien has consented to have the entity  forward the application to a legalization office. Qualified designated  entities are required to forward completed applications to the  appropriate legalization office within 60 days after the applicant gives  consent for such forwarding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Filing of application--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. The application must be  filed on Form I-700 at a qualified designated entity, at a legalization  office, at a designated port of entry, or at an overseas processing  office within the eighteen-month period beginning on June 1, 1987 and  ending on November 30, 1988.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applications in the United States. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The application must be  filed on Form I-700 with the required fee and, if the applicant is 14  years or older, the application must be accompanied by a completed Form  FD-258 (Fingerprint Card).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All fees for applications filed in the United States, other  than those within the provisions of Sec. 210.2(c)(4), must be submitted  in the exact amount in the form of a money order, cashier's check, or  bank check made payable to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  No personal checks or currency will be accepted. Fees will not be waived  or refunded under any circumstances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of an application filed at a legalization office,  including an application received from a qualified designated entity,  the district director may, at his or her discretion, require filing  either by mail or in person, or may permit filing in either manner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Each applicant, regardless of age, must appear at the  appropriate Service legalization office and must be fingerprinted for  the purpose of issuance of Form I-688A. Each applicant shall be  interviewed by an immigration officer, except that the interview may be  waived when it is impractical because of the health of the applicant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Filing at overseas processing offices. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The application must  be filed on Form I-700 and must include a completed State Department  Form OF-179 (Biographic Data for Visa Purposes).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Every applicant must appear at the appropriate overseas  processing office to be interviewed by a consular officer. The overseas  processing office will inform each applicant of the date and time of the  interview. At the time of the interview every applicant shall submit the  required fee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> All fees for applications submitted to an overseas processing  office shall be submitted in United States currency, or in the currency  of the country in which the overseas processing office is located. Fees  will not be waived or refunded under any circumstances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An applicant at an overseas processing office whose application  is recommended for approval shall be provided with an entry document  attached to the applicant's file. Upon admission to the United States,  the applicant   shall proceed to a legalization office for presentation or completion of  Form FD-258 (Fingerprint Card), presentation of the applicant's file and  issuance of the employment authorization Form I-688A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Border processing. The Commissioner will designate specific  ports of entry located on the southern land border to accept and process  applications under this part. Ports of entry so designated will process  preliminary applications as defined at Sec. 210.1(l) under the  authority of the district directors in whose districts they are located.  The ports of entry at Calexico, California, Otay Mesa, California, and  Laredo, Texas have been designated to conduct preliminary application  processing. Designated ports of entry may be closed or added at the  discretion of the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Admission standard. The applicant must present a fully completed  and signed Form I-700, Application for Temporary Resident Status with  the required fee and photographs at a designated port of entry. The  application must contain specific information concerning the performance  of qualifying employment in the United States and identify documentary  evidence which the applicant intends to submit as proof of such  employment. The applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the  examining officer during an interview that his or her claim to  eligibility for special agricultural worker classification is credible,  and that he or she is otherwise admissible to the United States under  the provisions of Sec. 210.3(e) of this part including, if required,  approval of an application for waiver of grounds of excludability.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Procedures. The fee for any application under this paragraph  including applications for waivers of grounds of excludability, must be  submitted in United States currency. Application fees shall not be  collected until the examining immigration officer has determined that  the applicant has presented a preliminary application and is admissible  to the United States including, if required, approval of an application  for waiver of grounds of excludability as provided in this paragraph.  Applicants at designated ports of entry must present proof of identity  in the form of a valid passport, a ``cartilla'' (Mexican military  service registration booklet), a Form 13 (``Forma trece''--Mexican lieu  passport identity document), or a certified copy of a birth certificate  accompanied by additional evidence of identity bearing a photograph and/ or fingerprint of the applicant. Upon a determination by an immigration  officer at a designated port of entry that an applicant has presented a  preliminary application, the applicant shall be admitted to the United  States as an applicant for special agricultural worker status. All  preliminary applicants shall be considered as prospective applicants for  the Group 2 classification. However, such applicants may later submit a  complete application for either the Group 1 or Group 2 classification to  a legalization office. Preliminary applicants are not required to pay  the application fee a second time when submitting the complete  application to a legalization office.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Conditions of admission. Aliens who present a preliminary  application shall be admitted to the United States for a period of  ninety (90) days with authorization to accept employment, if they are  determined by an immigration officer to be admissible to the United  States. Such aliens are required, within that ninety-day period, to  submit evidence of eligibility which meets the provisions of Sec. 210.3  of this part; to complete Form FD-258 (Fingerprint Card); to obtain a  report of medical examination in accordance with Sec. 210.2(d) of this  part; and to submit to a legalization office a complete application as  defined at Sec. 210.1(c) of this part. The INS may, for good cause,  extend the ninety-day period and grant further authorization to accept  employment in the United States if an alien demonstrates he or she was  unable to perfect an application within the initial period. If an alien  described in this paragraph fails to submit a complete application to a  legalization office within ninety days or within such additional period  as may have been authorized, his or her application may be denied for  lack of prosecution, without prejudice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Deportation is not stayed for an alien subject to deportation  and removal under the INA, notwithstanding   a claim to eligibility for SAW status, unless that alien has filed a  nonfrivolous application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Medical examination. An applicant under this part must be  examined at no expense to the government by a designated civil surgeon  or, in the case of an applicant abroad, by a physician or clinic  designated to perform medical examinations of immigrant visa applicants.  The medical report setting forth the findings concerning the mental and  physical condition of the applicant shall be incorporated into the  record. Any applicant certified under paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or  (5) of section 212(a) of the Act may appeal to a Board of Medical  Officers of the U.S. Public Health Service as provided in section 234 of  the Act and part 235 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Limitation on access to information and confidentiality. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Except for consular officials engaged in the processing of applications  overseas and employees of a qualified designated entity where an  application is filed with that entity, no person other than a sworn  officer or employee of the Department of Justice or bureau or agency  thereof, or contract personnel employed by the Service to work in  connection with the legalization program, will be permitted to examine  individual applications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Files and records prepared by qualified designated entities  under this section are confidential. The Attorney General and the  Service shall not have access to these files and records without the  consent of the alien.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All information furnished pursuant to an application for  temporary resident status under this part including documentary evidence  filed with the application shall be used only in the determination  process, including a determination under Sec. 210.4(d) of this part, or  to enforce the provisions of section 210(b)(7) of the Act, relating to  prosecutions for fraud and false statements made in connection with  applications, as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a determination is made by the Service that the alien has, in  connection with his or her application, engaged in fraud or willful  misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact, knowingly provided  a false writing or document in making his or her application, knowingly  made a false statement or representation, or engaged in any other  activity prohibited by section 210(b)(7) of the Act, the Service shall  refer the matter to the U.S. Attorney for prosecution of the alien or  any person who created or supplied a false writing or document for use  in an application for adjustment of status under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> of this part  who is determined to be ineligible for that status may be classified as  a temporary resident under Group 2 as defined in Sec. 210.1(g) of this  part if otherwise eligible for Group 2 status. In such a case the  applicant shall be notified of the decision to accord him or her Group 2  status and to deny Group 1 status. He or she is entitled to file an  appeal in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 103.3(a)(2) of this  chapter from that portion of the decision denying Group 1 status. In the  case of an applicant who is represented in the application process in  accordance with 8 CFR part 292, the applicant's representative shall  also receive notification of decision specified in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Motions. In accordance with the provisions of Sec. 103.5(b) of  this chapter, the director of a regional processing facility or a  consular officer at an overseas processing office may sua sponte reopen  any proceeding under this part under his or her jurisdiction and reverse  any adverse decision in such proceeding when appeal is taken under Sec.  103.3(a)(2) of this part from such adverse decision; the Associate  Commissioner, Examinations, and the Chief of the Administrative Appeals  Unit may sua sponte reopen any proceeding conducted by that unit under  this part and reconsider any decision rendered in   such proceeding. The decision must be served on the appealing party  within forty-five (45) days of receipt of any briefs and/or new  evidence, or upon expiration of the time allowed for the submission of  any briefs. Motions to reopen a proceeding or reconsider a decision  shall not be considered under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Certifications. The regional processing facility director may,  in accordance with Sec. 103.4 of this chapter, certify a decision to  the Associate Commissioner, Examinations when the case involves an  unusually complex or novel question of law or fact. A consular officer  assigned to an overseas processing office is authorized to certify a  decision in the same manner and upon the same basis.
