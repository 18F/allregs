                            <p class="depth0">In this subpart:</p><p class="depth0">Agency means an executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105.</p><p class="depth0">Authorized agency official means the head of the agency or an official who is authorized to act for the head of the agency in the matter concerned.</p><p class="depth0">Employee has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C. 2105.</p><p class="depth0">General Schedule or GS means the classification and pay system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53. It also refers to the pay schedule of GS rates established under 5 U.S.C. 5332, as adjusted under 5 U.S.C. 5303 or other law (including GS rates payable to GM employees). Law enforcement officers (LEOs) receiving LEO special base rates are covered by the GS classification and pay system, but receive higher base rates of pay in lieu of GS rates at grades GS-3 through GS-10.</p><p class="depth0">GM employee has the meaning given that term in 5 CFR 531.203.</p><p class="depth0">GS rate means a rate of basic pay within the General Schedule, excluding

any LEO special base rate and additional pay of any kind such as locality payments or special rate supplements. A rate payable to a GM employee is considered a GS rate.</p><p class="depth0">Highest applicable rate range means the rate range applicable to an employee's position that provides the highest rates of basic pay, excluding any retained rates. For example, a rate range of special rates may exceed an applicable locality rate range. In certain circumstances, the highest applicable rate range may consist of two types of pay rates from different pay schedules--e.g., a range where special rates (based on a fixed dollar supplement) are higher in the lower portion of the range and locality rates are higher in the higher portion of the range.</p><p class="depth0">Law enforcement officer or LEO has the meaning given that term in 5 CFR 550.103.</p><p class="depth0">LEO special base rate means a special base rate established for GS law enforcement officers at grades GS-3 through GS-10 under section 403 of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (section 529 of Pub. L. 101-509, November 5, 1990, as amended) which is used in lieu of a GS rate.</p><p class="depth0">Locality payment has the meaning given that term in 5 CFR 531.602.</p><p class="depth0">Locality rate means a GS rate or an LEO special base rate, if applicable, plus any applicable locality payment.</p><p class="depth0">Official worksite means the official location of an employee's position of record as determined under 5 CFR 531.605. Official worksite is synonymous with the term ``official duty station'' as used in 5 U.S.C. 5305(i).</p><p class="depth0">OPM means the Office of Personnel Management.</p><p class="depth0">Pay schedule means a set of rate ranges established for GS employees under a single authority--i.e., the General Schedule, an LEO special base rate schedule (for grades GS-3 through 10), a locality rate schedule based on GS rates, a locality rate schedule based on LEO special base rates (for grades GS-3 through 10), a special rate schedule under this subpart, or a similar schedule under 38 U.S.C. 7455. A pay schedule applies to or covers a defined category of employees based on established coverage conditions (e.g., official worksite, occupation). A pay schedule is considered to apply to or cover an employee who meets the established coverage conditions even when a rate under that schedule is not currently payable to the employee because of a higher pay entitlement under another pay schedule.</p><p class="depth0">Position of record means an employee's official position (defined by grade, occupational series, employing agency, LEO status, and any other condition that determines coverage under a pay schedule (other than official worksite)), as documented on the employee's most recent Notification of Personnel Action (Standard Form 50 or equivalent) and current position description. A position to which an employee is temporarily detailed is not documented as a position of record. For an employee whose change in official position is followed within 3 workdays by a reduction in force resulting in the employee's separation before he or she is required to report for duty in the new position, the position of record in effect immediately before the position change is deemed to remain the position of record through the date of separation.</p><p class="depth0">Rate of basic pay means the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee before any deductions, including a GS rate, an LEO special base rate, a locality rate, a special rate under this subpart or a similar rate under 38 U.S.C. 7455, or a retained rate, but excluding additional pay of any other kind.</p><p class="depth0">Rate range or range means the range of rates of basic pay for a grade within an established pay schedule, excluding any retained rate. A rate range may consist of GS rates, LEO special base rates, locality rates, special rates, or similar rates under other legal authority.</p><p class="depth0">Retained rate means a rate above the maximum rate of the rate range applicable to the employee which is payable under 5 CFR part 536 or, for a former member of the Senior Executive Service, under 5 CFR 359.705.</p><p class="depth0">Special rate means a rate of pay within a special rate schedule established under this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Special rate schedule means a pay schedule established under this subpart

to provide higher rates of pay for specified categories of GS positions or employees at one or more grades. An increased or decreased special rate schedule refers to an increase or decrease in one or more rate ranges within that schedule.</p><p class="depth0">Special rate supplement means the portion of a special rate paid above an employee's GS rate. However, for a law enforcement officer receiving an LEO special base rate who is also entitled to a special rate, the special rate supplement equals the portion of the special rate paid above the officer's LEO special base rate. When a special rate schedule covers both LEO positions and other positions, the value of the special rate supplement will be less for law enforcement officers receiving an LEO special base rate (since that rate is higher than the corresponding GS rate). The payable amount of a special rate supplement is subject to the Executive Schedule level IV limitation on special rates, as provided in Sec. 530.304(a).
