                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Thorax (upper torso) assembly (refer to Sec. 572.140(a)(1)(iv)). The thorax consists of the upper part of the torso assembly shown in drawing 210-3000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the anterior surface of the thorax of a completely assembled dummy (drawing 210-0000) is impacted by a test probe conforming to Sec. 572.146(a) at 6.0 0.1 m/s (19.7 0.3 ft/s) according to the test procedure in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maximum sternum displacement (compression) relative to the spine, measured with the chest deflection transducer (SA-572-S50), must not be less than 32mm (1.3 in) and not more than 38mm (1.5 in). Within this specified compression corridor, the peak force, measured by the probe-mounted

accelerometer as defined in Sec. 572.146(a) and calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, shall be not less than 680 N and not more than 810 N. The peak force after 12.5 mm of sternum compression but before reaching the minimum required 32.0 mm sternum compression shall not exceed 910 N.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The internal hysteresis of the ribcage in each impact, as determined from the force vs. deflection curve, shall be not less than 65 percent and not more than 85 percent. The hysteresis shall be calculated by determining the ratio of the area between the loading and unloading portions of the force deflection curve to the area under the loading portion of the curve.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The force shall be calculated by the product of the impactor mass and its deceleration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Test procedure. The test procedure for the thorax assembly is as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The test dummy is clothed in cotton-polyester-based tight-fitting shirt with long sleeves and ankle-length pants whose combined weight is not more than 0.25 kg (0.55 lbs).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Soak the dummy in a controlled environment at any temperature between 20.6 and 22.2 [deg]C (69 and 72 [deg]F) and at any relative humidity between 10 and 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Seat and orient the dummy on a seating surface without back support as shown in Figure P4, with the lower limbs extended horizontally and forward, the upper arms parallel to the torso and the lower arms extended horizontally and forward, parallel to the midsagittal plane, the midsagittal plane being vertical within 1 degree and the ribs level in the anterior-posterior and lateral directions within 0.5 degrees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Establish the impact point at the chest midsagittal plane so that the impact point of the longitudinal centerline of the probe coincides with the dummy's mid-sagittal plane and is centered on the center of No. 2 rib within 2.5 mm (0.1 in.) and 0.5 degrees of a horizontal plane.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Impact the thorax with the test probe so that at the moment of contact the probe's longitudinal center line is within 2 degrees of a horizontal line in the dummy's midsagittal plane.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Guide the test probe during impact so that there is no significant lateral, vertical or rotational movement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> No suspension hardware, suspension cables, or any other attachments to the probe, including the velocity vane, shall make contact with the dummy during the test.
