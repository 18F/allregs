States may disburse cash prospectively to  individuals self-directing their Community First Choice services and  supports, and must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ensure compliance with all applicable requirements of the  Internal Revenue Service, and State employment and taxation authorities,  including but not limited to, retaining required forms and payment of  FICA, FUTA and State unemployment taxes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Make available a financial management entity to an individual  who has demonstrated, after additional counseling, information,  training, or assistance that the individual cannot effectively manage  the cash option described in this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The State may require an individual to use a financial  management entity, but must provide the individual with the conditions  under which this option would be enforced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Vouchers.
