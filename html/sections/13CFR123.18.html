                            <p class="depth0">SBA will consider your request for an increase in your loan if you  can show that the eligible cost of repair or replacement of damages  increased because of events occurring after the loan approval that were  beyond your control. An eligible cost is one which is related to the  disaster for which SBA issued the original loan. For example, if you  discover hidden damage within a reasonable time after SBA approved your  original disaster loan and before repair, renovation, or reconstruction  is complete, you may request an increase. Or, if applicable building  code requirements were changed since SBA approved your original loan,  you may request an increase in your loan amount.  [63 FR 15072, Mar. 30, 1998]</p>
