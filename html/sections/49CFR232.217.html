                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When a train air brake system is tested from a yard air source,  an engineer's brake valve or a suitable test device shall be used to  provide any increase or reduction of brake pipe air pressure at the  same, or slower, rate as an engineer's brake valve.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The yard air test device must be connected to the end of the  train or block of cars that will be nearest to the controlling  locomotive. However, if the railroad adopts and complies with written  procedures to ensure that potential overcharge conditions to the train  brake system are avoided, the yard air test device may be connected to  other than the end nearest to the controlling locomotive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> and when practicable should be kept charged until road  motive power is coupled to train, after which, a Class III brake test  shall be performed as prescribed by Sec. 232.211.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the cars are off air for more than four hours, the cars shall  be retested in accordance with Sec. 232.205(c) through (f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At a minimum, yard air pressure shall be 60 psi at the end of  the consist or block of cars opposite from the yard test device and  shall be within 15 psi of the regulator valve setting on yard test  device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the air pressure of the yard test device is less than 80 psi,  then a brake pipe leakage or air flow test shall be conducted at the  operating pressure of the train when the locomotives are attached in  accordance with Sec. 232.205(c)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Mechanical yard air test devices and gauges shall be calibrated  every 92 days. Electronic yard test devices and gauges shall be  calibrated annually. Mechanical and electronic yard air test devices and  gauges shall be calibrated so that they are accurate to within [3 psi.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If used to test a train, a yard air test device and any yard air  test equipment shall be accurate and function as intended.
