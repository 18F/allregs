                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure  to comply with this part and if the noncompliance or threatened  noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with  this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal  to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance, or by other means  authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A referral to the Department of Justice with a recommendation  that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the  United States under any law of the United States, or any assurance or  other contractual undertaking;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The initiation of debarment proceedings pursuant to 2 CFR part  2424; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any applicable proceeding under State or local law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Noncompliance with Sec. 8.50. If an applicant or a recipient of  assistance under a contract which is extended or amended on or after  July 11, 1988, fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under  Sec. 8.50 or otherwise fails or   refuses to comply with the requirements imposed by that section, Federal  financial assistance may be refused under paragraph (c) of this section.  The Department is not required to provide assistance during the pendency  of the administrative proceeding under such paragraph (c), except where  the assistance is due and payable under a contract approved before July  11, 1988.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal  financial assistance. No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to  grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective  until:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The responsible civil rights official has advised the applicant  or recipient of its failure to comply and has determined that compliance  cannot be secured by voluntary means;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There has been an express finding on the record, after  opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to  comply with a requirement imposed under this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The action has been approved by the Secretary; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The expiration of 30 days after the Secretary has filed with the  committees of the House and Senate having legislative jurisdiction over  the program or activity involved a full written report of the  circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any action to suspend or  terminate, or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial  assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part  thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has  been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program,  or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice to State or local government. Whenever the Secretary  determines that a State or unit of general local government which is a  recipient of Federal financial assistance under title I of the Housing  and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5301-5318)  has failed to comply with a requirement of this part with respect to a  program or activity funded in whole or in part with such assistance, the  Secretary shall notify the Governor of the State or the chief executive  officer of the unit of general local government of the noncompliance and  shall request the Governor or the chief executive officer to secure  compliance. The notice shall be given at least sixty days before:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An order suspending, terminating, or refusing to grant or  continue Federal financial assistance becomes effective under paragraph  (c) of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by  law is taken under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by  any other means authorized by law shall be taken until:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The responsible civil rights official has determined that  compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The recipient or other person has been notified of its failure  to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At least 10 days have elapsed since the mailing of such notice  to the applicant or recipient. During this period, additional efforts  shall be made to persuade the applicant or recipient to comply with this  part and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.  However, this paragraph shall not be construed to prevent an award  official from utilizing appropriate procedures and sanctions established  under the program to assure or secure compliance with a specific  requirement of the program designed to effectuate the objectives of this  part.  [53 FR 20233, June 2, 1988; 53 FR 28115, July 26, 1988, as amended at 72  FR 73491, Dec. 27, 2007]</p>
