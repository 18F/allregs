                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A Federal savings association's board of directors may propose a plan for dissolution of the association. The plan may provide for either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appointment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (under section 5 of the Act and section 11 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended or section 21A of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, as amended) as receiver for the purpose of liquidation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transfer of all the association's assets to another association or home-financing institution under Federal or state charter either for cash sufficient to pay all obligations of the association and retire all outstanding accounts or in exchange for that association's payment of all the association's outstanding obligations and issuance of share accounts or other evidence of interest to the association's members on a pro rata basis; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dissolution in a manner proposed by the directors which they consider best for all concerned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The plan, and a statement of reasons for proposing dissolution and for proposing the plan, shall be submitted to the appropriate OCC licensing office for approval. The OCC will approve the plan if the OCC believes dissolution is advisable and the plan best for all concerned, but if the OCC considers the plan inadvisable, the OCC may either make recommendations to the association concerning the plan or disapprove it. When the plan is approved by the association's board of directors and by the OCC, it shall be submitted to the association's members at a duly called

meeting and, when approved by a majority of votes cast at that meeting, shall become effective. After dissolution in accordance with the plan, a certificate evidencing dissolution, supported by such evidence as the may require, shall immediately be filed with the OCC. When the OCC receives such evidence satisfactory to the OCC, it will terminate the corporate existence of the dissolved association and the association's charter shall thereby be canceled. A Federal savings association is not required to obtain approval under this section where the Federal savings association transfers all of its assets and liabilities to a bank in a transaction that is subject to Sec. 163.22(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2">PARTS 147	149 [RESERVED]</p>
