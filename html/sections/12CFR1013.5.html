                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Renegotiation. A renegotiation occurs when a consumer lease  subject to this part is satisfied and replaced by a new lease undertaken  by the same consumer. A renegotiation requires new disclosures, except  as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Extension. An extension is a continuation, agreed to by the  lessor and the lessee, of an existing consumer lease beyond the  originally scheduled end of the lease term, except when the continuation  is the result of a renegotiation. An extension that exceeds six months  requires new disclosures, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Assumption. New disclosures are not required when a consumer  lease is assumed by another person, whether or not the lessor charges an  assumption fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exceptions. New disclosures are not required for the following,  even if they meet the definition of a renegotiation or an extension:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A reduction in the rent charge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The deferment of one or more payments, whether or not a fee is  charged;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The extension of a lease for not more than six months on a  month-to-month basis or otherwise;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A substitution of leased property with property that has a  substantially equivalent or greater economic value, provided no other  lease terms are changed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The addition, deletion, or substitution of leased property in a  multiple-item lease, provided the average periodic payment does not  change by more than 25 percent; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> An agreement resulting from a court proceeding.
