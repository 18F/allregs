                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the preparation of profile graphs and in determining the location and height above sea level of the antenna site, the elevations or contour intervals must be taken from U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maps or Tennessee Valley Authority maps, whichever is the latest, for all areas for which maps are available. If such maps are not published for the area in question, the next best topographic information must be used. The maps used must include the principal area to be served. U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps may be obtained from the Eastern Distribution Branch, U.S. Geological Survey, 1200 South Eads Street, Arlington, VA 22202, for maps of areas east of the Mississippi River, including Minnesota, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, and from the Western Distribution Branch, U.S. Geological Survey, Federal Center, Denver CO 80225, for maps of areas west of the Mississippi River, including Alaska, Hawaii, Louisiana, Guam and American Samoa. Sectional aeronautical charts are available from the Distribution Division, National Ocean Service, Riverdale, MD 20840.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In lieu of maps, the average terrain elevation may be computer generated, using elevations from a 30 second point or better topographic data file such as those available for the U.S. Geological Survey's National Geographic Information Center or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Geophysical Data Center. In case of dispute maps will be used to determine the correct value.</p>
