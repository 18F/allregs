                                Sec. 330.213  Selection from an RPL.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Methods. An agency must adopt one of the selection methods in paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section for a single RPL. The agency may adopt the same method for each RPL it establishes or may vary the method by location, but it must adopt a written policy for each RPL it establishes and maintains. While an agency may not vary the method used for an individual vacancy, it may at any time change the selection method for all positions covered by a single RPL.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Retention standing order. For each vacancy to be filled, the agency places qualified RPL placement priority candidates in tenure group and subgroup order in accordance with part 351 of this chapter. In making a selection, an agency may not pass over a candidate in tenure group I to select from tenure group II and, within a tenure group, may not pass over a candidate in a higher subgroup to select from a lower subgroup. Within a subgroup, an agency may select any candidate without regard to order of retention standing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Numerical scoring. (1) For each vacancy to be filled, the agency rates RPL placement priority candidates according to their job experience and education. The agency must use job-related evaluation criteria for the position to be filled that can distinguish differences in qualifications measured and must apply the criteria in a fair and consistent manner. The agency assigns the candidates a numerical score of at least 70 on a scale of 100, based on the evaluation criteria developed under this paragraph. The agency must grant 5 additional points to veterans' preference eligibles under 5 U.S.C. 2108(3)(A) and (B), and 10 additional points to veterans' preference eligibles under 5 U.S.C. 2108(3) (C) through (G).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each vacancy to be filled, the agency rates RPL placement priority candidates according to their job experience and education.

At each score, candidates entitled to 10-point veterans' preference will be entered ahead of all other candidates, and those entitled to 5-point veterans' preference will be entered ahead of those candidates not entitled to veterans' preference.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The agency must make its selection from among the highest three candidates available and may not pass over a veterans' preference eligible to select a nonpreference eligible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Alternative rating and selection. (1) For each vacancy to be filled, the agency may use alternative rating and selection procedures (also called category rating) as described in 5 U.S.C. 3319 and part 337 of this chapter. The agency assesses RPL placement priority candidates against job-related evaluation criteria and then places them into two or more pre-defined quality categories.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each vacancy to be filled, the agency may use alternative rating and selection procedures (also called category rating) as described in 5 U.S.C. 3319 and part 337 of this chapter.

Veterans' preference points as prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are not applied under this method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The agency must make its selection from the highest quality category in accordance with its category rating policy established under part 337 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Application-based procedure.

Registration continues until it expires or the registrant is removed from the RPL under Sec. 330.209.</p>
