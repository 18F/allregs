                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and the regulations thereunder. Section 1001(e) and  paragraph (f) of this section prescribe the method of computing gain or  loss upon the sale or other disposition of a term interest in property  the adjusted basis (or a portion) of which is determined pursuant, or by  reference, to section 1014 (relating to the basis of property acquired  from a decedent) or section 1015 (relating to the basis of property  acquired by gift or by a transfer in trust).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Real estate taxes as amounts received. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 1001(b) and  section 1012 state rules applicable in making an adjustment upon a sale  of real property with respect to the real property taxes apportioned  between seller and purchaser under section 164(d). Thus, if the seller  pays (or agrees to pay) real property taxes attributable to the real  property tax year in which the sale occurs, he shall not take into  account, in determining the amount realized from the sale under section  1001(b), any amount received as reimbursement for taxes which are  treated under section 164(d) as imposed upon the purchaser. Similarly,  in computing the cost of the property under section 1012, the purchaser  shall not take into account any amount paid to the seller as  reimbursement for real property taxes which are treated under section  164(d) as imposed upon the purchaser. These rules apply whether or not  the contract of sale calls for the purchaser to reimburse the seller for  such real property taxes paid or to be paid by the seller.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On the other hand, if the purchaser pays (or is to pay) an  amount representing real property taxes which are treated under section  164(d) as imposed upon the seller, that amount shall be taken into  account both in determining the amount realized from the sale under  section 1001(b) and in computing the cost of the property under section  1012. It is immaterial whether or not the contract of sale specifies  that the sale price has been reduced by, or is in any way intended to  reflect, the taxes allocable to the seller. See also paragraph (b) of  Sec. 1.1012-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not apply to a seller  who, in a taxable year prior to the taxable year of sale, pays an amount  representing real property taxes which are treated under section 164(d)  as imposed on the purchaser, if such seller has elected to capitalize  such amount in accordance with section 266 and the   regulations thereunder (relating to election to capitalize certain  carrying charges and taxes).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Assume that the contract price on the sale of a parcel of  real estate is $50,000 and that real property taxes thereon in the  amount of $1,000 for the real property tax year in which occurred the  date of sale were previously paid by the seller. Assume further that  $750 of the taxes are treated under section 164(d) as imposed upon the  purchaser and that he reimburses the seller in that amount in addition  to the contract price. The amount realized by the seller is $50,000.  Similarly, $50,000 is the purchaser's cost. If, in this example, the  purchaser made no payment other than the contract price of $50,000, the  amount realized by the seller would be $49,250, since the sales price  would be deemed to include $750 paid to the seller in reimbursement for  real property taxes imposed upon the purchaser. Similarly, $49,250 would  be the purchaser's cost.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Assume that the purchaser in example (1), above, paid all  of the real property taxes. Assume further that $250 of the taxes are  treated under section 164(d) as imposed upon the seller. The amount  realized by the seller is $50,250. Similarly, $50,250 is the purchaser's  cost, regardless of the taxable year in which the purchaser makes actual  payment of the taxes.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. Assume that the seller described in the first part of  example (1), above, paid the real property taxes of $1,000 in the  taxable year prior to the taxable year of sale and elected under section  266 to capitalize the $1,000 of taxes. In such a case, the amount  realized is $50,750. Moreover, regardless of whether the seller elected  to capitalize the real property taxes, the purchaser in that case could  elect under section 266 to capitalize the $750 of taxes treated under  section 164(d) as imposed upon him, in which case his adjusted basis  would be $50,750 (cost of $50,000 plus capitalized taxes of $570).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other rules. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Even though property is not sold or otherwise  disposed of, gain is realized if the sum of all the amounts received  which are required by section 1016 and other applicable provisions of  subtitle A of the Code to be applied against the basis of the property  exceeds such basis. Except as otherwise provided in section 301(c)(3)(B)  with respect to distributions out of increase in value of property  accrued prior to March 1, 1913, such gain is includible in gross income  under section 61 as ``income from whatever source derived''. On the  other hand, a loss is not ordinarily sustained prior to the sale or  other disposition of the property, for the reason that until such sale  or other disposition occurs there remains the possibility that the  taxpayer may recover or recoup the adjusted basis of the property. Until  some identifiable event fixes the actual sustaining of a loss and the  amount thereof, it is not taken into account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth3">Example: A, an individual on a calendar year basis, purchased  certain shares of stock subsequent to February 28, 1913, for $10,000. On  January 1, 1954, A's adjusted basis for the stock had been reduced to  $1,000 by reason of receipts and distributions described in sections  1016(a)(1) and 1016(a)(4). He received in 1954 a further distribution of  $5,000, being a distribution covered by section 1016(a)(4), other than a  distribution out of increase of value of property accrued prior to March  1, 1913. This distribution applied against the adjusted basis as  required by section 1016(a)(4) exceeds that basis by $4,000. The $4,000  excess is a gain realized by A in 1954 and is includible in gross income  in his return for that calendar year. In computing gain from the stock,  as in adjusting basis, no distinction is made between items of receipts  or distributions described in section 1016. If A sells the stock in 1955  for $5,000, he realizes in 1955 a gain of $5,000, since the adjusted  basis of the stock for the purpose of computing gain or loss from the  sale is zero.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Installment sales. In the case of property sold on the  installment plan, special rules for the taxation of the gain are  prescribed in section 453.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Transfers in part a sale and in part a gift. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where a  transfer of property is in part a sale and in part a gift, the  transferor has a gain to the extent that the amount realized by him  exceeds his adjusted basis in the property. However, no loss is  sustained on such a transfer if the amount realized is less than the  adjusted basis. For the determination of basis of property in the hands  of the transferee, see Sec. 1.1015-4. For the allocation of the  adjusted basis of property in the case of a bargain sale to a charitable  organization, see Sec. 1.1011-2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The provisions of subparagraph (1) may be illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. A transfers property to his son for $60,000. Such  property in the hands of A has an adjusted basis of $30,000 (and a fair  market value of $90,000). A's gain is $30,000, the excess of $60,000,  the amount realized, over the adjusted basis, $30,000. He has made a  gift of $30,000, the excess of $90,000, the fair market value, over the  amount realized, $60,000.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. A transfers property to his son for $30,000. Such  property in the hands of A has an adjusted basis of $60,000 (and a fair  market value of $90,000). A has no gain or loss, and has made a gift of  $60,000, the excess of $90,000, the fair market value, over the amount  realized, $30,000.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. A transfers property to his son for $30,000. Such  property in A's hands has an adjusted basis of $30,000 (and a fair  market value of $60,000). A has no gain and has made a gift of $30,000,  the excess of $60,000, the fair market value, over the amount realized,  $30,000.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. A transfers property to his son for $30,000. Such  property in A's hands has an adjusted basis of $90,000 (and a fair  market value of $60,000). A has sustained no loss, and has made a gift  of $30,000, the excess of $60,000, the fair market value, over the  amount realized, $30,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Sale or other disposition of a term interest in property--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  General rule. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (3) of this  paragraph, for purposes of determining gain or loss from the sale or  other disposition after October 9, 1969, of a term interest in property  (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) a taxpayer shall not  take into account that portion of the adjusted basis of such interest  which is determined pursuant, or by reference, to section 1014 (relating  to the basis of property acquired from a decedent) or section 1015  (relating to the basis of property acquired by gift or by a transfer in  trust) to the extent that such adjusted basis is a portion of the  adjusted uniform basis of the entire property (as defined in Sec.  1.1014-5). Where a term interest in property is transferred to a  corporation in connection with a transaction to which section 351  applies and the adjusted basis of the term interest (i) is determined  pursuant to section 1014 or 1015 and (ii) is also a portion of the  adjusted uniform basis of the entire property, a subsequent sale or  other disposition of such term interest by the corporation will be  subject to the provisions of section 1001(e) and this paragraph to the  extent that the basis of the term interest so sold or otherwise disposed  of is determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the  transferor as provided by section 362(a). See subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph for rules relating to the characterization of stock received  by the transferor of a term interest in property in connection with a  transaction to which section 351 applies. That portion of the adjusted  uniform basis of the entire property which is assignable to such  interest at the time of its sale or other disposition shall be  determined under the rules provided in Sec. 1.1014-5. Thus, gain or  loss realized from a sale or other disposition of a term interest in  property shall be determined by comparing the amount of the proceeds of  such sale with that part of the adjusted basis of such interest which is  not a portion of the adjusted uniform basis of the entire property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Term interest defined. For purposes of section 1001(e) and this  paragraph, a term interest in property means--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A life interest in property,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An interest in property for a term of years, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> refer to an interest,  present or future, in the income from property or the right to use  property which will terminate or fail on the lapse of time, on the  occurrence of an event or contingency, or on the failure of an event or  contingency to occur. Such divisions do not refer to remainder or  reversionary interests in the property itself or other interests in the  property which will ripen into ownership of the entire property upon  termination or failure of a preceding term interest. A term interest in  property also includes any property received upon a sale or other  disposition of a life interest in property, an interest in property for  a term of years, or an income interest in a trust by the original holder  of such interest, but only to the extent that the adjusted basis of the  property received is determined by reference to the adjusted basis of  the term interest so transferred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exception. Paragraph (1) of section 1001(e) and subparagraph (1)  of this paragraph shall not apply to a sale or other disposition of a  term interest in   property as a part of a single transaction in which the entire interest  in the property is transferred to a third person or to two or more other  persons, including persons who acquire such entire interest as joint  tenants, tenants by the entirety, or tenants in common. See Sec.  1.1014-5 for computation of gain or loss upon such a sale or other  disposition where the property has been acquired from a decedent or by  gift or transfer in trust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Illustrations. For examples illustrating the application of this  paragraph, see paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.1014-5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Debt instruments issued in exchange for property--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In  general. If a debt instrument is issued in exchange for property, the  amount realized attributable to the debt instrument is the issue price  of the debt instrument as determined under Sec. 1.1273-2 or Sec.  1.1274-2, whichever is applicable. If, however, the issue price of the  debt instrument is determined under section 1273(b)(4), the amount  realized attributable to the debt instrument is its stated principal  amount reduced by any unstated interest (as determined under section  483).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certain debt instruments that provide for contingent payments-- </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. Paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not apply to a  debt instrument subject to either Sec. 1.483-4 or Sec. 1.1275-4(c)  (certain contingent payment debt instruments issued for nonpublicly  traded property).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>,  however, does not apply to a debt instrument if the fair market value of  the contingent payments is not reasonably ascertainable. Only in rare  and extraordinary cases will the fair market value of the contingent  payments be treated as not reasonably ascertainable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Coordination with section 453. If a debt instrument is issued in  exchange for property, and the income from the exchange is not reported  under the installment method of section 453, this paragraph (g) applies  rather than Sec. 15a.453-1(d)(2) to determine the taxpayer's amount  realized attributable to the debt instrument.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Effective date. This paragraph (g) applies to sales or exchanges  that occur on or after August 13, 1996.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Severances of trusts--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The severance of a trust  (including without limitation a severance that meets the requirements of  Sec. 26.2642-6 or of Sec. 26.2654-1(b) of this chapter) is not an  exchange of property for other property differing materially either in  kind or in extent if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An applicable state statute or the governing instrument  authorizes or directs the trustee to sever the trust; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(C)</em> of this chapter),  whether mandatory or in the discretion of the trustee, is authorized by  an applicable state statute or the governing instrument.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effective/applicability date. This paragraph (h) applies to  severances occurring on or after August 2, 2007. Taxpayers may apply  this paragraph (h) to severances occurring on or after August 24, 2004,  and before August 2, 2007.
