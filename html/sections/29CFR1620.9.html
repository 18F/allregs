                                Sec. 1620.9  Meaning of ``establishment.''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Although not expressly defined in the FLSA, the term  ``establishment'' had acquired a well settled meaning by the time of  enactment of the Equal Pay Act. It refers to a distinct physical place  of business rather than to an entire business or ``enterprise'' which  may include several separate places of business. Accordingly, each  physically separate place of business is ordinarily considered a  separate establishment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In unusual circumstances, two or more portions of a business  enterprise, even though located in a single physical place of business,  may constitute more than one establishment. For example, the facts might  reveal that these portions of the enterprise are physically segregated,  engaged in functionally separate operations, and have separate employees  and maintain separate records. Conversely, unusual circumstances may  call for two or more distinct physical portions of a business enterprise  being treated as a single establishment. For example, a central  administrative unit may hire all employees, set wages, and assign the  location of employment; employees may frequently interchange work  locations; and daily duties may be virtually identical and performed  under similar working conditions. Barring unusual circumstances,  however, the term ``establishment'' will be applied as described in  paragraph (a) of this section.</p>
