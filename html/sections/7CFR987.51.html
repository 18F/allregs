                            <p class="depth0">Transfers of dates may be made from one handler to another, and each handler who so transfers any such dates shall immediately upon the completion

of the particular transfer notify the Committee of the transfer, specifying the date of the transfer, the quantity and variety of dates involved, and the name of the receiving handler. If such transfer is wholly within the area of production, the assessment and withholding obligations shall be placed on the handler agreeing to assume them: Provided, That in the absence of the Committee receiving notice of a specific agreement on such obligations, the buying handler shall be held accountable. If such transfer is from within the area of production to any point outside thereof, the assessment and withholding obligations shall be met by the handler within the area of production. Except for packed dates inspected and certified for handling prior to transfer and which are not repacked, any receiving handler (other than a repacker not otherwise a handler, who shall comply with Sec. 987.53) shall comply with the requirements of Sec. 987.41 on all dates, but this shall apply to repacked dates previously inspected and certified for handling only if the handler also packs dates received as field-run dates.
