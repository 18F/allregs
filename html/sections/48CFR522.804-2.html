                            <p class="depth0">Goals for the employment of minorities and women in the construction industry are established by the Director, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), Department of Labor. The current goal for the utilization of women is 6.9%, regardless of the location of the Federal contract. This

goal was extended indefinitely by the Department of Labor in 1980. The current goals for minority participation vary by location and are listed in Appendix E of DOL's ``Technical Assistance Guide for Federal Construction Contractors.''
