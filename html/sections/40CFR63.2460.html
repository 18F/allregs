                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must meet each emission limit in Table 2 to this subpart  that applies to you, and you must meet each applicable requirement  specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> through (7) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To calculate emissions caused by the heating of a vessel without  a process condenser to a temperature lower than the boiling point, you  must use the procedures in Sec. 63.1257(d)(2)(i)(C)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)(D)(10)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To calculate emissions from vacuum systems for the purposes of  this subpart, the receiving vessel is part of the vacuum system, and  terms used in Equation 33 to 40 CFR part 63, subpart GGG, are defined as  follows:  Psystem = absolute pressure of the receiving vessel; Pi = partial pressure of the HAP determined at the exit  temperature and exit pressure conditions of the condenser or at the  conditions of the dedicated receiver; Pj = partial pressure of condensables (including HAP)  determined at the exit temperature and exit pressure conditions of the  condenser or at the conditions of the dedicated receiver; MWHAP = molecular weight of the HAP determined at the exit  temperature and exit pressure conditions of the condenser or at the  conditions of the dedicated receiver.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em> through  (vii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must determine the flowrate of gas (or volume of gas),  partial pressures of condensables, temperature (T), and HAP molecular  weight (MWHAP) at the exit temperature and exit pressure  conditions of the condenser or at the conditions of the dedicated  receiver.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must assume that all of the components contained in the  condenser exit vent stream are in equilibrium with the same components  in the exit condensate stream (except for noncondensables).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You must perform a material balance for each component.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For the emissions from gas evolution, the term for time, t,  must be used in Equation 12 to 40 CFR part 63, subpart GGG.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Emissions from empty vessel purging shall be calculated using  Equation 36 to 40 CFR part 63, subpart GGG and the exit temperature and  exit pressure conditions of the condenser or the conditions of the  dedicated receiver.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> You must conduct an engineering assessment as specified in  Sec. 63.1257(d)(2)(ii) for each emission episode that is not due to  vapor displacement, purging, heating, depressurization, vacuum  operations, gas evolution, air drying, or empty vessel purging. The  requirements of paragraphs (b)(3) through (4) of this section shall  apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> You may elect to conduct an engineering assessment if you can  demonstrate to the Administrator that the methods in Sec.  63.1257(d)(3)(i)(B) are not appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)(i)</em>, (ii),  or (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you comply with the alternative standard specified in Sec.  63.2505.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(C)</em>.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If you comply with an emission limit using a flare that meets  the requirements specified in Sec. 63.987.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)(i)</em> or (ii) of this section. You must comply with the  requirements of this section and submit the test report in the next  Compliance report.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> before switching.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> As an alternative to determining the uncontrolled organic HAP  emissions as specified in Sec. 63.1257(d)(2)(i) and (ii), you may elect  to demonstrate that non-reactive organic HAP are the only HAP used in  the process and non-reactive HAP usage in the process is less than  10,000 lb/yr. You must provide data and supporting rationale in your  notification of compliance status report explaining why the non-reactive  organic HAP usage will be less than 10,000 lb/yr. You must keep records  of the non-reactive organic HAP usage as specified in Sec.  63.2525(e)(2) and include information in compliance reports as specified  in Sec. 63.2520(e)(5)(iv).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (9) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Process condensers. Process condensers, as defined in Sec.  63.2550(i), are not considered to be control devices for batch process  vents. You must determine whether a condenser is a control device for a  batch process vent or a process condenser from which the uncontrolled  HAP emissions are evaluated as part of the initial compliance  demonstration for each MCPU and report the results with supporting  rationale in your notification of compliance status report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Initial compliance. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To demonstrate initial compliance with a  percent reduction emission limit in Table 2 to this subpart FFFF, you  must compare the sums of the controlled and uncontrolled emissions for  the applicable Group 1 batch process vents within the process, and show  that the specified reduction is met. This requirement does not apply if  you comply with the emission limits of Table 2 to this subpart FFFF by  using a flare that meets the requirements of Sec. 63.987.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When you conduct a performance test or design evaluation for a  non-flare control device used to control emissions from batch process  vents, you must establish emission profiles and conduct the test under  worst-case conditions according to Sec. 63.1257(b)(8) instead of under  normal operating conditions as specified in Sec. 63.7(e)(1). The  requirements in Sec. 63.997(e)(1)(i) and (iii) also do not apply for  performance tests conducted to determine compliance with the emission  limits for batch process vents. For purposes of this subpart FFFF,  references in Sec. 63.997(b)(1) to ``methods specified in Sec.  63.997(e)'' include the methods specified in Sec. 63.1257(b)(8).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> As an alternative to conducting a performance test or design  evaluation to demonstrate initial compliance with a percent reduction  requirement for a condenser, you may determine controlled emissions  using the procedures specified in Sec. 63.1257(d)(3)(i)(B) and  paragraphs (b)(3) through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> When Sec. 63.1257(d)(3)(i)(B)(7) specifies that condenser- controlled emissions from an air dryer must be calculated using Equation  11 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart GGG, with ``V equal to the air flow  rate,'' it means ``V equal to the dryer outlet gas flow rate,'' for the  purposes of this subpart. Alternatively, you may use Equation 12 of 40  CFR part 63, subpart GGG, with V equal to the dryer inlet air flow rate.  Account for time as appropriate in either equation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If a process condenser is used for any boiling operations, you  must demonstrate that it is properly operated according to the  procedures specified in Sec. 63.1257(d)(2)(i)(C)(4)(ii) and  (d)(3)(iii)(B), and the demonstration must occur only during the boiling  operation. The reference in Sec. 63.1257(d)(3)(iii)(B) to the  alternative standard in Sec. 63.1254(c) means Sec. 63.2505 for the  purposes of this subpart. As an alternative to measuring the exhaust gas  temperature, as required by Sec. 63.1257(d)(3)(iii)(B), you may elect  to measure the liquid temperature in the receiver.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> You must conduct a subsequent performance test or compliance  demonstration equivalent to an initial compliance demonstration within  180 days of a change in the worst-case conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> have not been approved by the  Administrator and determination of the operating limit using these  procedures is subject to review and approval by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you elect to establish separate monitoring levels for  different emission episodes within a batch process, you must maintain  records in your daily schedule or log of processes indicating each point  at which you change from one operating limit to another, even if the  duration of the monitoring for an operating limit is less than 15  minutes. You must maintain a daily schedule or log of processes  according to Sec. 63.2525(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Averaging periods. As an alternative to the requirement for  daily averages in Sec. 63.998(b)(3), you may determine averages for  operating blocks. An operating block is a period of time that is equal  to the time from the beginning to end of batch process operations within  a process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Outlet concentration correction for supplemental gases. If you  use a control device other than a combustion device to comply with a  TOC, organic HAP, or hydrogen halide and halogen HAP outlet  concentration emission limit for batch process vents, you must correct  the actual concentration for supplemental gases using Equation 1 of this  section; you may use process knowledge and representative operating data  to determine the fraction of the total flow due to supplemental gas. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10NO03.000  Where:  Ca = corrected outlet TOC, organic HAP, or hydrogen halide</p><p class="depth3">and halogen HAP concentration, dry basis, ppmv; Cm = actual TOC, organic HAP, or hydrogen halide and halogen</p><p class="depth3">HAP concentration measured at control device outlet, dry</p><p class="depth3">basis, ppmv; Qa = total volumetric flowrate of all gas streams vented to</p><p class="depth3">the control device, except supplemental gases; Qs = total volumetric flowrate of supplemental gases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If flow to a control device could be intermittent, you must  install, calibrate, and operate a flow indicator at   the inlet or outlet of the control device to identify periods of no  flow. Periods of no flow may not be used in daily or block averages, and  it may not be used in fulfilling a minimum data availability  requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Terminology. When the term ``storage vessel'' is used in subpart  WW of this part 63, the term ``process tank,'' as defined in Sec.  63.2550(i), applies for the purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)(i)</em> through (iv) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Operational requirements. The biofilter must be operated at all  times when emissions are vented to it.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(A)</em> through (D) of this section. The design  evaluation option for small control devices is not applicable if you use  a biofilter.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Keep up-to-date, readily accessible continuous records of either  the biofilter bed temperature averaged over the full period of the  performance test or the outlet total organic HAP or TOC concentration  averaged over the full period of the performance test. Include these  data in your notification of compliance status report as required by  Sec. 63.999(b)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Record either the percent reduction of total organic HAP  achieved by the biofilter determined as specified in Sec.  63.997(e)(2)(iv) or the concentration of TOC or total organic HAP  determined as specified in Sec. 63.997(e)(2)(iii) at the outlet of the  biofilter, as applicable.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If you monitor the biofilter bed temperature, you may elect to  use multiple thermocouples in representative locations throughout the  biofilter bed and calculate the average biofilter bed temperature across  these thermocouples prior to reducing the temperature data to 15 minute  (or shorter) averages for purposes of establishing operating limits for  the biofilter. If you use multiple thermocouples, include your rationale  for their site selection in your notification of compliance status  report.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Submit a performance test report as specified in Sec.  63.999(a)(2)(i) and (ii). Include the records from paragraph  (c)(9)(ii)(B) of this section in your performance test report.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Monitoring requirements. Use either a biofilter bed  temperature monitoring device (or multiple devices) capable of providing  a continuous record or an organic monitoring device capable of providing  a continuous record. Keep records of temperature or other parameter  monitoring results as specified in Sec. 63.998(b) and (c), as  applicable. General requirements for monitoring are contained in Sec.  63.996. If you monitor temperature, the operating temperature range must  be based on only the temperatures measured during the performance test;  these data may not be supplemented by engineering assessments or  manufacturer's recommendations as otherwise allowed in Sec.  63.999(b)(3)(ii)(A). If you establish the operating range (minimum and  maximum temperatures) using data from previous performance tests in  accordance with Sec. 63.996(c)(6), replacement of the biofilter media  with the same type of media is not considered a process change under  Sec. 63.997(b)(1). You may expand your biofilter bed temperature  operating range by conducting a repeat performance test that  demonstrates compliance with the 95 percent reduction requirement or  outlet concentration limit, as applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Repeat performance tests. You must conduct a repeat performance  test using the applicable methods specified in Sec. 63.997 within 2  years following the previous performance test and within 150 days after  each replacement of any portion of the biofilter bed media with a  different type of media or each replacement of more than 50 percent (by  volume) of the biofilter bed media with the same type of media.
