If an information return is required to be filed with respect to a payee attorney under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the attorney with respect to whom the information return is required to be filed (tier-one attorney) must file an information return under this section for any payment that the tier-one attorney makes to other payee attorneys with respect to that check, regardless of whether the tier-one attorney is a payor under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions. Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a return of information is not required under section 6045(f) with respect to the following payments:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Payments of wages or other compensation paid to an attorney by the attorney's employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Payments of compensation or profits paid or distributed to its partners by a partnership engaged in providing legal services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Payments of dividends or corporate earnings and profits paid to its shareholders by a corporation engaged in providing legal services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Payments made by a person to the extent that the person is required to report with respect to the same payee the payments or portions thereof under section 6041(a) and Sec. 1.6041-1(a) (or would be required to so report the payments or portions thereof but for the dollar amount limitation contained in section 6041(a) and Sec. 1.6041-1(a)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Payments made to a nonresident alien individual, foreign partnership, or foreign corporation that is not engaged in trade or business within the United States, and does not perform any labor or personal services in the United States, in the taxable year to which the payment relates. For how a payor determines whether a payment is subject to this exception, see Sec. 1.6041-4(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Payments made to an attorney in the attorney's capacity as the person responsible for closing a transaction within the meaning of Sec. 1.6045-4(e)(3) for the sale or exchange or financing of any present or future ownership interest in real estate described in Sec. 1.6045-4(b)(2)(i) through (iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Payments made to an attorney in the attorney's capacity as a trustee in bankruptcy under title 11, United States Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Attorney means a person engaged in the practice of law, whether as a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or joint venture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Legal services means all services related to, or in support of, the practice of law performed by, or under the supervision of, an attorney.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Payor means a person who makes a payment if that person is an obligor on the payment, or the obligor's insurer or guarantor. For example, a payor includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A person who pays a settlement amount to an attorney of a client who has asserted a tort, contract, violation of law, or workers' compensation claim against that person; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The person's insurer if the insurer pays the settlement amount to the attorney.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Payments to an attorney include payments by check or other method such as cash, wire or electronic transfer. Payment by check to an attorney means a check on which the attorney is named as a sole, joint, or alternative payee. The attorney is the payee on a check written to the attorney's client trust fund. However, the attorney is not a payee when the attorney's name is included on the payee line as ``in care of,'' such as a check written to ``client c/o attorney,'' or if the attorney's name is included on the check in any other manner that does not give the attorney the right to negotiate the check.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Amount of the payment means the amount tendered (e.g., the amount of a check) plus the amount required to be withheld from the payment under section 3406(a)(1), because a condition for withholding exists with respect to the attorney for whom an information return is required to be filed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Attorney to furnish TIN. A payor that is required to file an information return under this section must solicit a TIN from the attorney at or before the time the payor makes a payment to the attorney. The attorney must furnish the correct TIN to the payor, but is not required to certify the TIN. A payment for which a return of information is required under this section is subject to backup withholding under section 3406 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section. The examples assume that P is not a payor with respect to A, the attorney, under section 6041. See section 6041 and the regulations thereunder for rules regarding whether P is required under section 6041 to file information returns with respect to C. The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. One check--joint payees--taxable to claimant. Employee C, who sues employer P for back wages, is represented by attorney A. P settles the suit for $300,000. The $300,000 represents taxable wages to C under existing legal principles. P writes a settlement check payable jointly to C and A in the amount of $200,000, net of income and FICA tax withholding with respect to C. P delivers the check to A. A retains $100,000 of the payment

as compensation for legal services and disburses the remaining $100,000 to C. P must file an information return with respect to A for $200,000 under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. P also must file an information return with respect to C under sections 6041 and 6051, in the amount of $300,000. See Sec. Sec. 1.6041-1(f) and 1.6041-2.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. One check--joint payees--excludable to claimant. C, who sues corporation P for damages on account of personal physical injuries, is represented by attorney A. P settles the suit for a $300,000 damage payment that is excludable from C's gross income under section 104(a)(2). P writes a $300,000 settlement check payable jointly to C and A and delivers the check to A. A retains $120,000 of the payment as compensation for legal services and remits the remaining $180,000 to C. P must file an information return with respect to A for $300,000 under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. P does not file an information return with respect to tax-free damages paid to C.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Separate checks--taxable to claimant. C, an individual plaintiff in a suit for lost profits against corporation P, is represented by attorney A. P settles the suit for $300,000, all of which will be includible in C's gross income. A requests P to write two checks, one payable to A in the amount of $100,000 as compensation for legal services and the other payable to C in the amount of $200,000. P writes the checks in accordance with A's instructions and delivers both checks to A. P must file an information return with respect to A for $100,000 under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Pursuant to Sec. 1.6041-1(a) and (f), P must file an information return with respect to C for the $300,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Check made payable to claimant, but delivered to nonpayee attorney. Corporation P is a defendant in a suit for damages in which C, the plaintiff, has been represented by attorney A throughout the proceeding. P settles the suit for $300,000. Pursuant to a request by A, P writes the $300,000 settlement check payable solely to C and delivers it to A at A's office. P is not required to file an information return under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to A, because there is no payment to an attorney within the meaning of paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Multiple attorneys listed as payees. Corporation P, a defendant, settles a lost profits suit brought by C for $300,000 by issuing a check naming C's attorneys, Y, A, and Z, as payees in that order. Y, A, and Z do not belong to the same law firm. P delivers the payment to A's office. A deposits the check proceeds into a trust account and makes payments by separate checks to Y of $30,000 and to Z of $15,000, as compensation for legal services, pursuant to authorization from C to pay these amounts. A also makes a payment by check of $155,000 to C. A retains $100,000 as compensation for legal services. P must file an information return for $300,000 with respect to A under paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1)(i) of this section. A, in turn, must file information returns with respect to Y of $30,000 and to Z of $15,000 under paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(2) of this section because A is not required to file information returns under section 6041 with respect to A's payments to Y and Z because A's role in making the payments to Y and Z is merely ministerial. See Sec. 1.6041-1(e)(1), (e)(2) and (e)(5) Example 7 for information reporting requirements with respect to A's payments to Y and Z. As described in Example 3, P must also file an information return with respect to C, pursuant to Sec. 1.6041-1(a) and (f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation P, a defendant, settles a suit brought by C for $300,000 of damages. P will pay the damages by a joint check to C and his attorney, A. A failed to furnish P with A's TIN. P is required to deduct and withhold 28 percent tax from the $300,000 under section 3406(a)(1)(A) and paragraph (e) of this section. P writes the check to C and A as joint payees, in the amount of $216,000. P also must file an information return with respect to A under paragraph (a)(1) of this section in the amount of $300,000, as prescribed in paragraph (d)(5) of this section. If the damages are reportable under section 6041 because they are not excludable from gross income under existing legal principles, and are not subject to any exception under section 6041, P must also file an information return with respect to C pursuant to Sec. 1.6041-1(a) and (f) in the amount of $300,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rather than paying by joint check to C and A, P will pay the damages by a joint check to C and F, A's law firm. F failed to furnish its TIN to P. P is required to deduct and withhold 28 percent tax from the $300,000 under section 3406(a)(1)(A) and paragraph (e) of this section. P writes the check to C and F as joint payees, in the amount of $216,000. P also must file an information return with respect to F under paragraph (a)(1) of this section in the amount of $300,000, as prescribed in paragraph (d)(5) of this section. If the damages are reportable under section 6041 because they are not excludable from gross income under existing legal principles, and are not subject to any exception under section 6041, P must also file an information return with respect to C pursuant to Sec. 1.6041-1(a) and (f) in the amount of $300,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Individual P agrees to purchase a house that P will use solely as a residence. P obtains a loan from lender L to finance a portion of the cost of acquiring the house. L disburses loan proceeds of $300,000 to attorney A, who is the settlement agent, by a check naming A as the sole payee. A, in turn, writes checks from the loan proceeds and from other funds provided by P to the

persons involved in the purchase of the house, including a check for $800 to attorney B, whom P hired to provide P with legal services relating to the closing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> P, not L, is the payor of the payment to A under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. P, however, is not required to file an information return with respect to A under paragraph (a)(1) of this section because the payment was not made in the course of P's trade or business. Even if P made the payment in the course of P's trade or business, P would not be required to file an information return under section 6045(f) with respect to A because P is excepted under paragraph (c)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A is not required to file an information return under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to the payment to B because A is not the payor as that term is defined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. A is not required to file an information return under paragraph (b)(2) with respect to the payment to B because A was listed as sole payee on the check it received from P. See section 6041 and Sec. 1.6041-1(e) for whether A or L must file information returns under that section. See section 6045(e) and Sec. 1.6045-4 for whether A is required to file an information return under that section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Business mortgage lending transaction. The facts are the same as in Example 7 except that P buys real property that P will use in a trade or business. P, not L, is the payor of the payment to A under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. P, however, is not required to file an information return under section 6045(f) with respect to A because P is excepted under paragraph (c)(6) of this section. A is not required to file an information return under paragraphs (a) or (b)(2) of this section with respect to the payment to B. See section 6041 and Sec. 1.6041-1(e) to determine whether P or L must file an information return under that section with respect to the payment to A, and whether P or A must file a return with respect to the payment to B. See section 6045(e) for rules regarding whether A is required to file information returns under that section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. Qualified settlement fund. Corporation P agrees to settle for $300,000 a class action lawsuit brought by attorney A on behalf of a claimant class. Pursuant to the settlement agreement and a preliminary order of approval by a court, A establishes a bank account in the name of Q Settlement Fund, which is a qualified settlement fund (QSF) under Sec. 1.468B-1. A is also designated by the court as the administrator of the QSF. Corporation P transfers $300,000 by wire in Year 1 to A, who deposits the funds into the Q Settlement Fund. In Year 2, the court approves an award of attorney's fees of $105,000 for A. In Year 2, Q Settlement Fund delivers $105,000 to A. P is required to file an information return under paragraph (a) of this section with respect to A for Year 1 for the $300,000 payment it made to A. The Q Settlement Fund is required to file an information return under section 6041(a) and Sec. 1.468B-2(l)(2) with respect to A for Year 2 for the $105,000 payment it made to A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Cross reference to penalties. See the following sections regarding penalties for failure to comply with the requirements of section 6045(f) and this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section 6721 for failure to file a correct information return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 6722 for failure to furnish a correct payee statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Section 6723 for failure to comply with other information reporting requirements (including the requirement to furnish a TIN).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Section 7203 for willful failure to supply information (including a TIN).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Effective/applicability date.

A custodian or other transferor that transfers custody of a security to a broker solely to effect a sale must furnish a transfer statement only to the broker that effects the sale. However, no transfer statement is required if the transferor itself either effects the sale or is required to report the sale of the security under Sec. 1.6045-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Sales. A custodian or other transferor that transfers custody of a security to a broker solely to effect a sale must furnish a transfer statement only to the broker that effects the sale.

Applicable person does not include the beneficial owner of a security or any agent substituted for an undisclosed beneficial owner, any governmental unit or agency or instrumentality of a governmental unit holding escheated securities, or any organization that holds and transfers obligations among members of the organization as a service to its members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Broker receiving custody. Solely for purposes of this section, broker means any person described in Sec. 1.6045-1(a)(1), any person that acts as a custodian of securities in the ordinary course of a trade or business, any issuer of securities, and any agent of these persons. Broker does not include the beneficial owner of a security or any agent substituted for an undisclosed beneficial owner, any governmental unit or agency or instrumentality of a governmental unit holding escheated securities, or any organization that holds and transfers obligations among members of the organization as a service to its members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Other terms.

The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (a). Unless otherwise stated, in each example the customer is not treated as an exempt recipient under Sec. 1.6045-

1(c)(3)(i) or an exempt foreign person under Sec. 1.6045-1(g)(1)(i). The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. V, an entity treated as an exempt recipient under Sec. 1.6045-1(c)(3)(i), owns a security in an account with E, a broker. On February 1, 2012, V instructs E to transfer custody of the security to an account V maintains with F, another broker. Because E may treat V as an exempt recipient under Sec. 1.6045-1(c)(3)(i), under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, E is not required to furnish a transfer statement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. W maintains an account with G, a custodial broker. On August 1, 2012, W instructs G to purchase a security. G places an order to purchase the security with H, a broker with which G has a clearing agreement. W does not maintain a direct account with H. H executes the purchase and has the security delivered to G. Under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, H is not required to furnish a transfer statement because G received custody of the security and H purchased the security solely at the instruction of G.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3.

Therefore, under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, G is not required to furnish a transfer statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X maintains an account with J, an introducing broker. J contracts with K, a clearing broker, to allow K to execute trades on J's behalf under a clearing agreement. K uses L, a custodian of securities in the ordinary course of a trade or business, to hold custody of the securities of K's customers. K maintains a separate disclosed account for X as a clearing broker with custody at L. On May 1, 2012, X instructs J to purchase a security for X as the beneficial owner. J instructs K to purchase the security. K effects the purchase and has the security delivered to L.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> K is a broker and therefore is an applicable person that is a transferor within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. L acts as a custodian of securities in the ordinary course of a trade or business and therefore is a broker within the meaning of paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Because K effects the purchase of the security but does not receive custody of the security, under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, K must furnish a transfer statement to L.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assume the same facts as in Example 4 except that X later instructs J to sell the security. J instructs K to sell the security. K sells the security. L transfers custody of the security to settle X's sale in accordance with its custody arrangement with K by delivering the security to the purchasing broker. K deposits the sale proceeds in X's account with K. K is required to report the sale of the security under Sec. 1.6045-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> L acts as a custodian of securities in the ordinary course of a trade or business and therefore is an applicable person that is a transferor within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Because L transfers custody of the security to the purchaser's broker solely to effect the sale, under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, L must furnish a transfer statement to K.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the terms of their custody arrangement so provide, K may furnish the transfer statement as L's agent and satisfy L's duty to furnish the transfer statement under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section.

Y establishes a delivery-on-payment account with M, a broker, and provides M a standing instruction to deliver stock purchased in the account to Y's account at N, a custodian of securities in the ordinary course of a trade or business. On November 1, 2012, Y enters into a cash-on-delivery transaction by instructing M to purchase shares of C stock. M executes the purchase and effects delivery of the C stock to N.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> M is a broker and therefore is an applicable person that is a transferor within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. N acts as a custodian of securities in the ordinary course of a trade or business and therefore is a broker within the meaning of paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Because M effects the purchase of the stock and N receives custody of the stock, under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, M must furnish a transfer statement to N.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Z owns shares of stock in C, a corporation, in an account with O, a broker. On February 1, 2013, Z instructs O to transfer the C stock to C so that ownership is held on the books of the issuer. C has an arrangement with D, a transfer agent, to keep records of ownership of the company's stock, how that stock is held, and how many shares each investor owns. O transfers the stock to D.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> O is a broker and therefore is an applicable person that is a transferor within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. D is an agent of C, the issuer of the stock, and therefore is a broker within the meaning of paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Because O transfers custody of the stock to D, under

paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, O must furnish a transfer statement to D.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Assume the same facts as in Example 7 except that Z later instructs D to transfer the stock to an account Z maintains with P, another broker. D transfers the stock to P. D is an agent of C, the issuer of the stock, and therefore is an applicable person that is a transferor within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Because P is a broker and D transfers custody of the stock to P, under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, D must furnish a transfer statement to P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Information required--(1) In general.

The date the transfer was initiated and the settlement date of the transfer (if known when furnishing the statement).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Adjusted basis and acquisition date. The total adjusted basis of the security, the original acquisition date of the security, and, if applicable, the holding period adjustment required by section 1091. The transferor must determine this information as provided under Sec. Sec. 1.6045-1(d), 1.6045-1(m), and 1.6045-1(n), including reporting the adjusted basis of the security in U.S. dollars. If the basis of the transferred security is determined using an average basis method (as described in Sec. 1.1012-1(e)), the transferor may report any securities acquired more than five years before the transfer on a single statement on which the original acquisition date is reported as ``VARIOUS'' if the other information reported on the statement applies to all of the securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (b)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In a single account with P, a broker, Q purchases three lots of 100 shares of stock each in C, a corporation, at different prices on April 2, 2012, July 2, 2012, and October 2, 2012. Q instructs P to enroll the shares of the C stock in P's dividend reinvestment plan and to average the basis of the shares of the C stock. All of the C stock purchased by P has the same CUSIP number. On September 13, 2013, less than five years after the acquisition dates for all three lots, Q transfers all 300 shares of the C stock to an account with another broker.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, P must furnish three transfer statements.

Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that Q transfers the shares to the account with the other broker on September 13, 2017. For the 100 shares purchased on April 2, 2012, and the 100 shares purchased on July 2, 2012, under paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section, P may furnish a single transfer statement reporting the transfer of 200 shares with the original acquisition date as ``VARIOUS'' instead of furnishing two separate transfer statements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that, on June 15, 2012, Q sells the 100 shares purchased on April 2, 2012, at a loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, P must furnish two transfer statements. Under paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section and Sec. 1.6045-1(d)(6)(iii) and (d)(7)(ii), P must determine the average basis for the 200 transferred shares and the date for computing whether any gain or loss with respect to the stock purchased on July 2, 2012, is long-term or short-term by applying the rules for broker reporting of wash sales to

the stock purchased on July 2, 2012. Therefore, on both transfer statements, P must increase the average basis of the stock by the amount of loss disallowed under section 1091 on the sale of the 100 shares purchased on April 2, 2012. On the transfer statement reporting the transfer of the 100 shares purchased on July 2, 2012, P must adjust the holding period of the July 2, 2012, shares in accordance with section 1091.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> R, an employee of C, a corporation, participates in C's employee stock purchase program that satisfies the requirements of section 423. D administers the plan. R purchases stock in the plan at a 15 percent discount to the fair market value of the stock determined on the date of purchase. R purchases stock through the plan during 2012 until R terminates employment on October 15, 2012. R later instructs D to transfer the plan shares to S, a broker.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> D is the agent of C, the issuer of the securities, and therefore is an applicable person within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Because S is a broker and D transfers custody of the stock to S, under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, D must furnish a transfer statement to S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section and Sec. 1.6045-1(d)(6)(ii)(A), D must report adjusted basis on the transfer statement based on the amount paid by R. Under paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section and Sec. 1.6045-1(d)(6)(ii)(A), D is permitted, but is not required, to increase the adjusted basis for the amount (if any) includible as wage income by R for R's purchases of the stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Additional information required for a transfer of a debt instrument. In addition to the information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, for a transfer of a debt instrument that is a covered security, the following additional information is required:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A description of the payment terms used by the broker to compute any basis adjustments under Sec. 1.6045-1(n);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The issue price of the debt instrument;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The issue date of the debt instrument (if different from the original acquisition date of the debt instrument);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The adjusted issue price of the debt instrument as of the transfer date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The customer's initial basis in the debt instrument;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Any market discount that has accrued as of the transfer date (as determined under Sec. 1.6045-1(n));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Any bond premium that has been amortized as of the transfer date (as determined under Sec. 1.6045-1(n));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Any acquisition premium that has been amortized as of the transfer date (as determined under Sec. 1.6045-1(n)); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Whether the transferring broker has computed any of the information described in this paragraph (b)(3) by taking into account one or more elections described in Sec. 1.6045-1(n), and, if so, which election or elections were taken into account by the transferring broker.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Additional information required for option transfers. In addition to the information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, for a transfer of an option that is a covered security, the following additional information is required:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The date of grant or acquisition of the option;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of premium paid or received; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any other information required to fully describe the option, which may include a security identifier used by option exchanges, or details about the underlying asset, quantity covered, exercise type, strike price, and maturity date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Format of identification. An applicable person furnishing a transfer statement and a broker receiving the transfer statement may agree to combine the information required in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section in any format or to use a code in place of one or more required items. For example, a transferor and a receiving broker may agree to use a single code to represent the broker instead of the broker's name, address, and telephone number, or may use a security symbol or other identification number or scheme instead of the security identifier required by paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section. As another example, a transferor and a receiving broker may agree to use a security identifier for an exchange-traded option if that information would be sufficient to inform the receiving broker of the terms for that option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Transfers of noncovered securities. The information described in paragraphs (b)(1)(vii), (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(8), and (b)(9) of this section is not required for a transfer of a noncovered security if the transfer statement identifies the

security as a noncovered security. A transferor that chooses to report nonrequired information is not subject to penalties under section 6722 for failure to report this information correctly if the transfer statement identifies the security as a noncovered security. A single transfer statement may report the transfer of multiple noncovered securities if the transfer statement clearly conveys, either specifically or generally, the information described in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section to identify each security. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(6), a transferor must treat a security for which a broker makes a single-account election described in Sec. 1.1012-1(e)(11)(i) as a covered security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Transfers of borrowed securities. The transfer statement must indicate that a transferred security is borrowed if the transferor knows that the security is transferred pursuant to a lending or borrowing arrangement. The transfer statement must not report an adjusted basis If the transferor knows that the transferred security is lent or borrowed pursuant to a short sale. The receiving broker may be subject to special transfer reporting rules upon receipt of a borrowed security if the security is used to satisfy an existing short sale obligation. See Sec. 1.6045-1(c)(3)(xi)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Transfers pursuant to an inheritance--(i) In general. A transfer statement for a transfer of a security from a decedent or decedent's estate must indicate that the security is inherited. The transfer statement must report the date of death as the original acquisition date and must report adjusted basis according to the instructions or valuations furnished by an authorized representative of the estate, including any required adjustments to basis for property acquired from a decedent. If a transferor has not received instructions or valuations from an authorized representative, the transferor must report basis as the fair market value of the security on the date of death.</p><p class="depth0">However, if the transferor neither knows nor can readily ascertain the fair market value of the security on the date of death at the time the transfer statement is prepared, the transfer statement must indicate that the transfer consists of an inherited security but may otherwise report the security as if it were a noncovered security. If the transferor cannot identify which securities in a joint account have been transferred from the decedent, the transferor must treat each security in the account as if it were a noncovered security but must not indicate that any security is an inherited security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transfers of securities to satisfy a cash legacy. If a security is transferred from a decedent or a decedent's estate to satisfy a cash legacy, paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section apply and paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section does not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Subsequent transfers of inherited securities. A transfer statement must indicate that the transfer consists of an inherited security if a prior transfer statement reported the security as inherited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Gift or deemed gift transfers--(i) In general. A transfer statement for a security transferred to a different owner (other than a transfer that the transferor knows is pursuant to a lending or borrowing arrangement or is from a decedent or decedent's estate) must indicate that the security is a gift and must report the date of the gift (if known when furnishing the statement) and the fair market value of the gift on that date (if known or readily ascertainable at the time the transfer statement is prepared). The transfer statement must report the adjusted basis and original acquisition date of the security in the hands of the donor. However, if the transfer is between persons for whom gift-related basis adjustments are inapplicable or between accounts that share at least one common customer, the transferor must apply paragraph (b)(1) of this section as if the security were not a gift or deemed gift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A transfer statement for a security transferred to a different owner (other than a transfer that the transferor knows is pursuant to a lending or borrowing arrangement or is from a decedent or decedent's estate) must indicate that the security is a gift and must report the date of the gift (if known when furnishing the statement) and the fair market value of the gift on that date (if known or readily ascertainable at the time the transfer statement is prepared). The transfer statement must report the adjusted basis and original acquisition date of the security in the hands of the donor.

If a transferor transfers to a different account of the same customer a security that a prior transfer statement reported as a gifted security, the transferor must include on the transfer statement the information described in paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section for the date of the gift to the customer. If the prior transfer statement did not report a date for the gift,

the transferor must treat the settlement date for the prior transfer as the date of the gift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b)(9):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X instructs S, a broker, to give to Y stock in a publicly traded company that X holds in an account with S. The stock is a covered security. On X's instruction, S transfers custody of the stock to T, Y's broker. The transfer settles on August 15, 2013. Under paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section, S must provide a transfer statement to T that identifies the securities as gifted securities and indicates X's adjusted basis and original acquisition date. If S knows the settlement date, the transfer statement must also indicate that the date of the gift was August 15, 2013, and, because S can readily ascertain the fair market value of the stock on August 15, 2013, the fair market value of the stock on that date.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that, one year later, Y transfers the stock to an account in his name with U, another broker. Under paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section, T must provide a transfer statement to U that identifies the securities as gifted securities and indicates X's adjusted basis and original acquisition date of the stock. The transfer statement must also indicate the date of the gift, August 15, 2013, and the fair market value of the stock on that date either by reporting the value that S reported to T or, because T can readily ascertain the fair market value of the stock on August 15, 2013, by determining the fair market value of the stock on that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Specific identification of securities. Except as provided in Sec. 1.1012-1(e)(7)(ii), a transfer statement must report a transfer of less than the entire position in an account of a security that was acquired on different dates or at different prices consistently with a customer's adequate and timely identification of the security to be transferred. See Sec. 1.1012-1(c). If the customer does not provide an adequate and timely identification for the transfer, a transferor must first report the transfer of any securities in the account for which the transferor does not know the acquisition or purchase date followed by the earliest securities purchased or acquired, whether covered securities or noncovered securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Information from other parties and other accounts--(i) Transfer and issuer statements and transfers pursuant to an inheritance. When reporting a transfer of a covered security, a transferor must take into account all information, other than the classification of the security (such as stock), furnished on a transfer statement, all information furnished or deemed furnished on an issuer statement (as described in Sec. 1.6045B-1), and all instructions and valuations furnished by an authorized representative of the estate of a decedent, unless the statement or instructions are incomplete or the broker has actual knowledge that they are incorrect. A transferor may treat a customer as a minority shareholder when taking the information on an issuer statement into account unless the transferor knows that the customer is a majority shareholder and the issuer statement reports the action's effect on the basis of majority shareholders. Any failure to report correct information that arises solely from reliance on information furnished on a transfer statement or issuer statement or by an authorized representative of the estate is deemed to be due to reasonable cause for purposes of penalties under section 6722.

The receiving broker is only required to make this request once. If the receiving broker does not receive a complete transfer statement after requesting it, the receiving broker may treat the security as a noncovered security upon its subsequent sale or transfer. A transfer statement for a covered security is complete if, in the view of the receiving broker, it provides sufficient information to comply with Sec. 1.6045-1 when reporting the sale of the security.

If neither the issuer nor the acquiring or successor entity satisfies these reporting obligations, both parties are jointly and severally liable for any applicable penalties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Penalties. An issuer may use an agent to satisfy the requirements of this section for the issuer. Nonetheless, the issuer remains liable for penalty for any failure to comply unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. See sections 6721 through 6724.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Examples.

For purposes of section 6042(b)(3) and Sec. 1.6042-3(c), D must treat the distribution as a dividend. Therefore, under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, D is not required to file an issuer return. If D later determines that dividend treatment was incorrect, D must file an issuer return reporting the correct quantitative effect on basis.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. E, a corporation, undertakes a stock split as of April 1, 2014. E furnishes issuer statements under paragraph (b) of this section on April 1, 2014, at which time the books and records of E show that 90 percent

of its outstanding stock is owned by shareholders through a clearing organization as their nominee, 7 percent is owned by 5,000 individuals, and the remaining 3 percent is owned by a dividend reinvestment plan operated by E that has 1,000 members.

On January 15, 2014, F, an individual, purchases a one-year exchange-traded call option on 100 shares of Company X stock, with a strike price of $110. The call option is cleared through Clearinghouse G. Company X executes a 2-for-1 stock split as of April 1, 2014. Due to the stock split, the terms of F's option are altered, resulting in two option contracts, each on 100 shares of Company X stock with a strike price of $55. All other terms remain the same. Under paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, Clearinghouse G is required to prepare an issuer report for F.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On January 31, 2014, J, an individual, purchases from K a non-exchange traded 7-month call option on 100 shares of Company X stock, with a strike price of $110.

Due to the stock split, the terms of J's option are altered, resulting in one option contract on 200 shares of Company X stock with a strike price of $55. All other terms of the option remain the same. Under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, because the number of option contracts did not change, K is not required to prepare an issuer report for J.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Effective/applicability dates.
