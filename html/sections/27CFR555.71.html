The notice of contemplated action, ATF F 5400.12, will afford the licensee or permittee 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice to respond. If no response is received within the 15 days, or if after consideration of relevant matters presented by the licensee or permittee, the Director, Industry Operations finds that the licensee or permittee is not likely to abide by the law and regulations, he will proceed as provided in Sec. 555.74.
