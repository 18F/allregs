If the borrower and the borrower's spouse repay the loans jointly, the amount the borrowers would repay is based on both borrowers' Direct Loan debts at the time they enter joint repayment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The annual amount payable by a borrower under the ICR plan is the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount the borrower would repay annually over 12 years using standard amortization multiplied by an income percentage factor that corresponds to the borrower's AGI as shown in the income percentage factor table in a notice published annually by the Secretary in the Federal Register; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> 20 percent of discretionary income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(A)</em> For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, discretionary income is defined as a borrower's AGI minus the amount of the poverty guideline, as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, for the borrower's family size as defined in Sec. 685.209(a)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, discretionary income is defined as a borrower's AGI minus the amount of the poverty guideline, as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, for the borrower's family size as defined in Sec. 685.209(a)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the term ``poverty guideline'' refers to the income categorized by State and family size in the poverty guidelines published annually by the United States Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9902(2). If a borrower is not a resident of a State identified in the poverty guidelines, the poverty line to be used for the borrower is the poverty guideline (for the relevant family size) used for the 48 contiguous States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For exact incomes not shown in the income percentage factor table in the annual notice published by the Secretary, an income percentage factor is calculated, based upon the intervals between the incomes and income percentage factors shown on the table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Each year, the Secretary recalculates the borrower's annual payment amount based on changes in the borrower's AGI, the variable interest rate, the income percentage factors in the table in the annual notice published by the Secretary, and updated HHS Poverty Guidelines (if applicable).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> If a borrower's monthly payment is calculated to be greater than $0 but less than or equal to $5.00, the amount payable by the borrower is $5.00.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> For purposes of the annual recalculation described in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, after periods in which a borrower makes payments that are less than interest accrued on the loan, the payment amount is recalculated based upon unpaid accrued interest and the highest outstanding principal loan amount (including amount capitalized) calculated for that borrower while paying under the ICR plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> For each calendar year, the Secretary publishes in the Federal Register a revised income percentage factor table reflecting changes based on inflation. This revised table is developed by changing each of the dollar amounts contained in the table by a percentage equal to the estimated percentage changes in the Consumer Price Index (as determined by the Secretary) between December 1995 and the December next preceding the beginning of such calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Examples of the calculation of monthly repayment amounts and tables that show monthly repayment amounts for borrowers at various income and debt levels are included in the annual notice published by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> At the beginning of the repayment period under the ICR plan, the borrower must make monthly payments of the amount of interest that accrues on the borrower's Direct Loan until the Secretary calculates the borrower's monthly payment amount on the basis of the borrower's income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of married borrowers.

The Secretary may determine that special circumstances, such as a loss of employment by the borrower or the borrower's spouse, warrant an adjustment to the borrower's repayment obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Repayment period.

No later than six months prior to the anticipated date that the borrower will meet the forgiveness requirements, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An explanation that the borrower is approaching the date that he or she is expected to meet the requirements to receive loan forgiveness;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A reminder that the borrower must continue to make the borrower's scheduled monthly payments; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> General information on the current treatment of the forgiveness amount for tax purposes, and instructions for the borrower to contact the Internal Revenue Service for more information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The Secretary determines when a borrower has met the loan forgiveness requirements under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(D) of this section and does not require the borrower to submit a request for loan forgiveness.

the loan forgiveness requirements, the Secretary--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Notifies the borrower that the borrower's obligation on the loans is satisfied;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provides the information described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(D)(3) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Returns to the sender any payment received on a loan after loan forgiveness has been granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Limitation on capitalization of interest. If the amount of a borrower's monthly payment is less than the accrued interest, the unpaid interest is capitalized until the outstanding principal amount is 10 percent greater than the original principal amount. After the outstanding principal amount is 10 percent greater than the original amount, interest continues to accrue but is not capitalized.

The notification provides the borrower with--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The date, no earlier than 35 days before the end of the borrower's annual payment period, by which the Secretary must receive the documentation described in paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(A) of this section (annual deadline); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The consequences if the Secretary does not receive the information within 10 days following the annual deadline specified in the notice, including the borrower's new monthly payment amount as determined under paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(D) of this section, and the effective date for the recalculated monthly payment amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The Secretary designates the standard repayment plan for a borrower who initially selects the ICR plan but does not comply with the requirement in paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(A)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If, during a subsequent year that a borrower remains on the ICR plan,

the Secretary does not receive the documentation described in paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(A)(1) of this section within 10 days of the specified annual deadline, the Secretary recalculates the borrower's required monthly payment amount, unless the Secretary is able to determine the borrower's new monthly payment amount before the end of the borrower's current annual payment period. The maximum recalculated monthly amount the Secretary requires the borrower to repay is the amount the borrower would have paid under the standard repayment plan based on a 10-year repayment period using the amount of the borrower's loans that was outstanding at the time the borrower began repayment under the ICR plan. The repayment period based on the recalculated payment may exceed 10 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If the Secretary receives the documentation described in paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(A)(1) of this section within 10 days of the specified annual deadline--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary promptly determines the borrower's new scheduled monthly payment amount and maintains the borrower's current scheduled monthly payment amount until the new scheduled monthly payment amount is determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the new calculated monthly payment amount is less than the borrower's previously calculated monthly payment amount, and the borrower made payments at the previously calculated amount after the end of the most recent annual payment period, the Secretary makes the appropriate adjustment to the borrower's account. Notwithstanding Sec. 685.211(a)(3), the Secretary applies the excess payment amounts made after the end of the most recent annual payment period in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 685.211(a)(1), unless the borrower requests otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the new monthly payment amount is equal to or greater than the borrower's previously calculated monthly payment amount, and the borrower made payments at the previously calculated payment amount after the end of the most recent annual payment period, the Secretary does not make any adjustment to the borrower's account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any payments the borrower continued to make at the previously calculated payment amount after the end of the prior annual payment period and before the new monthly payment amount is calculated are considered to be qualifying payments for purposes of Sec. 685.219, provided that the payments otherwise meet the requirements described in Sec. 685.219(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The new annual payment period begins on the day after the end of the most recent annual payment period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)(1)</em> If the Secretary receives the documentation described in paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(A)(1) of this section more than 10 days after the specified annual deadline and the borrower's monthly payment amount is recalculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(D) of this section, the Secretary grants forbearance with respect to payments that are overdue or would be due at the time the new calculated monthly payment amount is determined, if the new monthly payment amount is $0.00 or is less than the borrower's previously calculated monthly payment amount.
