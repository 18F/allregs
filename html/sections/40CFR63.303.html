of emissions in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions from the charging operation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For charging operations, the owner or operator shall implement, for each day of operation, the work practices specified in Sec. 63.306(b)(6) and record the performance of the work practices as required in Sec. 63.306(b)(7).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> 0.0 percent leaking topside port lids, as determined by the procedures in Sec. 63.309(d)(1) (if applicable to the new nonrecovery coke oven battery); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> 0.0 percent leaking offtake system(s), as determined by the procedures in Sec. 63.309(d)(1) (if applicable to the new nonrecovery coke oven battery).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 63.304, the owner or operator of any nonrecovery coke oven battery shall meet the work practice standards in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator shall observe each coke oven door after charging and record the oven number of any door from which visible emissions occur.

damper setting during each charge to ensure that the damper is fully open.
