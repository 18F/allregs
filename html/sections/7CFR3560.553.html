These grant recipients will, in turn, assist other organizations to obtain loans and grants for the construction of farm labor housing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Technical assistance services may not be used to reimburse a nonprofit or public body applicant for technical services provided by a nonprofit organization, with housing and/or community development experience, to assist the nonprofit applicant entity in the development and packaging of its loan/grant docket and project. In addition, technical assistance will not be funded by the Agency when an identity of interest exists between the technical assistance provider and the loan or grant applicant.</p>
