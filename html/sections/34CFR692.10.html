The Secretary determines the ``average grant award  per student'' by dividing the total number of student recipients for all  States into the total amount of LEAP expenditures for all States,  including both the Federal allotments and the State funds matching those  allotments. In making this determination, the Secretary uses the most  current available data reported by each State.
