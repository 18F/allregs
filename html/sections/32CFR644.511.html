In any case where timber is being sold on a credit basis, if the bid is being questioned solely on the financial ability of the bidder and the bidder is a small business concern, the DE will notify the appropriate SBA field office immediately and follow the other procedures provided by Section III of the DOD-SBA Agreement. A certificate of competency issued by SBA will be honored in such cases.</p>
