(1) A licensee that  utilizes a bidding credit, and that during the initial term seeks to  assign or transfer control of a license to an entity that does not meet  the eligibility criteria for a bidding credit, will be required to  reimburse the U.S. Government for the amount of the bidding credit, plus  interest based on the rate for ten year U.S. Treasury obligations  applicable on the date the license was granted, as a condition of  Commission approval of the assignment or transfer. If, within the  initial term of the license, a licensee that utilizes a bidding credit  seeks to assign or transfer control of a license to an entity that is  eligible for a lower bidding credit, the difference between the bidding  credit obtained by the assigning party and the bidding credit for which  the acquiring party would qualify, plus interest based on the rate for  ten year U.S. Treasury obligations applicable on the date the license is  granted, must be paid to the U.S. Government as a condition of  Commission approval of the assignment or transfer. If, within the  initial term of the license, a licensee that utilizes a bidding credit  seeks to make any ownership change that would result in the licensee  losing eligibility for a bidding credit (or qualifying for a lower  bidding credit), the amount of the bidding credit (or the difference  between the bidding credit originally obtained and the bidding credit  for which the licensee would qualify after restructuring), plus interest  based on the rate for ten year U.S. Treasury obligations applicable on  the date the license is granted, must be paid to   the U.S. Government as a condition of Commission approval of the  assignment or transfer or of a reportable eligibility event (see  Sec. 1.2114).</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p>
