                                Sec. 2804.14  What is the processing fee for a grant application?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Unless you are exempt under Sec. 2804.16 of this subpart, you must pay a fee to BLM for the reasonable costs of processing your application before the Federal Government incurs them. The fees for Processing Categories 1 through 4 (see paragraph (b) of this section) are one-time fees and are not refundable. The fees are categorized based on an estimate of the amount of time that BLM will expend to process your application and issue a decision granting or denying the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> There is no processing fee if BLM's work is estimated to take one hour or less. Processing fees are based on categories. These categories and fees for 2005 are:</p><p class="depth2">2005 Processing Fee Schedule----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Processing fee per application as of June 21,</p><p class="depth2">Federal work hours    2005.

BLM will round these changes to the nearest dollar. BLM will update Category 5 processing fees as specified in the Master Agreement. You also may obtain a copy of the current schedule from any BLM state or field office or by writing: Director, BLM, 1849 C St., NW., Mail Stop 1000LS, Washington, DC 20240. BLM also posts the current schedule on the BLM Homepage on the Internet at http://www.blm.gov.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> After an initial review of your application, BLM will notify you of the processing category into which your application fits. You must then submit the appropriate payment for that category before BLM begins processing your application. Your signature on a cost recovery Master Agreement constitutes your agreement with the processing category decision. If you disagree with the category that BLM has determined for your application, you may appeal the decision under Sec. 2801.10 of this part. For Processing Categories 5 and 6 applications, see Sec. Sec. 2804.17, 2804.18, and 2804.19 of this subpart. If you paid the processing fee and you appeal a Processing Category 1 through 4 or a Processing Category 6 determination, BLM will process your application while the appeal is pending. If IBLA finds in your favor, you will receive a refund or adjustment of your processing fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In processing your application, BLM may determine at any time that the application requires preparing an EIS. If this occurs, BLM will send you a decision changing your processing category to Processing Category 6. You may appeal this decision under Sec. 2801.10 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> To expedite processing of your application, you may notify BLM in writing that you are waiving paying reasonable costs and are electing to pay the full actual costs incurred by BLM in processing your application and monitoring your grant.</p>
