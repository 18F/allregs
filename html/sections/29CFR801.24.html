                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The actual testing phase refers to that time during which the examiner administers the examination by using a polygraph instrument with respect to the examinee and then analyzes the charts derived from the test. Throughout the actual testing phase, the examiner shall not ask any question that was not presented in writing for review prior to the testing phase. An examiner may, however, recess the testing phase and return to the pre-test phase to review additional relevant questions with the examinee. In the case of an ongoing investigation, the examiner shall ensure that all relevant questions (as distinguished from technical baseline questions) pertain to the investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No testing period subject to the provisions of the Act shall be less than ninety minutes in length. Such ``test period'' begins at the time that the examiner begins informing the examinee of the nature and characteristics of the examination and the instruments involved, as prescribed in section 8(b) (2)(B) of the Act and Sec. 801.23 (a)(2) of this part, and ends when the examiner completes the review of the test results with the examinee as provided in Sec. 801.25 of this part. The ninety-minute minimum duration shall not apply if

the examinee voluntarily acts to terminate the test before the completion thereof, in which event the examiner may not render an opinion regarding the employee's truthfulness.</p>
