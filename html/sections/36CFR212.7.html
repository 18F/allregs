                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Existing or proposed forest roads that are or will be part of a  transportation system of a State, county, or other local public road  authority. Forest roads that are or will be part of a transportation  system of a State, county, or other local public road authority and are  on rights-of-way held by a State, county, or other local public road  authority may be constructed, reconstructed, improved, or maintained by  the Forest Service when there is an appropriate agreement with the  State, county, or other local public road authority under 23 U.S.C. 205  and the construction, reconstruction, improvement, or maintenance is  essential to provide safe and economical access to National Forest  System lands.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acquisition of easements and rights of use. Except as otherwise  provided in the regulations of this part, easements for road and trail  construction across non-Federal lands and easements or rights of use  over non-Federal roads and trails will be acquired in the name of the  United States of America and its assigns. The easements or rights of use  may be acquired by purchase, condemnation, donation, or as a reciprocal  for permits or easements for roads or trails to be constructed or for  easements over or permits to use existing roads or trails.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Methods of compensation for easements and rights of use acquired  by the United States. Compensation in negotiated acquisitions may be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By payment from appropriated funds;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pursuant to reservation in the grant of easement to the United  States whereby the grantor reserves the right to require haulers of  Federal timber or other Federal products over the road conveyed or  thereafter constructed by the grantor to make payments to the grantor in  accordance with the terms of the reservation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> By granting reciprocal rights; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> By a combination of these methods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cooperative construction and use agreements. Where areas, partly  lands administered by the Forest Service and partly private or other  ownership are undeveloped or inadequately developed by roads, the Chief  will, to the extent feasible and advantageous to the United States, join  in planning, constructing, reconstructing, improving, maintaining, and  using an adequate road system on the basis of each party bearing the  proportion of the cost attributable to the anticipated benefits as set  forth in Sec. 212.9.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Condemnation. Where access across non-Federal land or over a  non-Federal road or trail cannot be obtained through negotiations with  reasonable promptness, condemnation will be undertaken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Access over non-Federal land and use of non-Federal roads or  trails on a temporary basis. The Chief may negotiate a temporary  agreement for access over non-Federal land and for use of an existing  non-Federal road or trail where there is immediate need for temporary  access for limited purposes that can be economically met by such  procedure, or where the foreseeable need does not justify the  expenditures necessary to provide a permanent road or trail.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Use and control of interests in roads, trails, and easements  acquired by the United States. Interests in roads, trails, and easements  acquired by the United States shall be under the control of the United  States, subject to approved reservations, limitations and other  provisions set forth in the easement, permit, or other indenture. This  control by the United States may include restricting or conditioning the  use of the interest owned by the United States in the   road, trail, or easement where necessary.
