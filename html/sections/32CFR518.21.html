                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Fees for technical data. Technical data, other than technical data that discloses critical technology with military or space application, if required to be released under the FOIA, shall be released after the person requesting such technical data pays all reasonable costs attributed to search, duplication and review of the records to be released. Technical data, as used in this section, means recorded information, regardless of the form or method of the recording of a scientific or technical nature (including computer software documentation). This term does not include computer software, or data incidental to contract administration, such as financial and/or management information. Army Activities shall retain the amounts received by such a release, and it shall be merged with and available for the same purpose and the same time period as the appropriation from which the costs were incurred in complying with request. All reasonable costs as used in this sense are the full costs to the Federal Government of rendering the service, or fair market value of the service, whichever is higher. Fair market value shall be determined in accordance with commercial rates in the local geographical area. In the absence of a known market value, charges shall be based on recovery of full costs to the Federal Government. The full costs shall include all direct and indirect costs to conduct the search and to duplicate the records responsive to the request. This cost is to be differentiated from the direct costs allowable for other types of information released under the FOIA. DD Form 2086-1 will be used to annotate fees for technical data. The form is available through normal publication channels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Waiver. Activities shall waive the payment of costs described in paragraph (a) of this section, which are greater than the costs that would be required for release of this same information if the request is made by a citizen of the United States or a United States corporation, and such citizen or corporation certifies that the technical data requested is required to enable it to submit an offer, or determine whether it is capable of submitting an offer to provide the product to which the technical data relates to the United States or a contractor with the United States. However, Activities may require the citizen or corporation to pay a deposit in an amount equal to not more than the cost of complying with the request, which will be refunded upon submission of an offer by the citizen or corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The release of technical data is requested in order to comply with the terms of an international agreement; or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Activity determines that such a waiver is in the interest of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Fee rates--(1) Costs for a manual search of technical data.
