                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Individuals subject to work hour controls. Any individual who performs duties identified in Sec. 26.4(a)(1) through (a)(5) shall be subject to the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Calculating work hours. For the purposes of this section, a licensee shall calculate the work hours of individuals who are subject to this section as the amount of time the individuals perform duties for the licensee. Except as permitted by paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section, the calculated work hours must include all time performing duties for the licensee, including all within-shift break times and rest periods during which there are no reasonable opportunities or accommodations appropriate for restorative sleep.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Shift turnover. Licensees may exclude shift turnover from the calculation of an individual's work hours. Shift turnover includes only those activities that are necessary to safely transfer information and responsibilities between two or more individuals between shifts. Shift turnover activities may include, but are not limited to, discussions of the status of plant equipment, and the status of ongoing activities, such as extended tests of safety systems and components. Licensees may not exclude work hours worked during turnovers between individuals within a shift period due to rotations or relief within a shift. Activities that licensees may not exclude from work hours calculations also include, but are not limited to, shift holdovers to cover for late arrivals of incoming shift members; early arrivals of individuals for meetings, training, or pre-shift briefings for special evolutions; and holdovers for interviews needed for event investigations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within-shift break and rest periods. Licensees may exclude from the calculation of an individual's work hours only that portion of a break or rest period during which there is a reasonable opportunity and accommodations for restorative sleep (e.g., a nap).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Beginning or resuming duties subject to work hour controls. If an individual begins or resumes performing for the licensee any of the duties listed in Sec. 26.4(a) during the calculation period, the licensee shall include in the calculation of the individual's work hours all work hours worked for the licensee, including hours worked performing duties that are not listed in Sec. 26.4(a), and control the individual's work hours under the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Unannounced emergency preparedness exercises and drills. Licensees may exclude from the calculation of an individual's work hours the time the individual works unscheduled work hours for the purpose of participating in the actual conduct of an unannounced emergency preparedness exercise or drill.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Incidental duties performed off site. Licensees may exclude from the calculation of an individual's work hours unscheduled work performed off site (e.g., technical assistance provided by telephone from an individual's home), provided the total duration of the work does not exceed a nominal 30 minutes during any single break period. For the purposes of compliance with the minimum break requirements of Sec. 26.205(d)(2), and the minimum days off requirements of Sec. 26.205(d)(3) through (d)(5) or the maximum average work hours requirements of Sec. 26.205(d)(7), such duties do not constitute work periods, work shifts, or hours worked.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Work hours scheduling. Licensees shall schedule the work hours of individuals who are subject to this section consistent with the objective of preventing impairment from fatigue due to the duration, frequency, or sequencing of successive shifts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Work hour controls. Licensees shall control the work hours of individuals who are subject to this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as permitted in Sec. 26.207, licensees shall ensure that any individual's work hours do not exceed the following limits:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 16 work hours in any 24-hour period;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 26 work hours in any 48-hour period; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> 72 work hours in any 7-day period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Licensees shall ensure that individuals have, at a minimum, the rest breaks specified in this paragraph. For the purposes of this subpart, a break is defined as an interval of time that falls between successive work periods, during which the individual does not perform any duties for the licensee other than one period of shift turnover at either the beginning or end of a shift but not both. Except as permitted in Sec. 26.207, licensees shall ensure that individuals have, at a minimum--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A 10-hour break between successive work periods or an 8-hour break between successive work periods when a break of less than 10 hours is necessary to accommodate a crew's scheduled transition between work schedules or shifts; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A 34-hour break in any 9-day period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Licensees shall either ensure that individuals have, at a minimum, the number of days off specified in this

paragraph, or comply with the requirements for maximum average workhours in Sec. 26.205(d)(7). For the purposes of this section, a day off is defined as a calendar day during which an individual does not start a work shift. For the purposes of calculating the average number of days off required in this paragraph, the duration of the shift cycle may not exceed 6 weeks.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Individuals who are working 8-hour shift schedules shall have at least 1 day off per week, averaged over the shift cycle;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Individuals who are working 10-hour shift schedules shall have at least 2 days off per week, averaged over the shift cycle;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Individuals who are working 12-hour shift schedules while performing the duties described in Sec. 26.4(a)(1) through (a)(3) shall have at least 2.5 days off per week, averaged over the shift cycle;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Individuals who are working 12-hour shift schedules while performing the duties described in Sec. 26.4(a)(4) shall have at least 2 days off per week, averaged over the shift cycle; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Individuals who are working 12-hour shift schedules while performing the duties described in Sec. 26.4(a)(5) shall have at least 3 days off per week, averaged over the shift cycle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> During the first 60 days of a unit outage, licensees need not meet the requirements of Sec. 26.205(d)(3) or (d)(7) for individuals specified in Sec. 26.4(a)(1) through (a)(4), while those individuals are working on outage activities. However, the licensee shall ensure that the individuals specified in Sec. 26.4(a)(1) through (a)(3) have at least 3 days off in each successive (i.e., non-rolling) 15-day period and that the individuals specified in Sec. 26.4(a)(4) have at least 1 day off in any 7-day period;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> During the first 60 days of a unit outage, security system outage, or increased threat condition, licensees shall control the hours worked by individuals specified in Sec. 26.4(a)(5) as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> During the first 60 days of a unit outage or a planned security system outage, licensees need not meet the requirements of Sec. 26.205(d)(3) or (d)(7). However, licensees shall ensure that these individuals have at least 4 days off in each successive (i.e., non-rolling) 15-day period; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> During the first 60 days of an unplanned security system outage or increased threat condition, licensees need not meet the requirements of Sec. 26.205(d)(3), (d)(5)(i), or (d)(7).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The 60-day periods in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section may be extended for each individual in 7-day increments for each non-overlapping 7-day period the individual has worked not more than 48 hours during the unit or security system outage or increased threat condition, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Licensees may, as an alternative to complying with the minimum days off requirements in Sec. 26.205(d)(3), comply with the requirements for maximum average work hours in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Individuals may not work more than a weekly average of 54 hours, calculated using an averaging period of up to six (6) weeks, which advances by 7 consecutive calendar days at the finish of every averaging period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this section, when an individual's work shift starts at the end of a calendar day and concludes during the next calendar day, the licensee shall either consider the hours worked during that entire shift as if they were all worked on the day the shift started, or attribute the hours to the calendar days on which the hours were actually worked.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each licensee shall state, in its FFD policy and procedures required by Sec. 26.27 and Sec. 26.203(a) and (b), the work hour counting system in Sec. 26.205(d)(7)(ii) the licensee is using.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Each licensee shall state, in its FFD policy and procedures required by Sec. 26.27 and Sec. 26.203(a) and (b), the requirements with which the licensee is complying: the minimum days off requirements in Sec. 26.205(d)(3) or maximum average work hours requirements in Sec. 26.205(d)(7).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reviews. Licensees shall evaluate the effectiveness of their control of work hours of individuals who are subject to this section. Licensees shall conduct the reviews once per calendar year. If any plant or security system outages or increased threat conditions occurred since the licensee completed the most recent review, the licensee

shall include in the review an evaluation of the control of work hours during the outages or increased threat conditions. Licensees shall complete the review within 30 days of the end of the review period. Licensees shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Review the actual work hours and performance of individuals who are subject to this section for consistency with the requirements of Sec. 26.205(c). At a minimum, this review must address--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Individuals whose actual hours worked during the review period exceeded an average of 54 hours per week in any shift cycle while the individuals' work hours are subject to the requirements of Sec. 26.205(d)(3) or in any averaging period of up to 6 weeks, using the same averaging period durations that the licensee uses to control the individuals' work hours, while the individuals' work hours are subject to the requirements of Sec. 26.205(d)(7);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Individuals who were granted more than one waiver during the review period; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Individuals who were assessed for fatigue under Sec. 26.211 during the review period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Review individuals' hours worked and the waivers under which work was performed to evaluate staffing adequacy for all jobs subject to the work hour controls of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Document the methods used to conduct the review and the results of the review; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Record, trend, and correct, under the licensee's corrective action program, any problems identified in maintaining control of work hours consistent with the specific requirements and performance objectives of this part.
