submit evidence of FCC registration of the C-band downlink prior to the release of Federal funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any FCC authorization required for the project must be in the name of the applicant for the PTFP grant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the project is to be associated with an existing station, the FCC operating authority for that station must be current and valid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For any project requiring new authorization(s) from the FCC, the applicant must file a copy of each FCC application and any amendments with the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the applicant fails to file the required FCC application(s) by the closing date, or if the FCC returns, dismisses, or denies an application required for the project or any part thereof, or for the operation of the station with which the project is associ ated, the Agency may reject and return the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> No grant will be awarded until confirmation has been received from the FCC that any necessary authorization will be issued.</p>
