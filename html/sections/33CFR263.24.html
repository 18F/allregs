Work under this authority is limited to clearing and snagging or channel excavation and improvement with limited embankment construction by use of materials from the channel excavation. If investigation indicates that placement of revetment is needed to provide a complete and fully effective project, the local interests should provide for the item of construction either by work or by cash contribution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Local cooperation. The provisions of Sec. 263.23(d) are applicable.</p>
