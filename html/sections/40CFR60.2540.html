                                Sec. 60.2540  Are there any State plan requirements for this subpart
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Yes. Subpart B establishes general requirements for developing and processing section 111(d) plans. This subpart applies instead of the requirements in subpart B of this part for paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> State plans developed to implement this subpart must be as protective as the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. State plans must require all CISWI units to comply by the dates specified in Sec. 60.2535. This applies instead of the option for case-by-case less stringent emission standards and longer compliance schedules in Sec. 60.24(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> State plans developed to implement this subpart are required to include two increments of progress for the affected CISWI units. These two minimum increments are the final control plan submittal date and final compliance date in Sec. 60.21(h)(1) and (5). This applies instead of the requirement of Sec. 60.24(e)(1) that would require a State plan to include all five increments of progress for all CISWI units.
