L. 93-638 and the Solicitor has determined that the services of his office are not available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When a tribe determines it critical, and the Assistant Secretary--Indian Affairs finds the concerns of the tribe to have merit after consultation with and the advice of the Solicitor, to intervene, in a lawsuit being handled by the Justice Department or in an administrative proceeding being handled by the Solicitor because the responsible Government Attorney refuses either to exclude or to include some facet of the suit or proceedings which the tribe claims renders such legal representation completely inadequate to protect or in contravention of the rights and interests of the tribe. Prior to consulting with and advising the Assistant Secretary--Indian Affairs, in a lawsuit being handled by the Justice Department, the Solicitor shall seek the comments and advice of the Attorney General.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When a tribe determines, and the Assistant Secretary--Indian Affairs, after consultation with the Solicitor concurs, that a substantial possibility of a negotiated settlement or agreement exists.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Payment of fees will not be allowed if such payment was not authorized before services were performed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> This rule applies to expenditure of appropriated Federal funds and not a tribe's own funds on deposit in the U.S. Treasury.</p>
