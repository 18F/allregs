To make this determination, you must use at least one of the four compliance options listed in Table 1 of this section. You may apply any of the compliance options to an individual coil coating line, or to multiple lines as a group, or to the entire affected source. You may use different compliance options for different coil coating lines, or at different times on the same line. However, you may not use different compliance options at the same time on the same coil coating line. If you switch between compliance options for any coil coating line or group of lines, you must document this switch as required by Sec. 63.5190(a), and you must report it in the next semiannual compliance report required in Sec. 63.5180.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1 to Sec. 63.5170--Compliance Demonstration Requirements Index------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">If you choose to demonstrate</p><p class="depth0">compliance by:               Then you must demonstrate that:------------------------------------------------------------------------1.
