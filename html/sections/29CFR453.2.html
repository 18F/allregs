There is no provision in the Act which  precludes the bonding of such personnel in amounts exceeding those  specified in section 502(a). Similarly, the Act contains no provision  precluding the bonding of such personnel as are not required to be  bonded by this section. Such excess coverage may be in any amount and in  any form otherwise lawful and acceptable to the parties to such bonds.  [28 FR 14394, Dec. 27, 1963, as amended at 30 FR 14925, Dec. 2, 1965]</p>
