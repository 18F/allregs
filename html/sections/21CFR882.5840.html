                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. An implanted intracerebral/subcortical stimulator for pain relief is a device that applies electrical current to subsurface areas of a patient's brain to treat severe intractable pain. The stimulator consists of an implanted receiver with electrodes that are placed within a patient's brain and an external transmitter for transmitting the stimulating pulses across the patient's skin to the implanted receiver.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class III (premarket approval).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Date premarket approval application (PMA) or notice of completion of a product development protocol (PDP) is required. A PMA or a notice of completion of a PDP is required to be filed with the Food and Drug Administration on or before March 1, 1989, for any implanted intracerebral/subcortical stimulator for pain relief that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or that has on or before March 1, 1989, been found to be substantially equivalent to an implanted intracerebral/subcortical stimulator for pain relief that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. Any other implanted intracerebral/subcortical stimulator for pain relief shall have an approved PMA or a declared completed PDP in effect before being placed in commercial distribution.
