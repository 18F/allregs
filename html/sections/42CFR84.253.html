Sec.  84.206 and 84.207,  the minimum requirements and performance tests for chemical-cartridge  respirators prescribed in Subpart L of this part are applicable to  replaceable-cartridge and single-use vinyl chloride chemical-cartridge  respirators.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following bench tests are applicable to cartridges designed  for use with chemical-cartridge respirators for entry into and escape  from vinyl chloride atmospheres containing adequate oxygen to support  life:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where two cartridges are used in parallel on a chemical- cartridge respirator, the bench test requirements will apply to the  combination rather than the individual cartridges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Four cartridges or pairs of cartridges will be equilibrated at  25 5 [deg]C by passing 85 5  percent relative humidity air through them at 25 liters per minute for  six hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The equilibrated cartridges will be resealed, kept in an upright  position, at room temperature, and tested according to paragraphs (b)(4)  and (b)(5) of this section for other than single-use respirators or  according to paragraphs (b)(6) and (b)(7) of this section for single-use  respirators within 18 hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The cartridges or pairs of cartridges for other than single-use  respirators, equilibrated and stored as described in paragraphs (b)(1),  (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section, will be tested on an apparatus that  allows the test atmosphere at 85 5 percent  relative humidity and 25 5 [deg]C, to enter the  cartridges or pairs of cartridges continuously at a concentration of 10  ppm vinyl chloride monomer at a total flowrate of 64 liters per minute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The maximum allowable penetration after 90 minutes testing of  cartridges or pairs of cartridges for other than single-use respirators,  according   to paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall not exceed 1 ppm vinyl  chloride.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The single-use respirators, equilibrated and stored as described  in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, will be tested on an  apparatus that allows a test atmosphere at 85 5  percent relative humidity and 25 5 [deg]C to be  cycled through the respirator by a breathing machine at a concentration  of 10 ppm vinyl chloride monomer at the rate of 24 respirations per  minute at a minute volume of 40 0.6 liters.
