                            <p class="depth0">The terms and definitions contained in 33 CFR Parts 320 through 330  are applicable to this part. In addition, the following terms are  defined for the purposes of this part:</p><p class="depth0">Affected party means a permit applicant, landowner, a lease,  easement or option holder (i.e., an individual who has an identifiable  and substantial legal interest in the property) who has received an  approved JD, permit denial, or has declined a proffered individual  permit.</p><p class="depth0">Agent(s) means the affected party's business partner, attorney,  consultant, engineer, planner, or any individual with legal authority to  represent the appellant's interests.</p><p class="depth0">Appealable action means an approved JD, a permit denial, or a  declined permit, as these terms are defined in this section.</p><p class="depth0">Appellant means an affected party who has filed an appeal of an  approved JD, a permit denial or declined permit under the criteria and  procedures of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Approved jurisdictional determination means a Corps document stating  the presence or absence of waters of the United States on a parcel or a  written statement and map identifying the limits of waters of the United  States on a parcel. Approved JDs are clearly designated appealable  actions and will include a basis of JD with the document.</p><p class="depth0">Basis of jurisdictional determination is a summary of the indicators  that support the Corps approved JD. Indicators supporting the Corps  approved JD can include, but are not limited to: indicators of wetland  hydrology, hydric soils, and hydrophytic plant communities; indicators  of ordinary high water marks, high tide lines, or mean high water marks;  indicators of adjacency to navigable or interstate waters; indicators  that the wetland or waterbody is of part of a tributary system; or  indicators of linkages between isolated water bodies and interstate or  foreign commerce.</p><p class="depth0">Declined permit means a proffered individual permit, including a  letter of permission, that an applicant has refused to accept, because  he has objections to the terms and special conditions therein. A  declined permit can also be an individual permit that the applicant  originally accepted, but where such permit was subsequently modified by  the district engineer, pursuant to 33 CFR 325.7, in such a manner that  the resulting permit contains terms and special conditions that lead the  applicant to decline the modified permit, provided that the applicant  has not started work in waters of the United States authorized by such  permit. Where an applicant declines a permit (either initial or  modified), the applicant does not have a valid permit to conduct  regulated activities in waters of the United States, and must not begin  construction of the work requiring a Corps permit unless and until the  applicant receives and accepts a valid Corps permit.</p><p class="depth0">Denial determination means a letter from the district engineer  detailing the reasons a permit was denied with prejudice. The decision  document for the project will be attached to the denial determination in  all cases.</p><p class="depth0">Jurisdictional determination (JD) means a written Corps  determination that a wetland and/or waterbody is subject to regulatory  jurisdiction under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344)  or a written determination that a waterbody is subject to regulatory  jurisdiction under Section 9 or 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899  (33 U.S.C. 401 et seq.). Additionally, the term includes a written  reverification of expired JDs and a written reverification of JDs where  new information has become available that may affect the previously  written determination. For example, such geographic JDs may include, but  are not limited to, one or more of the following determinations: the  presence or absence of wetlands; the location(s) of the wetland  boundary, ordinary high water mark, mean high water mark, and/or high  tide line; interstate commerce nexus for isolated waters; and adjacency  of wetlands to other waters of the United States. All JDs will be in  writing and will be identified as either preliminary or approved. JDs do  not include determinations that a particular activity requires a DA  permit.</p><p class="depth0">Notification of Appeal Process (NAP) means a fact sheet that  explains the criteria and procedures of the administrative appeal  process. Every approved JD, permit denial, and every proffered  individual permit returned for reconsideration after review by the  district engineer in accordance with Sec. 331.6(b) will have an NAP form  attached.</p><p class="depth0">Notification of Applicant Options (NAO) means a fact sheet  explaining an applicant's options with a proffered individual permit  under the administrative appeal process.</p><p class="depth0">Permit denial means a written denial with prejudice (see 33 CFR  320.4(j)) of an individual permit application as defined in 33 CFR  325.5(b).</p><p class="depth0">Preliminary JDs are written indications that there may be waters of  the United States on a parcel or indications of the approximate  location(s) of waters of the United States on a parcel. Preliminary JDs  are advisory in nature and may not be appealed. Preliminary JDs include  compliance orders that have an implicit JD, but no approved JD.</p><p class="depth0">Proffered permit means a permit that is sent to an applicant that is  in the proper format for the applicant to sign (for a standard permit)  or accept (for a letter of permission). The term ``initial proffered  permit'' as used in this part refers to the first time a permit is sent  to the applicant. The initial proffered permit is not an appealable  action. However, the applicant may object to the terms or conditions of  the initial proffered permit and, if so, a second reconsidered permit  will be sent to the applicant. The term ``proffered permit'' as used in  this part refers to the second permit that is sent to the applicant.  Such proffered permit is an appealable action.</p><p class="depth0">Request for appeal (RFA) means the affected party's official request  to initiate the appeal process. The RFA must include the name of the  affected party, the Corps file number of the approved JD, denied permit,  or declined permit, the reason(s) for the appeal, and any supporting  data and information. No new information may be submitted. A grant of  right of entry for   the Corps to the project site is a condition of the RFA to allow the RO  to clarify elements of the record or to conduct field tests or sampling  for purposes directly related to the appeal. A standard RFA form will be  provided to the affected party with the NAP form. For appeals of  decisions related to unauthorized activities a signed tolling agreement,  as required by 33 CFR 326.3(e)(1)(v), must be included with the RFA,  unless a signed tolling agreement has previously been furnished to the  Corps district office. The affected party initiates the administrative  appeal process by providing an acceptable RFA to the appropriate Corps  of Engineers division office. An acceptable RFA contains all the  required information and provides reasons for appeal that meets the  criteria identified in Sec. 331.5.</p><p class="depth0">Review officer (RO) means the Corps official responsible for  assisting the division engineer or higher authority responsible for  rendering the final decision on the merits of an appeal.</p><p class="depth0">Tolling agreement refers to a document signed by any person who  appeals an approved JD associated with an unauthorized activity or  applies for an after-the-fact (ATF) permit, where the application is  accepted and evaluated by the Corps. The agreement states that the  affected party agrees to have the statute of limitations regarding any  violation associated with that approved JD or application ``tolled'' or  temporarily set aside until one year after the final Corps decision, as  defined at Sec. 331.10. No ATF permit application or administrative  appeal associated with an unauthorized activity will be accepted until a  tolling agreement is furnished to the district engineer.</p>
