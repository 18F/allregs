                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Occupation of field. To enhance safety and soundness and to  enable Federal savings associations to conduct their fiduciary  activities in accordance with the best practices of thrift institutions  in the United States (by efficiently delivering fiduciary services to  the public free from undue regulatory duplication and burden), OTS  occupies the field of the regulation of the fiduciary activities of  Federal savings associations. In so doing, OTS intends to give Federal  savings associations maximum flexibility to exercise their fiduciary  powers in accordance with a uniform scheme of Federal regulation.  Accordingly, Federal savings associations may exercise fiduciary powers  as authorized under Federal law, including this part, without regard to  State laws that purport to regulate or otherwise affect their fiduciary  activities, except to the extent provided in 12 U.S.C. 1464(n) (State  laws regarding scope of fiduciary powers, access to examination reports  regarding trust activities, deposits of securities, oaths and  affidavits, and capital) or in paragraph (c) of this section. For  purposes of this section, ``State law'' includes any State statute,  regulation, ruling, order, or judicial decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Illustrative examples. Examples of State laws that are preempted  by the HOLA and this section include those regarding:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Registration and licensing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Recordkeeping;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Advertising and marketing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The ability of a federal savings association conducting  fiduciary activities to maintain an action or proceeding in State court;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Fiduciary-related fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> State laws that are not preempted. State laws of the following  types are not preempted to the extent that they   only incidentally affect the fiduciary operations of Federal savings  associations or are otherwise consistent with the purposes of paragraph  (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contract and commercial law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Real property law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Tort law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Criminal law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Probate law; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any other law that OTS, upon review, finds:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Furthers a vital State interest; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Either has only an incidental effect on fiduciary operations or  is not otherwise contrary to the purposes expressed in paragraph (a) of  this section.  [67 FR 76299, Dec. 12, 2002, as amended at 68 FR 53026, Sept. 9, 2003]</p>
