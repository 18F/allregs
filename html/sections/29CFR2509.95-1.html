                                Sec. 2509.95-1  Interpretive bulletin relating to the fiduciary  defined benefit pension plan.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This Interpretive Bulletin provides guidance concerning  certain fiduciary standards under part 4 of title I of the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. 1104-1114,  applicable to the selection of an annuity provider for the purpose of  benefit distributions from a defined benefit pension plan (hereafter  ``pension plan'') when the pension plan intends to transfer liability  for benefits to an annuity   provider. For guidance applicable to the selection of an annuity  provider for benefit distributions from an individual account plan see  29 CFR 2550.404a-4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In General. Generally, when a pension plan purchases an annuity  from an insurer as a distribution of benefits, it is intended that the  plan's liability for such benefits is transferred to the annuity  provider. The Department's regulation defining the term ``participant  covered under the plan'' for certain purposes under title I of ERISA  recognizes that such a transfer occurs when the annuity is issued by an  insurance company licensed to do business in a State. 29 CFR 2510.3- 3(d)(2)(ii). Although the regulation does not define the term  ``participant'' or ``beneficiary'' for purposes of standing to bring an  action under ERISA Sec. 502(a), 29 U.S.C. 1132(a), it makes clear that  the purpose of a benefit distribution annuity is to transfer the plan's  liability with respect to the individual's benefits to the annuity  provider.</p><p class="depth2">Pursuant to ERISA section 404(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. 1104(a)(1),  fiduciaries must discharge their duties with respect to the plan solely  in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries. Section  404(a)(1)(A), 29 U.S.C. 1104(a)(1)(A), states that the fiduciary must  act for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to the participants  and beneficiaries and defraying reasonable plan administration expenses.  In addition, section 404(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. 1104(a)(1)(B), requires a  fiduciary to act with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the  prevailing circumstances that a prudent person acting in a like capacity  and familiar with such matters would use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Selection of Annuity Providers. The selection of an annuity  provider for purposes of a pension benefit distribution, whether upon  separation or retirement of a participant or upon the termination of a  plan, is a fiduciary decision governed by the provisions of part 4 of  title I of ERISA. In discharging their obligations under section  404(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. 1104(a)(1), to act solely in the interest of  participants and beneficiaries and for the exclusive purpose of  providing benefits to the participants and beneficiaries as well as  defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan, fiduciaries  choosing an annuity provider for the purpose of making a benefit  distribution must take steps calculated to obtain the safest annuity  available, unless under the circumstances it would be in the interests  of participants and beneficiaries to do otherwise. In addition, the  fiduciary obligation of prudence, described at section 404(a)(1)(B), 29  U.S.C. 1104(a)(1)(B), requires, at a minimum, that plan fiduciaries  conduct an objective, thorough and analytical search for the purpose of  identifying and selecting providers from which to purchase annuities. In  conducting such a search, a fiduciary must evaluate a number of factors  relating to a potential annuity provider's claims paying ability and  creditworthiness. Reliance solely on ratings provided by insurance  rating services would not be sufficient to meet this requirement. In  this regard, the types of factors a fiduciary should consider would  include, among other things:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The quality and diversification of the annuity provider's  investment portfolio;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The size of the insurer relative to the proposed contract;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The level of the insurer's capital and surplus;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The lines of business of the annuity provider and other  indications of an insurer's exposure to liability;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The structure of the annuity contract and guarantees supporting  the annuities, such as the use of separate accounts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The availability of additional protection through state guaranty  associations and the extent of their guarantees. Unless they possess the  necessary expertise to evaluate such factors, fiduciaries would need to  obtain the advice of a qualified, independent expert. A fiduciary may  conclude, after conducting an appropriate search, that more than one  annuity provider is able to offer the safest annuity available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Costs and Other Considerations. The Department recognizes that  there are situations where it may be in the interest of the participants  and beneficiaries to purchase other than the safest available annuity.  Such situations may occur where the safest available annuity is only  marginally safer, but disproportionately more expensive than competing  annuities, and the participants and beneficiaries are likely to bear a  significant portion of that increased cost. For example, where the  participants in a terminating pension plan are likely to receive, in the  form of increased benefits, a substantial share of the cost savings that  would result from choosing a competing annuity, it may be in the  interest of the participants to choose the competing annuity. It may  also be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries to choose  a competing annuity of the annuity provider offering the safest  available annuity is unable to demonstrate the ability to administer the  payment of benefits to the participants and beneficiaries. The  Department notes, however, that increased cost or other considerations  could never justify putting the benefits of annuitized participants and  beneficiaries at risk by purchasing an unsafe annuity.</p><p class="depth2">In contrast to the above, a fiduciary's decision to purchase more  risky, lower-priced annuities in order to ensure or maximize a reversion  of excess assets that will be paid solely to the employer-sponsor in  connection with the termination of an over-funded pension plan would  violate the fiduciary's duties under ERISA to act solely in the interest  of the plan participants and beneficiaries. In   such circumstances, the interests of those participants and  beneficiaries who will receive annuities lies in receiving the safest  annuity available and other participants and beneficiaries have no  countervailing interests. The fiduciary in such circumstances must make  diligent efforts to assure that the safest available annuity is  purchased.</p><p class="depth2">Similarly, a fiduciary may not purchase a riskier annuity solely  because there are insufficient assets in a defined benefit plan to  purchase a safer annuity. The fiduciary may have to condition the  purchase of annuities on additional employer contributions sufficient to  purchase the safest available annuity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Conflicts of Interest. Special care should be taken in reversion  situations where fiduciaries selecting the annuity provider have an  interest in the sponsoring employer which might affect their judgment  and therefore create the potential for a violation of ERISA  Sec. 406(b)(1). As a practical matter, many fiduciaries have this  conflict of interest and therefore will need to obtain and follow  independent expert advice calculated to identify those insurers with the  highest claims-paying ability willing to write the business.
