                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. As part of the program required in accordance with this part, an employer shall adopt and comply with a program to conduct periodic oversight tests and inspections to determine if safety-related railroad employees comply with Federal railroad safety laws, regulations, and orders particular to FRA-regulated personal and work group safety. The program of periodic oversight shall commence on

the day the employer files its program with FRA pursuant to Sec. 243.101(a) or on the day the employer commences operations pursuant to Sec. 243.101(b). The data gathered through the testing and inspection components of the program shall be used to determine whether systemic performance gaps exist, and to determine if modifications to the training component of the program are appropriate to close those gaps.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Locomotive engineer and conductor oversight exception. Periodic oversight specified in this section is not required for employees covered by parts 240 and 242 of this chapter, but a railroad shall use results of the assessments required by those parts to determine if changes in its training programs are necessary to close any proficiency gaps found during those assessments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Railroad oversight. Each railroad shall identify supervisory employees, by category or subcategory, responsible for conducting periodic oversight tests and inspections for the safety-related railroad employees that it authorizes to perform safety-related duties on its property, except a railroad is not required to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide oversight for a contractor's safety-related railroad employees if that contractor is required to conduct its own periodic oversight because it meets the criteria specified in paragraph (g) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide oversight for categories or subcategories of a contractor's safety-related railroad employees if the railroad does not employ supervisory employees who are qualified as safety-related railroad employees in those categories or subcategories; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide oversight for any supervisory employee identified by the railroad as responsible for conducting oversight in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Operational test exception for a railroad. A railroad is not required to perform operational tests of safety-related railroad employees employed by a contractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Railroad oversight for contractors. A railroad may choose to require supervisory employees to perform oversight of safety-related railroad employees employed by a contractor either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When oversight test and inspection sessions are scheduled specifically to determine if safety-related employees are in compliance with Federal railroad safety laws, regulations, and orders particular to FRA-regulated personal and work group safety; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a qualified railroad supervisory employee's duties place this person in the vicinity of one or more safety-related railroad employees employed by a contractor and performing the oversight would result in minimal disruption of this person's other assigned duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Railroad's duty to notify contractor of non-compliance. A railroad that finds evidence of contractor employee non-compliance with Federal railroad safety laws, regulations, and orders particular to FRA-regulated personal and work group safety during the periodic oversight shall provide that employee and that employee's employer with details of the non-compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Contractor oversight. Each contractor shall conduct periodic oversight tests and inspections of its safety-related railroad employees provided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A contractor employs more than 15 safety-related railroad employees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A contractor relies on training it directly provides to its own employees as the basis for qualifying those employees to perform safety-related duties on a railroad; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A contractor employs supervisory safety-related railroad employees capable of performing oversight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Oversight divided by agreement. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (g) of this section, a railroad and a contractor may agree that the contractor will provide the oversight by specifying in the program that the railroad has trained the contractor employees responsible for training and oversight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Detailed records required. Each employer that conducts periodic oversight in accordance with this section must keep a record of the date, time, place, and result of each test or inspection. The records shall specify each person administering tests and inspections, and each person tested. The record shall also provide a method to record whether the employee complied with

the monitored duties, and any interventions used to remediate non-compliance. Modifications of the program required by Sec. 217.9 of this chapter may be used in lieu of this oversight program, provided a railroad specifies it has done so in its program submitted in accordance with this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Additional records requirement. Records required under this section are subject to the requirements of Sec. 243.203.</p>
