Such notice does not relieve the registrant from obtaining the approval required under this subchapter for the export of defense articles or defense services to a foreign person, including the approval required prior to disclosing technical data. Such notice provides the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls with the information necessary to determine whether the authority of Sec. 38(g)(6) of the Arms Export Control Act regarding licenses or other approvals for certain sales or transfers of defense articles or data on the U.S. Munitions List should be invoked (see Sec. Sec. 120.10 and 126.1(e) of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The new entity formed when a registrant merges with another company or acquires, or is acquired by, another company or a subsidiary or division of another company shall advise the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The new firm name and all previous firm names being disclosed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The registration number that will survive and those that are to be discontinued (if any);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The license numbers of all approvals on which unshipped balances will be shipped under the surviving registration number, since any license not the subject of notification will be considered invalid; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Amendments to agreements approved by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls to change the name of a party to those agreements. The registrant must, within 60 days of this notification, provide to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls a signed copy of an amendment to each agreement signed by the new U.S. entity, the former U.S. licensor and the foreign licensee. Any agreements not so amended will be considered invalid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prior approval by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls is required for any amendment making a substantive change.
