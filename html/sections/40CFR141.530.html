                                Sec.  141.530  What is a disinfection profile and who must develop one?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A disinfection profile is a graphical representation of your system's level of Giardia lamblia or virus inactivation

measured during the course of a year. If you are a subpart H community or non-transient non-community water system which serves fewer than 10,000 persons, your system must develop a disinfection profile unless your State determines that your system's profile is unnecessary. Your State may approve the use of a more representative data set for disinfection profiling than the data set required under Sec. Sec.  141.532-141.536.
