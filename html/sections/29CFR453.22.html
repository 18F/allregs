Similarly, it appears that the provisions  of that section do not require the bonding of brokers or other  independent contractors who have contracted with labor organizations or  trusts for the performance of functions which are normally not carried  out by such labor organizations' or trusts' own officials or employees,  such as the buying of securities, the performance of other investment  functions, or the transportation of funds by armored truck. \12\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\12\ See Sec. 453.6(b). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
