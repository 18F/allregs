If the tag or mark comes off of the specified part the person in possession of the part shall have 30 days to present the part and broken tag or other marking device to the Service or the Service's authorized local representative for remarking or retagging purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Marks and tags for skins, skulls, and tusks will be provided by the Service.
