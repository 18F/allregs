                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General criteria for charging. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A sponsor must meet the  applicable requirements in paragraph (b) of this section for charging in  a clinical trial or paragraph (c) of this section for charging for  expanded access to an investigational drug for treatment use under  subpart I of this part, except that sponsors need not fulfill the  requirements in this section to charge for an approved drug obtained  from another entity not affiliated with the sponsor for use as part of  the clinical trial evaluation (e.g., in a clinical trial of a new use of  the approved drug, for use of the approved drug as an active control).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A sponsor must justify the amount to be charged in accordance  with paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A sponsor must obtain prior written authorization from FDA to  charge for an investigational drug.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> FDA will withdraw authorization to charge if it determines that  charging is interfering with the development of a drug for marketing  approval or   that the criteria for the authorization are no longer being met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Charging in a clinical trial--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Charging for a sponsor's drug.  A sponsor who wishes to charge for its investigational drug, including  investigational use of its approved drug, must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provide evidence that the drug has a potential clinical benefit  that, if demonstrated in the clinical investigations, would provide a  significant advantage over available products in the diagnosis,  treatment, mitigation, or prevention of a disease or condition;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Demonstrate that the data to be obtained from the clinical  trial would be essential to establishing that the drug is effective or  safe for the purpose of obtaining initial approval of a drug, or would  support a significant change in the labeling of an approved drug (e.g.,  new indication, inclusion of comparative safety information); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Demonstrate that the clinical trial could not be conducted  without charging because the cost of the drug is extraordinary to the  sponsor. The cost may be extraordinary due to manufacturing complexity,  scarcity of a natural resource, the large quantity of drug needed (e.g.,  due to the size or duration of the trial), or some combination of these  or other extraordinary circumstances (e.g., resources available to a  sponsor).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Duration of charging in a clinical trial. Unless FDA specifies a  shorter period, charging may continue for the length of the clinical  trial.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Charging for expanded access to investigational drug for  treatment use. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A sponsor who wishes to charge for expanded access to  an investigational drug for treatment use under subpart I of this part  must provide reasonable assurance that charging will not interfere with  developing the drug for marketing approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For expanded access under Sec. 312.320 (treatment IND or  treatment protocol), such assurance must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Evidence of sufficient enrollment in any ongoing clinical  trial(s) needed for marketing approval to reasonably assure FDA that the  trial(s) will be successfully completed as planned;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Evidence of adequate progress in the development of the drug  for marketing approval; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Information submitted under the general investigational plan  (Sec. 312.23(a)(3)(iv)) specifying the drug development milestones the  sponsor plans to meet in the next year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The authorization to charge is limited to the number of patients  authorized to receive the drug under the treatment use, if there is a  limitation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Unless FDA specifies a shorter period, charging for expanded  access to an investigational drug for treatment use under subpart I of  this part may continue for 1 year from the time of FDA authorization. A  sponsor may request that FDA reauthorize charging for additional  periods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Costs recoverable when charging for an investigational drug. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  A sponsor may recover only the direct costs of making its  investigational drug available.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Direct costs are costs incurred by a sponsor that can be  specifically and exclusively attributed to providing the drug for the  investigational use for which FDA has authorized cost recovery. Direct  costs include costs per unit to manufacture the drug (e.g., raw  materials, labor, and nonreusable supplies and equipment used to  manufacture the quantity of drug needed for the use for which charging  is authorized) or costs to acquire the drug from another manufacturing  source, and direct costs to ship and handle (e.g., store) the drug.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Indirect costs include costs incurred primarily to produce the  drug for commercial sale (e.g., costs for facilities and equipment used  to manufacture the supply of investigational drug, but that are  primarily intended to produce large quantities of drug for eventual  commercial sale) and research and development, administrative, labor, or  other costs that would be incurred even if the clinical trial or  treatment use for which charging is authorized did not occur.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For expanded access to an investigational drug for treatment use  under Sec. Sec. 312.315 (intermediate-size patient populations) and  312.320 (treatment IND or treatment protocol), in addition to the direct  costs described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, a   sponsor may recover the costs of monitoring the expanded access IND or  protocol, complying with IND reporting requirements, and other  administrative costs directly associated with the expanded access IND.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To support its calculation for cost recovery, a sponsor must  provide supporting documentation to show that the calculation is  consistent with the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and, if  applicable, (d)(2) of this section. The documentation must be  accompanied by a statement that an independent certified public  accountant has reviewed and approved the calculations.  [74 FR 40899, Aug. 13, 2009]</p>
