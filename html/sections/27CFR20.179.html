                                Sec. 20.179  Package identification number or serial number.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement. A dealer who fills packages with specially  denatured spirits shall mark each package with a package identification  number, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, or a serial  number, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Package identification number. A package identification number  shall apply to all of the packages filled at the same time on which all  of the marks required by Sec. 20.178 (a)(1) and (a)(3) through (a)(8)  are identical. All of the packages in one lot shall be the same type,  have the same rated capacity, and be uniformly filled with the same  quantity. A package identification number shall be derived from the date  on which the package is filled, and shall consist of the following  elements, in the order shown--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The last two digits of the calendar year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An alphabetical designation from ``A'' through ``L,''  representing January through December, in that order;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The digits corresponding to the day of the month; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A letter suffix when more than one identical lot is filled into  packages during the same day. For successive lots after the first lot, a  letter suffix shall be added in alphabetical order, with ``A''  representing the second lot of the day, ``B'' representing the third lot  of the day, etc. (e.g., the first three lots filled into packages on  November 19, 1983, would be identified as ``83K19,'' ``83K19A,'' and  ``83K19B'').</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Serial number. A consecutive serial number shall be marked on  each package, beginning with the number ``1''   and continuing in regular sequence. The dealer shall use a separate but  similar number series for packages containing specially denatured rum.  When any numbering series reaches ``1,000,000'', the dealer may  recommence the series by providing an alphabetical prefix or suffix for  each number in the new series.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Continuation of numbering series. If a change in proprietorship,  name, or trade name occurs, the numbering system in use at the time of  the change may be continued. If serial numbers are used at the time of a  change, the numbering series in use at the time of the change may be  continued.  (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1360, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5206))</p>
