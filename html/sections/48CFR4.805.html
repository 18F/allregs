                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Agencies must prescribe procedures for the handling, storing,  and disposing of contract files. These procedures must take into account  documents held in all types of media, including microfilm and various  electronic media. Agencies may change the original medium to facilitate  storage as long as the requirements of Part 4, law, and other  regulations are satisfied. The process used to create and store records  must record and reproduce the original document, including signatures  and other written and graphic images completely, accurately, and  clearly. Data transfer, storage, and retrieval procedures must protect  the original data from alteration. Unless law or other regulations  require signed originals to be kept, they may be destroyed after the  responsible agency official verifies that record copies on alternate  media and copies reproduced from the record copy are accurate, complete,  and clear representations of the originals. Agency procedures for  contract file disposal must include provisions that the documents  specified in paragraph (b) of this section may not be destroyed before  the times indicated, and may be retained longer if the responsible  agency official determines that the files have future value to the  Government. When original documents have been converted to alternate  media for storage, the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section  also apply to the record copies in the alternate media.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If administrative records are mixed with program records and  cannot be economically segregated, the entire file should be kept for  the period of time approved for the program records. Similarly, if  documents described in the following table are part of a subject or case  file that documents activities that are not described in the table, they  should be treated in the same manner as the files of which they are a  part. The retention periods for acquisitions at or below the simplified  acquisition threshold also apply to acquisitions conducted prior to July  3, 1995, that used small purchase procedures. The retention periods for  acquisitions above the simplified acquisition threshold also apply to  acquisitions conducted prior to July 3, 1995, that used other than small  purchase procedures.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Records pertaining to Contract          6 years and 3 months after</p><p class="depth0">Disputes statute actions.                   final action or decision</p><p class="depth0">for files created prior to</p><p class="depth0">October 1, 1979. 1 year</p><p class="depth0">after final action or</p><p class="depth0">decision for files created</p><p class="depth0">on or after October 1,</p><p class="depth0">1979. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contracts (and related records or       6 years and 3 months after</p><p class="depth0">documents, including successful             final payment.</p><p class="depth0">proposals) exceeding the simplified</p><p class="depth0">acquisition threshold for other than</p><p class="depth0">construction. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (3) Contracts (and related records or       3 years after final payment.</p><p class="depth0">documents, including successful</p><p class="depth0">proposals) at or below the simplified</p><p class="depth0">acquisition threshold for other than</p><p class="depth0">construction. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (4) Construction contracts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Above $2,000......................  6 years and 3 months after</p><p class="depth0">final payment. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> $2,000 or less...................  3 years after final payment. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Related records or documents,     Same as contract file.</p><p class="depth0">including successful proposals,</p><p class="depth0">except for contractor's payrolls (see</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv))</em>. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Contractor's payrolls submitted    3 years after contract</p><p class="depth0">in accordance with Department of        completion unless contract</p><p class="depth0">Labor regulations, with related         performance is the subject</p><p class="depth0">certifications, anti-kickback           of an enforcement action on</p><p class="depth0">affidavits, and other related papers.   that date. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (5) Solicited and unsolicited unsuccessful</p><p class="depth0">offers, quotations, bids, and proposals:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Relating to contracts above the     If filed separately from</p><p class="depth0">simplified acquisition threshold.       contract file, until</p><p class="depth0">contract is completed.</p><p class="depth0">Otherwise, the same as</p><p class="depth0">related contract file. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Relating to contracts at or below  1 year after date of award</p><p class="depth0">the simplified acquisition threshold.   or until final payment,</p><p class="depth0">whichever is later. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (6) Files for canceled solicitations......  5 years after cancellation. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (7) Other copies of procurement file        Upon termination or</p><p class="depth0">records used by component elements of a     completion.</p><p class="depth0">contracting office for administrative</p><p class="depth0">purposes. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (8) Documents pertaining generally to the   Until superseded or</p><p class="depth0">contractor as described at 4.801(c)(3).     obsolete. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (9) Data submitted to the Federal           5 years after submittal to</p><p class="depth0">Procurement Data System (FPDS).
