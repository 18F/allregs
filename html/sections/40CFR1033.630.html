If you include your request  in your application, your exemption is approved when we grant your  certificate. Note that no exemption is needed to ship an engine that has  been assembled in its certified configuration, is properly labeled, and  will not require an aftertreatment device to be attached when installed  in the locomotive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> in your application for  certification, or in a separate submission. If you include your request  in your application, your exemption is approved when we grant your  certificate. A manufacturer/remanufacturer may request an exemption  under 40 CFR 1068.261 instead of under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In cases where an engine has been assembled in its certified  configuration, properly labeled, and will not require an aftertreatment  device to be attached when installed in the locomotive, no exemption is  needed to ship the engine. You do not need an exemption to ship engines  without specific components if they are not emission-related components  identified in appendix I of 40 CFR part 1068.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In cases where an engine has been properly labeled by the  certificate holder and assembled in its certified configuration except  that it does not yet have a required aftertreatment device, an exemption  is required to ship the engine. You may ask for this exemption if you do  all of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You note on the Engine Emission Control Information label that  the locomotive must include the aftertreatment device to be covered by  the certificate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You make clear in your emission-related installation  instructions that installation of the aftertreatment device is required  for the locomotive to be covered by the certificate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In cases where an engine will be shipped to the certificate  holder in an uncertified configuration, an exemption is required to ship  the engine. You   may ask for this exemption under 40 CFR 1068.262.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other exemptions. In unusual circumstances, you may ask us to  provide an exemption for an assembly process that is not covered by the  provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. We will make the  exemption conditional based on you complying with requirements that we  determine are necessary to ensure that the locomotives are assembled in  their certified configuration before being placed (back) into service.
