                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Amount of subsidy payment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each qualifying covered  retiree enrolled with the sponsor of a qualified retiree prescription  drug plan in a plan year, the sponsor receives a subsidy payment in the  amount of 28 percent of the allowable retiree costs (as defined   in Sec. 423.882) in the plan year for such retiree attributable to gross  retiree costs between the cost threshold and the cost limit as defined  in paragraph (b) of this section. The subsidy payment is calculated by  first determining gross retiree costs between the cost threshold and  cost limit, and then determining allowable retiree costs attributable to  the gross retiree costs. For this purpose and where otherwise relevant  in this subpart, plan year is the calendar, policy, or fiscal year on  which the records of a plan are kept.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transition provision. For a qualified retiree prescription drug  plan that has a plan year which begins in calendar year 2005 and ends in  calendar year 2006, the subsidy for the plan year must be determined in  the following manner. Claims incurred in all months of the plan year  (including claims incurred in 2005) are taken into account in  determining which claims fall within the cost threshold and cost limit  for the plan year. The subsidy amount is determined based only on costs  incurred on and after January 1, 2006.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cost threshold and cost limit. The following cost threshold and  cost limits apply--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the cost threshold  under this section is equal to $250 for plan years that end in 2006.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the cost limit  under this section is equal to $5,000 for plan years that end in 2006.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The cost threshold and cost limit specified in paragraphs (b)(1)  and (b)(2) of this section, for plan years that end in years after 2006,  are adjusted in the same manner as the annual Part D deductible and the  annual Part D out-of-pocket threshold are adjusted annually under  Sec. 423.104(d)(1)(ii) and (d)(5)(iii)(B), respectively.</p>
