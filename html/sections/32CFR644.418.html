                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each agreement for the exchange of real property should be formalized by written contract specifying the terms and conditions of the exchange, including, by reference to exhibits incorporated therein or otherwise, the form and terms of the conveyance of the title to the property to and from the Government. The agreement, in the case of relocation contracts, will be developed in accordance with ER 1180-1-1. Where an exchange of land or interests therein is considered desirable in the course of a condemnation proceeding, the agreement can be incorporated in a stipulation therein (Sec. Sec. 644.111 through 644.121)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Submission to the Chief of Engineers of draft of conveyance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conveyance will usually be executed by the Secretary or head of the agency involved Sec. 644.441. To avoid impinging on his discretionary powers, the execution of any contract or agreement involving an exchange of real property interests must be approved in advance, be deferred pending execution of the conveyance, or provide that the terms and conditions of any grant to be made pursuant to the contract will be subject to approval by the Secretary or agency head. It is considered preferable that the contract contain a draft of conveyance as an exhibit thereto and, where time will permit, be submitted to DAEN-REM for review prior to final execution of the contract in order to avoid possible difficulties arising from subsequent disagreement over terms acceptable to the signatory of the Government's conveyance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In submitting for final approval and execution the conveyance of the Government's interest in land pursuant to a contract for exchange, the following data should included to support the proposed action:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Description and map of the property to be conveyed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Statements as to how and when the Government acquired title to the property, the nature and extent of its interest therein, and a statement of any encumbrance to which the property is subject and the nature thereof, such as easements for road rights-of-way, utility lines, etc.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A sufficient number of drafts or the conveyance to permit distribution thereof to interested agencies and the grantee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Two copies of the contract, option, stipulation in condemnation or other agreement which provides for the proposed conveyance, or, in lieu thereof, pertinent excerpts therefrom sufficient to clearly show the nature and extent of the Government's obligation to execute the conveyance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A citation of the statutory authority on which the execution of the conveyance is to be predicated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Any additional information necessary to a proper understanding of the proposed transaction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> When the exchange agreement is other than a relocation contract, an appraisal report showing the relative fair values of the properties to be exchanged.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> A copy of the conveyance to be made to the United States, or a statement by the Attorney General that an acceptable conveyance has been executed and delivered to the United States, and that an opinion of good title has been made or is not required by regulation to be made.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Recommendations of the Division and District Engineers.</p>
