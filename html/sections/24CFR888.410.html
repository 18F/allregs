PHAs will give written notice to all current owners of projects, for which they are the Contract Administrators, of the eligibility requirements for retroactive payments. Eligible project owners must make a request for payment or a request for a one-time contract determination within 60 days from the date of the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Request for payment. (1) Owners eligible for retroactive payments under Sec. 888.401(c) must submit a request for a calculation of the total rent adjustments and the establishment of the amount of the retroactive payment, as described in Sec. 888.401 (a) and (b), and documentation of the occupancy rate for the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991, if available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Owners eligible for retroactive payments under Sec. 888.401(c) must submit a request for a calculation of the total rent adjustments and the establishment of the amount of the retroactive payment, as described in Sec. 888.401 (a) and (b), and documentation of the occupancy rate for the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991, if available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Owners claiming eligibility under Sec. 888.401(c)(2) must certify that a request was not made because of an anticipated reduction in the Contract Rents as a result of a comparability study. The certification must contain the year or years upon which the request for payment is based and a statement of the basis for the belief that rents would have been reduced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Retroactive payments will be made to owners over a three-year period as funds are appropriated for that purpose. When funds are available for payment, HUD will publish a Federal Register Notice containing procedures for claiming payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Request for one-time contract rent determination. When making a request for payment, eligible owners may also request a one-time contract rent determination, as described in Sec. 888.420. Eligible owners may request a one-time contract rent determination even if they choose to forgo receiving retroactive payments, provided they are eligible for retroactive payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transfer of ownership since October 1, 1979. Eligible owners requesting retroactive payments must certify that they are entitled to the entire amount of the payment. Any owner who is unable to certify must present documentation of an agreement between the current and former owners of the proportionate share of the payment for which each is eligible.
