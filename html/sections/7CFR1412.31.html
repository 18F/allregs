                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The PLC yield for covered commodities on the farm is equal to  the counter-cyclical payment yield established for each covered  commodity on the farm that was effective September 30, 2013, unless the  PLC yield is updated as specified in Sec. 1421.32. If the Secretary  designates an additional oilseed or pulse crop as a covered commodity  that does not have a counter-cyclical payment yield, the PLC yield for  that commodity will be established as specified in Sec. 1412.33 or  Sec. 1412.34, whichever is applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a PLC yield is not already established for a covered  commodity on a farm for which base acres are allocated through the base  acres reallocation   process or for which a covered commodity is planted on generic base  acres, a yield will be established for the covered commodity on the farm  using the yield on similarly situated farms, as determined by FSA. The  yield on similarly situated farms will then be used as the 2013 county  average counter-cyclical yield for the covered commodity.</p>
