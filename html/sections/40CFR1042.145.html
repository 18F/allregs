                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The provisions in this section apply instead of other provisions in this part. This section describes when these interim provisions expire. Only the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section apply for Category 3 engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Delayed standards. Post-manufacturer marinizers that are small-volume engine manufacturers may delay compliance with the Tier 3 standards for engines below 600 kW as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may delay compliance with the Tier 3 standards for one model year, as long as the engines meet all the requirements that apply to Tier 2 engines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may delay compliance with the NTE standards for Tier 3 engines for three model years in addition to the one-year delay specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, as long as the engines meet all other Tier 3 requirements for the appropriate model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Part 1065 test procedures for Category 1 and Category 2 engines. You must generally use the test procedures specified in subpart F of this part, including the applicable test procedures in 40 CFR part 1065. As specified in this paragraph (c), you may use a combination of the test procedures specified in this part and the test procedures specified for Tier 2 engines before January 1, 2015. After this date, you must use test procedures only as specified in subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may determine maximum test speed for engines below 37 kW as specified in 40 CFR part 89 without request through the 2009 model year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before January 1, 2015, you may ask to use some or all of the procedures specified in 40 CFR part 94 (or 40 CFR part 89 for engines below 37 kW) for engines certified under this part 1042. If you ask to rely on a combination of procedures under this paragraph (c)(2), we will approve your request only if you show us that it does not affect your ability to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission standards. This generally requires that the combined procedures would result in emission measurements at least as high as those that would be measured using the procedures specified in this part. Alternatively, you may demonstrate that the combined effects of the different procedures is small relative to your compliance margin (the degree to which your emissions are below the applicable standards).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Delayed compliance with NTE standards. Engines below 56 kW may delay complying with the NTE standards specified in Sec.  1042.101(c) until the 2013 model year. Engines at or above 56 kW and below 75 kW may delay complying with the NTE standards specified in Sec.  1042.101(c) until the 2012 model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In-use compliance limits. The provisions of this paragraph (f) apply for the first three model years of the Tier 4 standards. For purposes of determining compliance based on testing other than certification or production-line testing, calculate the applicable in-use compliance limits by adjusting the applicable standards/FELs. The PM adjustment does not apply for engines with a PM standard or FEL above 0.04 g/kW-hr. The NOX adjustment does not apply for engines with a NOX FEL above 2.7 g/kW-hr. Add the applicable adjustments in one of the following tables to the otherwise applicable standards and NTE limits. You must specify during certification which add-ons, if any, will apply for your engines.

You may ask us to accept as compliant an engine that does not fully meet specific requirements under the applicable NTE standards. Such deficiencies are intended to allow for minor deviations from the NTE standards under limited conditions. We expect your engines to have functioning emission control hardware that allows you to comply with the NTE standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Request our approval for specific deficiencies in your application for certification, or before you submit your application. We will not approve deficiencies retroactively to cover engines already certified. In your request, identify the scope of each deficiency and describe any auxiliary emission control devices you will use to control emissions to the lowest practical level, considering the deficiency you are requesting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We will approve a deficiency only if compliance would be infeasible or unreasonable considering such factors as the technical feasibility of the given hardware and the applicable lead time and production cycles. We may consider other relevant factors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Our approval applies only for a single model year and may be limited to specific engine configurations. We may approve your request for the same deficiency in the following model year if correcting the deficiency would require unreasonable hardware or software modifications and we determine that you have demonstrated an acceptable level of effort toward complying.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You may ask for any number of deficiencies in the first three model years during which NTE standards apply for your engines. For the next four model years, we may approve up to three deficiencies per engine family. Deficiencies of the same type that apply similarly to different power ratings within a family count as one deficiency per family. We may condition approval of any such additional deficiencies during these four years on any additional conditions we determine to be appropriate. We will not approve deficiencies after the seven-year period specified in this paragraph (g)(4), unless they are related to safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The following interim provisions apply for Category 3 engines:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicability of Tier 3 standards to Category 3 engines operating in Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. territories. (i) Category 3 engines are not required to comply with the Tier 3 NOX standard when operating in areas of Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, or U.S. Virgin Islands. Category 3 engines are also not required to comply with the Tier 3 NOX standards when operating in the waters of the smallest Hawaiian islands or in the waters of

Alaska west of Kodiak. For the purpose of this paragraph (h)(1), ``the smallest Hawaiian islands'' includes all Hawaiian islands other than Hawaii, Kahoolawe, Kauai, Lanai, Maui, Molokai, Niihau, and Oahu. Engines must comply fully with the appropriate Tier 2 NOX standard and all other applicable requirements when operating in the areas identified in this paragraph (h)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Category 3 engines are not required to comply with the Tier 3 NOX standard when operating in areas of Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, or U.S. Virgin Islands. Category 3 engines are also not required to comply with the Tier 3 NOX standards when operating in the waters of the smallest Hawaiian islands or in the waters of

The Tier 3 standards apply in full for any area included in an ECA or an ECA associated area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Part 1065 test procedures. You must generally use the test procedures specified in subpart F of this part for Category 3 engines, including the applicable test procedures in 40 CFR part 1065. You may use a combination of the test procedures specified in this part and the test procedures specified in 40 CFR part 94 before January 1, 2016 without request. After this date, you must use test procedures only as specified in subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Limitation of 40 CFR 1068.101 before July 1, 2010. Notwithstanding other provisions of this part or 40 CFR part 94, for the period June 29, 2010 through July 1, 2010, it is not a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101 to operate in U.S. waters uncertified engines installed on vessels manufactured outside of the United States before June 29, 2010. Operation of such vessels in U.S. waters on or after July 1, 2010 is deemed to be introduction into U.S. commerce of a new marine engine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Vessel manufacturers and marine equipment manufacturers may apply the provisions of Sec.  1042.605 to land-based engines with maximum engine power at or above 19 kW and below 600 kW produced under the allowances provided in 40 CFR 1039.625 for model year 2013 marine engines. All the provisions of Sec.  1042.605 apply as if those engines were certified to emission standards under 40 CFR part 1039. Similarly, engine manufacturers, vessel manufacturers, and marine equipment manufacturers must comply with all the provisions of 40 CFR 1039.625 as if those engines were installed in land-based equipment.
