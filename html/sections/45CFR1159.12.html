                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Endowment shall charge no fees for search time or for any  other time expended by the Endowment to review a record. However, the  Endowment may charge fees where you request that a copy be made of a  record to which you have been granted access. Where a copy of the record  must be made in order to provide access to the record (e.g., computer  printout where no screen reading is available), the copy will be made  available to you without cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Copies of records made by photocopy or similar process will be  charged to you at the rate of $0.10 per page. Where records are not  susceptible to photocopying (e.g., punch cards, magnetic tapes, or  oversize materials), you will be charged actual cost as determined on a  case-by-case basis. A copying fee totaling $3.00 or less shall be   waived, but the copying fees for contemporaneous requests by the same  individual shall be aggregated to determine the total fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special and additional services provided at your request, such  as certification or authentication, postal insurance, and special  mailing arrangement costs, will be charged to you.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A copying fee shall not be charged or, alternatively, it may be  reduced, when the General Counsel determines, based on a petition, that  the petitioning individual is indigent and that the Endowment's  resources permit a waiver of all or part of the fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All fees shall be paid before any copying request is undertaken.  Payments shall be made by check or money order payable to the ``National  Endowment for the Arts.''</p>
