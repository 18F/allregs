                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 2131.270, insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Accounting and Allowable Cost (OCT 2005)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Annual financial report. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor must prepare  annually a financial report summarizing the financial operations of the  FEGLI Program for the previous contract year. This report will be due to  OPM in accordance with a date established by OPM's requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Contractor must have the most recent financial report for  the FEGLI Program audited by an independent public accounting firm that  ascribes to the standards of the American Institute of Certified Public  Accountants. The audit must be performed in accordance with Generally  Accepted Government Auditing Standards or other requirements issued by  OPM. The report by the independent accounting firm on its audit must be  submitted to OPM along with the annual financial report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Based on the results of either the independent audit or a  Government audit, the FEGLI contract may be:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Adjusted by amounts found not to constitute chargeable costs; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Adjusted for prior overpayments or underpayments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definition of costs. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A cost is chargeable to the contract  for a contract term if it is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An actual, allowable, allocable, and reasonable cost;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Incurred with proper justification and accounting support;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Determined in accordance with subpart 31.2 of the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and subpart 2131.2 of the Federal  Employees' Group Life Insurance Acquisition Regulation (LIFAR)  applicable on October 1 of each year; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Determined in accordance with the terms of this contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the absence of specific contract terms to the contrary,  contract costs will be classified in accordance with the following  criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Benefits. Claims costs consist of payments made and costs  incurred (including delayed settlement interest) by the Contractor for  life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, excess  mortality charges, post-mortem conversion   charges, and conversion policies on behalf of insured persons, less any  overpayments recovered (subject to the terms of LIFAR 2131.205-3),  refunds, or other credits received.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Administrative expenses. Administrative expenses consist of  chargeable costs as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause incurred  in the adjudication of claims or incurred in the Contractor's overall  operation of the business. Unless otherwise provided in the contract,  FAR, or LIFAR, administrative expenses include, but are not limited to,  taxes, service charges to reinsurers, the cost of investigation and  settlement of policy claims, the cost of maintaining records regarding  payment of claims, and legal expenses incurred in the litigation of  benefit payments. Administrative expenses exclude the expenses related  to investment income in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this clause.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Administrative expense ceiling. Each year an administrative  expense ceiling for the following contract year is calculated based on  the prior contract year's administrative expense ceiling, adjusted by  the percentage change in the average monthly consumer Price Index for  All Urban Consumers for the preceding 12 months. Administrative expenses  are reimbursed up to the administrative expense ceiling or actual costs,  whichever is less. Both parties will reexamine the base, including the  prior year's actual expenses, at the request of either OPM or the  Contractor. Within the administrative expense ceiling is a separately  negotiated limit for indirect costs that may be charged against the  ceiling for the contract year. The Contractor agrees to provide annually  to the Contracting Officer a detailed report of direct and indirect  administrative costs which form the basis for determining the limit on  indirect costs for the following contract year. During a continuity of  services period, OPM and the Contractor will negotiate a one-time  increase in the administrative expense ceiling to cover phase-in/phase- out costs. Costs that exceed the revised ceiling must be submitted by  the Contractor, in writing and in advance of their incurrence, to the  Contracting Officer for approval.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Investment income. Investment income represents the amount  earned by the Contractor after deducting chargeable investment expenses.  Investment expenses are those chargeable contract costs, as defined in  paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, which are attributable to the  investment of FEGLI funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Certification of Annual Financial Report. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor  must certify the annual financial report in the form set forth in  paragraph (c)(2) of this clause. The certificate must be signed by the  chief executive officer for the Contractor's FEGLI Program operations  and the chief financial officer for the Contractor's FEGLI Program  operations and must be returned with the annual financial report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The certification required must be in the following form:</p><p class="depth3">Certification of Annual Financial Report</p><p class="depth3">This is to certify that I have reviewed this financial report and,  to the best of my knowledge and belief, attest that:</p><p class="depth3">1. The report was prepared in conformity with the guidelines issued  by the Office of Personnel Management and fairly presents the financial  results of this contract year in conformity with those guidelines;</p><p class="depth3">2. The costs included in the report are actual, allowable,  allocable, and reasonable in accordance with the terms of the contract  and with the cost principles of the Federal Employees' Group Life  Insurance Program Acquisition Regulation (LIFAR) and the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR);</p><p class="depth3">3. Income, overpayments, refunds, and other credits made or owed in  accordance with the terms of the contract and applicable cost principles  have been included in the report.</p><p class="depth3">Contractor Name:_______________________________________________________  (Chief Executive Officer for FEGLI Operations)</p><p class="depth3">Date signed:___________________________________________________________  (Chief Financial Officer for FEGLI Operations)</p><p class="depth3">Date signed:___________________________________________________________  (Type or print and sign)</p><p class="depth3">(End of certificate)  [70 FR 41155, July 18, 2005]</p>
