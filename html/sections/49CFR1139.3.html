The application of possible labor and nonlabor cost increases  for the purpose of updating the ``base calendar year--actual'' cost data  may be accomplished by the use of either individual carrier data for  each of the study carriers, or the composite carrier data for those  study carriers whose revenue from the issue traffic amount to 50 percent  or more of their total system revenues for the ``base calendar year-- actual.'' The sample values for expenses and revenues shall be expanded  to full year values without adjustments to known annual report figures  of any carrier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where cost studies are developed through the use of computer  processing techniques, there shall be submitted a manual application of  the costing procedures used for one traffic and cost study carrier  (study carrier) in order to demonstrate the procedures by which the  computer program distributes the annual report statistics, and applies  service unit-costs to each shipment. An illustration of the application  of service unit-costs to the applicable traffic service units generated  by one single-line sample shipment and by one interline sample shipment  shall also be submitted. These sample shipments shall be on the  ``Carried'' basis.</p>
