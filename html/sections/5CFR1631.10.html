                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When the FOIA Officer has denied a request for expedited processing or a request for records, in whole or in part, the person making the request may, within 30 calendar days of receipt of

the response of the FOIA Officer, appeal the denial to the Executive Director. The appeal must be in writing, addressed to the Executive Director, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, 77 K Street NE., Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20002, and be clearly labeled as a ``Freedom of Information Act Appeal.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> The Executive Director will act upon the appeal of a denial of a request for expedited processing within 5 work days of its receipt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Executive Director will act upon the appeal of a denial of a request for expedited processing within 5 work days of its receipt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Executive Director will act upon the appeal of a denial of a request for records within 20 work days of its receipt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Executive Director will decide the appeal in writing and mail the decision to the requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the appeal concerns an expedited processing request and the decision is in favor of the person making the request, the Executive Director will order that the request be processed on an expedited basis. If the decision concerning a request for records is in favor of the requester, the Executive Director will order that the subject records be promptly made available to the person making the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the appeal of a request for expedited processing of records is denied, in whole or in part, the Executive Director's decision will set forth the basis for the decision. If the appeal of a request for records is denied, in whole or in part, the Executive Director's decision will set forth the exemption relied on and a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the records withheld and the reasons for asserting it, if different from the reasons described by the FOIA Officer under Sec. 1631.9. The denial of a request for records will state that the person making the request may, if dissatisfied with the decision on appeal, file a civil action in Federal court. (A Federal court does not have jurisdiction to review a denial of a request for expedited processing after the Board has provided a complete response to the request.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> No personal appearance, oral argument, or hearing will ordinarily be permitted in connection with an appeal of a request for expedited processing or an appeal for records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> On appeal of a request concerning records, the Executive Director may reduce any fees previously assessed.
