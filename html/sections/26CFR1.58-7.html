                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 58(g)(1) provides that except in the case of the stock options item of tax preference (section 57(a)(6) and Sec.  1.57-1(f)) and the capital gains item of tax preference (section 57(a)(9) and Sec.  1.57-1(i)), items of tax preference which are attributable to sources within any foreign country or possession of the United States shall, for purposes of section 56, be taken into account only to the extent that such items reduce the tax imposed by chapter 1 (other than the minimum tax under section 56) on income derived from sources within the United States. Items of tax preference from sources within any foreign country or possession of the United States reduce the chapter 1 tax on income from sources within the United States to the extent the deduction relating to such preferences, in combination with other foreign deductions, exceed the income from such sources and, in effect, offset income from sources within the United States. Items of tax preference, for this purpose, are determined after application of Sec.  1.57-4 (relating to limitation on amounts treated as items of tax preference). In the case of a taxpayer who deducted foreign taxes under section 164 for a taxable year, the provisions of this section shall be applied (without regard to section 275(a)(4)) as if he had elected the overall foreign tax credit limitation under section 904(a) (2) for such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Preferences attributable to foreign sources--(1) Preferences other than excess investment interest. Except in the case of excess investment interest (see subparagraph (2) of this paragraph), an item of tax preference to which this section applies is attributable to sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States to the extent such item is attributable to a deduction properly allocable or apportionable to an item or class of gross income from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States under the principles of section 862(b), or section 863, and the regulations thereunder. Where, in the case of income partly from sources

within the United States and partly from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States, taxable income is computed before apportionment to domestic and foreign sources, and is then apportioned by processes or formulas of general apportionment (pursuant to section 863(b) and the regulations thereunder), deductions attributable to such taxable income are considered to be proportionately from sources within the United States and within the foreign country or possession of the United States on the same basis as taxable income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Preferences other than excess investment interest. Except in the case of excess investment interest (see subparagraph (2) of this paragraph), an item of tax preference to which this section applies is attributable to sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States to the extent such item is attributable to a deduction properly allocable or apportionable to an item or class of gross income from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States under the principles of section 862(b), or section 863, and the regulations thereunder. Where, in the case of income partly from sources

within the United States and partly from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States, taxable income is computed before apportionment to domestic and foreign sources, and is then apportioned by processes or formulas of general apportionment (pursuant to section 863(b) and the regulations thereunder), deductions attributable to such taxable income are considered to be proportionately from sources within the United States and within the foreign country or possession of the United States on the same basis as taxable income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Excess investment interest--(i) Per-country limitation--(a) In the case of a taxpayer on the per-country foreign tax credit limitation under section 904(a) for the taxable year, excess investment interest (as defined in section 57(b)(1)), and the resulting item of tax preference, is attributable to sources within a foreign country or a possession of the United States to the extent that investment interest expense attributable to income from sources within such foreign country or possession of the United States exceeds the net investment income from sources within such foreign country or such possession. For this purpose, net investment income from within a foreign country or possession of the United States is the excess (if any) of the investment income from sources within such country or possession over the investment expenses attributable to income from sources within such country or such possession. For the definition of investment interest expense see section 57(b)(2)(D); for the definition of investment income see section 57(b)(2)(B); for the definition of investment expense see section 57(b)(2)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the taxpayer's excess investment interest computed on a worldwide basis is less than the taxpayer's total separately determined excess investment interest (as defined in this subdivision (b)), the amount of the taxpayer's excess investment interest from each foreign country or possession is the amount which bears the same relationship to the taxpayer's excess investment interest from each such country or possession, determined without regard to this subdivision (b), as the taxpayer's worldwide excess investment interest bears to the taxpayer's total separately determined excess investment interest. For purposes of this subdivision (b), the taxpayer's total separately determined excess investment interest is the sum of the total excess investment interest determined without regard to this subdivision (b) plus the taxpayer's excess investment interest from sources within the United States determined in a manner consistent with (a) of this subdivision (i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Overall limitation. In the case of a taxpayer who has elected the overall foreign tax credit limitation under section 904(a)(2) for the taxable year, excess investment interest (as defined in section 57(b)(1)), and the resulting item of tax preference, is attributable to sources within any foreign country or possession of the United States to the extent that investment interest expense attributable to income from such sources exceeds the sum of (a) the net investment income from such sources plus (b) the excess, if any, of net investment income from sources within the United States over investment interest expense attributable to sources within the United States. For this purpose, net investment income from sources within any foreign country or possession of the United States is the excess (if any) of the investment income from all such sources over the investment expenses attributable to income from such sources. For the definition of investment interest expense see section 57(b)(2)(D) for the definition of investment income see section 57(b)(2)(B); for the definition of investment expense see section 57(b)(2)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Allocation of expenses. The determination of the investment interest expense and investment expenses attributable to a foreign country or possession of the United States is made in a manner consistent with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Attribution of certain interest deductions to foreign sources. Where net investment income from sources within any foreign country or possession has the effect of offsetting investment interest expense attributable to income from sources within the United States,

the deductions for the investment interest expense so offset are, for purposes of Sec.  1.58-7(c) (relating to reduction in taxes on United States source income), treated as deductions attributable to income from sources within the foreign country or possession from which such net investment income is derived. Such an offset will occur where there is an excess of investment interest expense attributable to income from sources within the United States over net investment income from such sources and (a) in the case of a taxpayer on the per-country foreign tax credit limitation, an excess of net investment income from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States over investment interest expense from within such foreign country or possession, or (b) in the case of a taxpayer who has elected the overall foreign tax credit limitation, there is an excess of net investment income from sources within foreign countries or possessions of the United States over investment interest expense attributable to income from within such sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Separate limitation on interest income. Where a taxpayer has income described in section 904(f)(2) (relating to interest income subject to the separate foreign tax credit limitation) or expenses attributable to such income, the determination of the excess investment interest resulting therefrom must be determined separately with respect to such income and the expenses properly allocable or apportionable thereto in the same manner as such determination is made in the case of a taxpayer on the per-country foreign tax credit limitation for the taxable year (see subdivision (i) of this subparagraph).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Examples. The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples in each of which the taxpayer is an individual and a citizen of the United States:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. The taxpayer's only items of income and deduction relating to excess investment interest are as follows:

(30,000)</p><p class="depth0">investment interest.........------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the taxpayer is on the per-country foreign tax credit limitation, his excess investment interest from France and Germany determined under subdivision (i)(a) of this subparagraph is $40,000 and zero, respectively. Since the taxpayer's worldwide excess investment interest ($90,000) is less than his total separately determined excess investment interest ($60,000 (United States) plus $40,000 (French) plus zero (German), or $100,000), the limitation in subdivision (i) (b) of this subparagraph applies and the excess investment interest attributable to France is limited as follows:
Total worldwide excess ($90,000) / Total separately determined excess</p><p class="depth0"><em>($100,000)</em> x French excess ($40,000) = $36,000
The taxpayer's total excess investment interest attributable to sources within any foreign country or possession of the United States is, thus, $36,000 ($36,000 (French) plus zero (German)). The taxpayer's excess investment interest attributable to sources within the United States is $54,000
($90,000 / $100,000 x $60,000).
Since, in making the latter determination, $6,000 of the $60,000 of U.S. investment interest expense in excess of U.S. net investment income is, in effect, offset by German net investment income, for purposes of Sec.  1.58-7(c), $6,000 of interest deductions attributable to income from sources within the United States are, pursuant to subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, treated as deductions attributable to income from sources within Germany.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that the items of income and deduction in Germany and the United States are reversed. The worldwide excess investment interest, thus, remains $90,000 and the items of income and deduction relating to excess investment interest are as follows:

Since the total separately determined excess would exceed the worldwide excess, the limitation to the worldwide excess in subdivision (i) applies and the excess investment interest is determined as follows:

France:$90,000 / $100,000 x $40,000 = $36,000
Germany:$90,000 / $100,000 x $60,000 = $54,000
Total excess investment interest attributable to sources within any</p><p class="depth0">foreign countries and possessions--$90,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that the taxpayer, in addition has investment income, investment expenses, and investment interest subject to the separate limitation under section 904(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If the taxpayer has elected the overall foreign tax credit limitation, his excess investment interest from sources within any foreign countries or possessions of the United States determined under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph is the same as in (a) of example (1) of this subdivision (vi). He then treats such amount as separately determined excess investment interest attributable to a single foreign country as determined under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph and proceeds as in (b) of example (1) of this subdivision (vi) treating items of income and deduction subject to section 904(f) and from each separate foreign country or possession separately in making the additional determinations under subdivisions (i) and (iv) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the taxpayer has not elected the overall foreign tax credit limitation, his excess investment interest from sources within any foreign country or possession of the United States would be determined in the same manner as in (b) of example (1) treating items of income and deduction which are subject to section 904(f) and from each separate foreign country or possession separately in making the determinations under subdivisions (i) and (iv) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reduction in taxes on United States source income--(1) Overall limitation--(i) In general. If a taxpayer is on the overall foreign tax credit limitation under section 904(a)(2), the items of tax preference determined to be attributable to foreign sources under paragraph (b) of this section reduce the tax imposed by chapter 1 (other than the minimum tax imposed under section 56) on income from sources within the United States for the taxable year to the extent of the smallest of the following three amounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Items of tax preference (other than stock options and capital gains) attributable to sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The excess (if any) of the total deductions properly allocable or apportionable to items or classes of gross income from sources within foreign countries and possessions of the United States over the gross income from such sources, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Taxable income from sources within the United States.
See Sec.  1.58-7(b)(2)(iv) with respect to the attribution of certain interest deductions to foreign sources in cases involving the excess investment interest item of tax preference.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Net operating loss. Where there is an overall net operating loss for the taxable year, to the extent that the lesser of the amounts determined under (a) or (b) of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph exceeds the taxpayer's taxable income from sources within the United States (and, therefore do not offset taxable income from sources within the United States for the taxable year) the amount of such excess is treated as ``suspense preferences.'' Suspense preferences are converted to actual items of tax preference, arising in the loss year and subject to the provisions of section 56, as the net operating loss is used in other taxable years, in the form of a net operating loss deduction under section 172, to offset taxable income from sources within the United States. Suspense preferences which, in other taxable years, reduce taxable income from sources within any foreign country or possession of the United States lose their character as suspense preferences and, thus, are never converted into actual items of tax preference. The amount of the suspense preferences which are converted into actual items of tax preference is equal to that portion of the net operating loss attributable to the suspense preferences which offset taxable income from sources within the United States in taxable years other than the loss year. The determination of the component parts of the net operating loss and the determination of the amount by which the portion of the net operating loss attributable to suspense preferences offsets taxable income from sources within the United States is made on a year-by-year basis in the same order as the net operating loss is used in accordance with section 172(b). Such determination is made by applying deductions attributable to U.S. source income first against such income and deductions attributable to foreign source income first against such foreign source income and in accordance with the following principles:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Deductions attributable to items or classes of gross income from sources

within the United States offset taxable income from sources within the United States before any remaining portion of the net operating loss;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Deductions attributable to items or classes of gross income from sources within foreign countries or possessions of the United States offset taxable income from such sources before any remaining portion of the net operating loss;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Deductions described in (b) of the subdivision (ii) which are not suspense preferences (referred to in this subparagraph as ``other foreign deductions'') offset taxable income from sources within foreign countries and possessions of the United States before suspense preferences; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Suspense preferences offset taxable income from sources within the United States before other foreign deductions.
For purposes of the above computations, taxable income is computed with the modifications specified in section 172(b)(2) or section 172(c), whichever is applicable. However, the amount of suspense preferences which are converted into actual items of tax preference in accordance with the above principles is reduced to the extent suspense preferences offset increases in taxable income from sources within the United States due to the modifications specified in section 172(b)(2) or section 172(c). For this purpose, suspense preferences are considered to offset an increase in taxable income due to the section 172(b)(2) modifications only after reducing taxable income computed before the section 172(b)(2) or section 172(c) modifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples. In each example the taxpayer is an individual citizen of the United States and has elected the overall foreign tax credit limitation. Personal deductions and exemptions are disregarded for purposes of these examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In 1974, the taxpayer has the following items of income and deduction:
United States taxable income:</p><p class="depth0">Gross income......................  ..........   $750,000</p><p class="depth0">Deductions........................  ..........   (250,000)   $500,000</p><p class="depth0">------------Foreign source loss:</p><p class="depth0">Gross income......................  ..........    200,000</p><p class="depth0">Deductions:</p><p class="depth0">Preference items (excess of        $550,000</p><p class="depth0">percentage depletion over</p><p class="depth0">basis).........................</p><p class="depth0">Other...........................     50,000    (600,000)   (400,000)</p><p class="depth0">------------------------Overall taxable income..............  ..........  ..........    100,000</p><p class="depth0">Pursuant to subdivision (i) of this subparagraph the smallest of (a) the items of tax preference attributable to the foreign sources ($550,000), (b) the foreign source loss ($400,000), or (c) the taxable income from sources within the United States ($500,000) reduces the tax imposed by chapter 1 (other than the minimum tax) on income from sources within the United States. Thus, $400,000 of the $550,000 of excess depletion is treated as an item of tax preference in 1974 subject to the minimum tax.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that the gross income from sources within the United States is $350,000 resulting in U.S. taxable income of $100,000 and an overall net operating loss of $300,000. Pursuant to subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, $100,000 of the $550,000 excess depletion would be treated as an item of tax preference in 1974 subject to the minimum tax. In addition, pursuant to subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the excess of the items of tax preference from foreign sources ($550,000) or the foreign source loss ($400,000), whichever is less, over the U.S. taxable income ($100,000), or, in this example, $300,000, is treated as suspense preferences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If, in 1971, the taxpayer's total items of income and deduction result in $350,000 of taxable income all of which is from sources within the United States, the entire $300,000 net operating loss, all of which is attributable to suspense preferences, is used to offset U.S. taxable income. Accordingly, the full $300,000 of suspense preferences are converted into actual items of tax preference arising in 1974 and are subject to tax under section 56.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the $350,000 in 1971 is modified taxable income resulting from the denial of a section 1202 capital gains deduction of $175,000 by reason of section 172(b)(2), the $300,000, otherwise treated as actual items of tax preference, is reduced by $125,000, i.e., the extent to which the suspense preferences offset U.S.

taxable income attributable to the increase in taxable income resulting from the denial of the section 1202 deduction.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. In 1974, the taxpayer has the following items of income and deduction:
United States loss:</p><p class="depth0">Gross income....................  ..........    $75,000</p><p class="depth0">Deductions......................  ..........   (225,000)</p><p class="depth0">-------------</p><p class="depth0">..........  ..........

(500,000)</p><p class="depth0">Since the nonpreference deductions reduce the foreign source income before the preference portion, the $350,000 foreign source loss consists of $200,000 of suspense preferences and $150,000 of other deductions. In 1971, 1972, and 1973 the taxpayer had taxable income from sources within the United States of $100,000, $200,000, and $300,000, respectively and taxable income from sources within foreign countries of $80,000 each year.

If a taxpayer is on the per-country foreign tax credit limitation for the taxable year, the amount by which the items of tax preference to which this section applies reduce the tax imposed by chapter 1 (other than the minimum tax under section 56) on income from sources within the United States is determined separately with respect to each foreign country or possession of the United States. Such determination is made in a manner consistent with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph as modified in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. In applying subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph to a taxpayer on the per-country limitation, if the total potential preference amounts (as defined in this subdivision (i)) exceed the taxpayer's taxable income from sources within the United States, then, for purposes of subparagraph (1)(i)(c) of this paragraph (relating to the U.S. taxable income limitation on the amount treated as a reduction of U.S. taxable income), the taxable income from sources within the United States which is reduced by potential preference amounts with respect to each foreign country or possession is an amount which bears the same relationship to such income as the potential preference amount with respect to such foreign country or possession bears to the total of the potential preference amounts with respect to all foreign countries and possessions. For purposes of this subparagraph, the potential preference amount with respect to a foreign country or possession is the lesser of the amount of foreign source preference (described in subparagraph (1)(i)(a) of this paragraph) attributable to such country or possession or the amount of foreign source loss (described in subparagraph (1)(i)(b) of this paragraph) attributable to such country or possession.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If a taxpayer is on the per-country foreign tax credit limitation for the taxable year, the amount by which the items of tax preference to which this section applies reduce the tax imposed by chapter 1 (other than the minimum tax under section 56) on income from sources within the United States is determined separately with respect to each foreign country or possession of the United States. Such determination is made in a manner consistent with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph as modified in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. In applying subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph to a taxpayer on the per-country limitation, if the total potential preference amounts (as defined in this subdivision (i)) exceed the taxpayer's taxable income from sources within the United States, then, for purposes of subparagraph (1)(i)(c) of this paragraph (relating to the U.S. taxable income limitation on the amount treated as a reduction of U.S. taxable income), the taxable income from sources within the United States which is reduced by potential preference amounts with respect to each foreign country or possession is an amount which bears the same relationship to such income as the potential preference amount with respect to such foreign country or possession bears to the total of the potential preference amounts with respect to all foreign countries and possessions. For purposes of this subparagraph, the potential preference amount with respect to a foreign country or possession is the lesser of the amount of foreign source preference (described in subparagraph (1)(i)(a) of this paragraph) attributable to such country or possession or the amount of foreign source loss (described in subparagraph (1)(i)(b) of this paragraph) attributable to such country or possession.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Net operating loss. Where there is an overall net operating loss for the taxable year and the total of the potential preference amounts with respect to all foreign countries and possessions exceeds the taxpayer's taxable income from sources within the United States, the amount of such excess is treated as ``suspense preferences''. The suspense preferences are converted into actual items of tax preference, arising in the loss year and subject to the provisions of section 56, as the net operating loss is used in other taxable years, in the form of a net operating loss deduction under section 172, to offset taxable income from sources within the United States. Suspense preferences attributable to a foreign country or possession which, in other taxable years, reduce taxable income from sources within such country or possession or offset taxable income from sources within any other foreign country or possession lose their character as suspense preferences and, thus, are never converted into actual items of tax preference. The amount of the suspense preferences which are converted into actual items of tax preference is equal to that portion of the net operating loss attributable to the suspense preferences which offsets taxable income from sources within the United States in taxable years other than the loss year. The determination of the component parts of the net operating loss and the determination of the amount by which the portion of the net operating loss attributable to the suspense preferences offsets taxable income from sources within the United States is made on a year-by-year basis in the same order as the net operating loss is used in accordance with section 172(b). Such determination is made by applying deductions attributable to United States source income first against such income and applying deductions attributable to income from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States first against income from sources within such country or possession and in accordance with the following principles:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Deductions attributable to items or classes of gross income from sources within the United States offset taxable income from sources within the United States before any remaining deductions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Deductions attributable to items or classes of gross income from sources within any foreign country or possession of the United States which are not suspense preferences (referred to in this paragraph as ``other foreign deductions'') offset taxable income from sources within such country or possession before any remaining deductions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Suspense preferences attributable to items or classes of gross income from sources within a foreign country or possession offset any remaining taxable income from sources within such foreign country or possession after application of (b) of this subdivision (ii) before any remaining deductions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Suspense preferences from each foreign country and possession (remaining after application of (c) of this subdivision (ii)) offset taxable income from sources within the Unted States (remaining after application of (a) of this subdivision (ii)) before other foreign deductions pro rata on the basis of the total of such suspense preferences;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Other foreign deductions from each foreign country and possession (remaining after application of (b) of this subdivision (ii)) offset taxable income from sources within the United States (remaining after application (a) and (b) of this subdivision (ii)) pro rata on the basis of the total of such other foreign deductions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Deductions attributable to income from sources within the United States (remaining after application of (a) of this subdivision (ii)) offset taxable income from sources within any foreign country or possession before any foreign deductions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Other foreign deductions from each foreign country and possession (remaining after application of (b) and (e) of this subdivision (ii)) offset taxable income from sources within any other foreign countries or possessions (remaining after application of (f) of this subdivision (ii)) pro rata on the basis of the total of such other foreign deductions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Suspense preferences (remaining after the application of (c) and (d) of this subdivision (ii)) offset taxable income from sources within any foreign country or possession (remaining after

For purposes of the above computations, taxable income is computed with the modifications specifed in section 172(b)(2) or section 172(c), whichever is applicable. However, the amount of suspense preferences which are converted into actual items of tax preference in accordance with the above principles is reduced to the extent the suspense preferences offset increases in taxable income from sources within the United States due to the modifications specified in section 172(b)(2) or section 172(c). For this purpose, suspense preferences are considered to offset an increase in taxable income due to section 172(b)(2) or section 172(c) modifications only after reducing taxable income computed before such modifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples in each of which the per-country foreign tax credit limitation is applicable. For purposes of these examples, personal deductions and exemptions are disregarded.</p><p class="depth0">Example (1).

Since the total potential preference amounts ($45,000) is less than the taxable income from sources within the United States ($60,000), no modification of U.S. taxable income is required. Thus, the amount by which the U.K. preferences reduce the tax on taxable income from sources within the United States, determined in a manner consistent with subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, is the smallest of (1) the items of tax preference attributable to the United Kingdom ($45,000), (2) the excess of deductions over gross income attributable to the United Kingdom ($70,000), or (3) taxable income from sources within the United States ($60,000). The full $45,000 of U.K. preference items are, therefore, taken into account as items of tax preference in 1971 and subject to the minimum tax.
