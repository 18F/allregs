                            <p class="depth0">Prior to collecting any debt by administrative offset or referring  such claim to another agency for collection through administrative  offset, NCUA shall provide the debtor with a written Notice of Intent to  Collect by Administrative Offset (the Notice) at least 30 calendar days  before administrative offset is to commence.</p><p class="depth0">The Notice shall provide the following information:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The nature and amount of the debt, the intention of NCUA to  collect the debt through administrative offset, and a statement of the  rights of the debtor under this section, including the right to request  a waiver under 5 U.S.C. 5584;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An opportunity to inspect and copy the records of NCUA related  to the debt or receive copies if personal inspection is impractical;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The payment due date, which shall be 30 calendar days from the  date after receipt of the initial demand for payment;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An opportunity for the debtor to obtain a review of the  determination of indebtedness. Any request for review by the debtor  shall be in writing and shall be submitted to NCUA within 15 calendar  days after receipt of the Notice. NCUA may waive the time limits for  requesting review for good cause shown by the debtor. NCUA shall provide  the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An applicable statute authorizes or requires NCUA to consider  waiver of the indebtedness involved, the debtor requests waiver of the  indebtedness, and the waiver determination turns on an issue of  credibility or veracity; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and NCUA  determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by  review of the documentary evidence, as for example, when the validity of  the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity. Unless otherwise  required by law, an oral hearing under this subpart is not required to  be a formal evidentiary hearing, although NCUA shall document all  significant matters discussed at the hearing. In those cases where an  oral hearing is not required by this subpart, NCUA shall make its  determination on the request for waiver or reconsideration based upon a  review of the written record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An opportunity to enter into a written agreement for the  repayment of the amount of the claim at the discretion of NCUA;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> That charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs  will be assessed against the debtor, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717,  if payment is not received by the payment due date, unless excused by  the FCCS;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> That if the debtor has not entered into an agreement with NCUA  to pay the debt, has not requested NCUA to review the debt, or has not  paid the debt by the payment due date, NCUA intends to collect the debt  by all legally available means;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The name and address of the Executive Director whom the debtor  shall send all correspondence relating to the debt; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Other information, as may be appropriate.</p>
