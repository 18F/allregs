                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are one member of  a class of chlorinated aromatic compounds which have been determined to  be hazardous to health and the environment. They are used, among other  things, as insulators and coolants for electric cables and components  such as transformers and capacitors, as additives for extreme pressure  lubricants, and as coatings in foundry use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Substances containing PCBs are divided into three classes  according to the concentration of PCBs present, as measured by parts per  million (ppm).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Zero through 49 ppm is classified as an excluded PCB product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fifty through 499 ppm PCB is classified as PCB item.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Five hundred or greater ppm PCB is classified as PCB.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Excluded PCB products (0-49 ppm PCB) are not subject to Federal  restrictions and may be transferred, donated, sold, or otherwise  processed under parts 101-43 through 101-46 of this chapter provided  such processing conforms to the provisions of this section and all  applicable State and local laws. Some States regulate PCB concentrations  at a stricter level than does the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All PCBs and PCB items to be transferred, donated, or sold shall  be labeled or marked conspicuously with a warning substantially as  follows:</p><p class="depth3">Caution--This item contains PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), a  toxic environmental contaminant requiring special handling and disposal  in accordance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulation  (40 CFR 761), applicable State laws, and 41 CFR 101-42.1102-2. For  proper disposal information, contact the nearest EPA office. For  transportation requirements, see 49 CFR Parts 171-180.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Unmarked or unlabeled items containing PCBs or PCB items with an  unknown level of concentration of PCBs shall not be transferred,  donated, or sold.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Utilization requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> PCBs and PCB items are reported  for utilization screening in accordance with Sec. 101-42.204.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transfers of excess PCBs or PCB items shall not be approved by  GSA unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The items are intact, non-leaking, and totally enclosed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The SF 122, Transfer Order Excess Personal Property, or other  transfer document cites the specific provision in 40 CFR Part 761 that  permits continued use of the item, and contains a certification that the  property has been inspected by the transferee and complies with all the  use, inspection, labeling, and other provisions of 40 CFR part 761.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a PCB or PCB item is transferred as excess to another  agency, the receiving agency shall annotate its property accountability  records to reflect the nature and extent of the PCB content and shall  list the provisions of 40 CFR part 761 authorizing use of the item. If  tests are conducted to ascertain the nature and extent of PCB  contamination, the receiving agency shall furnish the GSA regional  office with a copy of the test results. Such information shall be  perpetuated on any notification or release documents when the agency  disposes of the property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Donation requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No PCB or PCB-contaminated items  shall be approved by GSA for donation under part 101-44 unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The certification required by Sec. 101-42.1102(a)(4) appears on  the SF 123, Transfer Order Surplus Personal Property;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The specific donee has been determined; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A justification from the recipient is attached stating the  proposed use of the property and citing the specific provision in 40 CFR  part 761 that permits continued use of the item.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All PCBs and PCB items must be in usable condition and in  working order to be eligible for donation. Such items that are not in  usable condition will not be approved for donation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Items to be donated must be intact, totally enclosed, and non- leaking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If PCBs or PCB items are donated to service educational  activities or to   public airports, the Department of Defense or the Federal Aviation  Administration, respectively, shall obtain the following signed warning  and certification from the donee. State agencies for surplus property  shall have the warning and certification typed or stamped on the face of  each copy of the distribution document and signed and dated by the  authorized representative of the donee organization at the time the  property is issued.</p><p class="depth3">Warning and certification:</p><p class="depth3">The donee is aware that the item(s) listed as containing  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a toxic environmental contaminant,  require(s) special handling and disposal in accordance with U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency regulation (40 CFR part 761) and U.S.  Department of Transportation regulations codified in 49 CFR parts 171- 180. The donee certifies that this item will be handled and disposed of  in accordance with applicable Federal statutes and regulations and  applicable State laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Sales requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Surplus PCBs or PCB items normally shall  not be sold by GSA or holding agencies. These items are regarded as  extremely hazardous and are to be disposed of by the holding agency  under the Environmental Protection Agency regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Agencies may request the authority to sell, or that GSA sell, a  specific PCB or PCB item. Such requests shall cite the provision in 40  CFR part 761 that authorizes sale and continued use of the specific  item. Any such requests shall also include a justification for sale of  the item rather than disposal under the EPA regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If PCBs or PCB items are to be sold, the corresponding  invitation for bids (IFB), any Standard Form (SF) which lists such  items, and any printed matter which advertises the sale of such items  shall contain the warning as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Abandonment and destruction. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> PCBs and PCB items of personal  property not disposed of via utilization, donation, or sale shall be  destroyed or otherwise disposed of in accordance with the Environmental  Protection Agency regulation (40 CFR part 761) and applicable State  laws.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Holding agencies shall contact the nearest office of the EPA for  assistance in complying with the provisions of 40 CFR part 761.</p>
