This responsibility will include negotiation for  matrix support and services outside the chain of command when additional  expertise is needed to prepare, review, or otherwise support the  development and approval of NEPA analyses and documentation. These NEPA  costs may be borne by successful contract offerors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ensure accuracy and adequacy of NEPA analyses, regardless of the  author. This work includes incorporation of comments from appropriate  servicing Army environmental and legal staffs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Ensure adequate opportunities for public review and comment on  proposed NEPA actions, in accordance with applicable laws and EOs as  discussed in Sec. 651.14 (e).

These documents will provide enough information to ensure that  Army decision makers (at all levels) are informed in the performance of  their duties (40 CFR 1501.2, 1505.1). This result requires coordination  and resolution of important issues developed during the environmental  analysis process, especially when the proposed action may involve  significant environmental impacts, and includes the incorporation of  comments from an affected installation's environmental office in  recommendations made to decision makers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Adequately fund and implement the decision including all  mitigation actions and effectiveness monitoring.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Prepare and maintain the official record copy of all NEPA  analyses and documentation for which they are the proponent.

In addition, copies of all EAs and FNSIs (in electronic  copy) will be provided to ODEP. A copy of the documentation should be  maintained for six years after signature of the FNSI/ROD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Maintain the administrative record for the environmental  analysis performed. The administrative record shall be retained by the  proponent for a period of six years after completion of the action,  unless the action is controversial or of a nature that warrants keeping  it longer. The administrative record includes all documents and  information used to make the decision. This administrative record should  contain, but is not limited to, the following types of records:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Technical information used to develop the description of the  proposed action, purpose and need, and the range of alternatives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Studies and inventories of affected environmental baselines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Correspondence with regulatory agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Correspondence with, and comments from, private citizens,  Native American tribes, Alaskan Natives, local governments, and other  individuals and agencies contacted during public involvement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Maps used in baseline studies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Maps and graphics prepared for use in the analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Affidavits of publications and transcripts of any public  participation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Other written records that document the preparation of the  NEPA analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> An index or table of contents for the administrative record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Identify other requirements that can be integrated and  coordinated within the NEPA process. After doing so, the proponent  should establish a strategy for concurrent, not sequential, compliance;  sharing similar data, studies, and analyses; and consolidating  opportunities for public participation. Examples of relevant statutory  and regulatory processes are given in Sec. 651.14 (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Identify and coordinate with public agencies, private  organizations, and individuals that may have an interest in or  jurisdiction over a resource that might be impacted. Coordination should  be accomplished in cooperation with the Installation Environmental  Offices in order to maintain contact and continuity with the regulatory  and environmental communities. Applicable agencies include, but are not  limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> State Historic Preservation Officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Tribal Historic Preservation Officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Regional offices of the EPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> State agencies charged with protection of the environment,  natural resources, and fish and wildlife.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> USACE Civil Works regulatory functions, including Clean Water  Act, Section 404, permitting and wetland protection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> National Marine Fisheries Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Local agencies and/or governing bodies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Environmental interest groups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Minority, low-income, and disabled populations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Tribal governments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Existing advisory groups (for example, Restoration Advisory  Boards, Citizens Advisory Commissions, etc.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Identify and coordinate, in concert with environmental offices,  proposed actions and supporting environmental analyses with local and/or  regional ecosystem management initiatives such as the Mojave Desert  Ecosystem Management Initiative or the Chesapeake Bay Initiative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Review Army policies, including AR 200-1 (Environmental  Protection and Enhancement), AR 200-3 (Natural Resources--Land, Forest,  and Wildlife Management), and AR 200-4 (Cultural Resources Management)  to ensure that the proposed action is coordinated with appropriate  resource managers, operators, and planners, and is consistent with  existing Army plans and their supporting NEPA analyses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Identify potential impacts to (and consult with as appropriate)  American Indian, Alaskan Native, or Native Hawaiian lands, resources, or  cultures (for example, sacred sites, traditional cultural properties,  treaty rights, subsistence hunting or fishing rights, or cultural items  subject to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act  (NAGPRA)). All consultation shall be conducted on a Government-to- Government basis in accordance with the Presidential Memorandum on  Government-to-Government Relations with Tribal Governments (April 29,  1994) (3 CFR, 1994 Comp., p. 1007) and AR 200-4 (Cultural Resources  Management). Proponents shall consider, as appropriate, executing  Memoranda of Agreements (MOAs) with interested Native American groups  and tribes to facilitate timely and effective participation in the NEPA  process. These agreements should be accomplished in cooperation with  Installation Environmental Offices in order to maintain contact and  continuity with the regulatory and environmental communities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Review NEPA documentation that relies upon mitigations that  were not accomplished to determine if the NEPA analysis needs to be  rewritten or updated. Such an update is required if the unaccomplished  mitigation was used to support a FNSI. Additional public notice/ involvement must accompany any rewrites.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(r)</em> The Commander, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC).  The Commander, TRADOC will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ensure that NEPA requirements are understood and options  incorporated in the Officer Foundation Standards (OFS).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Integrate environmental considerations into doctrine, training,  leader development, organization, materiel, and soldier (DTLOMS)  processes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Include environmental expert representation on all Integrated  Concept Teams (ICTs) involved in requirements determinations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Ensure that TRADOC CBTDEVs retain and transfer any environmental  analysis or related data (such as alternatives analysis) to the MATDEV  upon approval of a materiel need. This information and data will serve  as the basis for the MATDEV's Acquisition Strategy and subsequent NEPA  analyses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Ensure that environmental considerations are incorporated into  the Mission Needs Statements (MNSs) and Operational Requirements  Documents (ORDs).</p>
