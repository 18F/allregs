The reviewing official may  respond to the motion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If, in his motion to reopen, a defendant demonstrates  extraordinary circumstances excusing his failure to file a timely  answer, the ALJ will withdraw the initial decision, and grant the  defendant an opportunity to answer the complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A decision by the ALJ to deny a defendant's motion to reopen a  case is not subject to review or reconsideration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The defendant may appeal to the authority head the decision  denying a motion to reopen by filing a notice of appeal with the  authority head within 15 days after the ALJ denies the motion.
