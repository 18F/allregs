                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. Excess Income consists of cash collected as rent from the residents by the mortgagor, on a unit-by-unit basis, that is in excess of the HUD-approved unassisted Basic Rent. The unit-by-unit requirement necessitates that, if a unit has Excess Income, the Excess Income must be returned to HUD. It is not permissible to do an aggregate calculation of the Excess Income for all occupied rent-paying units, and then to offset or subtract from that figure any unpaid rent from occupied or vacant units, before remitting Excess Income to HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General requirement to return Excess Income. Except as otherwise provided in this section, or as agreed to by HUD pursuant to a plan of action approved under 24 CFR part 248 or in connection with an adjustment of contract rents under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 Act (1937 Act) (42 U.S.C. 1437f), the mortgagor shall agree to pay monthly to HUD the total of all Excess Income in accordance with procedures prescribed by HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Retention of Excess Income for project use--(1) Eligible mortgagors. Any mortgagor of a project receiving Section 236 interest reduction payments may apply to retain Excess Income for project use unless the mortgagor owes prior Excess Income and is not current in payments under a HUD-approved Workout or Repayment Agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Eligible mortgagors. Any mortgagor of a project receiving Section 236 interest reduction payments may apply to retain Excess Income for project use unless the mortgagor owes prior Excess Income and is not current in payments under a HUD-approved Workout or Repayment Agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Eligible uses. Excess Income retained by a mortgagor for project use may be used for any necessary and reasonable operating expense of the project. Examples of necessary and reasonable operating expenses are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Project operating shortfalls, including repair costs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Repair costs identified in the Comprehensive Needs Assessment, including increasing deposits to the Reserve Fund for Replacements to a limit necessary to adequately fund the reserve;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Service coordinators;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Neighborhood networks located at the project for project residents; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Enhanced supportive services for the residents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Request for approval to retain Excess Income. A mortgagor must submit a written request to retain Excess Income for project use to the local HUD Field Office. The request must describe:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount or percentage of Excess Income requested;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The period from which Excess Income is being requested; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The proposed use of the requested Excess Income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Retention of Excess Income for non-project use--(1) Eligible mortgagors. Any mortgagor of a project receiving Section 236 interest reduction payments may apply to retain Excess Income for non-project use unless the mortgagor owes prior Excess Income and is not current in payments under a HUD-approved Workout or Repayment Agreement or the mortgagor falls within any of the following categories:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Eligible mortgagors.

Excess Income retained by a mortgagor for non-project use may be used for any purpose, except that the non-project use of Excess Income by a nonprofit entity mortgagor is limited to activities that carry out the entity's nonprofit purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Request for approval to retain Excess Income.

A mortgagor requesting approval to retain Excess Income for a specific, ongoing purpose where the purpose extends beyond the current fiscal year may submit a request that describes the proposed use of Excess Income and advises that the intended use will extend beyond the current fiscal year. If HUD approves the request, following review of the request in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, the mortgagor will not be required to submit a new request each fiscal year provided the use of Excess Income remains the same. The mortgagor will still be required to submit the Monthly Report of Excess Income and the end of year narrative under paragraph (g) of this section. If the use of Excess Income changes, the mortgagor must notify HUD of the change and submit a new request to retain Excess Income 90 days prior to the date the mortgagor intends to begin retaining Excess Income for the new purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> HUD review and response procedure. HUD will review a mortgagor's request to retain Excess Income and issue a letter of approval or denial as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Approval letter.
