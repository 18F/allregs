                            <p class="depth0">The provisions of this subpart B are authorized under section 103 of  the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (Pub.  L. 101-235, approved December 15, 1989) (42 U.S.C. 3537a) (hereinafter,  Section 103). Both the provisions of Section 103 and this subpart B  apply for the purposes of Section 103. Section 103 proscribes direct or  indirect communication of certain information during the selection  process by HUD employees to persons within or outside of the Department  who are not authorized to receive that information. The purpose of the  proscription is to preclude giving an unfair advantage to applicants who  would receive information not available to other applicants or to the  public. Section 103 also authorizes the Department to impose a civil  money penalty on a HUD employee who knowingly discloses protected  information, if such a violation of Section 103 is material, and  authorizes the Department to   sanction the person who received information improperly by, among other  things, denying assistance to that person.</p>
