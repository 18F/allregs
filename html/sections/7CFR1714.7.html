                            <p class="depth0">Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the municipal  interest rate may not exceed 7 percent on a loan advance to a borrower  primarily engaged in providing retail electric service if the borrower  meets, at the time of loan approval, either the consumer density test  set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, or both the rate disparity  test for the interest rate cap and the consumer income test set forth in  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Low consumer density test. The borrower meets this test if the  average number of consumers per mile of line of its total electric  system, based on the most recent data available at the time of loan  approval is less than 5.50.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rate disparity test for the interest rate cap. The borrower  meets this test if its average revenue per kWh sold is more than the  average revenue per kWh sold by all electric utilities in the state in  which the borrower provides service. To determine whether a borrower  meets this test, RUS will compare the borrower's average total revenue  with statewide data in the table of Average Revenue per Kilowatthour for  Electric Utilities by Sector, Census Division and State, in the Electric  Power Annual issued by the Energy Information Administration of the  Department of Energy (DOE), or the successor to this table. The test  will be based on the most recent calendar year for which full year DOE  data are available at the time of loan approval and borrower data for  the same year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Consumer income test.The borrower meets this test if either the  average per capita income of the residents receiving electric service  from the borrower is less than the average per capita income of  residents of the state in which the borrower provides service or the  median household income of the households receiving electric service  from the borrower is less than the median household income of the  households in the state.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To qualify under the consumer income test, the borrower must  include in its loan application information about the location of its  residential consumers. The borrower must provide to RUS, based on the  most recent data available at the time of loan application, either the  number of consumers in each county it serves or the number of consumers  in each census tract it serves. Using the most recently published  decennial census data on income from the Bureau of the Census, RUS will  compare, on a weighted average basis, the average per capita and median  household income of the counties or census tracts served by the borrower  with state figures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In cases where conditions have substantially changed so that  the decennial census data no longer accurately describes the economic  conditions of the borrower's consumers, the borrower may provide RUS  with more current income data from a reliable source such as a State  agency. The Administrator has the sole discretion to determine whether  such data submitted by the borrower is sufficient to determine whether  the borrower qualifies under the consumer income test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Borrowers serving 2 or more states. If a borrower serves  consumers in 2 or more states, the rate disparity test and the consumer  income test will be determined on a weighted average based on the  percentage of the borrower's total consumers that are served in each  state.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> High density test. If the average number of consumers per mile  of the borrower's total electric system exceeds 17, the interest rate  cap will not apply to funds used for the purpose of furnishing or  improving electric service to consumers located in an area that is an  urban area at the time of loan approval, notwithstanding that the area  must have been deemed a rural area for the purpose of qualifying for a  loan under this part. (See the definition of ``rural area'' in 7 CFR  1710.2.) If the average number of consumers per mile of line of the  borrower's total electric system exceeds 17, the borrower must include,  as a note on RUS Form 740c, Cost Estimates and Loan Budget for Electric  Borrowers, submitted as part of the loan application for a loan subject  to the interest rate cap, a breakdown of funds included in the proposed  loan to furnish or improve service to consumers located in such urban  areas. For such borrowers only funds for those facilities serving  consumers located outside an urban area are eligible for the interest  rate cap.</p>
