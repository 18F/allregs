                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section applies to a financial institution or  creditor that is a federal credit union.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section and appendix J, the  following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Account means a continuing relationship established by a person  with a federal credit union to obtain a product or service for personal,  family, household or business purposes. Account includes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An extension of credit, such as the purchase of property or  services involving a deferred payment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A share or deposit account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term board of directors refers to a federal credit union's  board of directors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Covered account means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An account that a federal credit union offers or maintains,  primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, that involves or  is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions, such as a  credit card account, mortgage loan, automobile loan, checking account,  or share account; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any other account that the federal credit union offers or  maintains for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to members or  to the safety and soundness of the federal credit union from identity  theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation, or  litigation risks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Credit has the same meaning as in 15 U.S.C. 1681a(r)(5).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Customer means a member that has a covered account with a  federal credit union.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Financial institution has the same meaning as in 15 U.S.C.  1681a(t).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Identity theft has the same meaning as in 16 CFR 603.2(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Red Flag means a pattern, practice, or specific activity that  indicates the possible existence of identity theft.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Service provider means a person that provides a service  directly to the federal credit union.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Periodic Identification of Covered Accounts. Each federal credit  union must periodically determine whether it offers or maintains covered  accounts. As a part of this determination, a federal credit union must  conduct a risk assessment to determine whether it offers or maintains  covered accounts described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section,  taking into consideration:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The methods it provides to open its accounts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The methods it provides to access its accounts; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Its previous experiences with identity theft.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Establishment of an Identity Theft Prevention Program. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Program requirement. Each federal credit union that offers or maintains  one or more covered accounts must develop and implement a written  Identity Theft Prevention Program (Program) that is designed to detect,  prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of a  covered account or any existing covered account. The Program must be  appropriate to the size and complexity of the federal credit union and  the nature and scope of its activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Elements of the Program. The Program must include reasonable  policies and procedures to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identify relevant Red Flags for the covered accounts that the  federal credit union offers or maintains, and incorporate those Red  Flags into its Program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Detect Red Flags that have been incorporated into the Program  of the federal credit union;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Respond appropriately to any Red Flags that are detected  pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section to prevent and mitigate  identity theft; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Ensure the Program (including the Red Flags determined to be  relevant) is updated periodically, to reflect changes in risks to  members and to the safety and soundness of the federal credit union from  identity theft.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Administration of the Program. Each federal credit union that is  required to implement a Program must provide for the continued  administration of the Program and must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Obtain approval of the initial written Program from either its  board of directors or an appropriate committee of the board of  directors;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Involve the board of directors, an appropriate committee  thereof, or a designated employee at the level of senior management in  the oversight, development, implementation and administration of the  Program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Train staff, as necessary, to effectively implement the Program;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Exercise appropriate and effective oversight of service provider  arrangements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Guidelines. Each federal credit union that is required to  implement a Program must consider the guidelines in appendix J of this  part and include in its Program those guidelines that are appropriate.</p>
