                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. Under Article III(3(c)) and (5(c)) of the Treaty, an  import permit or an introduction-from-the-sea certificate for Appendix-I  species can be issued only if the Management Authority is satisfied that  the specimen is not to be used for primarily commercial purposes. Trade  in Appendix-I species must be subject to particularly strict regulation  and authorized only in exceptional circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> How we make our findings. We must find that the intended use of  the Appendix-I specimen is not for primarily commercial purposes before  we can issue a CITES document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We will make this decision on a case-by-case basis considering  all available information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicant must provide sufficient information to satisfy us  that the intended use is not for primarily commercial purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The definitions of ``commercial'' and ``primarily commercial  purposes'' in Sec.  23.5 apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> We will look at all aspects of the intended use of the specimen.  If the noncommercial aspects do not clearly predominate, we will  consider the import or introduction from the sea to be for primarily  commercial purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> While the nature of the transaction between the owner in the  country of export and the recipient in the country of import or  introduction from the sea may have some commercial aspects, such as the  exchange of money to cover the costs of shipment and care of specimens  during transport, it is the intended use of the specimen, including the  purpose of the export, that must not be for primarily commercial  purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> We will conduct an assessment of factors listed in paragraph (d)  of this section. For activities involving an anticipated measurable  increase in revenue and other economic value associated with the  intended use, we will conduct an analysis as described in paragraph (e)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> All net profits generated in the United States from activities  associated with the import of an Appendix-I species must be used for  conservation of that species.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The following are examples of types of transactions in  which the noncommercial aspects of the intended use of the specimen may  predominate depending on the facts of each situation. The discussions of  each example provide further guidance in assessing the actual degree of  commerciality on a case-by-case basis. These examples outline  circumstances commonly encountered and do not cover all situations where  import or introduction from the sea could be found to be not for  primarily commercial purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Personal use. Import or introduction from the sea of an  Appendix-I specimen for personal use generally is considered to be not  for primarily commercial purposes. An example is the import of a  personal sport-hunted trophy by the person who hunted the wildlife for  display in his or her own home.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Scientific purposes. The import or introduction from the sea of  an Appendix-I specimen by a scientist or scientific institution may be  permitted in situations where resale, commercial exchange, or exhibit of  the specimen for economic benefit is not the primary intended use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Conservation, education, or training. Generally an Appendix-I  specimen may be imported or introduced from the sea by government  agencies or nonprofit institutions for purposes of conservation,  education, or training. For example, a specimen could be imported or  introduced from the sea primarily to train customs staff in effective  CITES control, such as for identification of certain types of specimens.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Biomedical industry. Import or introduction from the sea of an  Appendix-I specimen by an institution or company in the biomedical  industry is   initially presumed to be commercial since specimens are typically  imported or introduced from the sea to develop and sell products that  promote public health for profit. However, if the importer clearly shows  that the sale of products is only incidental to public health research  and not for the primary purpose of economic benefit or profit, then such  an import or introduction from the sea could be considered as scientific  research under paragraph (c)(2) of this section if the principles of  paragraph (b) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Captive-breeding or artificial propagation programs. The import  of an Appendix-I specimen for purposes of establishing a commercial  operation for breeding or artificial propagation is considered to be for  primarily commercial purposes. As a general rule, import or introduction  from the sea of an Appendix-I specimen for a captive-breeding or  artificial propagation program must have as a priority the long-term  protection and recovery of the species in the wild. The captive-breeding  or artificial propagation program must be part of a program aimed at the  recovery of the species in the wild and be undertaken with the support  of a country within the species' native range. Any profit gained must be  used to support this recovery program. If a captive-breeding or  artificial propagation operation plans to sell surplus specimens to help  offset the costs of its program, import or introduction from the sea  would be allowed only if any profit would be used to support the  captive-breeding or artificial propagation program to the benefit of the  Appendix-I species, not for the personal economic benefit of a private  individual or share-holder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Professional dealers. Import or introduction from the sea by a  professional dealer who states a general intention to eventually sell  the specimen or its offspring to an undetermined recipient would be  considered to be for primarily commercial purposes. However, import or  introduction from the sea through a professional dealer by a qualified  applicant may be acceptable if the ultimate intended use would be for  one of the purposes set out in paragraphs (c)(2), (3), and (5) of this  section and where a binding contract, conditioned on the issuing of  permits, is in place.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> to assess the level of scrutiny and amount of information we need to  make a finding of whether the intended use of the specimen is not for  primarily commercial purposes. We give less scrutiny and require less  detailed information when the import or introduction from the sea poses  a low risk of being primarily commercial, and give more scrutiny and  require more detailed information when the proposed activity poses  greater risk. We consider the cumulative risks, recognizing that each  aspect of the international trade has a continuum of risk from high to  low associated with it as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Type of importer: From for-profit entity to private individual  to nonprofit entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ability of the proposed uses to generate revenue: From the  ability to generate measurable increases in revenue or other economic  value to no anticipated increases in revenue or other economic value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Appeal of the species: From high public appeal to low public  appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Occurrence of the species in the United States: From uncommon to  common in a controlled environment in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Intended use of offspring: From commercial to noncommercial.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Analysis of anticipated revenues and other economic value. We  will analyze revenues and other economic value anticipated to result  from the use of the specimen for activities with a high risk of being  primarily commercial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We will examine the proposed use of any net profits generated in  the United States. We consider net profit to include all funds or other  valuable considerations (including enhanced value of common stock  shares) received or attained by you or those affiliated with you as a  result of the import or introduction from the sea, to the extent that  such funds or other valuable considerations exceed the reasonable  expenses that are properly attributable to the proposed activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We will consider any conservation project to be funded and, if  the species   was or is to be taken from the wild, how the project benefits the  species in its native range, including agreements, timeframes for  accomplishing tasks, and anticipated benefits to the species.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> We will consider any plans to monitor a proposed conservation  project, including expenditure of funds or completion of tasks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In rare cases involving unusually high net profits, we will  require the applicant to provide a detailed analysis of expected revenue  (both direct and indirect) and expenses to show anticipated net profit,  and a statement from a licensed, independent certified public accountant  that the internal accounting system is sufficient to account for and  track funds generated by the proposed activities.</p>
