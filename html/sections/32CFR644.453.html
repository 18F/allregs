                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Engineer estimate and appraisal. Any restoration case not covered by the definitions of minor restoration case in paragraph (a) of Sec. 644.452 is a major restoration case. A complete engineer estimate and appraisal will be prepared by the DE for use in negotiating a cash settlement, or to determine the cost of restoration, if the work is to be performed by the Government. ENG Form 1440-R, Cost of Restoration, will be used for this purpose. A copy of this form will be transmitted to the General Accounting Office in support of settlements made with landowners in the case of military property and contains the minimum data required by that office. Such transmittal is not required when civil works property is involved. In order to afford a measure of flexibility, ENG Form 1440-R is divided into five parts, each relating to specific factors, to be used as conditions may require.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preparation of ENG Form 1440-R. Comments and instructions for preparation of ENG Form 1440-R are contained in the following paragraphs which are keyed to the item numbers

on the Recapitulation sheet, part I of the form:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``1'' to ``6'' Self-explanatory.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``7. Original Cost (Actual or Estimated) of Government-owned improvements, fixtures and alterations: (part 4).'' The General Accounting Office requires that, in all cases involving the relinquishment of Government-owned improvements to lessors in lieu of restoration, and in any other cases where a contract is entered into between the Government and another party to transfer improvements, the original cost of the improvements be given. If not ascertainable, an estimate should be submitted. In exceptional cases, where, because of the circumstances or expense of the work involved, neither the original cost nor a reasonably accurate estimate can be given, an explanation of the facts and circumstances is required. Where structures have been built under contract, or improvements made under contract, a citation to the contract under which the work was performed should be submitted with the original cost statement, estimate, or explanation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ``8. Estimated Market Value, (Value in place of Government-owned improvements, fixtures, and alterations): (part 4).'' An estimate will be made of the current market value of the buildings or improvements in place. In those cases where it is indicated that the Government-owned buildings or improvements located on leased lands may materially enhance the value of the leased site, an appraiser will estimate the market value of the fee title to the leased area in its unrestored condition. He will also separately estimate the market value of the site, assuming restoration as provided in the existing lease. The difference between the fee title value and restored land value will be reported as the ``value in place'' of the improvements to be sold or otherwise disposed of. ``Value in place'' is defined as the amount by which the improvements involved enhance the market value of the leased site. This value will serve to establish the top sales price expectancy in negotiations with the landowner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> ``9. Gross Salvage Value of Government-owned property: (part 4)''. The ``gross salvage value'' is the highest price obtainable in the open market for Government-owned improvements when sold for use elsewhere than on the leased premises, assuming that no expense to the buyer is involved in the dismantling and/or removal of the improvements from the leased property to the nearest probable market or location of future use. The estimate of gross salvage value should be made in accordance with established property appraisal procedures. Because market demand usually determines the highest and best use to which the components of a group of improvements will be put (e.g., whether a building will be worth more on the market for moving intact to a new site for continued use as a building, or worth more as a stockpile of used construction material), it is important to consider not only prevailing market prices and demand for used construction materials in the vicinity by contacting sources such as local building trades, wrecking companies, used material dealers, etc., but to also give consideration to possible interest by house moving and construction companies and individuals who might utilize improvements intact. Due consideration should also be given in making the estimate to the effect that such facts as the original cost of the improvements, the original cost of the materials therein, and the deterioration or depreciation of the materials in place might have upon the market value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> ``10. Estimated Cost of Dismantling and/or Removal of Government-owned Property: (part 4).'' The estimated dismantling cost and/or cost of removal will be itemized in the appropriate column opposite the itemized listing of improvements on the ENG Form 1440-R (part 4), and the total will be reflected on the recapitulation sheet (part 1). The dismantling cost is the amount of expenditure necessary to accomplish dismantlement in a manner providing the greatest net return to the Government. Net return is the value of the improvements when detached or dismantled, less the cost of dismantling or detaching, and less the cost of removal. The cost of removal is the cost of moving the detached or dismantled improvements to the nearest

probable market or the nearest installation of the Department having adequate storage space. In cases of frame buildings having concrete or similar permanent-type floors or foundations, the cost of removal of such floors or foundations will not be included as an item of dismantling and/or removal cost. Instead, it will be treated as an item in the estimated ``Cost of Restoration other than Cost of Dismantling and Removal'' (Item 12). In developing estimates of gross salvage value and costs of dismantling and/or removal, inquiry should be made of experienced tradesmen, used material dealers, wrecking contractors, etc., familiar with the local market for the types of materials and services involving the current costs of loading, hauling, unloading, cleaning, stockpiling and other economic factors contributing to the current local market value of similar materials in useable form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> ``11. Estimated Net Salvage Value of Government-owned Property: (part 4)''. This amount is obtained by subtracting the estimated cost of dismantling and/or removal (Item 10) from the estimated gross salvage value (Item 9).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> ``12. Cost of Restoration other than Cost of Dismantling and Removal: (part 3)''. From information developed by the joint survey of the property, Sec. 644.447 of this part, it is the responsibility of the real estate officer, or his representative, to advise the personnel responsible for preparing the restoration cost estimate of the items which will require restoration, repair or replacement under the terms of the lease. A brief statement as to the probable cause of damage, in excess of ordinary wear and tear, or resulting from other than circumstances over which the Government has no control, will be included in the supporting data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> ``13. Total Cost of Restoration: (Item 10 plus Item 12)''. The estimates of cost under Items 10 and 12 will be based on sound estimating practices generally employed for the type of work involved. The estimates will be predicated on performance of the work by contract and, therefore, consideration will be given to justifiable allowances for contractor's profits, insurance, employees compensation payments, and overhead.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> ``14. Net Cost of Restoration: (Item 9 minus Item 13)''. In those cases where the cost of dismantling and/or removal of Government-owned improvements (as defined in Item 10), and the other costs of restoration (as defined in Item 12), exceed the gross salvage value (as defined in Item 9), the difference is a minus quantity and constitutes the maximum amount of money which the Government can pay the lessor, in addition to transferring all improvements to him in lieu of restoration and paying rent during the estimated period of restoration (provided such improvements are not considered to have an ``in place'' value). If this is a plus quantity, it represents the minimum amount of cash that the Government can accept from the lessor after transferring to him all items of property or equipment shown in the report, less the allowance for rental during the estimated period of restoration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> ``15. Approximate Time Required for Actual Salvaging and Restoration Operations''. So long as the owner is deprived of use of his property he is entitled to rental stipulated in the lease. A fair allowance will be made in a settlement with the lessor to cover a reasonable time required to fit the premises for use. If all improvements are to be left in place, it may well be that no allowance for rental will be required by the lessor for time required for salvaging.</p>
