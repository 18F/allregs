The following are excepted form the provision in paragraph (a) of this section prohibiting the payment of premium pay:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Continuation of premium pay. An employee given training during a period of duty for which he or she is already receiving premium pay for overtime, night, holiday, or Sunday work shall continue to receive that premium pay. This exception does not apply to an employee assigned to full-time training at institutions of higher learning.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Training at night. An employee given training at night because situations that he or she must learn to handle occur only at night shall be paid by the applicable premium pay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cost savings. An employee given training on overtime, on a holiday, or on a Sunday because the costs of the training, premium pay included, are less than the costs of the same training confined to regular work hours shall be paid the applicable premium pay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Availability pay. An agency shall continue to pay availability pay during agency-sanctioned training to a criminal investigator who is eligible for it under 5 U.S.C. 5545a and implementing regulations.

(i) A firefighter compensated under part 550, subpart M, of this chapter shall receive basic pay and overtime pay for the firefighter's regular tour of duty (as defined in Sec. 550.1302 of this chapter) in any week in which attendance at agency-sanctioned training reduces the hours in the firefighter's regular tour of duty.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A firefighter compensated under part 550, subpart M, of this chapter shall receive basic pay and overtime pay for the firefighter's regular tour of duty (as defined in Sec. 550.1302 of this chapter) in any week in which attendance at agency-sanctioned training reduces the hours in the firefighter's regular tour of duty.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The special pay protection provided by paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section does not apply to firefighters who voluntarily participate in training during non-duty hours, leave hours, or periods of excused absence. It also does not apply if the firefighter is entitled to a greater amount of pay based on actual work hours during the week in which training occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Agency exemption. An employee given training during a period not otherwise covered by a provision of this paragraph may be paid premium pay when the employing agency has been granted an exception to paragraph (a)
