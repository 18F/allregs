If NMFS determines  that the diversity of handling practices at certain ports at which fish  or fish products regulated under this subpart are being imported into  the United States allows for circumvention of the consignment document  requirement, NMFS may undertake a rulemaking to designate, after  consultation with the CBP, those ports at which fish or fish products  regulated under this subpart from any ocean area may be imported into  the United States.
