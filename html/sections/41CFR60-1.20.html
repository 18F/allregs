                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> OFCCP may conduct compliance evaluations to determine if the  contractor maintains nondiscriminatory hiring and employment practices  and is taking affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed  and that employees are placed, trained, upgraded, promoted, and  otherwise treated during employment without regard to race, color,  religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.  A compliance evaluation may consist of any one or any combination of the  following investigative procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compliance review. A comprehensive analysis and evaluation of  the hiring and employment practices of the contractor, the written  affirmative action program, and the results of the affirmative action  efforts undertaken by the contractor. A compliance review may proceed in  three stages:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A desk audit of the written AAP and supporting documentation to  determine whether all elements required by the regulations in this part  are included, whether the AAP meets agency standards of reasonableness,  and whether the AAP and supporting documentation satisfy agency  standards of acceptability. The desk audit is conducted at OFCCP  offices, except in the case of preaward reviews. In a preaward review,  the desk audit normally is conducted at the contractor's establishment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An on-site review, conducted at the contractor's establishment  to investigate unresolved problem areas identified in the AAP and  supporting documentation during the desk audit, to verify that the  contractor has implemented the AAP and has complied with those  regulatory obligations not required to be included in the AAP, and to  examine potential instances or issues of discrimination. An on-site  review normally will involve an examination of the contractor's  personnel and employment policies, inspection and copying of documents  related to employment actions, and interviews with   employees, supervisors, managers, hiring officials; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where necessary, an off-site analysis of information supplied  by the contractor or otherwise gathered during or pursuant to the on- site review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Off-site review of records. An analysis and evaluation of the  AAP (or any part thereof) and supporting documentation, and other  documents related to the contractor's personnel policies and employment  actions that may be relevant to a determination of whether the  contractor has complied with the requirements of the Executive Order and  regulations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compliance check. A determination of whether the contractor has  maintained records consistent with Sec. 60-1.12; at the contractor's  option the documents may be provided either on-site or off-site; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Focused review. An on-site review restricted to one or more  components of the contractor's organization or one or more aspects of  the contractor's employment practices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where deficiencies are found to exist, reasonable efforts shall  be made to secure compliance through conciliation and persuasion. Before  the contractor can be found to be in compliance with the order, it must  make a specific commitment, in writing, to correct any such  deficiencies. The commitment must include the precise action to be taken  and dates for completion. The time period allotted shall be no longer  than the minimum period necessary to effect such changes. Upon approval  of the commitment, the contractor may be considered in compliance, on  condition that the commitments are faithfully kept. The contractor shall  be notified that making such commitments does not preclude future  determinations of noncompliance based on a finding that the commitments  are not sufficient to achieve compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Preaward compliance evaluations. Each agency shall include in  the invitation for bids for each formally advertised nonconstruction  contract or state at the outset of negotiations for each negotiated  contract, that if the award, when let, should total $10 million or more,  the prospective contractor and its known first-tier subcontractors with  subcontracts of $10 million or more shall be subject to a compliance  evaluation before the award of the contract unless OFCCP has conducted  an evaluation and found them to be in compliance with the Order within  the preceding 24 months. The awarding agency will notify OFCCP and  request appropriate action and findings in accordance with this  subsection. Within 15 days of the notice OFCCP will inform the awarding  agency of its intention to conduct a preaward compliance evaluation. If  OFCCP does not inform the awarding agency within that period of its  intention to conduct a preaward compliance evaluation, clearance shall  be presumed and the awarding agency is authorized to proceed with the  award. If OFCCP informs the awarding agency of its intention to conduct  a preaward compliance evaluation, OFCCP shall be allowed an additional  20 days after the date that it so informs the awarding agency to provide  its conclusions. If OFCCP does not provide the awarding agency with its  conclusions within that period, clearance shall be presumed and the  awarding agency is authorized to proceed with the award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Submission of Documents; Standard Affirmative Action Formats.  Each prime contractor or subcontractor with 50 or more employees and a  contract of $50,000 or more is required to develop a written affirmative  action program for each of its establishments (Sec. 60-1.40). If a  contractor fails to submit an affirmative action program and supporting  documents, including the workforce analysis, within 30 days of a  request, the enforcement procedures specified in Sec. 60-1.26(b) shall  be applicable. Contractors may reach agreement with OFCCP on nationwide  AAP formats or on frequency of updating statistics.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Confidentiality and relevancy of information. If the contractor  is concerned with the confidentiality of such information as lists of  employee names, reasons for termination, or pay data, then alphabetic or  numeric coding or the use of an index of pay and pay ranges, consistent  with the ranges assigned to each job group, are acceptable for purposes  of the compliance   evaluation. The contractor must provide full access to all relevant data  on-site as required by Sec. 60-1.43. Where necessary, the compliance  officer may take information made available during the on-site  evaluation off-site for further analysis. An off-site analysis should be  conducted where issues have arisen concerning deficiencies or an  apparent violation which, in the judgment of the compliance officer,  should be more thoroughly analyzed off-site before a determination of  compliance is made. The contractor must provide all data determined by  the compliance officer to be necessary for off-site analysis. Such data  may only be coded if the contractor makes the key to the code available  to the compliance officer. If the contractor believes that particular  information which is to be taken off-site is not relevant to compliance  with the Executive Order, the contractor may request a ruling by the  OFCCP District/Area Director. The OFCCP District/Area Director shall  issue a ruling within 10 days. The contractor may appeal that ruling to  the OFCCP Regional Director within 10 days. The Regional Director shall  issue a final ruling within 10 days. Pending a final ruling, the  information in question must be made available to the compliance officer  off-site, but shall be considered a part of the investigatory file and  subject to the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section. The agency  shall take all necessary precautions to safeguard the confidentiality of  such information until a final determination is made. Such information  may not be copied by OFCCP and access to the information shall be  limited to the compliance officer and personnel involved in the  determination of relevancy. Data determined to be not relevant to the  investigation will be returned to the contractor immediately.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Public Access to Information. OFCCP will treat information  obtained in the compliance evaluation as confidential to the maximum  extent the information is exempt from public disclosure under the  Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. It is the practice of OFCCP  not to release data where the contractor is still in business, and the  contractor indicates, and through the Department of Labor review process  it is determined, that the data are confidential and sensitive and that  the release of data would subject the contractor to commercial harm.
