                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Property of a nonresident who was not a citizen of the United States at the time of his death is considered to be situated in the United States if it is--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Real property located in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tangible personal property located in the United States, except certain works of art on loan for exhibition (see paragraph (b) of Sec. 20.2105-1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of an estate of a decedent dying before November 14, 1966, written evidence of intangible personal property which is treated as being the property itself, such as a bond for the payment of money, if it is physically located in the United States; except that this subparagraph shall not apply to obligations of the United States (but not its instrumentalities) issued before March 1, 1941, if the decedent was not engaged in business in the United States at the time of his death. See section 2106(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Except as specifically provided otherwise in this section or in Sec. 20.2105-1 (which specific exceptions, in the case of estates of decedents dying on or after November 14, 1966, cause this subparagraph to have relatively limited applicability), intangible personal property the written evidence of which is not treated as being the property itself, if it is issued by or enforceable against a resident of the United States or a domestic corporation or governmental unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Shares of stock issued by a domestic corporation, irrespective of the location of the certificates (see, however, paragraph (i) of Sec. 20.2105-1 for a special rule with respect to certain withdrawable accounts in savings and loan or similar associations).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In the case of an estate of a decedent dying before November 14, 1966, moneys deposited in the United States by or for the decedent with any person carrying on the banking business, if the decedent was engaged in business in the United States at the time of his death.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> In the case of an estate of a decedent dying on or after November 14, 1966, except as specifically provided otherwise in paragraph (d), (i), (j), (l), or (m) of Sec. 20.2105-1, any debt obligation, including a bank deposit, the primary obligor of which is--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A United States person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)), or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The United States, a State or any political subdivision thereof, the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of any such government.
This paragraph applies irrespective of whether the written evidence of the debt obligation is treated as being the property itself or whether the decedent was engaged in business in the United States at the time of his death. For purposes of this subparagraph and paragraphs (k), (l), and (m) of Sec. 20.2105-1, a debt obligation on which there are two or more primary obligors shall be apportioned among such obligors, taking into account to the extent appropriate under all the facts and circumstances any choate or inchoate rights of contribution existing among such obligors with respect to the indebtedness. The term ``agency or instrumentality,'' as used in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section does not include a possession of the United States or an agency or instrumentality of a possession. Currency is not a debt obligation for purposes of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> In the case of an estate of a decedent dying on or after January 1, 1970, except as specifically provided otherwise in paragraph (i) or (l) of Sec. 20.2105-1, deposits with a branch in the United States of a foreign corporation, if the branch is engaged in the commercial banking business, whether or not the decedent was engaged in business in the United States at the time of his death.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Transfers. Property of which the decedent has made a transfer taxable under sections 2035 through 2038 is deemed to be situated in the United States if it is determined, under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, to be so situated either at the time of the transfer or at the time of the decedent's death. See Sec. Sec. 20.2035-1 through 20.2038-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Death tax convention. It should be noted that the situs rules described in this section may be modified for various purposes under the provisions of an applicable death tax convention with a foreign country.
