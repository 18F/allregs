                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ratings in general. Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the OCC assigns to a bank a rating of ``outstanding,'' ``satisfactory,'' ``needs to improve,'' or ``substantial noncompliance'' based on the bank's performance under the lending, investment and service tests, the community development test, the small bank performance standards, or an approved strategic plan, as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Lending, investment, and service tests. The OCC assigns a rating for a bank assessed under the lending, investment, and service tests in accordance with the following principles:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the lending test receives an assigned rating of at least ``satisfactory'';</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on both the service test and the investment test and a rating of at least ``high satisfactory'' on the lending test receives an assigned rating of ``outstanding''; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No bank may receive an assigned rating of ``satisfactory'' or higher unless it receives a rating of at least ``low satisfactory'' on the lending test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices. (1) The OCC's evaluation of a bank's CRA performance is adversely affected by evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices in any geography by the bank or in any assessment area by any affiliate whose loans have been considered as part of the bank's lending performance. In connection with any type of lending activity described in Sec. 25.22(a), evidence of discriminatory or other credit practices that violate an applicable law, rule, or regulation includes, but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The OCC's evaluation of a bank's CRA performance is adversely affected by evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices in any geography by the bank or in any assessment area by any affiliate whose loans have been considered as part of the bank's lending performance. In connection with any type of lending activity described in Sec. 25.22(a), evidence of discriminatory or other credit practices that violate an applicable law, rule, or regulation includes, but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Discrimination against applicants on a prohibited basis in violation, for example, of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or the Fair Housing Act;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Violations of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Violations of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Violations of section 8 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Violations of the Truth in Lending Act provisions regarding a consumer's right of rescission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In determining the effect of evidence of practices described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section on the bank's assigned rating, the OCC considers the nature, extent, and strength of the evidence of the practices; the policies and procedures that the bank (or affiliate, as applicable) has in place to prevent the practices; any corrective action that the bank (or affiliate, as applicable) has taken or has committed to take, including voluntary corrective action resulting from self-assessment; and any other relevant information.
