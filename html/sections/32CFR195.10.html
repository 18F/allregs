                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Opportunity for hearing. Whenever an opportunity for a hearing  is required by Sec. 195.9, reasonable notice shall be given by  registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected  applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or  recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision  under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the  matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either  (1) fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice  within which the applicant or recipient may request of the responsible  Department official that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (2)  advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been  set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so  fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The  complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of hearing.  An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written  information and argument. The failure of an applicant or recipient to  request a hearing under this paragraph or to appear at a hearing for  which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to  a hearing under section 602 of the Act and Sec. 195.11(c) and consent to  the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is  available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time and place of hearing. Hearings shall be held at the offices  of the responsible component of the Department of Defense in Washington,  D.C., at a time fixed by the responsible Department official unless he  determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of the  component requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be  held before the responsible Department official or, at his discretion,  before a hearing examiner designated by him.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hearing examiner. The examiner shall be a field grade officer or  civilian employee above the grade of GS-12 (or the equivalent) who shall  be a person admitted to practice law before a Federal court or the  highest court of a State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Right to counsel. In all proceedings under this section, the  applicant or recipient and the responsible component of the Department  shall have the right to be represented by counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The recipient shall receive an open hearing at  which he or his counsel may examine any witnesses present. Both the  responsible Department official and the applicant or recipient shall be  entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in  the notice for hearing or as determined by the officer conducting the  hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings  conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to  assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject  testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably  necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may  exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All  documents and other evidence offered or taken for record shall be open  to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute  facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript  shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance  thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon  the hearing record and written findings shall be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Consolidated or joint hearings. In cases in which the same or  related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part  with respect to two or more programs to which this part applies, or  noncompliance with   this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments  or agencies issued under Title VI of the Act, the Assistant Secretary of  Defense (Manpower), the Secretary of a Military Department, or other  responsible Department official designated by the Assistant Secretary of  Defense (Manpower) after consultation with the Assistant Secretary of  Defense (Manpower) may, by agreement with such other departments or  agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or  joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of appropriate  procedures not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such  cases, insofar as this part is concerned, shall be made in accordance  with Sec. 195.11.  [29 FR 19291, Dec. 31, 1964, as amended at 30 FR 133, Jan. 7, 1965.
