                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Wine produced in the United States which has been  taxpaid, removed from bonded wine premises, and subsequently determined  to be unmerchantable may be returned to bonded wine premises for  reconditioning, reformulation or destruction. The tax paid on United  States wine may, when such wine is returned to bond, be refunded or  credited, without interest, to the proprietor of the bonded wine  premises to which such wine is delivered. However, no tax paid on any  United States wine for which a claim has been or will be made under the  provisions of 27 CFR part 70, subpart G will be refunded or credited. If  the tax on the United States wine has been determined but not paid, the  person liable for the tax may, when such wine is returned to bond, be  relieved of the liability. Claims for refund or credit, or relief from  tax paid or determined on United States wine returned to bond are filed  in accordance with Sec. 24.66.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Receipt. The quantity of unmerchantable taxpaid United States  wine returned to bond is determined upon receipt on bonded wine  premises. The quantity determined will be entered on the TTB F 5120.17,  Report of Bonded Wine Premises Operations for the reporting period  during which the United States wine is returned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Records.
