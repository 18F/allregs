                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The notice of grant award specifies how long NIEHS intends to support the project without requiring the project to recompete for funds. This period, called the project period, will usually be for 1-5 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Generally, the grant will initially be for one year and subsequent continuation awards will also be for one year at a time. A grantee must submit a separate application to have the support continued for each subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and the funding level of such awards will be made after consideration of such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices and the availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require a determination by the NIEHS that continued funding is in the best interest of the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any grant commits or obligates the Federal Government in any way to make any additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved application or portion of an approved application.</p>
