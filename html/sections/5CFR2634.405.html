                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligible entities. An interested party must select an entity that meets the requirements of this regulation to serve as an independent trustee or other fiduciary. The type of entity that is allowed to serve as an independent trustee is a financial institution, not more than 10 percent of which is owned or controlled by a single individual, which is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A bank, as defined in 12 U.S.C. 1841(c); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An investment adviser, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80b-2(a)(11).</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (a):</p><p class="depth3">By the terms of paragraph (3)(A)(i) of section 102(f) of the Act, an individual who is an attorney, a certified public accountant, a broker, or an investment advisor is also eligible to serve as an independent trustee. However, experience of the Office of Government Ethics over the years dictates the necessity of limiting service as a trustee or other fiduciary to the financial institutions referred to in this paragraph, to maintain effective administration of trust arrangements and preserve confidence in the Federal qualified trust program. Accordingly, under its authority pursuant to paragraph (3)(D) of section 102(f) of the Act, the Office of Government Ethics will not approve proposed trustees or other fiduciaries who are not financial institutions, except in unusual cases where compelling necessity is demonstrated to the Director, in his or her sole discretion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Orientation. After the interested party selects a proposed trustee, that proposed trustee should contact the Office of Government Ethics for an orientation about the qualified trust program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Independence requirements. The Director shall determine that a proposed trustee is independent if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The entity is independent of and unassociated with any interested party so that it cannot be controlled or influenced in the administration of the trust by any interested party;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The entity is not and has not been affiliated with any interested party, and is not a partner of, or involved in any joint venture or other investment or business with, any interested party; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any director, officer, or employee of such entity:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is independent of and unassociated with any interested party so that such director, officer, or employee cannot be controlled or influenced in the administration of the trust by any interested party;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is not and has not been employed by any interested party, not served as a director, officer, or employee of any organization affiliated with any interested party, and is not and has not been a partner of, or involved in any joint venture or other investment with, any interested party; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is not a relative of any interested party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Required documents. In order to make this determination, the proposed trustee must submit the following documentation to the Director:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A letter describing its past and current contacts, including banking and client relationships, with the employee, spouse, or minor or dependent child; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Certificate of Independence, which must be executed in the form prescribed in appendix A to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determination. If the Director determines that the current relationships, if any, between the interested party and the independent trustee do not violate the independence requirements, these relationships will be disclosed in an annex to the trust instrument. No additional relationships with the independent trustee may be established unless they are approved by the Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Approval of the trustee. If the Director determines that the proposed trustee meets applicable requirements, the Office of Government Ethics will send the interested parties and their representatives a letter indicating its approval of a proposed trustee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Revocation. The Director may revoke the approval of a trustee or any other designated fiduciary pursuant to the rules of subpart E of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Adding fiduciaries. An independent trustee may employ or consult other entities, such as investment counsel, investment advisers, accountants, and tax preparers, to assist in any capacity to administer the trust or to manage and control the trust assets, if all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When any interested party or any representative of an interested party learns about such employment or consultation, the person must sign the trust instrument as a party, subject to the prior approval of the Director;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under all the facts and circumstances, the person is determined pursuant to the requirements for eligible entities under paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section to be independent of an interested party with respect to the trust arrangement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The person is instructed by the independent trustee or other designated fiduciary not to disclose publicly or to any interested party information which might specifically identify current trust assets or those assets which have been sold or disposed of from trust holdings, other than information relating to the sale or disposition of original trust assets in the case of the blind trust; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The person is instructed by the independent trustee or other designated fiduciary to have no direct communication with respect to the trust with any interested party or any representative of an interested party, and to make all indirect communications with respect to the trust only through the independent trustee, pursuant to Sec. 2634.408(a).</p>
