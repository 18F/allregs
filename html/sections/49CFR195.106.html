F = A design factor of 0.72, except that a design factor of 0.60 is used</p><p class="depth2">for pipe, including risers, on a platform located offshore or</p><p class="depth2">on a platform in inland navigable waters, and 0.54 is used for</p><p class="depth2">pipe that has been subjected to cold expansion to meet the</p><p class="depth2">specified minimum yield strength and is subsequently heated,</p><p class="depth2">other than by welding or stress relieving as a part of</p><p class="depth2">welding, to a temperature higher than 900 F (482 C) for any</p><p class="depth2">period of time or over 600 F (316 C) for more than 1 hour.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The yield strength to be used in determining the internal design  pressure under paragraph (a) of this section is the specified minimum  yield strength. If the specified minimum   yield strength is not known, the yield strength to be used in the design  formula is one of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The yield strength determined by performing all of the  tensile tests of ANSI/API Spec 5L (incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 195.3) on randomly selected specimens with the following number of  tests:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Pipe size                          No. of tests ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Less than 6\5/8\ in (168 mm) nominal        One test for each 200</p><p class="depth4">outside diameter.                           lengths. 6 \5/8\ in through 12\3/4\ in (168 mm       One test for each 100</p><p class="depth4">through 324 mm) nominal outside diameter.   lengths.

(165,474 kPa). If the average  yield-tensile ratio is 0.85 or less, the yield strength of the pipe is  taken as the lower of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Eighty percent of the average yield strength determined by the  tensile tests.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The lowest yield strength determined by the tensile tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the pipe is not tensile tested as provided in paragraph (b)  of this section, the yield strength shall be taken as 24,000 p.s.i.  (165,474 kPa).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the nominal wall thickness to be used in determining internal  design pressure under paragraph (a) of this section is not known, it is  determined by measuring the thickness of each piece of pipe at quarter  points on one end. However, if the pipe is of uniform grade, size, and  thickness, only 10 individual lengths or 5 percent of all lengths,  whichever is greater, need be measured. The thickness of the lengths  that are not measured must be verified by applying a gage set to the  minimum thickness found by the measurement. The nominal wall thickness  to be used is the next wall thickness found in commercial specifications  that is below the average of all the measurements taken. However, the  nominal wall thickness may not be more than 1.14 times the smallest  measurement taken on pipe that is less than 20 inches (508 mm) nominal  outside diameter, nor more than 1.11 times the smallest measurement  taken on pipe that is 20 inches (508 mm) or more in nominal outside  diameter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The minimum wall thickness of the pipe may not be less than 87.5  percent of the value used for nominal wall thickness in determining the  internal design pressure under paragraph (a) of this section. In  addition, the anticipated external loads and external pressures that are  concurrent with internal pressure must be considered in accordance with  Secs. 195.108 and 195.110 and, after determining the internal design  pressure, the nominal wall thickness must be increased as necessary to  compensate for these concurrent loads and pressures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The seam joint factor used in paragraph (a) of this section  is determined in accordance with the following standards incorporated by  reference (see Sec. 195.3):  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Seam joint</p><p class="depth3">Specification                   Pipe class            factor ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ASTM A53/A53M....................
