Carriers electing to  establish rates for Transitional Intrastate Access Service in this  manner shall notify the appropriate state regulatory authority of their  election in the filing required by Sec. 51.907(b)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A Rate-of-Return Carrier may elect to apply its interstate  access rate structure and interstate rates to Transitional Intrastate  Access Service. In addition to applicable interstate access rates, the  carrier may, between July 1, 2012 and July 1, 2013, assess a  transitional per-minute charge on Transitional Intrastate Access Service  end office switching minutes (previously billed as intrastate access).  The transitional per-minute charge shall be no greater than the Step 1  Access Revenue Reduction divided by Fiscal Year 2011 Transitional  Intrastate Access Service end office switching minutes.
