                                Sec. 24.204  Availability of comparable replacement dwelling
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(6))</em> has been made available to the  person. When possible, three or more comparable replacement dwellings  shall be made available. A comparable replacement dwelling will be  considered to have been made available to a person, if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The person is informed of its location;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The person has sufficient time to negotiate and enter into a  purchase agreement or lease for the property; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subject to reasonable safeguards, the person is assured of  receiving the relocation assistance and acquisition payment to which the  person is entitled in sufficient time to complete the purchase or lease  of the property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Circumstances permitting waiver. The Federal Agency funding the  project may grant a waiver of the policy in paragraph (a) of this  section in any case where it is demonstrated that a person must move  because of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A major disaster as defined in section 102 of the Robert T.  Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (42  U.S.C. 5122);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A presidentially declared national emergency; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Another emergency which requires immediate vacation of the real  property, such as when continued occupancy of the displacement dwelling  constitutes a substantial danger to the health or safety of the  occupants or the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Basic conditions of emergency move. Whenever a person to be  displaced is required to relocate from the displacement dwelling for a  temporary period because of an emergency as described in paragraph (b)  of this section, the Agency shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Take whatever steps are necessary to assure that the person is  temporarily relocated to a decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pay the actual reasonable out-of-pocket moving expenses and any  reasonable increase in rent and utility costs incurred in connection  with the temporary relocation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Make available to the displaced person as soon as feasible, at  least one comparable replacement dwelling. (For purposes of filing a  claim and meeting the eligibility requirements for a relocation payment,  the date of displacement is the date the person moves from the  temporarily occupied dwelling.)</p>
