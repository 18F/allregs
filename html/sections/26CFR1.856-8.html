                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Revocation of an election to be a real estate investment trust.  A corporation, trust, or association that has made an election under  section 856(c)(1) to be a real estate investment trust may revoke the  election for any taxable year after the first taxable year for which the  election is effective. The revocation must be made by filing a statement  with the district director for the internal revenue district in which  the taxpayer maintains its principal place of business or principal  office or agency. The statement must be filed on or before the 90th day  after the first day of the first taxable year for which the revocation  is to be effective. The statement must be signed by an official  authorized to sign the income tax return of the taxpayer and must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of  the taxpayer,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specify the taxable year for which the election was made, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Include a statement that the taxpayer, pursuant to section  856(g)(2), revokes its election under section 856(c)(1) to be a real  estate investment trust.  The revocation may be made only with respect to a taxable year beginning  after October 4, 1976, and is effective for the taxable year in which  made and for all succeeding taxable years. A revocation with respect to  a taxable year beginning after October 4, 1976, that is filed before  February 6, 1981, in the time and manner prescribed in Sec. 7.856(g)-1  of this chapter (as in effect when the revocation was filed) is  considered to meet the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Termination of election to be a real estate investment trust. An  election of a corporation, trust, or association under section 856(c)(1)  to be a real estate investment trust shall terminate if the corporation,  trust, or association is not a qualified real estate investment trust  for any taxable year (including the taxable year with respect to which  the election is made) beginning after October 4, 1976. (This election  terminates whether the failure to be a qualified real estate investment  trust is intentional or inadvertent.) The term ``taxable year'' includes  a taxable year of less than 12 months for which a return is made under  section 443. The termination of the election is effective for the first  taxable year beginning after October 4, 1976, for which the corporation,  trust, or association is not a qualified real estate investment trust  and for all succeeding taxable years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> for any taxable year prior to the fifth taxable year which  begins after the first taxable year for which the termination or  revocation is effective.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>. A  corporation, trust, or association meets the continuity of ownership  requirement only if at any time during the taxable year the persons who  own, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more in value of its  outstanding shares owned, at any time during the first taxable year for  which the termination or revocation was effective, 50 percent or more in  value of the outstanding shares of the corporation, trust, or  association whose election has been terminated or revoked. A  corporation, trust, or association meets the continuity of assets  requirement only if either (i) a substantial portion of its assets were  assets of the corporation, trust, or association whose election has been  revoked or terminated, or (ii) it acquires a substantial portion of the  assets of the corporation, trust, or association whose election has been  terminated or revoked.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> from making a  new election under section 856(c)(1) with respect to 1978.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(4))</em>; sec. 856(e)(5) (88  Stat. 2113; 26 U.S.C. 856(e)(5)); sec. 856(f)(2) (90 Stat. 1751; 26  U.S.C.
