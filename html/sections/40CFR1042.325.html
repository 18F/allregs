                                Sec.  1042.325  What happens if an engine family fails the production
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> We may suspend your certificate of conformity for an engine  family if it fails under Sec.  1042.315. The suspension may apply to all  facilities producing engines from an engine family, even if you find  noncompliant engines only at one facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> We will tell you in writing if we suspend your certificate in  whole or in part. We will not suspend a certificate until at least 15  days after the engine family fails. The suspension is effective when you  receive our notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Up to 15 days after we suspend the certificate for an engine  family, you may ask for a hearing (see Sec.  1042.920). If we agree  before a hearing occurs that we used erroneous information in deciding  to suspend the certificate, we will reinstate the certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Section 1042.335 specifies steps you must take to remedy the  cause of the engine family's production-line failure. All the engines  you have produced since the end of the last test period are presumed  noncompliant and should be addressed in your proposed remedy. We may  require you to apply the remedy to engines produced earlier if we  determine that the cause of the failure is likely to have affected the  earlier engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You may request to amend the application for certification to  raise the FEL of the entire engine family before or after we suspend  your certificate as described in Sec.  1042.225(f). We will approve your  request if the failure is not caused by a defect and it is clear that  you used good engineering judgment in establishing the original FEL.
