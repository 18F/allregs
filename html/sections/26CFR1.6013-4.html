For the purpose of filing a joint  return under section 6013, the status as husband and wife of two  individuals having taxable years beginning on the same day shall be  determined:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the taxable year of each individual is the same, as of the  close of such year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the close of the taxable year is different by reason of the  death of one spouse, as of the time of such death.   An individual legally separated from his spouse under a decree of  divorce or of separate maintenance shall not be considered as married.  However, the mere fact that spouses have not lived together during the  course of the taxable year shall not prohibit them from making a joint  return. A husband and   wife who are separated under an interlocutory decree of divorce retain  the relationship of husband and wife until the decree becomes final. The  fact that the taxpayer and his spouse are divorced or legally separated  at any time after the close of the taxable year shall not deprive them  of their right to file a joint return for such taxable year under  section 6013.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of Sec. 1.6017- 1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definition of executor or administrator. For purposes of section  6013 the term ``executor or administrator'' means the person who is  actually appointed to such office and not a person who is merely in  charge of the property of the decedent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> for married individuals filing separate returns.  Section 6212 applies to the assessment of any deficiency in tax on such  return.
