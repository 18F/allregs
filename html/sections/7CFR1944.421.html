                            <p class="depth0">Grantees wishing to continue with self-help efforts after the end of the current grant plus any extensions should file Form SF-424, in accordance with Sec. 1944.410(e). It is recommended that it be filed at least 6 months before the end of the current grant period. Funds from the existing grant may be used to meet the conditions of a new grant to serve the same or redefined geographic area. If the grantee is targeting a different geographic area, a new preapplication must be submitted in accordance with Sec. 1944.410 and the grantee may apply for a predevelopment grant in accordance with Sec. 1944.410(d). In addition to meeting the conditions of an applicant as defined in Sec. 1944.411 of this subpart, the grantee must also have received or will receive an acceptable rating on its current grant unless an exception is granted by the State Director. The State Director may grant an exception to the rating if it is determined that the reasons causing the previous unacceptable rating have been removed or will be removed with the approval of this grant.</p>
