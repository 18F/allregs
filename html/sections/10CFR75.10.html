(The Commission request must state whether the facility has been identified under Article 39(b) of the principal text of the Safeguards Agreement or Article 2(a) of the Initial protocol.) The applicant, licensee, or certificate holder shall submit the requested information to the Commission within the period specified in the Commission's request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Facility information includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The identification of the facility, stating its general character, purpose, nominal capacity (thermal power level, in the case of power reactors), and geographic location, and the name and address to be used for routine purposes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the general arrangement of the facility with reference, to the extent feasible, to the form, location and flow of nuclear material, and to the general layout of important items of equipment which use, produce, or process nuclear material;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of features of the facility relating to material accounting, containment, and surveillance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the existing and proposed procedures at the facility for nuclear material accounting and control, with special reference to material balance areas established by the licensee, measurement of flow, and procedures for physical inventory taking (As part of this description, the applicant, licensee, or certificate holder may identify a process step involving information that it deems to be commercially sensitive and for which it proposes that a special material balance area be established so as to restrict IAEA access to this information); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A map of the site and information on the size of the buildings and on the general nature of the activities conducted in each building.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each licensee or certificate holder shall thereafter submit to the Commission information with respect to any modification at the facility affecting the information referred to in paragraph (a) of this section.
