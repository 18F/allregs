this part, the term ``direct grant program'' includes any grant program of the Department other than a program whose authorizing statute or implementing regulations provide a formula for allocating program funds among eligible States. With respect to Public Law 81-874 (the Impact Aid Program), the term ``direct grant program'' includes only the entitlement increase for children with disabilities under section 3(d)(2)(C) of Public Law 81-874 (20 U.S.C. 238(d)(2)(C) and disaster assistance under section 7 of that law (20 U.S.C. 241-1).</p><p class="depth2">Note: See part 76 for the general regulations that apply to programs that allocate funds among eligible States. For a description of the two kinds of direct grant programs see Sec. 75.200. Paragraph (b) of that section describes discretionary grant programs. Paragraph (c) of that section describes formula grant programs. Also see Sec. Sec. 75.201, 75.209, and 75.210 for the selection criteria for discretionary grant programs that do not have implementing regulations or whose implementing regulations do not include selection criteria.
