Metalworking fluids that are not diluted with water prior to use and are generally used for metalworking processes that require lubrication rather than cooling.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> General purpose soluble, semi-synthetic, and synthetic oils.

The minimum biobased content shall be based on the amount of qualifying biobased carbon in the product as a percent of the weight (mass) of the total organic carbon in the finished product.

Determination of the preference compliance date for metalworking fluids--high performance soluble, semi-synthetic, and synthetic oils is deferred until USDA identifies two or more manufacturers of biobased products within this subcategory. At that time, USDA will publish a document in the Federal Register announcing that Federal agencies have one year from the date of publication to give procurement preference to biobased metalworking fluids--high performance soluble, semi-synthetic, and synthetic oils.
