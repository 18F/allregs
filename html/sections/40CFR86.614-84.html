                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. The procedures prescribed by this section apply whenever a manufacturer requests a hearing under Sec. 86.084-30(d)(6)(i), Sec. 86.084-30(d)(7), or Sec. 86.612(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The following definitions shall be applicable to this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Hearing Clerk shall mean the Hearing Clerk of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Manufacturer refers to a manufacturer contesting a suspension or revocation order directed at the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Party shall include the Agency and the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Presiding Officer shall mean an Administrative Law Judge appointed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3105 (see also 5 CFR part 930 as amended).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Environmental Appeals Board shall mean the Board within the Agency described in section 1.25 of this title. The Administrator delegates to the Environmental Appeals Board authority to issue final decisions in appeals filed under this subpart. Appeals directed by the Administrator, rather than to the Environmental Appeals Board, will not be considered. This delegation of authority to the Environmental Appeals Board does not preclude the Environmental Appeals Board from referring an appeal or a motion filed under this subpart to the Administrator for decision when the Environmental Appeals Board, in its discretion, deems it appropriate to do so. When an appeal or motion is referred to the Administrator, all parties shall be so notified and the rules in this part referring to the Environmental Appeals Board shall be interpreted as referring to the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Request for public hearing. (1) If the manufacturer disagrees with the Administrator's decision to suspend, revoke, or void a certificate or disputes the basis for an automatic suspension under Sec. 86.612(a), it may request a public hearing as described in this section. Requests for such a hearing shall be filed with the Administrator not later than 15 days after the Administrator's notification of his decision to suspend or revoke unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. Two copies of such request shall simultaneously be served upon the Director of the Manufacturers Operations Division and two copies filed with the Hearing Clerk. Failure of the manufacturer to request a hearing within the time provided shall constitute a waiver of his right to such a hearing. Subsequent to the expiration of the period for requesting a hearing as of right, the Administrator may, in his discretion and for good cause shown, grant the manufacturer a hearing to contest the suspension or revocation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the manufacturer disagrees with the Administrator's decision to suspend, revoke, or void a certificate or disputes the basis for an automatic suspension under Sec. 86.612(a), it may request a public hearing as described in this section.
