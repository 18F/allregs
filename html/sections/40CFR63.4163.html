                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To demonstrate continuous compliance with the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4090, the organic HAP emission rate for each compliance period determined according to the procedures in Sec. 63.4161 must be equal to or less than the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4090. Each month following the initial compliance period described in Sec. 63.4160 is a compliance period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the organic HAP emission rate for any compliance period exceeded the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4090, this is a deviation from the emission limitation for that compliance period and must be reported as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.4110(b)(6) and 63.4120(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each operating limit required by Sec. 63.4092 that applies to you as specified in Table 1 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an operating parameter is out of the allowed range specified in Table 1 to this subpart, this is a deviation from the operating limit that must be reported as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.4110(b)(6) and 63.4120(g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an operating parameter deviates from the operating limit specified in Table 1 to this subpart, then you must assume that the emission capture system and add-on control device were achieving zero efficiency during the time period of the deviation. For the purposes of completing the compliance calculations specified in Sec. 63.4161, you must treat the materials used during a deviation on a controlled coating operation as if they were used on an uncontrolled coating operation for the time period of the deviation. You must not include those materials in the calculation of organic HAP emissions reductions in Equation 1 of Sec. 63.4161.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must meet the requirements for bypass lines in Sec. 63.4168(b). If any bypass line is opened and emissions are diverted to the atmosphere when the coating operation is running, this is a deviation that must be reported as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.4110(b)(6) and 63.4120(g). For the purposes of completing the compliance calculations specified in Sec. 63.4161, you must treat the materials used during a deviation on a controlled coating operation as if they were used on an uncontrolled coating operation for the time period of the deviation. You must not include those materials in the calculation of organic HAP emissions reductions in Equation 1 of Sec. 63.4161.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the work practice standards in Sec. 63.4093. If you did not develop a work practice plan, or you did not implement the plan, or you did not keep the records required by Sec. 63.4130(k)(9), this is a deviation from the work practice standards that must be reported as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.4110(b)(6) and 63.4120(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> As part of each semiannual compliance report required in Sec. 63.4120, you must submit a statement that you were in compliance with the emission limitations during the reporting period because the organic HAP emission rate for each compliance period was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4090, and you achieved the operating limits required by Sec. 63.4092 and the work practice standards required by Sec. 63.4093 during each compliance period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> [Reseved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Consistent with Sec. Sec. 63.6(e) and 63.7(e)(1), deviations that occur during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction of the emission capture system, add-on control device, or coating operation that may affect emission capture or control device efficiency are not violations if you demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that you were operating in accordance with Sec. 63.6(e). The Administrator will determine whether deviations that occur during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are violations according to the provisions in Sec. 63.6(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> You must maintain records as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.4130 and 63.4131.
