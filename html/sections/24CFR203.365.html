                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Items to be furnished the Secretary. Within 45 days after the  deed is filed for record, in the case of a conveyance claim; or, in the  case of a claim arising from a pre-foreclosure sale, within 30 days  after the closing of the pre-foreclosure sale, unless extended by the  Commissioner, the mortgagee must forward to the Secretary:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A copy of the deed to the Secretary that has been filed for  record and the title evidence continued so as to include recordation of  the deed; or   evidence, as prescribed by the Secretary, of the closing of the pre- foreclosure sale.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fiscal data pertaining to the mortgage transaction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any additional information or data that the Secretary may  require.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Items to be retained by mortgagee. The mortgagee must retain all  cash amounts, held or deposited for the account of the mortgagor or to  which it is entitled under the mortgage transaction, that have not been  applied in reduction of the principal mortgage indebtedness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Claim file to be maintained by mortgagee. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary may  verify the accuracy of information regarding the insurance claim either  before payment of the claim or after payment by periodic reviews of the  mortgagee's records. Mortgagees must reimburse the Secretary for any  claim and interest overpaid because of incorrect, unsupported, or  inappropriate information provided by the mortgagee, or because of  failure to provide correct information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mortgagees must maintain a claim file containing documentation  supporting all information submitted for claim payment for at least  three years after a claim has been paid. All claim files for claims paid  during a period relating to an unresolved or ongoing claim review must  be maintained until final resolution of such review. Information to be  maintained in the claim file includes receipts covering all  disbursements as required by the fiscal data form, ledger cards covering  the mortgage transaction, and any additional information or data  relevant to the mortgage transaction or insurance claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Secretary may review any claim file at any time during the  three-year period after the claim has been paid. Denial of access to any  files will be grounds for withdrawal of the mortgagee's approved lender  status, debarment by the Secretary, or immediate suspension of all claim  payments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within 24 hours of a request by the Secretary, a mortgagee must  make available for review, or forward to the Secretary, hard copies of  identified claim files.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Statistical sampling. HUD may use statistical sampling in  selecting claims to be reviewed and in determining the amount due the  Secretary because of overpayment.
