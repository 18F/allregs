                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You, as a manufacturer, importer, or maker of a firearm, must  legibly identify the firearm as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By engraving, casting, stamping (impressing), or otherwise  conspicuously placing or causing to be engraved, cast, stamped  (impressed) or placed on the frame or receiver thereof an individual  serial number. The serial number must be placed in a manner not  susceptible of being readily obliterated, altered, or removed, and must  not duplicate any serial number placed by you on any other firearm. For  firearms manufactured, imported, or made on and after January 30, 2002,  the engraving, casting, or stamping (impressing) of the serial number  must be to a minimum depth of .003 inch and in a print size no smaller  than \1/16\ inch; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By engraving, casting, stamping (impressing), or otherwise  conspicuously placing or causing to be engraved, cast, stamped  (impressed), or placed on the frame, receiver, or barrel thereof certain  additional information. This information must be placed in a manner not  susceptible of being readily obliterated, altered or removed. For  firearms manufactured, imported, or made on and after January 30, 2002,  the engraving, casting, or stamping (impressing) of this information  must be to a minimum depth of .003 inch. The additional information  includes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The model, if such designation has been made;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The caliber or gauge;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Your name (or recognized abbreviation) and also, when  applicable, the name of the foreign manufacturer or maker;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of a domestically made firearm, the city and State  (or recognized abbreviation thereof) where you as the manufacturer  maintain your place of business, or where you, as the maker, made the  firearm; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> In the case of an imported firearm, the name of the country in  which it was manufactured and the city and State (or recognized  abbreviation thereof) where you as the importer maintain your place of  business. For additional requirements relating to imported firearms, see  Customs regulations at 19 CFR part 134.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The depth of all markings required by this section will be  measured from the flat surface of the metal and not the peaks or ridges.  The height of serial numbers required by paragraph (a)(1) of this  section will be measured as the distance between the latitudinal ends of  the character impression bottoms (bases).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Director may authorize other means of identification upon  receipt of a letter application from you, submitted in duplicate,  showing that such other identification is reasonable and will not hinder  the effective administration of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the case of a destructive device, the Director may authorize  other means of identifying that weapon upon receipt of a letter  application from you, submitted in duplicate, showing that engraving,  casting, or stamping (impressing) such a weapon would be dangerous or  impracticable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A firearm frame or receiver that is not a component part of a  complete weapon at the time it is sold, shipped, or otherwise disposed  of by you must be identified as required by this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any part defined as a machine gun, muffler, or silencer for  the purposes of this part that is not a component part of a complete  firearm at the time it is sold, shipped, or otherwise disposed of by you  must be identified as required by this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Director may authorize other means of identification of  parts defined as machine guns other than frames or receivers and parts  defined as mufflers or silencers upon receipt of a letter application  from you, submitted in duplicate, showing that such other identification  is reasonable and will not hinder the effective administration of this  part.  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  1140-0050)  [T.D. ATF-461, 66 FR 40601, Aug. 3, 2001, as amended by ATF-11F, 73 FR  57242, Oct. 2, 2008]</p>
