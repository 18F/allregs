                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In reviewing requests for extension of payment of principal and interest, consideration shall be given to the effect of such extensions on the security of the Government's loans, and on the ability of the Borrower to achieve program objectives. It is the policy of RUS to extend the time for payment of principal and interest on the basis of findings that such extension does not impair the security and feasibility of the Government's loans and:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is essential to the effectiveness of the Borrower's operations in achieving RUS program objectives which include providing reliable, affordable electricity to RE Act beneficiaries;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is necessary to help a Borrower place its operations on a more stable financial basis and thereby provide assurance of repayment of loans within the time when payments of such loans are due under the terms of the note or notes as extended; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is otherwise in the best interest of the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Extensions will be given in the minimum amount to achieve the purpose of the extension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The maximum interest rate a RUS Borrower can charge on deferments for programs relating to consumer loans, e.g., energy resource conservation (ERC) program, contribution-in-aid of construction (CIAC), etc., will not be more than 300 basis points above the average interest rate on the note(s) being deferred. For example, if the RUS Borrower's average interest rate on the note(s) being deferred is 5 percent, the RUS Borrower can charge a maximum interest rate of 8 percent.
