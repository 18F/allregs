                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. If, without any surrender of his stock or securities as defined in section 1083(f), a shareholder in a corporation which is a registered

holding company or a majority-owned subsidiary company receives stock or securities in such corporation or owned by such corporation, no gain to the shareholder will be recognized with respect to the stock or securities received by such shareholder which do not constitute nonexempt property, if the distribution to such shareholder is made by the distributing corporation in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission directed to such corporation. A distribution is not within the provisions of section 1081(c)(1) if it is within the provisions of section 1081(d), relating to transfers within a system group. A distribution is also not within the provisions of section 1081(c)(1) if it involves a surrender by the shareholder of stock or securities or a transfer by the shareholder of property in exchange for the stock or securities received by the shareholder. For further limitations, see section 1081(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special rule.

S. C. 79c) that the distributing corporation is exempt from any provision or provisions of such act, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Before January 1, 1958, the distributing corporation disposes of all the common stock in the second corporation which it owns.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The distributing corporation shall, as soon as practicable, notify the district director in whose district the corporation's income tax return and supporting data was filed (see paragraph (g) of Sec. 1.1081-11), as to whether or not the requirement of subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph has been met. If such requirement has not been met, the periods of limitation (sections 6501 and 6502) with respect to any deficiency, including interest and additions to the tax, resulting solely from the receipt of such rights to acquire stock, shall include one year immediately following the date of such notification; and assessment and collection shall be made notwithstanding any provisions of law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment and collection.</p>
