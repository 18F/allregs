Such order will state the specific basis for the  Commission's action. Notice of the issuance of such order will be given  to the jurisdictional agency, to participants in the proceeding before  the jurisdictional agency, and to participants in the proceeding before   the Commission under paragraph (d) of this section and under Sec.  270.503.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the event that the Commission fails to issue a final order  within 120 days after issuance of the preliminary finding, the  determination of the jurisdictional agency shall become final.</p>
