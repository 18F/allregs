                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When a final decision is required. After all submissions of  proof have been received, the Judgment Officer shall make the final  decision. Upon its issuance, the final decision shall forthwith be filed  with the Proceedings Clerk, and immediately served on the parties. The  Proceedings Clerk shall also serve a notice, to accompany the final  decision, of the effect of a failure by a party ordered to pay a  reparation award to file the documents required by Sec. 12.407(c) of  these rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Content of final decision. The final decision shall contain:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A briefly stated conclusion, not accompanied by findings of  fact, as to whether the respondent violated any provision of the Act,  Commission's regulations or orders, resulting in damages to the  complainant; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If one or more counterclaims have been permitted in the  proceeding, a brief conclusion, not accompanied by findings of fact, as  to whether the complainant is liable to the respondent for such  counterclaims; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A determination of the amount of damages, if any, sustained by  complainant or respondent in connection with reparation claims or  counterclaims, and an order against a party found liable for damages  directing that party to pay an award. An award in   favor of the complainant shall not exceed the amount of damages in the  complaint (including any amendment thereto), and an award in favor of a  respondent shall not exceed the amount of damages claimed in a  counterclaim (including any amendment thereto).  A conclusion made pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not  be deemed a finding of the Commission for the purposes of Section 8a of  the Commodity Exchange Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No assessment of prejudgment interest or costs; assessment of  post-judgment interest. A party found liable for damages in a voluntary  decisional proceeding shall not be assessed prejudgment interest,  attorney's fees, or costs (other than the filing fee and costs assessed  as a sanction for abuse of discovery). Post-judgment interest shall be  awarded at a rate determined in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1961(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> of  the Commodity Exchange Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effective date of final decision. A final decision and order  shall become effective thirty (30) days after service, unless the  Commission pursuant to Sec. 12.403 takes review of the decision on its  own motion on or before the thirtieth day. Any reparation award ordered  in a final decision pursuant to this rule shall be satisfied in full  within forty-five (45) days after service thereof, unless the Commission  pursuant to Sec. 12.403(b) stays the duty of satisfaction. Any party  who fails timely to satisfy such an award is subject to the automatic  suspension provisions of Sec. 12.407(c).
