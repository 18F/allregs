                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d)  of this section, an MA organization may not--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Disenroll an individual from any MA plan it offers; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Orally or in writing, or by any action or inaction, request or  encourage an individual to disenroll.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Basis for disenrollment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Optional disenrollment. An MA  organization may disenroll an individual from an MA plan it offers in  any of the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any monthly basic and supplementary beneficiary premiums are not  paid on a timely basis, subject to the grace period for late payment  established under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The individual has engaged in disruptive behavior specified at  paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The individual provides fraudulent information on his or her  election form or permits abuse of his or her enrollment card as  specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Required disenrollment. An MA organization must disenroll an  individual from an MA plan it offers in any of the following  circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The individual no longer resides in the MA plan's service area  as specified under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, is no longer  eligible under Sec. 422.50(a)(3)(ii), and optional continued enrollment  has not been offered or elected under Sec. 422.54.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The individual loses entitlement to Part A or Part B benefits  as described in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Death of the individual as described in paragraph (d)(6) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Individuals enrolled in a specialized MA plan for special needs  individuals that exclusively serves and enrolls special needs  individuals who no longer meet the special needs status of that plan (or  deemed continued eligibility, if applicable).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The individual is not lawfully present in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Plan termination or reduction of area where plan is available-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. An MA organization that has its contract for an MA  plan terminated, that terminates an MA plan, or that discontinues  offering the plan in any portion of the area where the plan had  previously been available, must disenroll affected enrollees in  accordance with the procedures for   disenrollment set forth at paragraph (d)(7) of this section, unless the  exception in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception. When an MA organization discontinues offering an MA  plan in a portion of its service area, the MA organization may elect to  offer enrollees residing in all or portions of the affected area the  option to continue enrollment in an MA plan offered by the organization,  provided that there is no other MA plan offered in the affected area at  the time of the organization's election. The organization may require an  enrollee who chooses to continue enrollment to agree to receive the full  range of basic benefits (excluding emergency and urgently needed care)  exclusively through facilities designated by the organization within the  plan service area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Notice requirement. If the disenrollment is for any of the  reasons specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2)(i), or (b)(3) of this  section (that is, other than death or loss of entitlement to Part A or  Part B) the MA organization must give the individual a written notice of  the disenrollment with an explanation of why the MA organization is  planning to disenroll the individual. Notices for reasons specified in  paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(2)(i) must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Be provided to the individual before submission of the  disenrollment to CMS; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Include an explanation of the individual's right to a hearing  under the MA organization's grievance procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(iv)</em> of this section, an MA organization may disenroll an  individual from the MA plan for failure to pay basic and supplementary  premiums under the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The MA organization can demonstrate to CMS that it made  reasonable efforts to collect the unpaid premium amount, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Alerting the individual that the premiums are delinquent;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Providing the individual with a grace period, that is, an  opportunity to pay past due premiums in full. The length of the grace  period must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Be at least 2 months; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Begin on the first day of the month for which the premium is  unpaid or the first day of the month following the date on which premium  payment is requested, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Advising the individual that failure to pay the premiums by the  end of the grace period will result in termination of MA coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The MA organization provides the enrollee with notice of  disenrollment that meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (c) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the enrollee fails to pay the premium for optional  supplemental benefits but pays the basic premium and any mandatory  supplemental premium, the MA organization has the option to discontinue  the optional supplemental benefits and retain the individual as an MA  enrollee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An MA organization may not disenroll an individual who had  monthly premiums withheld per Sec. 422.262(f)(1) and (g) of this part,  or who is in premium withhold status, as defined by CMS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Extension of grace period for good cause and reinstatement. When  an individual is disenrolled for failure to pay the plan premium, CMS  (or a third party to which CMS has assigned this responsibility, such as  an MA organization) may reinstate enrollment in the MA plan, without  interruption of coverage, if the individual--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Shows good cause for failure to pay within the initial grace  period; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Pays all overdue premiums within 3 calendar months after the  disenrollment date; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Establishes by a credible statement that failure to pay premiums  within the initial grace period was due to circumstances for which the  individual had no control, or which the individual could not reasonably  have been expected to foresee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> No extension of grace period. A beneficiary's enrollment in the  MA plan may not be reinstated if the only basis for such reinstatement  is a change in the individual's circumstances subsequent to the  involuntary disenrollment for non-payment of premiums.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Disruptive behavior--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definition of disruptive behavior. An  MA plan enrollee is disruptive if his or her behavior substantially  impairs the plan's ability to arrange for or provide services to the  individual or other plan members. An individual cannot be considered  disruptive if such behavior is related to the use of medical services or  compliance (or noncompliance) with medical advice or treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Basis of disenrollment for disruptive behavior. An organization  may disenroll an individual whose behavior is disruptive as defined in  422.74(d)(2)(i) only after it meets the requirements described in this  section and CMS has reviewed and approved the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effort to resolve the problem. The MA organization must make a  serious effort to resolve the problems presented by the individual,  including providing reasonable accommodations, as determined by CMS, for  individuals with mental or cognitive conditions, including mental  illness and developmental disabilities. In addition, the MA organization  must inform the individual of the right to use the organization's  grievance procedures. The beneficiary has a right to submit any  information or explanation that he or she may wish to the MA  organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Documentation. The MA organization must document the enrollee's  behavior, its own efforts to resolve any problems, as described in  paragraph (iii), and any extenuating circumstances. The MA organization  may request from CMS the ability to decline future enrollment by the  individual. The MA organization must submit this information and any  documentation received by the beneficiary to CMS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> CMS review of the proposed disenrollment. CMS will review the  information submitted by the MA organization and any information  submitted by the beneficiary (which the MA organization must forward to  CMS) to determine if the MA organization has fulfilled the requirements  to request disenrollment for disruptive behavior. If the organization  has fulfilled the necessary requirements, CMS will review the  information and make a decision to approve or deny the request for  disenrollment, including conditions on future enrollment, within 20  working days. During the review, CMS will ensure that staff with  appropriate clinical or medical expertise review the case before making  the final decision. The MA organization will be required to provide a  reasonable accommodation, as determined by CMS, for the individual in  such exceptional circumstances that CMS deems necessary. CMS will notify  the MA organization within 5 working days after making its decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Effective date of disenrollment. If CMS permits an MA  organization to disenroll an individual for disruptive behavior, the  termination is effective the first day of the calendar month after the  month in which the MA organization gives the individual notice of the  disenrollment that meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (c) of  this section, unless otherwise determined by CMS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Individual commits fraud or permits abuse of enrollment card-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Basis for disenrollment. An MA organization may disenroll the  individual from an MA plan if the individual--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Knowingly provides, on the election form, fraudulent information  that materially affects the individual's eligibility to enroll in the MA  plan; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Intentionally permits others to use his or her enrollment card  to obtain services under the MA plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notice of disenrollment. The MA organization must give the  individual a written notice of the disenrollment that meets the  requirements set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Report to CMS. The MA organization must report to CMS any  disenrollment based on fraud or abuse by the individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Individual no longer resides in the MA plan's service area--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Basis for disenrollment. Unless continuation of enrollment is elected  under Sec. 422.54, the MA organization must disenroll an individual if  the MA organization establishes, on the basis of a written statement  from the individual or other evidence acceptable to CMS, that the  individual has permanently moved--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Out of the MA plan's service area or is incarcerated as  specified in paragraph (d)(4)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> From the residence in which the individual resided at the time  of enrollment in the MA plan to an area outside the MA plan's service  area, for those individuals who enrolled in the MA plan under the  eligibility requirements at Sec. 422.50(a)(3)(ii) or (a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule. If the individual has not moved from the MA  plan's service area (or residence, as described in paragraph  (d)(4)(i)(B) of this section), but has left the service area (or  residence) for more than 6 months, the MA organization must disenroll  the individual from the plan, unless the exception in paragraph  (d)(4)(iii) of this section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exception. If the MA plan offers a visitor/traveler benefit  when the individual is out of the service area but within the United  States (as defined in Sec. 400.200 of this chapter) for a period of  consecutive days longer than 6 months but less than 12 months, the MA  organization may elect to offer to the individual the option of  remaining enrolled in the MA plan if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The individual is disenrolled on the first day of the 13th month  after the individual left the service area (or residence, if paragraph  (d)(4)(i)(B) of this section applies);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The individual understands and accepts any restrictions imposed  by the MA plan on obtaining these services while absent from the MA  plan's service area for the extended period, consistent with paragraph  (d)(4)(i)(C) of the section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The MA organization makes this visitor/traveler option available  to all Medicare enrollees who are absent for an extended period from the  MA plan's service area. MA organizations may limit this visitor/traveler  option to enrollees who travel to certain areas, as defined by the MA  organization, and who receive services from qualified providers who  directly provide, arrange for, or pay for health care; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The MA organization furnishes all Medicare Parts A and B  services and all mandatory and optional supplemental benefits at the  same cost sharing levels as apply within the plan's service area; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The MA organization furnishes the services in paragraph  (d)(4)(iii)(D) of this section consistent with Medicare access and  availability requirements at Sec. 422.112 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Notice of disenrollment. The MA organization must give the  individual a written notice of the disenrollment that meets the  requirements set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Incarceration. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The MA organization must disenroll an  individual if the MA organization establishes, on the basis of evidence  acceptable to CMS, that the individual is incarcerated and does not  reside in the service area of the MA plan as specified at Sec. 422.2 or  when notified of the incarceration by CMS as specified in paragraph  (d)(4)(v)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Notification by CMS of incarceration. When CMS notifies the MA  organization of the disenrollment due to the individual being  incarcerated and not residing in the service area of the MA plan as per  Sec. 422.2, disenrollment is effective the first of the month following  the start of incarceration, unless otherwise specified by CMS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Loss of entitlement to Part A or Part B benefits. If an  individual is no longer entitled to Part A or Part B benefits, CMS  notifies the MA organization that the disenrollment is effective the  first day of the calendar month following the last month of entitlement  to Part A or Part B benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Death of the individual. If the individual dies, disenrollment  is effective the first day of the calendar month following the month of  death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Plan termination or area reduction. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When an MA organization  has its contract for an MA plan terminated, terminates an MA plan, or  discontinues offering the plan in any portion of the area where the plan  had previously been available, the MA organization must give each  affected MA plan enrollee a written notice of the effective date of the  plan termination or area reduction and a description of alternatives for  obtaining benefits under the MA program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The notice must be sent before the effective date of the plan  termination or area reduction, and in the timeframes specified in  Sec. 422.506(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Enrollee is not lawfully present in the United States.  Disenrollment is effective the first day of the month following notice  by CMS that the individual is ineligible in accordance with  Sec. 417.422(h) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Consequences of disenrollment--(1) Disenrollment for non-payment  of premiums, disruptive behavior, fraud or abuse, loss of Part A or Part  B. An individual who is disenrolled under paragraph (b)(1)(i),  (b)(1)(ii), (b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(iii)</em>, or paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is  deemed to have elected original Medicare.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> or (b)(3) of this section has a special election  period in which to make a new election as provided in Sec. 422.62(b)(1)  and (b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An individual who fails to make an election during the special  election period is deemed to have elected original Medicare.
