                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The jobs to which the equal pay standard is  applicable are jobs that require equal effort to perform. Where  substantial differences exist in the amount or degree of effort required  to be expended in the performance of jobs, the equal pay standard cannot  apply even though the jobs may be equal in all other respects. Effort is  concerned with the measurement of the physical or mental exertion needed  for the performance of a job. Job factors which cause mental fatigue and  stress, as well as those which alleviate fatigue, are to be considered  in determining the effort required by the job. ``Effort'' encompasses  the total requirements of a job. Where jobs are otherwise equal under  the EPA, and there is no substantial difference in the amount or degree  of effort which must be expended in performing the jobs under  comparison, the jobs may require equal effort in their performance even  though the effort may be exerted in different ways on the two jobs.  Differences only in the kind of effort required to be expended in such a  situation will not justify wage differentials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Comparing effort requirements of jobs. To illustrate the  principle of equal effort exerted in different ways, suppose that a male  checker employed by a supermarket is required to spend part of his time  carrying out heavy packages or replacing stock involving the lifting of  heavy items whereas a female checker is required to devote an equal  degree of effort during a similar portion of her time to performing  fill-in work requiring greater dexterity--such as rearranging displays  of spices or other small items. The difference in kind of effort  required of the employees does not appear to make their efforts unequal  in any respect which would justify a wage differential, where such  differences in kind of effort expended to perform the job are not  ordinarily considered a factor in setting wage levels. Further, the  occasional or sporadic performance of an activity which may require  extra physical or mental exertion is not alone sufficient to justify a  finding of unequal effort. Suppose, however, that men and women are  working side by side on a line assembling parts. Suppose further that  one of the men who performs the operations at the end of the line must  also lift the assembly, as he completes his part of it, and places it on  a waiting pallet. In such a situation, a wage rate differential might be  justified for the person (but only for the person) who is required to  expend the extra effort in the performance of his job, provided that the  extra effort so expended is substantial and is performed over a  considerable portion of the work cycle. In general, a wage rate  differential based on differences in the degree or amount of effort  required for performance of jobs must be applied uniformly to men and  women. For example, if all women and some men performing a particular  type of job never perform heavy lifting, but some men do, payment of a  higher wage rate to all of the men would constitute a prohibited wage  rate differential if the equal pay provisions otherwise apply.</p>
