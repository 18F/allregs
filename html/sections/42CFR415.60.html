                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. For purposes of this subpart, physician compensation costs means monetary payments, fringe benefits, deferred compensation, and any other items of value (excluding office space or billing and collection services) that a provider or other organization furnishes a physician in return for the physician services. Other organizations are entities related to the provider within the meaning of Sec. 413.17 of this chapter or entities that furnish services for the provider under arrangements within the meaning of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each provider that incurs physician compensation costs must allocate those costs, in proportion to the percentage of total time that is spent in furnishing each category of services, among--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Physician services to the provider (as described in Sec. 415.55);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Physician services to patients (as described in Sec. 415.102); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Activities of the physician, such as funded research, that are not paid under either Part A or Part B of Medicare.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Allowable physician compensation costs. Only costs allocated to payable physician services to the provider (as described in Sec. 415.55) are allowable costs to the provider under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Allocation of all compensation to services to the provider. Generally, the total physician compensation received by a physician is allocated among all services furnished by the physician, unless--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provider certifies that the compensation is attributable solely to the physician services furnished to the provider; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The physician bills all patients for the physician services he or she furnishes to them and personally receives the payment from or on behalf of the patients. If returned directly or indirectly to the provider or an organization related to the provider within the meaning of Sec. 413.17 of this chapter, these payments are not compensation for physician services furnished to the provider.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Assumed allocation of all compensation to beneficiary services. If the provider and physician agree to accept the assumed allocation of all the physician services to direct services to beneficiaries as described under Sec. 415.102(a), CMS does not require a written allocation agreement between the physician and the provider.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Determination and payment of allowable physician compensation costs. (1) Except as provided under paragraph (e) of this section, the intermediary pays the provider for these costs only if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided under paragraph (e) of this section, the intermediary pays the provider for these costs only if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The provider submits to the intermediary a written allocation agreement between the provider and the physician that specifies the respective amounts of time the physician spends in furnishing physician services to the provider, physician services to patients, and services that are not payable under either Part A or Part B of Medicare; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The compensation is reasonable in terms of the time devoted to these services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the absence of a written allocation agreement, the intermediary assumes, for purposes of determining reasonable costs of the provider, that 100 percent of the physician compensation cost is allocated to services to beneficiaries as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Recordkeeping requirements. Except for services furnished in accordance with the assumed allocation under paragraph (e) of this section, each provider that claims payment for services of physicians under this subpart must meet all of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maintain the time records or other information it used to allocate physician compensation in a form that permits the information to be validated by the intermediary or the carrier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Report the information on which the physician compensation allocation is based to the intermediary or the carrier on an annual basis and promptly notify the intermediary or carrier of any revisions to the compensation allocation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Retain each physician compensation allocation, and the information on which it is based, for at least 4 years after the end of each cost reporting period to which the allocation applies.</p>
