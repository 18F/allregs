                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Drip pads must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be constructed of non-earthen materials, excluding wood and non- structurally supported asphalt;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be sloped to free-drain treated wood drippage, rain and other  waters, or solutions of drippage and water or   other wastes to the associated collection system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Have a curb or berm around the perimeter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Have a hydraulic conductivity of less than or equal to 1x10- \7\ centimeters per second, e.g., existing concrete drip pads must be  sealed, coated, or covered with a surface material with a hydraulic  conductivity of less than or equal to 1x10-\7\ centimeters per second  such that the entire surface where drippage occurs or may run across is  capable of containing such drippage and mixtures of drippage and  precipitation, materials, or other wastes while being routed to an  associated collection system. This surface material must be maintained  free of cracks and gaps that could adversely affect its hydraulic  conductivity, and the material must be chemically compatible with the  preservatives that contact the drip pad. The requirements of this  provision apply only to existing drip pads and those drip pads for which  the owner or operator elects to comply with Sec. 264.572(b) instead of  Sec. 264.572(a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator must obtain and keep on file at the  facility a written assessment of the drip pad, reviewed and certified by  a qualified Professional Engineer that attests to the results of the  evaluation. The assessment must be reviewed, updated and recertified  annually. The evaluation must document the extent to which the drip pad  meets the design and operating standards of this section, except for  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Be of sufficient structural strength and thickness to prevent  failure due to physical contact, climatic conditions, the stress of  daily operations, e.g., variable and moving loads such as vehicle  traffic, movement of wood, etc.  [Note: EPA will generally consider applicable standards established by  professional organizations generally recognized by the industry such as  the American Concrete Institute (ACI) or the American Society of Testing  and Materials (ASTM) in judging the structural integrity requirement of  this paragraph.]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, the drip pad must have:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A synthetic liner installed below the drip pad that is designed,  constructed, and installed to prevent leakage from the drip pad into the  adjacent subsurface soil or groundwater or surface water at any time  during the active life (including the closure period) of the drip pad.  The liner must be constructed of materials that will prevent waste from  being absorbed into the liner and to prevent releases into the adjacent  subsurface soil or groundwater or surface water during the active life  of the facility. The liner must be:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Constructed of materials that have appropriate chemical  properties and sufficient strength and thickness to prevent failure due  to pressure gradients (including static head and external hydrogeologic  forces), physical contact with the waste or drip pad leakage to which  they are exposed, climatic conditions, the stress of installation, and  the stress of daily operation (including stresses from vehicular traffic  on the drip pad);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Placed upon a foundation or base capable of providing support  to the liner and resistance to pressure gradients above and below the  liner to prevent failure of the liner due to settlement, compression or  uplift; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Installed to cover all surrounding earth that could come in  contact with the waste or leakage; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A leakage detection system immediately above the liner that is  designed, constructed, maintained and operated to detect leakage from  the drip pad. The leakage detection system must be:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Constructed of materials that are:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Chemically resistant to the waste managed in the drip pad and  the leakage that might be generated; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent collapse under  the pressures exerted by overlaying materials and by any equipment used  at the drip pad;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Designed and operated to function without clogging through the  scheduled closure of the drip pad; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Designed so that it will detect the failure of the drip pad or  the presence of a release of hazardous waste or accumulated liquid at  the earliest practicable time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A leakage collection system immediately above the liner that is  designed, constructed, maintained and operated to collect leakage from  the drip pad such that it can be removed from below the drip pad. The  date, time, and quantity of any leakage collected in this system and  removed must be documented in the operating log.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Drip pads must be maintained such that they remain free of  cracks, gaps, corrosion, or other deterioration that could cause  hazardous waste to be released from the drip pad.  [Note:See Sec. 264.573(m) for remedial action required if deterioration  or leakage is detected.]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The drip pad and associated collection system must be designed  and operated to convey, drain, and collect liquid resulting from  drippage or precipitation in order to prevent run-off.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Unless protected by a structure, as described in Sec. 264.570(b)  of this subpart, the owner or operator must design, construct, operate  and maintain a run-on control system capable of preventing flow onto the  drip pad during peak discharge from at least a 24-hour, 25-year storm,  unless the system has sufficient excess capacity to contain any run-off  that might enter the system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Unless protected by a structure or cover as described in  Sec. 264.570(b) of this subpart, the owner or operator must design,  construct, operate and maintain a run-off management system to collect  and control at least the water volume resulting from a 24-hour, 25-year  storm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The drip pad must be evaluated to determine that it meets the  requirements of paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section and the owner  or operator must obtain a statement from a qualified Professional  Engineer certifying that the drip pad design meets the requirements of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Drippage and accumulated precipitation must be removed from the  associated collection system as necessary to prevent overflow onto the  drip pad.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The drip pad surface must be cleaned thoroughly in a manner and  frequency such that accumulated residues of hazardous waste or other  materials are removed, with residues being properly managed as hazardous  waste, so as to allow weekly inspections of the entire drip pad surface  without interference or hindrance from accumulated residues of hazardous  waste or other materials on the drip pad. The owner or operator must  document the date and time of each cleaning and the cleaning procedure  used in the facility's operating log. The owner/operator must determine  if the residues are hazardous as per 40 CFR 262.11 and, if so, must  manage them under parts 261-268, 270, and section 3010 of RCRA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Drip pads must be operated and maintained in a manner to  minimize tracking of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents off  the drip pad as a result of activities by personnel or equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> After being removed from the treatment vessel, treated wood from  pressure and non-pressure processes must be held on the drip pad until  drippage has ceased. The owner or operator must maintain records  sufficient to document that all treated wood is held on the pad  following treatment in accordance with this requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Collection and holding units associated with run-on and run-off  control systems must be emptied or otherwise managed as soon as possible  after storms to maintain design capacity of the system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Throughout the active life of the drip pad and as specified in  the permit, if the owner or operator detects a condition that may have  caused or has caused a release of hazardous waste, the condition must be  repaired within a reasonably prompt period of time following discovery,  in accordance with the following procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon detection of a condition that may have caused or has caused  a release of hazardous waste (e.g., upon detection of leakage in the  leak detection system), the owner or operator must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Enter a record of the discovery in the facility operating log;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Immediately remove the portion of the drip pad affected by the  condition from service;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Determine what steps must be taken to repair the drip pad and  clean up any leakage from below the drip   pad, and establish a schedule for accomplishing the repairs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Within 24 hours after discovery of the condition, notify the  Regional Administrator of the condition and, within 10 working days,  provide written notice to the Regional Administrator with a description  of the steps that will be taken to repair the drip pad and clean up any  leakage, and the schedule for accomplishing this work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Regional Administrator will review the information  submitted, make a determination regarding whether the pad must be  removed from service completely or partially until repairs and cleanup  are complete and notify the owner or operator of the determination and  the underlying rationale in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon completing all repairs and cleanup, the owner or operator  must notify the Regional Administrator in writing and provide a  certification signed by an independent, qualified registered  professional engineer, that the repairs and cleanup have been completed  according to the written plan submitted in accordance with paragraph  (m)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Should a permit be necessary, the Regional Administrator will  specify in the permit all design and operating practices that are  necessary to ensure that the requirements of this section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> The owner or operator must maintain, as part of the facility  operating log, documentation of past operating and waste handling  practices. This must include identification of preservative formulations  used in the past, a description of drippage management practices, and a  description of treated wood storage and handling practices.
