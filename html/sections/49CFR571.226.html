Test procedures.</p><p class="depth0">S5.1 Demonstrate compliance with S4.2 of this standard in accordance with the test procedures specified in this standard, under the conditions of S6, using the equipment described in S7. In the impact test described by these procedures, target locations are

identified (S5.2) and the zero displacement plane location is determined (S5.3). The glazing is pre-broken, fully retracted or removed prior to the impact test (S5.4). The countermeasure is deployed, if applicable, and an ejection impactor (see S7.1) strikes the countermeasure at the impact target locations, at the specified speeds and times (S5.5). The lateral displacement of the ejection impactor beyond the zero displacement plane is measured.</p><p class="depth0">S5.2 Determination of impact target locations.</p><p class="depth0">S5.2.1 Boundary of target location.</p><p class="depth0">S5.2.1.1 Initial determination of offset line. Determine the location of an offset-line within the side daylight opening by projecting each point of the side daylight opening laterally onto a vehicle vertical longitudinal plane. Move each point by 252 mm towards the center of the side daylight opening projection and perpendicular to a line tangent to the projection at that point, while maintaining the point on a vehicle vertical longitudinal plane.</p><p class="depth0">S5.2.1.2 Rearmost limit of offset line.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Seats fixed in a forward facing direction. Except as provided in S5.2.1.2(b), if an offset line extends rearward of a transverse vertical vehicle plane located behind the seating reference point at the distance specified in 5.2.1.2(a)(1) or (2), the transverse vertical vehicle plane defines the rearward edge of the offset line for the purposes of determining target locations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a vehicle with fewer than 3 rows--1,400 mm behind the rearmost SgRP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a vehicle with 3 or more rows--600 mm behind the 3rd row SgRP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Seats not fixed in a forward facing direction. When the last row seat adjacent to the opening, in the case of a vehicle with fewer than 3 rows, or the 3rd row seat adjacent to the opening, in the case of a vehicle with 3 or more rows, is not fixed in the forward facing direction, the offset line may extend farther rearward than specified in S5.2.1.2(a) under the following conditions. With the seat in any non-forward facing orientation, the seat back set at an inclination position closest to the manufacturer's design seat back angle, and all other seat adjustments at any possible position of adjustment, determine the location of a vertical transverse vehicle plane located behind the portion of the seat rearmost in the vehicle, at the distance specified in 5.2.1.2(b)(1) and (2). The boundary of target locations extends to this vertical plane if it is farther rearward than the plane determined in S5.2.1.2(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a vehicle with fewer than 3 rows--1,400 mm behind the portion of the seat rearmost in the vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a vehicle with 3 or more rows--600 mm behind the portion of the seat rearmost in the vehicle, for a seat in the 3rd row.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Vehicles with partitions or bulkheads. If a vehicle has a fixed transverse partition or bulkhead behind which there are no designated seating positions, a vertical transverse vehicle plane 25 mm forward of the most forward portion of the partition or bulkhead defines the rearward edge of the offset line for the purposes of determining target locations when said plane is forward of the limiting plane defined in S5.2.1.2(a) or (b).</p><p class="depth0">S5.2.2 Preliminary target locations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To identify the impact target locations, the following procedures are performed with the x and z axes of the target, shown in Figure 1 (provided for illustration purposes), aligned within 1 degree of the vehicle longitudinal and vertical axes, respectively, and the target y axis pointing in the outboard direction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Place targets at any location inside the offset-line where the target is tangent to within 2 mm of the offset-line at just two or three points (see Figure 2) (figure provided for illustration purposes).</p><p class="depth0">S5.2.3 Determination of primary target locations. Divide the side daylight opening into four quadrants by passing a vertical line and a horizontal line, in a vehicle vertical longitudinal plane, through the geometric center of the side daylight opening.</p><p class="depth0">S5.2.3.1 Front windows. For any side daylight opening forward of the vehicle B-pillar, the primary quadrants are the forward-lower and rearward-upper.</p><p class="depth0">S5.2.3.2 Rear windows. For any side daylight opening rearward of the B-pillar, the primary quadrants are the forward-upper and rearward-lower.</p><p class="depth0">S5.2.3.3 If a primary quadrant contains only one target center, that target is the primary target for that quadrant (see Figure 3) (figure provided for illustration purposes). If there is more than one target center in a primary quadrant, the primary target for that quadrant is the lowest target in a lower quadrant and the highest target in an upper quadrant. If there is a primary quadrant that does not contain a target center, the target center closest to the primary quadrant outline is the primary target.</p><p class="depth0">S5.2.4 Determination of secondary target locations.</p><p class="depth0">S5.2.4.1 Front windows. Measure the horizontal distance between the centers of the primary targets. For a side daylight opening forward of the B-pillar, place one secondary target center rearward of the forward primary target by one-third of the horizontal distance between the primary target centers and tangent with upper portion of the offset-line. Place another secondary target center rearward of the forward primary target by two-thirds of the horizontal distance between the primary target centers and tangent with the lower portion of the offset-line (see figure 4) (figure provided for illustration purposes).</p><p class="depth0">S5.2.4.2 Rear windows. For side daylight openings rearward of the B-pillar, place one secondary target center rearward of the forward primary target by one-third of the horizontal distance between the primary target centers and tangent with lower portion of the offset-line. Place another secondary target center rearward of the forward primary target by two-thirds of the horizontal distance between the primary target centers and tangent with the upper portion of the offset-line (see Figure 4) (figure provided for illustration purposes).</p><p class="depth0">S5.2.5 Target adjustment.</p><p class="depth0">S5.2.5.1 Target elimination and reconstitution.</p><p class="depth0">S5.2.5.1.1 Target elimination. Determine the horizontal and vertical distance between the centers of the targets. If the minimum distance between the z axes of the targets is less than 135 mm and the minimum distance between the x axes of the targets is less than 170 mm, eliminate the targets in the order of priority given in steps 1 through 4 of Table 1 (see Figure 5, 5a and 5b) (figures provided for illustration purposes). In each case, both the z axes of the targets must be closer than 135 mm and x axes of the targets must be closer than 170 mm. If the minimum distance between the z axes of the targets is not less than 135 mm or the minimum distance between the x axes of the targets is not less than 170 mm, do not eliminate the target. Continue checking all the targets listed in steps 1 through 4 of Table 1.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--Priority List of Target Distance To Be Checked Against Limits------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Eliminate this target if</p><p class="depth0">distances between z axes</p><p class="depth0">Measure distance from z     of targets and x axes of</p><p class="depth0">Step        axis to z axis and x axis    targets are less than 135</p><p class="depth0">to x axis for these targets        mm and 170 mm,</p><p class="depth0">respectively------------------------------------------------------------------------1..............

If after following the procedure given in S5.2.5.1.1, there are only two targets remaining, determine the absolute distance between the centers of these targets. If this distance is greater than or equal to 360 mm, place a target such that its center bisects a line connecting the centers of the remaining targets.</p><p class="depth0">S5.2.5.2 Target reorientation--90 degree rotation. If after following the procedure given in S5.2.5.1 there are less than four targets in a side daylight opening, repeat the procedure in 5.2 through 5.2.5.1.2, with a modification to S5.2 as follows. Reorient the target by

rotating it 90 degrees about the y axis of the target such that the target positive z axis is aligned within 1 degree of the vehicle longitudinal axis, pointing in the direction of the vehicle positive x axis (see Figures 5a and 5b) (figures provided for illustration purposes). If after performing the procedure in this section, the remaining targets exceed the number of targets determined with the original orientation of the target, the reoriented targets represent the final target locations for the side daylight opening.</p><p class="depth0">S5.2.5.3 Target reorientation incremental rotation. If after following the procedure given in S5.2.5.2 there are no targets in a side daylight opening, starting with the target in the position defined in S5.2.2(a), reorient the target by rotating it in 5 degree increments about the y axis of the target by rotating the target positive z axis toward the vehicle positive x axis. At each increment of rotation, attempt to fit the target within the offset line of the side daylight opening. At the first increment of rotation where the target will fit, place the target center as close as possible to the geometric center of the side daylight opening. If more than one position exists that is closest to the geometric center of the side daylight opening, select the lowest.</p><p class="depth0">S5.3 Determination of zero displacement plane. The glazing covering the target location of the side daylight opening being tested is intact and in place in the case of fixed glazing and intact and fully closed in the case of movable glazing. With the ejection impactor targeting point aligned within 2 mm of the center of any target location specified in S5.2, and with the ejection impactor on the inside of the vehicle, slowly move the impactor towards the window until contact is made with the interior of the glazing with no more than 20 N of pressure being applied to the window. The location of the most outboard surface of the headform establishes the zero displacement plane for this target location.</p><p class="depth0">S5.4 Window position and condition.Subject to S5.5(b), prior to impact testing, the glazing covering the target location must be removed from the side daylight opening, fully retracted, or pre-broken according to the procedure in S5.4.1, at the vehicle manufacturer's option.</p><p class="depth0">S5.4.1 Window glazing pre-breaking procedure.</p><p class="depth0">S5.4.1.1 Breakage pattern. Locate the geometric center of the side daylight opening, established in S5.2.3 of this standard. Mark the outside surface of the window glazing in a horizontal and vertical grid of points separated by 752 mm with one point coincident within 2 mm of the geometric center of the side daylight opening (see Figure 6) (figure provided for illustration purposes). Mark the inside surface of the window glazing in a horizontal and vertical grid of points separated by 752 mm with the entire grid horizontally offset by 37.5 2 mm from the grid of points on the outside of the glazing.</p><p class="depth0">S5.4.1.2 Breakage method.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Start with the inside surface of the window and forward-most, lowest mark made as specified in S5.4.1.1 of this standard. Use a center punch in this procedure. The punch tip has a 5 2 mm diameter prior to coming to a point. The spring is adjusted to require 150 25 N of force to activate the punch. Only once at each mark location, apply pressure to activate the spring in the center punch in a direction which is perpendicular to the tangent of the window surface at the point of contact, within 10 degrees. Apply the pressure only once at each mark location, even if the glazing does not break or no hole results.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use a 100 10 mm x 100 10 mm piece of plywood with a minimum thickness of 18 mm as a reaction surface on the opposite side of the glazing to prevent to the extent possible the window surface from deforming by more than 10 mm when pressure is being applied to the hole-punch.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Continue the procedure with the center punch by moving rearward in the grid until the end of a row is reached. When the end of a row is reached, move to the forward-most mark on the next higher row and continue the procedure. Continue in this pattern until the procedure is conducted at each marked location on the inside surface of the glazing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Repeat the process on the outside surface of the window.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If punching a hole causes the glazing to disintegrate, halt the breakage procedure and proceed with the headform impact test.</p><p class="depth0">S5.5 Impact speeds and time delays. The ejection impactor speeds specified below must be achieved after propulsion has ceased.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Vehicles with or without an ejection mitigation countermeasure that deploys in a rollover. For a vehicle with an ejection mitigation countermeasure that deploys in a rollover, using the ejection propulsion mechanism, propel the ejection impactor such that it first strikes the countermeasure, while aligned with any target location specified in S5.2 of this standard, 1.5 0.1 seconds after activation of the ejection mitigation countermeasure that deploys in the event of a rollover, and at a speed of 20 0.5 km/h. For a vehicle without an ejection mitigation countermeasure that deploys in a rollover, propel the ejection impactor at any time such that it first strikes the countermeasure, while aligned with any target location specified in S5.2 of this standard, at a speed of 20 0.5 km/h.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Vehicles with an ejection mitigation countermeasure that deploys in a rollover. For a vehicle with an ejection mitigation countermeasure that deploys in a rollover, remove or fully retract any movable glazing from the side daylight opening. Using the ejection propulsion mechanism, propel the ejection impactor such that it first strikes the countermeasure, while aligned with any target location specified in S5.2 of this standard, 6.0 0.1 seconds after activation of an ejection mitigation countermeasure that deploys in the event of a rollover, and at a speed of 16 0.5 km/h.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An ejection mitigation countermeasure that deploys in the event of a rollover is described as such in the vehicle's owner manual or in other written information provided by the vehicle manufacturer to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">S5.6 Ejection impactor orientation.</p><p class="depth0">S5.6.1 If the targets for the side daylight opening being impacted were determined by the procedure specified in S5.2.2 through S5.2.5.1 only, the ejection impactor orientation is as follows.

Measure the force to an accuracy of 5 N. The measurement excludes the force measured over the first 25 mm of travel and is recorded at a minimum frequency of 100 Hz. During the test a 100 kg 0.5 kg mass is attached to the impactor with its center of gravity passing through the axis of motion of the impactor and no more than 5 mm rear of the posterior surface of the headform.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Take the five force level averages made at each impactor orientation in S7.3(a) and average them. Take the

maximum of the force average values and divide by 9.81 times the combined mass of the ejection impactor and mass added in S7.3(b). The resulting value must not exceed 0.25.</p><p class="depth0">S7.4 Targeting accuracy. Determine that the ejection mitigation test device can deliver the ejection impactor targeting point through a zone defined by a cylinder with a 20 mm diameter and 100 mm length, when the ejection impactor is moving at the speed specified in S5.5. The projection of the long axis of the cylinder is normal to the target and passes through the target center. The long axis of the cylinder is bisected by a vehicle vertical longitudinal plane passing through the theoretical point of impact with the countermeasure.</p><p class="depth0">S8 Phase-in Schedule for Vehicle Certification.</p><p class="depth0">S8.1 Vehicles manufactured on or after September 1, 2013 and before September 1, 2016.
