                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Group 1 performance requirements. Except for the additional requirement for halogenated vent streams as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the owner or operator of a Group 1 process vent shall comply with the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Flare. Reduce emissions of regulated material using a flare meeting the applicable requirements of Sec. 65.142(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 98 percent or 20 parts per million standard. Reduce emissions of regulated material or TOC by at least 98 weight-percent or to a concentration of less than 20 parts per million by volume, whichever is less stringent. For combustion devices, the emission reduction or concentration shall be calculated on a dry basis, and corrected to 3 percent oxygen. The owner or operator shall meet the requirements in Sec. 65.142(b) and paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and/or (a)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Compliance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be achieved by using any combination of recovery and/or control device to meet the 20 parts per million by volume concentration standard; or by using any combination of recovery and/or control device to meet the 98 weight percent reduction standard, if the recovery device meets the conditions of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An owner or operator may use a recovery device alone or in combination with one or more control devices to reduce emissions of total regulated material by 98 weight-percent if all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For process vents referenced to this part by 40 CFR part 63, subpart G, the recovery device (and any control device that operates in combination with the recovery device to reduce emissions of total regulated material by 98 weight-percent) was installed before December 31, 1992.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The recovery device that will be used to reduce emissions of total regulated material by 98 weight-percent is the last recovery device before emission to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The recovery device alone or in combination with one or more control devices is capable of reducing emissions of total regulated material by 98 weight-percent but is not capable of reliably reducing emissions of total regulated material to a concentration of 20 parts per million by volume.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> If the owner or operator disposed of the recovered material, the recovery device would be considered a control device and comply with the requirements of this subpart and Sec. 65.142(b) for control devices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> TRE index value. Achieve and maintain a TRE index value greater than 1.0 at the outlet of the final recovery device, or prior to release from the process vent to the atmosphere if no recovery device is present. If the TRE index value is greater than 1.0, the process vent shall meet the provisions for a Group 2A or 2B process vent specified in either paragraph (c), (d), (e), or (f) of this section, whichever is applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Halogenated Group 1 performance requirement. Halogenated Group 1 process vents that are combusted shall be controlled according to paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section. The owner or operator shall either designate the Group 1 process vent as a halogenated Group 1 process vent or shall determine whether the process vent is halogenated using the procedures specified in Sec. 65.64(g). If determined, the halogen concentration in the vent stream shall be recorded and reported in the Initial Compliance Status Report as specified in Sec. 65.160(d). If the owner or operator designates the process vent as a halogenated Group 1 process vent, then this shall also be recorded and reported in the Initial Compliance Status Report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Halogen reduction device following combustion. If a combustion device is used to comply with paragraph (a)(2) of this section for a halogenated process vent, then the process vent exiting the combustion device shall be ducted to a halogen reduction device including, but not limited to, a scrubber before it is discharged to the atmosphere, and the halogen reduction device shall meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable. The halogenated process vent shall not be combusted using a flare.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the halogen reduction device shall reduce overall emissions of hydrogen halides and halogens by 99 percent or shall reduce the outlet mass of total hydrogen halides and halogens to less than 0.45 kilogram per hour (0.99 pound per hour), whichever is less stringent. The owner or operator shall meet the requirements in Sec. 65.142(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a scrubber or other halogen reduction device was installed prior to December 31, 1992, the device shall reduce overall emissions of hydrogen halides and halogens by 95 percent or shall reduce the outlet mass of total hydrogen halides and halogens to less than 0.45 kilogram per hour (0.99 pound per hour), whichever is less stringent. The owner or operator shall meet the requirements in Sec. 65.142(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Halogen reduction device prior to combustion. A halogen reduction device, such as a scrubber, or other technique may be used to reduce the process vent halogen atom mass emission rate to less than 0.45 kilogram per hour (0.99 pound per hour) prior to any combustion control device and thus make the process vent nonhalogenated; the process vent must comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section. The mass emission rate of halogen atoms contained in organic compounds prior to the combustor shall be determined according to the procedures in Sec. 65.64(g). The owner or operator shall maintain the record specified in Sec. 65.160(d) and submit the report specified in Sec. 65.165(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Performance requirements for Group 2A process vents with recovery devices. For Group 2A process vents, where the owner or operator is using a recovery device to maintain a TRE index value greater than 1.0, the owner or operator shall maintain a TRE index value greater than 1.0 and comply with the requirements for recovery devices in Sec. 65.142(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Performance requirements for Group 2A process vents without recovery devices. For Group 2A process vents where the

owner or operator is not using a recovery device to maintain a TRE index value greater than 1.0, determine the appropriate parameters to be monitored and submit the information as specified in paragraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this section. Such information shall be submitted for approval to the Administrator as part of a title V permit application or by separate notice. The owner or operator shall monitor as specified in Sec. 65.65(a), maintain the record specified in Sec. 65.66(e), and submit reports as specified in Sec. 65.67(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Parameter monitoring. A description of the parameter(s) to be monitored to ensure the owner or operator of a process vent achieves and maintains the TRE above 1.0. and an explanation of the criteria used to select the parameter(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Demonstration methods and procedures. A description of the methods and procedures that will be used to demonstrate that the parameter indicates proper operation of the process, the schedule for this demonstration, and a statement that the owner or operator will establish a range for the monitored parameter as part of the Initial Compliance Status Report required in Sec. 65.5(d), unless this information has already been included in the operating permit application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting frequency. The frequency and content of monitoring, recording, and reporting if monitoring and recordkeeping are not continuous, or if reports of daily average values when the monitored parameter value is outside the range established in the operating permit or Initial Compliance Status Report will not be included in periodic reports required under Sec. 65.5(e). The rationale for the proposed monitoring, recording, and reporting system shall be included.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Group 2B performance requirements. For Group 2B process vents, the owner or operator shall maintain a TRE index greater than 4.0, a flow rate less than 0.011 scmm, or a concentration less than the applicable criteria in table 1 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Group 2A or 2B process change requirements. Whenever process changes are made that could reasonably be expected to change a Group 2A or 2B process vent to a Group 1 vent, the owner or operator shall recalculate the TRE index value, flow, or TOC or organic hazardous air pollutant (HAP) concentration according to paragraph (f)(1), (2), or (3) of this section as specified for each process vent as necessary to determine whether the process vent is Group 1, Group 2A, or Group 2B and shall maintain the applicable records specified in Sec. 65.66(d) and submit the applicable reports specified in Sec. 65.67(b). The owner or operator shall perform the group status determination as soon as practical after the process change and within 180 days after the process change. Examples of process changes include, but are not limited to, changes in production capacity, production rate, feedstock type, or catalyst type, or whenever there is replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment. For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, process changes do not include process upsets; unintentional, temporary process changes; and changes that are within the range on which the original TRE index value calculation was based.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Flow rate. The flow rate shall be determined as specified in the sampling site and flow rate determination procedures in Sec. 65.64(b) and (d) or by using best engineering assessment of the effects of the change. Engineering assessments shall meet the specifications in Sec. 65.64(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Concentration. The TOC or organic HAP concentration shall be determined as specified in Sec. 65.64(b) and (c) or by using best engineering assessment of the effects of the change. Engineering assessments shall meet the specifications in Sec. 65.64(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> TRE index value. The TRE index value shall be recalculated based on measurements of process vent flow rate, TOC, and/or organic HAP concentrations, and heating values as specified in Sec. 65.64(b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) as applicable, or based on best engineering assessment of the effects of the change. Engineering assessments shall meet the specifications in Sec. 65.64(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Group status change to Group 1. Where the process change causes the group status to change to Group 1, the owner or operator shall comply with

the Group 1 process vent provisions in paragraph (a) of this section and, if they apply, the halogenated Group 1 process vent provisions in paragraph (b) of this section upon initial startup after the change and thereafter unless the owner or operator demonstrates to the Administrator that achieving compliance will take longer than making the process change. If this demonstration is made to the Administrator's satisfaction, the owner or operator shall comply as expeditiously as practical, but in no event later than 3 years after the emission point becomes Group 1, and shall comply with the following procedures to establish a compliance date:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator for approval a compliance schedule, along with a justification for the schedule.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The compliance schedule shall be submitted with the operating permit application or amendment or by other appropriate means.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Administrator shall approve the compliance schedule or request changes within 120 calendar days of receipt of the compliance schedule and justification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Group status change to Group 2A. Whenever a process change causes the process vent group status to change to Group 2A, the owner or operator shall comply with the provisions of paragraph (c) or (d) of this section upon completion of the group status determination of the process vent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Group status change to Group 2B. Whenever a process change causes the process vent group status to change to Group 2B, the owner or operator shall comply with the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section as soon as practical after the process change.</p>
