Achieve and maintain a TRE index value greater  than 1.0 at the outlet of the final recovery device, or prior to release  from the process vent to the atmosphere if no recovery device is  present. If the TRE index value is greater than 1.0, the process vent  shall meet the provisions for a Group 2A or 2B process vent specified in  either paragraph (c), (d), (e), or (f) of this section, whichever is  applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> or (2) of this section. The owner or operator shall  either designate the Group 1 process vent as a halogenated Group 1  process vent or shall determine whether the process vent is halogenated  using the procedures specified in Sec. 65.64(g). If determined, the  halogen concentration in the vent stream shall be recorded and reported  in the Initial Compliance Status Report as specified in Sec. 65.160(d).  If the owner or operator designates the process vent as a halogenated  Group 1 process vent, then this shall also be recorded and reported in  the Initial Compliance Status Report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> or (ii) of this section, as applicable. The halogenated  process vent shall not be combusted using a flare.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the  halogen reduction device shall reduce overall emissions of hydrogen  halides and halogens by 99 percent or shall reduce the outlet mass of  total hydrogen halides and halogens to less than 0.45 kilogram per hour  (0.99 pound per hour), whichever is less stringent. The owner or  operator shall meet the requirements in Sec. 65.142(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a scrubber or other halogen reduction device was installed  prior to December 31, 1992, the device shall reduce overall emissions of  hydrogen halides and halogens by 95 percent or shall reduce the outlet  mass of total hydrogen halides and halogens to less than 0.45 kilogram  per hour (0.99 pound per hour), whichever is less stringent. The owner  or operator shall meet the requirements in Sec. 65.142(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section. The mass emission rate of halogen atoms contained  in organic compounds prior to the combustor shall be determined  according to the procedures in Sec. 65.64(g). The owner or operator  shall maintain the record specified in Sec. 65.160(d) and submit the  report specified in Sec. 65.165(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Performance requirements for Group 2A process vents with  recovery devices. For Group 2A process vents, where the owner or  operator is using a recovery device to maintain a TRE index value  greater than 1.0, the owner or operator shall maintain a TRE index value  greater than 1.0 and comply with the requirements for recovery devices  in Sec. 65.142(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em>,  (2), and (3) of this section. Such information shall be submitted for  approval to the Administrator as part of a title V permit application or  by separate notice. The owner or operator shall monitor as specified in  Sec. 65.65(a), maintain the record specified in Sec. 65.66(e), and  submit reports as specified in Sec. 65.67(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Parameter monitoring. A description of the parameter(s) to be  monitored to ensure the owner or operator of a process vent achieves and  maintains the TRE above 1.0. and an explanation of the criteria used to  select the parameter(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Demonstration methods and procedures. A description of the  methods and procedures that will be used to demonstrate that the  parameter indicates proper operation of the process, the schedule for  this demonstration, and a statement that the owner or operator will  establish a range for the monitored parameter as part of the Initial  Compliance Status Report required in Sec. 65.5(d), unless this  information has already been included in the operating permit  application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting frequency. The  frequency and content of monitoring, recording, and reporting if  monitoring and recordkeeping are not continuous, or if reports of daily  average values when the monitored parameter value is outside the range  established in the operating permit or Initial Compliance Status Report  will not be included in periodic reports required under Sec. 65.5(e).  The rationale for the proposed monitoring, recording, and reporting  system shall be included.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Group 2B performance requirements. For Group 2B process vents,  the owner or operator shall maintain a TRE index greater than 4.0, a  flow rate less than 0.011 scmm, or a concentration less than the  applicable criteria in table 1 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> of this section,  process changes do not include process upsets; unintentional, temporary  process changes; and changes that are within the range on which the  original TRE index value calculation was based.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Flow rate. The flow rate shall be determined as specified in the  sampling site and flow rate determination procedures in Sec. 65.64(b)  and (d) or by using best engineering assessment of the effects of the  change. Engineering assessments shall meet the specifications in Sec.  65.64(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Concentration. The TOC or organic HAP concentration shall be  determined as specified in Sec. 65.64(b) and (c) or by using best  engineering assessment of the effects of the change. Engineering  assessments shall meet the specifications in Sec. 65.64(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> TRE index value. The TRE index value shall be recalculated based  on measurements of process vent flow rate, TOC, and/or organic HAP  concentrations, and heating values as specified in Sec. 65.64(b), (c),  (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) as applicable, or based on best engineering  assessment of the effects of the change. Engineering assessments shall  meet the specifications in Sec. 65.64(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Group status change to Group 1. Where the process change causes  the group status to change to Group 1, the owner or operator shall  comply with   the Group 1 process vent provisions in paragraph (a) of this section  and, if they apply, the halogenated Group 1 process vent provisions in  paragraph (b) of this section upon initial startup after the change and  thereafter unless the owner or operator demonstrates to the  Administrator that achieving compliance will take longer than making the  process change. If this demonstration is made to the Administrator's  satisfaction, the owner or operator shall comply as expeditiously as  practical, but in no event later than 3 years after the emission point  becomes Group 1, and shall comply with the following procedures to  establish a compliance date:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator for  approval a compliance schedule, along with a justification for the  schedule.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The compliance schedule shall be submitted with the operating  permit application or amendment or by other appropriate means.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Administrator shall approve the compliance schedule or  request changes within 120 calendar days of receipt of the compliance  schedule and justification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Group status change to Group 2A. Whenever a process change  causes the process vent group status to change to Group 2A, the owner or  operator shall comply with the provisions of paragraph (c) or (d) of  this section upon completion of the group status determination of the  process vent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Group status change to Group 2B. Whenever a process change  causes the process vent group status to change to Group 2B, the owner or  operator shall comply with the provisions of paragraph (e) of this  section as soon as practical after the process change.</p>
