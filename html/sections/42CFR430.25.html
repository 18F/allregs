                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope of section. This section describes the purpose and effect of waivers, identifies the requirements that may be waived and the other regulations that apply to waivers, and sets forth the procedures that CMS follows in reviewing and taking action on waiver requests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose of waivers. Waivers are intended to provide the flexibility needed to enable States to try new or different approaches to the efficient and cost-effective delivery of health care services, or to adapt their programs to the special needs of particular areas or groups of beneficiaries. Waivers allow exceptions to State plan requirements and permit a State to implement innovative programs or activities on a time-limited basis, and subject to specific safeguards for the protection of beneficiaries and the program. Detailed rules for waivers are set forth in subpart B of part 431, subpart A of part 440, and subpart G of part 441 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of waivers.

furnished in a hospital, SNF, ICF, or ICF/IID, and is reimbursable under the State plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A waiver under section 1916 (a)(3) or (b)(3) of the Act allows a State to impose a deduction, cost-sharing or similar charge of up to twice the ``nominal charge'' established under the plan for outpatient services, if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The outpatient services are received in a hospital emergency room but are not emergency services; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The State has shown that Medicaid beneficiaries have actually available and accessible to them alternative services of nonemergency outpatient services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Requirements that are waived. In order to permit the activities described in paragraph (c) of this section, one or more of the title XIX requirements must be waived, in whole or in part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Under section 1915(b) of the Act, and subject to certain limitations, any of the State plan requirements of section 1902 of the Act may be waived to achieve one of the purposes specified in that section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under section 1915(c) of the Act, the following requirements may be waived:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Statewideness--section 1902(a)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Comparability of services--section 1902(a)(10)(B).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Income and resource rules--section 1902(a)(10)(C)(i)(III).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Under section 1916 of the Act, paragraphs (a)(3) and (b)(3) require that any cost-sharing imposed on beneficiaries be nominal in amount, and provide an exception for nonemergency services furnished in a hospital emergency room if the conditions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Submittal of waiver request. The State Governor, the head of the Medicaid agency, or an authorized designee may submit the waiver request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Review of waiver requests.
