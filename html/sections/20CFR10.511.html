                            <p class="depth0">If OWCP issues a formal loss of wage-earning capacity determination,  including a finding of no loss of wage-earning capacity, that  determination and rate of compensation, if applicable, remains in place  until that determination is modified by OWCP. Modification of such a  determination is only warranted where the party seeking the modification  establishes either that there is a material change in the nature and  extent of the injury-related condition, the employee has been retrained  or otherwise vocationally rehabilitated, or the original determination  was erroneous. However, OWCP is not precluded from adjudicating a  limited period of disability following the   issuance of a loss of wage-earning capacity decision, such as where an  employee has a demonstrated need for surgery.</p><p class="depth0">Return to Work--Employee's Responsibilities</p>
