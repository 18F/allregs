                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The costs of central office equipment are carried in the  following accounts:  Central Office Switching.................  Account 2210. Non-digital Switching....................  Account 2211. Digital Electronic Switching.............  Account 2212. Operator Systems.........................  Account 2220. Central Office--Transmission.............  Account 2230. Radio Systems............................  Account 2231. Circuit Equipment........................  Account 2232.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Records of the cost of central office equipment are usually  maintained for each study area separately by accounts. However, each  account frequently includes equipment having more than one use. Also,  equipment in one account frequently is associated closely with equipment  in the same building in another account. Therefore, the separations  procedures for central office equipment have been designed to deal with  categories of plant rather than with equipment in an account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the separation of the cost of central office equipment among  the operations, the first step is the assignment of the equipment in  each study area to categories. The basic method of making this  assignment is the identification of the equipment assignable to each  category, and the determination of the cost of the identified equipment  by analysis of accounting, engineering and other records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cost of common equipment not assigned to a specific  category, e.g., common power equipment, including emergency power  equipment, aisle lighting and framework, including distributing frames,  is distributed among the categories in proportion to the cost of  equipment, (excluding power equipment not dependent upon common power  equipment) directly assigned to categories.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The cost of power equipment used by one category is assigned  directly to that category, e.g., 130 volt power supply provided for  circuit equipment. The cost of emergency power equipment protecting only  power equipment used by one category is also assigned directly to that  category.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where appropriate, a weighting factor is applied to the cost of  circuit equipment in distributing the power plant costs not directly  assigned, in order to reflect the generally greater power use per dollar  of cost of this equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The second step is the apportionment of the cost of the  equipment in each category among the operations through the application  of appropriate use factors or by direct assignment.
