                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The provisions of this section apply to fiberboard IBCs intended  to contain solids that are loaded or discharged by gravity. Fiberboard  IBCs are designated: 11G.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions for fiberboard IBC types:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fiberboard IBCs consist of a fiberboard body with or without  separate top and bottom caps, appropriate service and structural  equipment, and if necessary an inner liner (but no inner packaging).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Liner means a separate tube or bag, including the closures of  its openings, inserted in the body but not forming an integral part of  it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Construction requirements for fiberboard IBCs are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Top lifting devices are prohibited in fiberboard IBCs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fiberboard IBCs must be constructed of strong, solid or double- faced corrugated fiberboard (single or multiwall) that is appropriate to  the capacity of the outer packaging and its intended use. Water  resistance of the outer surface must be such that the increase in mass,  as determined in a test carried out over a period of 30 minutes by the  Cobb method of determining water absorption, is not greater than 155  grams per square meter (0.0316 pounds per square foot)--see ISO 535 (E)  (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). Fiberboard must have proper  bending qualities. Fiberboard must be cut, creased without cutting  through any thickness of fiberboard, and slotted so as to permit  assembly without cracking, surface breaks, or undue bending. The fluting  of corrugated fiberboard must be firmly glued to the facings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The walls, including top and bottom, must have a minimum  puncture resistance of 15 Joules (11 foot-pounds of energy) measured  according to ISO 3036 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Manufacturers' joints in the bodies of IBCs must be made with  an appropriate overlap and be taped, glued, stitched with metal staples  or fastened by other means at least equally effective. Where joints are  made by gluing or taping, a water-resistant adhesive must be used. Metal  staples must pass   completely through all pieces to be fastened and be formed or protected  so that any inner liner cannot be abraded or punctured by them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The strength of the material used and the construction of the  liner must be appropriate to the capacity of the IBC and the intended  use. Joints and closures must be sift-proof and capable of withstanding  pressures and impacts liable to occur under normal conditions of  handling and transport.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any integral pallet base forming part of an IBC, or any  detachable pallet, must be suitable for the mechanical handling of an  IBC filled to its maximum permissible gross mass.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The pallet or integral base must be designed to avoid  protrusions that may cause damage to the IBC in handling.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The outer packaging must be secured to any detachable pallet to  ensure stability in handling and transport. Where a detachable pallet is  used, its top surface must be free from sharp protrusions that might  damage the IBC.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Strengthening devices, such as timber supports to increase  stacking performance, may be used but must be external to the inner  liner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The load-bearing surfaces of IBCs intended for stacking must be  designed to distribute loads in a stable manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fiberboard IBCs may not have a volumetric capacity greater than  3,000 L (793 gallons) or less than 450 L (119 gallons).
