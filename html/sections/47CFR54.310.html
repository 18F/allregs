Connect America Phase II  support may be made available for census blocks or other areas  identified as eligible by public notice, including locations identified  by the forward-looking cost model as extremely high-cost. The number of  supported locations will be identified for each area eligible for  support will be identified by public notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Term of support. Connect America Phase II model-based support  shall be provided to price cap carriers that elect to make a state-level  commitment for six years. Connect America Phase II support awarded  through a competitive bidding process shall be provided for ten years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Deployment obligation. Recipients of Connect America Phase II  model-based support must complete deployment to 40 percent of supported  locations by December 31, 2017, to 60 percent of supported locations by  December 31, 2018, to 80 percent of supported locations by December 31,  2019, and to 100 percent of supported locations by December 31, 2020.  Compliance shall be determined based on the total number of supported  locations in a state.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of meeting the obligation to deploy to the  requisite number of supported locations in a state,   recipients may serve unserved locations in census blocks with costs  above the extremely high-cost threshold instead of locations in eligible  census blocks, provided that they meet the public interest obligations  set forth in Sec. 54.309 for those locations and provided that the  total number of locations covered is greater than or equal to the number  of supported locations in the state.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Recipients of Connect America Phase II model-based support may  elect to deploy to 95 percent of the number of supported locations in a  given state with a corresponding reduction in support computed based on  the average support per location in the state times 1.89.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disbursement of Phase II funding. An eligible telecommunications  carrier will be advised by public notice when it is authorized to  receive support. The public notice will detail how disbursements will be  made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Provider eligibility. Any eligible telecommunications carrier is  eligible to receive Connect America Phase II support in eligible areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An entity may obtain eligible telecommunications carrier  designation after public notice of winning bidders in a competitive  bidding process for the offer of Phase II Connect America support. An  applicant in the competitive bidding process shall certify that it is  financially and technically qualified to provide the services supported  by Connect America Phase II in order to receive such support.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To the extent an applicant in the competitive bidding process  seeks eligible telecommunications carrier designation prior to public  notice of winning bidders for Phase II Connect America support, its  designation as an eligible telecommunications carrier may be conditional  subject to the receipt of Phase II Connect America support.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Transition to model-based support. Eligible telecommunications  carriers electing model-based support in states where that support is  less than their Phase I frozen support will transition to model-based  support as follows: In addition to model-based support, in the first  year of Phase II, they will receive 75% of the difference between Phase  I frozen support and model-based support; in the second year of Phase  II, they will receive 50% of the difference between Phase I frozen  support and model-based support; and in the third year of Phase II, they  will receive 25% of the difference between Phase I frozen support and  model-based support.  [79 FR 11335, Feb. 28, 2014, as amended at 79 FR 39188, July 9, 2014; 80  FR 4477, Jan. 27, 2015]</p><p class="depth2">Effective Date Note: At 79 FR 39188, July 9, 2014, Sec. 54.310,  paragraph (e)(1) was revised.
