                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Commissioner may propose and promulgate regulations for the  efficient enforcement of the laws administered by FDA whenever it is  necessary or appropriate to do so. The issuance, amendment, or  revocation of   a regulation may be initiated in any of the ways specified in Sec.  10.25.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This section applies to any regulation: (i) Not subject to Sec.  10.50 and part 12, or (ii) if it is subject to Sec. 10.50 and part 12,  to the extent that those provisions make this section applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A regulation proposed by an interested person in a petition  submitted under Sec. 10.25(a) will be published in the Federal Register  as a proposal if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The petition contains facts demonstrating reasonable grounds for  the proposal; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The petition substantially shows that the proposal is in the  public interest and will promote the objectives of the act and the  agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Two or more alternative proposed regulations may be published on  the same subject to obtain comment on the different alternatives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A regulation proposed by an interested person in a petition  submitted under Sec. 10.25(a) may be published together with the  Commissioner's preliminary views on the proposal and any alternative  proposal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, each  regulation must be the subject of a notice of proposed rulemaking  published in the Federal Register. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The notice will contain:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name of the agency;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The nature of the action, e.g., proposed rule, or notice;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A summary in the first paragraph describing the substance of  the document in easily understandable terms;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Relevant dates, e.g., comment closing date, and proposed  effective date(s);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The name, business address, and phone number of an agency  contact person who can provide further information to the public about  the notice;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> An address for submitting written comments;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Supplementary information about the notice in the form of a  preamble that summarizes the proposal and the facts and policy  underlying it, includes references to all information on which the  Commissioner relies for the proposal (copies or a full list of which are  a part of the docket file on the matter in the office of the Division of  Dockets Management), and cites the authority under which the regulation  is proposed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Either the terms or substance of the proposed regulation or a  description of the subjects and issues involved;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> A reference to the existence or lack of need for an  environmental impact statement under Sec. 25.52 of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> The docket number of the matter, which identifies the docket  file established by the Division of Dockets Management for all relevant  submissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The proposal will provide 60 days for comment, although the  Commissioner may shorten or lengthen this time period for good cause. In  no event is the time for comment to be less than 10 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After publication of the proposed rule, any interested person  may request the Commissioner to extend the comment period for an  additional specified period by submitting a written request to the  Division of Dockets Management stating the grounds for the request. The  request is submitted under Sec. 10.35 but should be headed ``REQUEST  FOR EXTENSION OF COMMENT PERIOD.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A request must discuss the reason comments could not feasibly be  submitted within the time permitted, or that important new information  will shortly be available, or that sound public policy otherwise  supports an extension of the time for comment. The Commissioner may  grant or deny the request or may grant an extension for a time period  different from that requested. An extension may be limited to specific  persons who have made and justified the request, but will ordinarily  apply to all interested persons.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A comment time extension of 30 days or longer will be published  in the Federal Register and will be applicable to all interested  persons. A comment time extension of less than 30 days will be the  subject either of a letter or memorandum filed with the Division of  Dockets Management or of a notice published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A notice of proposed rulemaking will request that four copies of  all comments be submitted to the Division of   Dockets Management, except that individuals may submit single copies.  Comments will be stamped with the date of receipt and will be numbered  chronologically.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Persons submitting comments critical of a proposed regulation  are encouraged to include their preferred alternative wording.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> After the time for comment on a proposed regulation has expired,  the Commissioner will review the entire administrative record on the  matter, including all comments and, in a notice published in the Federal  Register, will terminate the proceeding, issue a new proposal, or  promulgate a final regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The quality and persuasiveness of the comments will be the basis  for the Commissioner's decision. The number or length of comments will  not ordinarily be a significant factor in the decision unless the number  of comments is material where the degree of public interest is a  legitimate factor for consideration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The decision of the Commissioner on the matter will be based  solely upon the administrative record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A final regulation published in the Federal Register will have a  preamble stating: (i) The name of the agency, (ii) the nature of the  action e.g., final rule, notice, (iii) a summary first paragraph  describing the substance of the document in easily understandable terms,  (iv) relevant dates, e.g., the rule's effective date and comment closing  date, if an opportunity for comment is provided, (v) the name, business  address, and phone number of an agency contact person who can provide  further information to the public about the notice, (vi) an address for  the submission of written comments when they are permitted, (vii)  supplementary information about the regulation in the body of the  preamble that contains references to prior notices relating to the same  matter and a summary of each type of comment submitted on the proposal  and the Commissioner's conclusions with respect to each. The preamble is  to contain a thorough and comprehensible explanation of the reasons for  the Commissioner's decision on each issue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The effective date of a final regulation may not be less than 30  days after the date of publication in the Federal Register, except for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A regulation that grants an exemption or relieves a restriction;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A regulation for which the Commissioner finds, and states in  the notice good cause for an earlier effective date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The provisions for notice and comment in paragraphs (b) and (c)  of this section apply only to the extent required by the Administrative  Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551, 552, and 553). As a matter of discretion,  however, the Commissioner may voluntarily follow those provisions in  circumstances in which they are not required by the Administrative  Procedure Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The requirements of notice and public procedure in paragraph (b)  of this section do not apply in the following situations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the Commissioner determines for good cause that they are  impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. In these  cases, the notice promulgating the regulation will state the reasons for  the determination, and provide an opportunity for comment to determine  whether the regulation should subsequently be modified or revoked. A  subsequent notice based on those comments may, but need not, provide  additional opportunity for public comment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> New animal drug regulations, which are promulgated under section  512(i) of the act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In addition to the notice and public procedure required under  paragraph (b) of this section, the Commissioner may also subject a  proposed or final regulation, before or after publication in the Federal  Register, to the following additional procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conferences, meetings, discussions, and correspondence under  Sec. 10.65.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A hearing under parts 12, 13, 14, or 15.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A notice published in the Federal Register requesting  information and views before the Commissioner determines whether to  propose a regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A draft of a proposed regulation placed on public display in the  office of the Division of Dockets Management. If this procedure is used,  the Commissioner shall publish an appropriate notice in the Federal  Register stating that the document is available and specifying the time  within which comments on the draft proposal may be submitted orally or  in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A revised proposal published in the Federal Register, which  proposal is subject to all the provisions in this section relating to  proposed regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A tentative final regulation or tentative revised final  regulation placed on public display in the office of the Division of  Dockets Management and, if deemed desirable by the Commissioner,  published in the Federal Register. If the tentative regulation is placed  on display only, the Commissioner shall publish an appropriate notice in  the Federal Register stating that the document is available and  specifying the time within which comments may be submitted orally or in  writing on the tentative final regulation. The Commissioner shall mail a  copy of the tentative final regulation and the Federal Register notice  to each person who submitted comments on the proposed regulation if one  has been published.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A final regulation published in the Federal Register that  provides an opportunity for the submission of further comments, in  accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Any other public procedure established in this chapter and  expressly applicable to the matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The record of the administrative proceeding consists of all of  the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the regulation was initiated by a petition, the  administrative record specified in Sec. 10.30(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a petition for reconsideration or for a stay of action is  filed, the administrative record specified in Sec. Sec. 10.33(k) and  10.35(h).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The proposed rule published in the Federal Register, including  all information identified or filed by the Commissioner with the  Division of Dockets Management on the proposal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All comments received on the proposal, including all information  submitted as a part of the comments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The notice promulgating the final regulation, including all  information identified or filed by the Commissioner with the Division of  Dockets Management as part of the administrative record of the final  regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The transcripts, minutes of meetings, reports, Federal Register  notices, and other documents resulting from the procedures specified in  paragraph (f) of this section, but not the transcript of a closed  portion of a public advisory committee meeting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> All documents submitted to the Division of Dockets Management  under Sec. 10.65(h).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The record of the administrative proceeding closes on the date  of publication of the final regulation in the Federal Register unless  some other date is specified. Thereafter, any interested person may  submit a petition for reconsideration under Sec. 10.33 or a petition  for stay of action under Sec. 10.35. A person who wishes to rely upon  information or views not included in the administrative record shall  submit it to the Commissioner with a new petition to modify the final  regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The Division of Dockets Management shall maintain a  chronological list of all regulations proposed and promulgated under  this section and Sec. 10.50 (which list will not include regulations  resulting from petitions filed and assigned a docket number under Sec.  10.30) showing--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The docket number (for a petition submitted directly to a  center, the list also includes the number or other designation assigned  by the center, e.g., the number assigned to a food additive petition);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The name of the petitioner, if any;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The subject matter involved; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The disposition of the petition.
