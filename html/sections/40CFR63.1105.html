                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Design requirements. The owner or operator shall equip each transfer rack with one of the control options listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A closed vent system designed to collect HAP-containing vapors displaced from tank trucks or railcars during loading and to route the collected vapors to a flare. The owner or operator must meet the requirements of Sec.  63.982(a)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A closed vent system designed to collect HAP-containing vapors displaced from tank trucks or railcars during loading and to route the collected vapors to a control device other than a flare. The owner or operator must meet the requirements of Sec.  63.982(a)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Process piping designed to collect the HAP vapors displaced from tank trucks or railcars during loading and

to route the collected vapors to a process where the HAP vapors shall predominantly meet one of, or a combination of, the ends specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section or to a fuel gas system. The owner or operator must meet the requirements of Sec.  63.982(a)(3).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Recycled and/or consumed in the same manner as a material that fulfills the same function in that process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Transformed by chemical reaction into materials that are not HAP;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Incorporated into a product; and/or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Recovered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Process piping designed to collect the HAP vapors displaced from tank trucks or railcars during loading and to route the collected vapors to a vapor balance system. The vapor balance system must be designed to route the collected HAP vapors to the storage vessel from which the liquid being loaded originated, or to another storage vessel connected to a common header, or to compress and route collected HAP vapors to a process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Operating requirements. An owner or operator of a transfer rack shall operate it in such a manner that emissions are routed through the equipment specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Control device operation. Whenever HAP emissions are vented to a control device used to comply with the provisions of this subpart, such control device shall be operating.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Tank trucks and railcars. The owner or operator shall load HAP-containing materials only into tank trucks and railcars that meet the requirement in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section and shall maintain the records specified in paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Have a current certification in accordance with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) pressure test requirements of 49 CFR part 180 for tank trucks and 49 CFR 173.31 for railcars; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Have been demonstrated to be vapor-tight within the preceding 12 months as determined by the procedures in paragraph (h) of this section. Vapor-tight means that the pressure in a truck or railcar tank will not drop more than 750 pascals within 5 minutes after it is pressurized to a minimum of 4,500 pascals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Pressure relief device. The owner or operator of a transfer rack subject to the provisions of this subpart shall ensure that no pressure relief device in the loading equipment of each tank truck or railcar shall begin to open to the atmosphere during loading. Pressure relief devices needed for safety purposes are not subject to the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Compatible system. The owner or operator of a transfer rack subject to the provisions of this subpart shall load HAP-containing materials only to tank trucks or railcars equipped with a vapor collection system that is compatible with the transfer rack's closed vent system or process piping.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Loading while systems connected. The owner or operator of a transfer rack subject to this subpart shall load HAP-containing material only to tank trucks or railcars whose collection systems are connected to the transfer rack's closed vent system or process piping.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Vapor tightness procedures. For the purposes of demonstrating vapor tightness to determine compliance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the procedures and equipment specified in paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) shall be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The pressure test procedures specified in Method 27 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A pressure measurement device that has a precision of q2.5 millimeters of mercury or better and that is capable of measuring above the pressure at which the tank truck or railcar is to be tested for vapor tightness.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Recordkeeping. The owner or operator of a transfer rack shall record that the verification of DOT tank certification or Method 27 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 testing required in Sec.  63.84(c) has been performed. Various methods for the record of verification can be used, such as a check-off on a log sheet, a list of DOT serial numbers or Method 27 data, or a position description for gate security showing that the security guard will not allow any trucks on-site that do not have the appropriate documentation.
