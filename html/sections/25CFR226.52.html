                            <p class="depth0">No well may be permanently abandoned until it is no longer producing oil and/or gas in paying quantities and such a showing has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Superintendent. The lessee may not shut down, abandon, or otherwise discontinue the operation or use of any well for any purpose without the written approval of the Superintendent. All applications for such approval must be submitted to the Superintendent on forms furnished by the Superintendent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An application for authority to permanently shut down or discontinue the use or operation of a well must set forth the justification, the means by which the well bore is to be protected, and the contemplated eventual disposition of the well. The method of conditioning such well is subject to the approval of the Superintendent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prior to permanent abandonment of any well, the oil lessee or the gas lessee, as the case may be, must offer the well to the other for his/her recompletion or use under such terms as may be mutually agreed upon but not in conflict with the regulations. Failure of the lessee receiving the offer to reply within 10 calendar days after receipt thereof will be deemed a rejection of the offer. If, after indicating acceptance, the two parties cannot agree on the terms of the offer within 30 calendar days, the disposition of such well will be determined by the Superintendent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Superintendent is authorized to shut in a lease when the lessee fails to comply with the terms of the lease, the regulations, and/or orders of the Superintendent.</p>
