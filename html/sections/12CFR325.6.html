                                Sec. 325.6  Issuance of directives.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A directive is a final order issued to a bank that fails to maintain capital at or above the minimum leverage capital requirement as set forth in Sec. Sec. 325.3 and 325.4. A directive issued pursuant to this section, including a plan submitted under a directive, is enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as a final cease-and-desist order issued under 12 U.S.C. 1818(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Issuance of directives. If a bank is operating with less than the minimum leverage capital requirement established by this regulation, the Board of Directors, or its designee(s), may issue and serve upon any insured state nonmember bank a directive requiring the bank to restore its capital to the minimum leverage capital requirement within a specified time period. The directive may require the bank to submit to the appropriate FDIC regional director, or other specified official, for review and approval, a plan describing the means and timing by which the bank shall achieve the minimum leverage capital requirement. After the FDIC has approved the plan, the bank may be required under the terms of the directive to adhere to and monitor compliance with the plan. The directive may be issued during the course of an examination of the bank, or at any other time that the FDIC deems appropriate, if the bank is found to be operating with less than the minimum leverage capital requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice and opportunity to respond to issuance of a directive. (1) If the FDIC makes an initial determination that a directive should be issued to a bank pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the FDIC, through the appropriate designated official(s), shall serve written notification upon the bank of its intent to issue a directive. The notice shall include the current Tier 1 leverage capital ratio, the basis upon which said ratio was calculated, the proposed capital injection, the proposed date for achieving the minimum leverage capital requirement and any other relevant information concerning the decision to issue a directive. When deemed appropriate, specific requirements of a proposed plan for meeting the minimum leverage capital requirement may be included in the notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the FDIC makes an initial determination that a directive should be issued to a bank pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the FDIC, through the appropriate designated official(s), shall serve written notification upon the bank of its intent to issue a directive. The notice shall include the current Tier 1 leverage capital ratio, the basis upon which said ratio was calculated, the proposed capital injection, the proposed date for achieving the minimum leverage capital requirement and any other relevant information concerning the decision to issue a directive. When deemed appropriate, specific requirements of a proposed plan for meeting the minimum leverage capital requirement may be included in the notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within 14 days of receipt of notification, the bank may file with the appropriate designated FDIC official(s) a written response, explaining why the directive should not be issued, seeking modification of its terms, or other appropriate relief. The bank's response shall include any information, mitigating circumstances, documentation or other relevant evidence which supports its position, and may include a plan for attaining the minimum leverage capital requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After considering the bank's response, the appropriate designated FDIC official(s) shall serve upon the bank a written determination addressing the bank's response and setting forth the FDIC's findings and conclusions in support of any decision to issue or not to issue a directive. The directive may be issued as originally proposed or in modified form. The directive may order the bank to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Achieve the minimum leverage capital requirement established by this regulation by a certain date;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Submit for approval and adhere to a plan for achieving the minimum leverage capital requirement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Take other action as is necessary to achieve the minimum leverage capital requirement; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A combination of the above actions.
If a directive is to be issued, it may be served upon the bank along with the final determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any bank, upon a change in circumstances, may request the FDIC to reconsider the terms of a directive and may propose changes in the plan under which it is operating to meet the minimum leverage capital requirement. The directive and plan continue in effect while such request is pending before the FDIC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All papers filed with the FDIC must be postmarked or received by the

appropriate designated FDIC official(s) within the prescribed time limit for filing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Failure by the bank to file a written response to notification of intent to issue a directive within the specified time period shall constitute consent to the issuance of such directive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Enforcement of a directive. (1) Whenever a bank fails to follow the directive or to submit or adhere to its capital adequacy plan, the FDIC may seek enforcement of the directive in the appropriate United States district court, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 3907(b)(2)(B)(ii), in the same manner and to the same extent as if the directive were a final cease-and-desist order. In addition to enforcement of the directive, the FDIC may seek assessment of civil money penalties for violation of the directive against any bank, any officer, director, employee, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of the bank, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 3909(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever a bank fails to follow the directive or to submit or adhere to its capital adequacy plan, the FDIC may seek enforcement of the directive in the appropriate United States district court, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 3907(b)(2)(B)(ii), in the same manner and to the same extent as if the directive were a final cease-and-desist order.

In addition to addressing a bank's minimum leverage capital requirement, the capital directive may also address minimum risk-based capital requirements that are to be maintained and calculated in accordance with appendix A to this part.
