                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Electrically operated toys, and the instruction sheets and outer packaging thereof, shall be labeled in accordance with the requirements of this section and any other applicable requirements of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act and regulations promulgated thereunder. All labeling shall be prominently and conspicuously displayed under customary conditions of purchase, storage, and use. All required information shall be readily visible, noticeable, clear, and, except where coding is permitted, shall be in legible English (other languages may also be included as appropriate). Such factors governing labeling as location, type size, and contrast against background may be based on necessary condensations to provide a reasonable display.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Specific items. (1) The toy shall be marked in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section to indicate:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The toy shall be marked in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section to indicate:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The electrical ratings required by paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any precautionary statements required by paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The date (month and year) of manufacture (or appropriate codes). As an alternative to putting this information on the toy itself, it may be included in the instructions provided with the toy (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The shelf pack or package of the toy shall be labeled in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section to indicate:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The date (month and year) of manufacture (or appropriate codes).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The electrical ratings required by paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any precautionary statements required by paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each toy shall be provided with adequate instructions that are easily understood by children of those ages for which the toy is intended. The instructions shall describe the applicable installation, assembly, use, cleaning, maintenance (including lubrication), and other functions as appropriate. Applicable precautions shall be included as well as the information required by paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, except that the date of manufacture information described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section need not be included in the instructions provided with the toy if it is placed on the toy itself. The instructions shall also contain a statement addressed to parents recommending that the toy be periodically examined for potential hazards and that any potentially hazardous parts be repaired or replaced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If a toy is produced or assembled at more than one establishment, the toy and its shelf pack or package shall have a distinctive mark (which may be in code) identifying the toy as the product of a particular establishment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Rating.

The markings shall not be permanently obliterable by spillage of any material

intended for use with the toy and shall not be readily removable by cleaning with ordinary household cleaning substances. All markings on the toy and labeling of the shelf pack or package required by paragraph (b) of this section shall contrast sharply with the background (whether by color, projection, or indentation) and shall be readily visible and legible. Such markings and labeling shall appear in lettering of a height not less than that specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, except that those words shown in capital letters in paragraph (e) of this section shall appear in capital lettering of a height not less than twice that specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The markings required on the toy by paragraph (b) of this section shall be of a permanent nature, such as paint-stenciled, die-stamped, molded, or indelibly stamped.
