                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> SES rate range. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On the first day of the first applicable pay  period beginning on or after January 1, 2004, the minimum rate of basic  pay of the SES rate range is set at an amount equal to the minimum rate  of basic pay under 5 U.S.C. 5376 for senior-level positions (excluding  any locality-based comparability payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304). The  minimum rate of basic pay for the SES rate range will increase  consistent with any increase in the minimum rate of basic pay for  senior-level positions under 5 U.S.C. 5376. An SES member may not  receive less than the minimum rate of the SES rate range. Except as  provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the maximum rate of basic  pay of the SES rate range is set at the rate for level III of the  Executive Schedule. An SES member's rate of basic pay must be set at one  of the rates within the SES rate range   based on the senior executive's performance and/or contribution to the  agency's performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>. The applicable maximum rate of basic pay for the  SES rate range will increase with any increase in the rate for levels II  or III of the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5318.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rates of basic pay higher than the rate for level III of the  Executive Schedule but less than or equal to the rate for level II of  the Executive Schedule generally are reserved for those senior  executives who have demonstrated the highest levels of individual  performance and/or made the greatest contributions to the agency's  performance, as determined by the agency through the administration of  its performance appraisal system for senior executives, or, in the case  of newly-appointed senior executives, those who possess superior  leadership or other competencies, consistent with the agency's strategic  human capital plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Suspension of certification of performance appraisal system. A  senior executive whose rate of basic pay is higher than the rate for  level III of the Executive Schedule may not suffer a reduction in pay  because his or her agency's applicable performance appraisal system  certification is suspended under 5 CFR 430.405(h). The senior executive  will continue to receive his or her current SES rate and is not eligible  for a pay adjustment until the senior executive is assigned to a  position that would allow the employee to receive a pay adjustment or  until certification of the employing agency's applicable performance  appraisal system is reinstated under 5 CFR part 430, subpart D. The SES  rate of pay is not considered a retained rate of pay for the purpose of  applying 5 U.S.C. 3594 and 5 CFR part 359, subpart G, or 5 U.S.C. 5363  and 5 CFR part 536, subpart C.  [69 FR 70362, Dec. 6, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 31305, May 31, 2005]</p>
