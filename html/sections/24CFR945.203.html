                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicable terminology. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As used in this section, the terms  ``initial allocation plan'' refers to the PHA's first submission of an  allocation plan, and ``updated allocation plan'' refers to the biennial  update (once every two years) of this plan, which is described in  paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As provided in Sec. 945.105, the term ``project'' includes the  plural (``projects'') and includes a portion of a project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consultation in plan development. These consultation  requirements apply to the development of an initial allocation plan as  provided in paragraph (c) of this section, or any update of the  allocation plan as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In preparing the draft plan, the PHA shall consult with:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The State or unit of general local government where the project  is located;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Public and private service providers;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Representative advocacy groups for each of these family types:  disabled families, elderly families, and families with children, where  such advocacy groups exist;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Representatives of the residents of the PHA's projects proposed  for designation, including representatives from resident councils or  resident management corporations where they exist; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Other parties that the PHA determines would be interested in the  plan, or other parties that have contacted the PHA and expressed an  interest in the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Following the completion of the draft plan, the PHA shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Issue public notices regarding its intention to designate  housing and the availability of the draft plan for review;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contact directly those individuals, agencies and other  interested parties specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and  advise of the availability of the draft plan for review;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Allow not less than 30 days for public comment on the draft  allocation plan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Make free copies of the draft plan available upon request, and  in accessible format, when appropriate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Conduct at least one public meeting on the draft allocation  plan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Give fair consideration to all comments received; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Retain any records of public meetings held on the allocation  plan (or updated plan) and any written comments received on the plan for  a period of five years commencing from the date of submission of the  allocation plan to HUD. These records must be available for review by  HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification of the project to be designated and type of  designation to be made. The PHA must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identify the type of designation to be made (i.e., housing for  disabled families or housing for elderly families);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identify the building(s), floor(s), or unit(s) to be designated  and their location, or if specific units are not designated, the number  to be designated; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> State the reasons the building(s), floor(s), or unit(s) were  selected for designation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identification of groups and persons consulted and comments  submitted. The PHA must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identify the groups and persons with whom the PHA has consulted  in the development of the allocation plan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Include a summary of comments received on the plan from the  groups and persons consulted; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Describe how the plan addresses these comments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Profile of proposed designated project in pre-designation state.  This component of the plan must include, for the projects, buildings, or  portions of buildings to be designated:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The total number of families currently occupying the project,  and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The number of families who are members of the group for whom the  project is to be designated, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The number of families who are not members of the group for whom  the project is to be designated;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An estimate of the total number of elderly families and  disabled families who are potential tenants of the project (i.e., as the  project now exists), based on information provided by:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The waiting list from which vacancies in the project are filled;  and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A local housing needs survey, if available, such as the CHAS,  for the jurisdiction within which the area served by the PHA is located;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An estimate of the number of potential tenants who will need  accessible units based on information provided by:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The needs assessment prepared in accordance with 24 CFR 8.25,  and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A housing needs survey, if available, such as the CHAS or HUD- prescribed successor survey;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The number of units in the project that became vacant and  available for occupancy during the year preceding the date of submission  of the allocation plan to HUD;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The average length of vacancy for dwelling units in the project  for the year preceding the date of submission of the allocation plan to  HUD;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> An estimate of the number of units in the project that the PHA  expects to become vacant and available for occupancy during the two-year  period following the date of submission of the allocation plan to HUD  (i.e., if the project were not to be designated);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> An estimate of the average length of time elderly families and  non-elderly persons with disabilities currently have to wait for a  dwelling unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Projected profile of project in designated state. This component  of the plan must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identify the source of the families for the designated project  (e.g., current residents of the project, families currently on the  waiting list, residents of other projects, and potential tenants based  on information from the local housing needs survey);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For projects proposed to be designated for occupancy by elderly  families an estimate of the number of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Units in the project that are anticipated to become vacant and  available for occupancy during the two-year period following the date of  submission of the allocation plan to HUD;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Near-elderly families who may be needed to fill units in the  designated project for elderly families, as provided in Sec.  945.303(c);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Describe any impact the designation may have on the average  length of time applicants in the group for which the project is  designated and other applicants will have to wait for a dwelling unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> PHA occupancy policies and procedures. This component of the  plan must describe any changes the PHA intends to make in its admission  policies to accommodate the designation, including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> How the waiting list will be maintained;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> How dwelling units will be assigned; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> How records will be maintained to document the effect on all  families who would have resided in the designated project if it had not  been designated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Strategy for addressing the current and future housing needs of  the families in the PHA's jurisdiction. The PHA must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identify the housing resources currently owned or controlled by  the PHA, including any mixed population projects, in existence, as  provided in 24 CFR part 960, subpart D, that will be available to these  families;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Describe the steps to be taken by the PHA to respond to any  need for accessible units that will no longer be available for  applicants who need them. The PHA has a continuing obligation under  section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) to provide  accessible dwellings even if the project designation removes accessible  dwellings from the inventory of possible dwellings for non-elderly  persons with disabilities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a project is being designated for elderly families,  describe the steps the PHA will take to facilitate access to supportive  services by non-elderly disabled families. The services should be  equivalent to those available in the designated project and requested by  non-elderly disabled families. If the PHA funds supportive services for  the designated project for elderly families,   the PHA must provide the same level of services, upon the request of  non-elderly disabled families.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If a project is being designated for elderly families, identify  the additional housing resources that the PHA determines will be  sufficient to provide assistance to not less than the number of non- elderly disabled families that would have been housed by the PHA if  occupancy in units in the designated project were not restricted to  elderly families (one-for-one replacement is not required). Among these  resources may be:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Normal turnover in existing projects;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Existing housing stock that previously was not available to or  considered for non-elderly disabled families. Examples are dwellings in  general occupancy (family) projects that are reconfigured to meet the  dwelling size needs of the non-elderly disabled families, or were  previously occupied by elderly families who will relocate to the  designated project for elderly families, or were previously vacant  because there had not been a demand for dwellings of that size in that  location;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Housing for which the PHA has received preliminary notification  that it will obtain; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Housing for which the PHA plans to apply during the period  covered by the allocation plan, and which it has a reasonable  expectation of obtaining.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Where a project is being designated for elderly families,  explain how the PHA plans to secure the required additional housing  resources. In the case of housing for which the PHA plans to apply, the  PHA must provide sufficient information about the housing resource and  its application to establish that the PHA can reasonably expect to  obtain the housing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Describe incentives, if any, that the PHA intends to offer to:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Families who are members of the group for whom a project was  designated to achieve voluntary transfers to the designated project; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Families who are not members of the group for whom a project was  designated to achieve voluntary transfers from the project proposed to  be designated;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Criteria for allocation plan approval. HUD shall approve an  initial allocation plan, or updated allocation plan, if HUD determines  that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The information contained in the plan is complete and accurate  (a plan that is incomplete, i.e., missing required statements or items,  will be disapproved), and the projections are reasonable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Implementation of the plan will not result in a substantial  increase in the vacancy rates in the designated project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Implementation of the plan will not result in a substantial  increase in delaying or denying housing assistance to families on the  PHA's waiting list because of designating projects;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The plan for securing sufficient additional housing resources  for non-elderly disabled persons can reasonably be achieved; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The plan conforms to the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Allocation plan approval or disapproval--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Written  notification. HUD shall notify each PHA, in writing, of approval or  disapproval of the initial or updated allocation plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Timing of notification. An allocation plan shall be considered  to be approved by HUD if HUD fails to provide the PHA with notification  of approval or disapproval of the plan, as required by paragraph (e)(1)  of this section, within:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 90 days after the date of submission of an allocation plan that  contains comments, as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 45 days after the date of submission of all other plans,  including</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Initial plans for which no comments were received;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Updated plans, as provided in paragraph (f) of this section; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Revised initial plans or revised updated plans, as provided in  paragraph (e)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Approval limited solely to approval of designated housing. HUD's  approval of an initial plan or updated allocation plan under this  section may not be construed to constitute approval of any request for  assistance for major reconstruction of obsolete projects, assistance for  development or acquisition of public housing, or assistance under 24   CFR part 890 (supportive housing for persons with disabilities).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Resubmission following disapproval. If HUD disapproves an  initial allocation plan, a PHA shall have a period of not less than 45  days or more than 90 days following notification of disapproval as  provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, to submit amendments to  the plan, or to submit a revised plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Biennial update of plan--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Each PHA that owns or  operates a public housing project that is designated for occupancy under  this part shall update its allocation plan not less than once every two  years, from the date of HUD approval of the initial allocation plan. A  PHA that wishes to amend or revise its plan later than 90 days after HUD  disapproval must begin the hearing and consultation process again.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failure to submit updated plan. If the PHA fails to submit the  updated plan as required by this paragraph (f), the Secretary may revoke  the designation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph  (f)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Contents of updated plan. The updated allocation plan shall  contain, at a minimum, the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The most recent update of the allocation plan data, and  projections for the next two years;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An assessment of the accuracy of the projections contained in  previous plans and in the updated allocation plan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The number of times a vacancy was filled in accordance with  Sec. 945.303(c);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A discussion of the impact of the designation on the designated  project and the other public housing projects operated by the PHA, using  the data obtained from the system developed in Sec. 945.203(c),  including</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The number of times there was a substantial increase in delaying  housing assistance to families on the PHA's waiting list because  projects were designated; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The number of times there was a substantial increase in denying  housing assistance to families on the PHA's waiting list because  projects were designated;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A plan for adjusting the allocation of designated units, if  necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Criteria for approval of updated plan. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> HUD shall approve an  updated allocation plan based on HUD's review and assessment of the  updated plan, using the criteria in (d) of this section. If HUD  considers it appropriate, the review and assessment shall include any  on-site review and monitoring of PHA performance in the administration  of its designated housing and in the allocation of the PHA's housing  resources. Notification of approval or disapproval of the updated  allocation plan shall be provided in accordance with paragraph (e) of  this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a PHA's updated plan is not approved, HUD may require PHAs  to change the designation of existing or planned projects to other  categories, such as general occupancy or mixed population projects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Notification of approval or disapproval of updated plan. HUD  shall notify each PHA submitting an updated plan of approval or  disapproval of the updated plan, in accordance with the form of  notification and within the time periods required by paragraph (e) of  this section.
