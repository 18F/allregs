Satisfactory evidence may include copies of qualified dealer licenses or  exemption certificates obtained for state tax purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Registration. With respect to each person that has been  registered as a qualified retailer by the district director, the rules  of Sec. 48.4101-1(g), (h), and (i) apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Cross reference. For the tax on previously untaxed diesel fuel  or kerosene that is used for a taxable purpose, see Sec. 48.4082-4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Effective date.
