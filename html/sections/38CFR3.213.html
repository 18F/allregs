                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. For the purpose of establishing entitlement to a higher rate of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on the existence of a dependent, VA will require evidence which satisfies the requirements of Sec.  3.204. For the purpose of reducing or discontinuing such benefits, a statement by a claimant or payee setting forth the month and year of change of status which would result in a reduction or discontinuance of benefits to that person will be accepted, in the absence of contradictory information. This includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Veteran. A statement by the veteran setting forth the month and year of death of a spouse, child, or dependent parent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Surviving spouse. A statement by the surviving spouse or remarried surviving spouse setting forth the month and year of remarriage and any change of name. (An award for a child or children who are otherwise entitled may be made to commence the day following the date of discontinuance of any payments to the surviving spouse.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Child. A statement by the veteran or surviving spouse (where an additional allowance is being paid to the veteran or surviving spouse for a child), or fiduciary, setting forth the month and year of the child's death, marriage, or discontinuance of school attendance. A similar statement by a child who is receiving payments direct will be accepted to establish the child's marriage or the discontinuance of school attendance. Where appropriate, the month and year of discontinuance of school attendance will be required in addition to the month and year of death or marriage of a child.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Parent. A statement by a parent setting forth the month and year:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Of marriage or remarriage;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When two parents or a parent and spouse ceased living together;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When two parents or a parent and spouse resumed living together following a period of separation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Of divorce or death of a spouse.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Date not reported. If the month and year of the event is not reported, the award will be reduced or discontinued, whichever is appropriate, effective date of last payment. The payee will be requested to furnish within 60 days from the date of request a statement setting forth the date of the event. Where payments are continued at a reduced rate, the award will be discontinued effective date of last payment if the required statement is not received within the 60-day period. Payments on a discontinued award may be resumed, if otherwise in order, from the date of discontinuance if the necessary information is received within 1

year from the date of request; otherwise from the date of receipt of a new claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contradictory information. Where there is reason to believe that the event reported may have occurred at an earlier date, formal proof will be required.</p><p class="depth2">Cross References: Abandoned claims. See Sec.  3.158. Change in status of dependents. See Sec.  3.651. Material change in income, net worth or change in status. See Sec.  3.660. Evidence of dependents and age. See Sec.  3.204.
