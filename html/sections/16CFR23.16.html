                            <p class="depth0">It is unfair or deceptive to use the unqualified expressions  ``brilliant,'' ``brilliant cut,'' or ``full cut'' to describe, identify,  or refer to any diamond except a round diamond that has at least thirty- two (32) facets plus the table above the girdle and at least twenty-four  (24) facets below.</p><p class="depth0">Note to Sec. 23.16: Such terms should not be applied to single or  rose-cut diamonds. They may be applied to emerald-(rectangular) cut,  pear-shaped, heart-shaped, oval-shaped, and marquise-(pointed oval) cut  diamonds meeting the above-stated facet requirements when, in immediate  conjunction with the term used, the form of the diamond is disclosed.</p>
