                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Notice of seizure. As soon as practicable after seizure of property, the internal revenue officer seizing the property shall give notice in writing to the owner of the property (or, in the case of personal property, to the possessor thereof). The written notice shall be delivered to the owner (or to the possessor, in the case of personal property) or left at his usual place of abode or business if he has such within the internal revenue district where the seizure is made. If the owner cannot be readily located, or has no dwelling or place of business within such district, the notice may be mailed to his last known address. Such notice shall specify the sum demanded and shall contain, in the case of personal property, a list sufficient to identify the property seized and, in the case of real property, a description with reasonable certainty of the property seized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Notice of sale. (1) As soon as practicable after seizure of the property, the district director shall give notice of sale in writing to the owner. Such notice shall be delivered to the owner or left at his usual place of abode or business if located within the internal revenue district where the seizure is made. If the owner cannot be readily located, or has no dwelling or place of business within such district, the notice may be mailed to his last known address. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address, see Sec. 301.6212-2. The notice shall specify the property to be sold, and the time, place, manner, and conditions of the sale thereof, and shall expressly state that only the right, title, and interest of the delinquent taxpayer in and to such property is to be offered for sale. The notice shall also be published in some newspaper published in the county wherein the seizure is made or in a newspaper generally circulated in that county. For example, if a newspaper of general circulation in a county but not published in that county will reach more potential bidders for the property to be sold than a newspaper published within the county, or if there is a newspaper of general circulation within the county but no newspaper published within the county, the district director may cause public notice of the sale to be given in the newspaper of general circulation within the county. If there is no newspaper published or generally circulated in the county, the notice shall be posted at the post office nearest the place where the seizure is made, and in not less than two other public places.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> As soon as practicable after seizure of the property, the district director shall give notice of sale in writing to the owner. Such notice shall be delivered to the owner or left at his usual place of abode or business if located within the internal revenue district where the seizure is made. If the owner cannot be readily located, or has no dwelling or place of business within such district, the notice may be mailed to his last known address. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address, see Sec. 301.6212-2. The notice shall specify the property to be sold, and the time, place, manner, and conditions of the sale thereof, and shall expressly state that only the right, title, and interest of the delinquent taxpayer in and to such property is to be offered for sale.

If there is no newspaper published or generally circulated in the county, the notice shall be posted at the post office nearest the place where the seizure is made, and in not less than two other public places.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The district director may use other methods of giving notice of sale and of advertising seized property in addition to those referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (b), when he believes that the nature of the property to be sold is such that a wider or more specialized advertising coverage will enhance the possibility of obtaining a higher price for the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whenever levy is made without regard to the 10-day period provided in section 6331(a) (relating to cases in which collection is in jeopardy), a public notice of sale of the property seized shall not be made within such 10-day period unless section 6336 (relating to perishable goods) is applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Time, place, manner, and conditions of sale. The time, place, manner, and conditions of the sale of property seized by levy shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Time and place of sale. The time of sale shall not be less than 10 days nor more than 40 days from the time of giving public notice under section 6335(b) (see paragraph (b) of this section). The place of sale shall be within the county in which the property is seized, except that if it appears to the district director under whose supervision the seizure was made that substantially higher bids may be obtained for the property if the sale is held at a place outside such county, he may order that the sale be held in such other place. The

sale shall be held at the time and place stated in the notice of sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Adjournment of sale. When it appears to the district director that an adjournment of the sale will best serve the interest of the United States or that of the taxpayer, the district director may adjourn, or cause the internal revenue officer conducting the sale to adjourn, the sale from time to time, but the date of the sale shall not be later than one month after the date fixed in the original notice of sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determinations relating to minimum price--(i) Minimum price. Before the sale of property seized by levy, the district director shall determine a minimum price, taking into account the expenses of levy and sale, for which the property shall be sold. The internal revenue officer conducting the sale may either announce the minimum price before the sale begins, or defer announcement of the minimum price until after the receipt of the highest bid, in which case, if the highest bid is greater than the minimum price, no announcement of the minimum price shall be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Minimum price. Before the sale of property seized by levy, the district director shall determine a minimum price, taking into account the expenses of levy and sale, for which the property shall be sold. The internal revenue officer conducting the sale may either announce the minimum price before the sale begins, or defer announcement of the minimum price until after the receipt of the highest bid, in which case, if the highest bid is greater than the minimum price, no announcement of the minimum price shall be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Purchase by the United States. Before the sale of property seized by levy, the district director shall determine whether the purchase of property by the United States at the minimum price would be in the best interest of the United States. In determining whether the purchase of property would be in the best interest of the United States, the district director may consider all relevant facts and circumstances including for example--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Marketability of the property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Cost of maintaining the property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Cost of repairing or restoring the property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Cost of transporting the property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Cost of safeguarding the property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Cost of potential toxic waste cleanup; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Other factors pertinent to the type of property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effective date. This paragraph (c)(3) applies to determinations relating to minimum price made on or after December 17, 1996.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Disposition of property at sale--(i) Sale to highest bidder at or above minimum price. If one or more persons offer to buy the property for at least the amount of the minimum price, the property shall be sold to the highest bidder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sale to highest bidder at or above minimum price. If one or more persons offer to buy the property for at least the amount of the minimum price, the property shall be sold to the highest bidder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Property deemed sold to United States at minimum price. If no one offers at least the amount of the minimum price for the property and the Secretary has determined that it would be in the best interest of the United States to purchase the property for the minimum price, the property shall be declared to be sold to the United States for the minimum price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Release to owner. If the property is not declared to be sold under paragraph (c)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section, the property shall be released to the owner of the property and the expense of the levy and sale shall be added to the amount of tax for the collection of which the United States made the levy. Any property released under this paragraph (c)(4)(iii) shall remain subject to any lien imposed by subchapter C of chapter 64 of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Effective date. This paragraph (c)(4) applies to dispositions of property at sale made on or after December 17, 1996.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Offering of property--(i) Sale of indivisible property. If any property levied upon is not divisible, so as to enable the district director by sale of a part thereof to raise the whole amount of the tax and expenses of levy and sale, the whole of such property shall be sold. For application of surplus proceeds of sale, see section 6342(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sale of indivisible property. If any property levied upon is not divisible, so as to enable the district director by sale of a part thereof to raise the whole amount of the tax and expenses of levy and sale, the whole of such property shall be sold. For application of surplus proceeds of sale, see section 6342(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Separately, in groups, or in the aggregate. The seized property may be offered for sale--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> As separate items, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> As groups of items, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In the aggregate, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Both as separate items (or in groups) and in the aggregate. In such cases, the property shall be sold under the method which produces the highest aggregate amount.
The district director shall select whichever of the foregoing methods of offering the property for sale as, in his opinion, is most feasible under all the facts and circumstances of the case, except that if the property to be sold includes both real and personal property, only the personal property may be grouped for the purpose of offering such property for sale. However, real

and personal property may be offered for sale in the aggregate, provided the real property, as separate items, and the personal property as a group, or as groups, or as separate items, are first offered separately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Condition of title and of property. Only the right, title, and interest of the delinquent taxpayer in and to the property seized shall be offered for sale, and such interest shall be offered subject to any prior outstanding mortgages, encumbrances, or other liens in favor of third parties which are valid as against the delinquent taxpayer and are superior to the lien of the United States. All seized property shall be offered for sale ``as is'' and ``where is'' and without recourse against the United States. No guaranty or warranty, express or implied, shall be made by the internal revenue officer offering the property for sale, as to the validity of the title, quality, quantity, weight, size, or condition of any of the property, or its fitness for any use or purpose. No claim shall be considered for allowance or adjustment or for rescission of the sale based upon failure of the property to conform with any representation, express or implied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Terms of payment. The property shall be offered for sale upon whichever of the following terms is fixed by the district director in the public notice of sale:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Payment in full upon acceptance of the highest bid, without regard to the amount of such bid, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the aggregate price of all property purchased by a successful bidder at the sale is more than $200, an initial payment of $200 or 20 percent of the purchase price, whichever is the greater, and payment of the balance (including all costs incurred for the protection or preservation of the property subsequent to the sale and prior to final payment) within a specified period, not to exceed 1 month from the date of the sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Method of sale. The district director shall sell the property either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At public auction, at which open competitive bids shall be received, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At public sale under sealed bids. The following rules, in addition to the other rules provided in this paragraph, shall be applicable to public sale under sealed bids:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Invitation to bidders. Bids shall be solicited through a public notice of sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Form for use by bidders. A bid shall be submitted on a form which will be furnished by the district director upon request. The form shall be completed in accordance with the instructions thereon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Remittance with bid. If the total bid is $200 or less, the full amount of the bid shall be submitted therewith. If the total bid is more than $200, 20 percent of such bid or $200, whichever is greater, shall be submitted therewith. (In the case of alternative bids submitted by the same bidder for items of property offered separately, or in groups, or in the aggregate, the bidder shall remit the full amount of the highest alternative bid submitted, if that bid is $200 or less. If the highest alternative bid submitted is more than $200, the bidder shall remit 20 percent of the highest alternative bid or $200, whichever is greater.) Such remittance shall be by a certified, cashier's, or treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the United States or under the laws of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or by a U.S. postal, bank, express, or telegraph money order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Time for receiving and opening bids. Each bid shall be submitted in a securely sealed envelope. The bidder shall indicate in the upper left hand corner of the envelope his name and address and the time and place of sale as announced in the public notice of sale. A bid will not be considered unless it is received by the internal revenue officer conducting the sale prior to the opening of the bids. The bids will be opened at the time and place stated in the notice of sale, or at the time fixed in the announcement of the adjournment of the sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Consideration of bids. The public notice of sale shall specify whether the property is to be sold separately, by groups, or in the aggregate or by a combination of these methods, as provided in subparagraph (4)(ii) of this paragraph. If the notice specifies an alternative method, bidders may submit

bids under one or more of the alternatives. In case of error in the extension of prices in any bid, the unit price will govern. The internal revenue officer conducting the sale shall have the right to waive any technical defects in a bid. In the event two or more highest bids are equal in amount, the internal revenue officer conducting the sale shall determine the successful bidder by drawing lots. After the opening, examination, and consideration of all bids, the internal revenue officer conducting the sale shall announce the amount of the highest bid or bids and the name of the successful bidder or bidders. Any remittance submitted in connection with an unsuccessful bid shall be returned at the conclusion of the sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Withdrawal of bids. A bid may be withdrawn on written or telegraphic request received from the bidder prior to the time fixed for opening the bids. A technical defect in a bid confers no right on the bidder for the withdrawal of his bid after it has been opened.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Payment of bid price. All payments for property sold under this section shall be made by cash or by a certified, cashier's, or treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the United States or under the laws of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or by a U.S. postal, bank, express, or telegraph money order. If payment in full is required upon acceptance of the highest bid, the payment shall be made at such time. If deferred payment is permitted, the initial payment shall be made upon acceptance of the bid, and the balance shall be paid on or before the date fixed for payment thereof. Any remittance submitted with a successful sealed bid shall be applied toward the purchase price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Delivery and removal of personal property. Responsibility of the United States for the protection or preservation of seized personal property shall cease immediately upon acceptance of the highest bid. The risk of loss is on the purchaser of personal property upon acceptance of his bid. Possession of any personal property shall not be delivered to the purchaser until the purchase price has been paid in full. If payment of part of the purchase price for personal property is deferred, the United States will retain possession of such property as security for the payment of the balance of the purchase price and, as agent for the purchaser, will cause the property to be cared for until the purchase price has been paid in full or the sale is declared null and void for failure to make full payment of the purchase price. In such case, all charges and expenses incurred in caring for the property after the acceptance of the bid shall be borne by the purchaser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Default in payment. If payment in full is required upon acceptance of the bid and is not then and there paid, the internal revenue officer conducting the sale shall forthwith proceed again to sell the property in the manner provided in section 6335(e) and this section. If the conditions of the sale permit part of the payment to be deferred, and if such part is not paid within the prescribed period, suit may be instituted against the purchaser for the purchase price or such part thereof as has not been paid, together with interest at the rate of 6 percent per annum from the date of the sale; or, in the discretion of the district director, the sale may be declared by the district director to be null and void for failure to make full payment of the purchase price and the property may again be advertised and sold as provided in subsections (b), (c), and (e) of section 6335 and this section. In the event of such readvertisement and sale, any new purchaser shall receive such property or rights to property free and clear of any claim or right of the former defaulting purchaser, of any nature whatsoever, and the amount paid upon the bid price by such defaulting purchaser shall be forfeited to the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Stay of sale of seized property pending Tax Court decision. For restrictions on sale of seized property pending Tax Court decision, see section 6863(b)(3) and Sec. 301.6863-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Right to request the sale of seized property--(1) In general. The owner of any property seized by levy may request that the district director sell such property within 60 days after such request, or within any longer period

specified by the owner. The district director must comply with such a request unless the district director determines that compliance with the request is not in the best interests of the Internal Revenue Service and notifies the owner of such determination within the 60 day period, or any longer period specified by the owner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The owner of any property seized by levy may request that the district director sell such property within 60 days after such request, or within any longer period

specified by the owner. The district director must comply with such a request unless the district director determines that compliance with the request is not in the best interests of the Internal Revenue Service and notifies the owner of such determination within the 60 day period, or any longer period specified by the owner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Procedures to request the sale of seized property--(i) Manner. A request for the sale of seized property shall be made in writing to the group manager of the revenue officer whose signature is on Levy Form 668-B. If the owner does not know the group manager's name or address, the owner may send the request to the revenue officer, marked for the attention of his or her group manager.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Manner. A request for the sale of seized property shall be made in writing to the group manager of the revenue officer whose signature is on Levy Form 668-B. If the owner does not know the group manager's name or address, the owner may send the request to the revenue officer, marked for the attention of his or her group manager.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Form. The request for sale of seized property within 60 days, or such longer period specified by the owner, shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name, current address, current home and work telephone numbers and any convenient times to be contacted, and taxpayer identification number of the owner making the request;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A description of the seized property that is the subject of the request;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A copy of the notice of seizure, if available;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The period within which the owner is requesting that the property be sold; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The signature of the owner or duly authorized representative. For purposes of these regulations, a duly authorized representative is any attorney, certified public accountant, enrolled actuary, or any other person permitted to represent the owner before the Internal Revenue Service who is not disbarred or suspended from practice before the Internal Revenue Service and who has written power of attorney executed by the owner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Notification to owner. The group manager shall respond in writing to a request for sale of seized property as soon as practicable after receipt of such request and in no event later than 60 days after receipt of the request, or, if later, the date specified by the owner for the sale.
