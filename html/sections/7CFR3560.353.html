                            <p class="depth0">Generally, the Agency will provide the borrower prior notice of an on-site monitoring review and will conduct the on-site monitoring review in the presence of the borrower. However, the Agency may visit a housing project, without prior notice, to observe physical conditions, operations and management activities, or other borrower or tenant activities. In addition, the Agency may conduct on-site reviews without the presence of the borrower, the management agent, or other designated representative of the borrower.</p>
