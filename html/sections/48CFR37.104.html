                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A personal services contract is characterized by the employer- employee relationship it creates between the Government and the  contractor's personnel. The Government is normally required to obtain  its employees by direct hire under competitive appointment or other  procedures required by the civil service laws. Obtaining personal  services by contract, rather than by direct hire, circumvents those laws  unless Congress has specifically authorized acquisition of the services  by contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agencies shall not award personal services contracts unless  specifically authorized by statute (e.g., 5 U.S.C. 3109) to do so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An employer-employee relationship under a service contract  occurs when, as a result of (i) the contract's terms or (ii) the manner  of its administration during performance, contractor personnel are  subject to the relatively continuous supervision and control of a  Government officer or employee. However, giving an order for a specific  article or service, with the right to reject the finished product or  result, is not the type of supervision or control that converts an  individual who is an independent contractor (such as a contractor  employee) into a Government employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each contract arrangement must be judged in the light of its own  facts and circumstances, the key question always being: Will the  Government exercise relatively continuous supervision and control over  the contractor personnel performing the contract? The sporadic,  unauthorized supervision of only one of a large number of contractor  employees might reasonably be considered not relevant, while relatively  continuous Government supervision of a substantial number of contractor  employees would have to be taken strongly into account (see (d) below).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The following descriptive elements should be used as a guide in  assessing whether or not a proposed contract is personal in nature:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Performance on site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Principal tools and equipment furnished by the Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Services are applied directly to the integral effort of agencies  or an organizational subpart in furtherance of assigned function or  mission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Comparable services, meeting comparable needs, are performed in  the same or similar agencies using civil service personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The need for the type of service provided can reasonably be  expected to last beyond one year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The inherent nature of the service, or the manner in which it is  provided reasonably requires directly or indirectly, Government  direction or supervision of contractor employees in order to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Adequately protect the Government's interest;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Retain control of the function involved; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Retain full personal responsibility for the function supported  in a duly authorized Federal officer or employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When specific statutory authority for a personal service  contract is cited, obtain the review and opinion of legal counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Personal services contracts for the services of individual  experts or consultants are limited by the Classification Act. In  addition, the Office of Personnel Management has established  requirements which apply in acquiring the personal services of experts  or consultants in this manner (e.g., benefits, taxes, conflicts of  interest). Therefore,   the contracting officer shall effect necessary coordination with the  cognizant civilian personnel office.  [48 FR 42365, Sept. 19, 2001, as amended at 66 FR 2133, Jan. 10, 2001]</p>
