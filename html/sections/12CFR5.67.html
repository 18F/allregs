                            <p class="depth0">To avoid complicated recordkeeping in connection with fractional shares, a national bank issuing additional stock by stock dividend, upon consolidation or merger, or otherwise, may adopt arrangements such as the following to preclude the issuance of fractional shares. The bank may:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Issue scripts or warrants for trading;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Make reasonable arrangements to provide those to whom fractional shares would otherwise be issued an opportunity to realize at a fair price upon the fraction not being issued through its sale, or the purchase of the additional fraction required for a full share, if there is an established and active market in the national bank's stock;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Remit the cash equivalent of the fraction not being issued to those to whom fractional shares would otherwise be issued. The cash equivalent is based on the market value of the stock, if there is an established and active market in the national bank's stock. In the absence of such a market, the cash equivalent is based on a reliable and disinterested determination as to the fair market value of the stock if such stock is available; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Sell full shares representing all the fractions at public auction, or to the highest bidder after having solicited and received sealed bids from at least three licensed stock brokers. The national bank shall distribute the proceeds of the sale pro rata to shareholders who otherwise would be entitled to the fractional shares.</p>
