The owner may  remove the beneficiary's name from the registration with the consent of  the beneficiary. The transaction will not be conducted through the  registered owner's TreasuryDirect account. The bond will be changed to  the single owner form of registration. Once the transaction is  completed, the bond will be treated as a bond originally issued as a  book-entry bond in TreasuryDirect, and will be subject to subpart C of  this part. The owner may then perform any transaction available for  book-entry bonds purchased in the TreasuryDirect system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Transfer to the beneficiary or a third party with a change in  registration.

The bond may be  transferred without the consent of the non-converting coowner, and will  retain the coowner registration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Remove a coowner from the registration. The converting coowner  (or the non-converting coowner, if the bond has been previously  transferred to the account of the non-converting coowner) may remove the  other coowner from the registration. The consent of the other coowner is  required. The bond must reside in the account of the coowner who is  requesting the transaction. The transaction will not be conducted  through the registered owner's TreasuryDirect account. The bond's  registration will be changed to the single owner form of registration.  Once this transaction is completed, the bond will be treated as a bond  originally issued as a book-entry bond in TreasuryDirect, and will be  subject to subpart C of this part. The owner may then perform any  transaction available for book-entry bonds purchased in the  TreasuryDirect system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Transfer to non-converting coowner or a third party with a  change in registration.
