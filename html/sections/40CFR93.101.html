These areas are  not isolated rural nonattainment and maintenance areas.</p><p class="depth0">EPA means the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p class="depth0">FHWA means the Federal Highway Administration of DOT.</p><p class="depth0">FHWA/FTA project, for the purpose of this subpart, is any highway or  transit project which is proposed to receive funding assistance and  approval through the Federal-Aid Highway program or the Federal mass  transit program, or requires Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) or  Federal Transit Administration (FTA) approval for some aspect of the  project, such as connection to an interstate highway or deviation from  applicable design standards on the interstate system.</p><p class="depth0">Forecast period with respect to a transportation plan is the period  covered by the transportation plan pursuant to 23 CFR part 450.</p><p class="depth0">FTA means the Federal Transit Administration of DOT.</p><p class="depth0">Highway project is an undertaking to implement or modify a highway  facility or highway-related program. Such an undertaking consists of all  required phases necessary for implementation. For analytical purposes,  it must be defined sufficiently to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Connect logical termini and be of sufficient length to address  environmental matters on a broad scope;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Have independent utility or significance, i.e., be usable and be  a reasonable expenditure even if no additional transportation  improvements in the area are made; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Not restrict consideration of alternatives for other reasonably  foreseeable transportation improvements.</p><p class="depth0">Horizon year is a year for which the transportation plan describes  the envisioned transportation system according to Sec. 93.106.</p><p class="depth0">Hot-spot analysis is an estimation of likely future localized CO,  PM10, and/or PM2.5 pollutant concentrations and a  comparison of those concentrations to the national ambient air quality  standards. Hot-spot analysis assesses impacts on a scale smaller than  the entire nonattainment or maintenance area, including, for example,  congested roadway intersections and highways or   transit terminals, and uses an air quality dispersion model to determine  the effects of emissions on air quality.</p><p class="depth0">Increase the frequency or severity means to cause a location or  region to exceed a standard more often or to cause a violation at a  greater concentration than previously existed and/or would otherwise  exist during the future period in question, if the project were not  implemented.</p><p class="depth0">Isolated rural nonattainment and maintenance areas are areas that do  not contain or are not part of any metropolitan planning area as  designated under the transportation planning regulations. Isolated rural  areas do not have Federally required metropolitan transportation plans  or TIPs and do not have projects that are part of the emissions analysis  of any MPO's metropolitan transportation plan or TIP. Projects in such  areas are instead included in statewide transportation improvement  programs. These areas are not donut areas.</p><p class="depth0">Lapse means that the conformity determination for a transportation  plan or TIP has expired, and thus there is no currently conforming  transportation plan and TIP.</p><p class="depth0">Limited maintenance plan is a maintenance plan that EPA has  determined meets EPA's limited maintenance plan policy criteria for a  given NAAQS and pollutant. To qualify for a limited maintenance plan,  for example, an area must have a design value that is significantly  below a given NAAQS, and it must be reasonable to expect that a NAAQS  violation will not result from any level of future motor vehicle  emissions growth.</p><p class="depth0">Maintenance area means any geographic region of the United States  previously designated nonattainment pursuant to the CAA Amendments of  1990 and subsequently redesignated to attainment subject to the  requirement to develop a maintenance plan under section 175A of the CAA,  as amended.</p><p class="depth0">Maintenance plan means an implementation plan under section 175A of  the CAA, as amended.</p><p class="depth0">Metropolitan planning organization (MPO) means the policy board of  an organization created as a result of the designation process in 23  U.S.C. 134(d).</p><p class="depth0">Milestone has the meaning given in CAA sections 182(g)(1) and 189(c)  for serious and above ozone nonattainment areas and PM10  nonattainment areas, respectively. For all other nonattainment areas, a  milestone consists of an emissions level and the date on which that  level is to be achieved as required by the applicable CAA provision for  reasonable further progress towards attainment.</p><p class="depth0">Motor vehicle emissions budget is that portion of the total  allowable emissions defined in the submitted or approved control  strategy implementation plan revision or maintenance plan for a certain  date for the purpose of meeting reasonable further progress milestones  or demonstrating attainment or maintenance of the NAAQS, for any  criteria pollutant or its precursors, allocated to highway and transit  vehicle use and emissions.</p><p class="depth0">National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) are those standards  established pursuant to section 109 of the CAA.</p><p class="depth0">NEPA means the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended  (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).</p><p class="depth0">NEPA process completion, for the purposes of this subpart, with  respect to FHWA or FTA, means the point at which there is a specific  action to make a determination that a project is categorically excluded,  to make a Finding of No Significant Impact, or to issue a record of  decision on a Final Environmental Impact Statement under NEPA.</p><p class="depth0">Nonattainment area means any geographic region of the United States  which has been designated as nonattainment under section 107 of the CAA  for any pollutant for which a national ambient air quality standard  exists.</p><p class="depth0">Project means a highway project or transit project.</p><p class="depth0">Protective finding means a determination by EPA that a submitted  control strategy implementation plan revision contains adopted control  measures or written commitments to adopt enforceable control measures  that fully satisfy the emissions reductions requirements relevant to the  statutory provision for   which the implementation plan revision was submitted, such as reasonable  further progress or attainment.</p><p class="depth0">Recipient of funds designated under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal  Transit Laws means any agency at any level of State, county, city, or  regional government that routinely receives title 23 U.S.C. or Federal  Transit Laws funds to construct FHWA/FTA projects, operate FHWA/FTA  projects or equipment, purchase equipment, or undertake other services  or operations via contracts or agreements. This definition does not  include private landowners or developers, or contractors or entities  that are only paid for services or products created by their own  employees.</p><p class="depth0">Regionally significant project means a transportation project (other  than an exempt project) that is on a facility which serves regional  transportation needs (such as access to and from the area outside of the  region, major activity centers in the region, major planned developments  such as new retail malls, sports complexes, etc., or transportation  terminals as well as most terminals themselves) and would normally be  included in the modeling of a metropolitan area's transportation  network, including at a minimum all principal arterial highways and all  fixed guideway transit facilities that offer an alternative to regional  highway travel.</p><p class="depth0">Safety margin means the amount by which the total projected  emissions from all sources of a given pollutant are less than the total  emissions that would satisfy the applicable requirement for reasonable  further progress, attainment, or maintenance.</p><p class="depth0">Standard means a national ambient air quality standard.</p><p class="depth0">Transit is mass transportation by bus, rail, or other conveyance  which provides general or special service to the public on a regular and  continuing basis. It does not include school buses or charter or  sightseeing services.</p><p class="depth0">Transit project is an undertaking to implement or modify a transit  facility or transit-related program; purchase transit vehicles or  equipment; or provide financial assistance for transit operations. It  does not include actions that are solely within the jurisdiction of  local transit agencies, such as changes in routes, schedules, or fares.  It may consist of several phases. For analytical purposes, it must be  defined inclusively enough to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Connect logical termini and be of sufficient length to address  environmental matters on a broad scope;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Have independent utility or independent significance, i.e., be a  reasonable expenditure even if no additional transportation improvements  in the area are made; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Not restrict consideration of alternatives for other reasonably  foreseeable transportation improvements.</p><p class="depth2">Transportation control measure (TCM) is any measure that is  specifically identified and committed to in the applicable  implementation plan, including a substitute or additional TCM that is  incorporated into the applicable SIP through the process established in  CAA section 176(c)(8), that is either one of the types listed in CAA  section 108, or any other measure for the purpose of reducing emissions  or concentrations of air pollutants from transportation sources by  reducing vehicle use or changing traffic flow or congestion conditions.  Notwithstanding the first sentence of this definition, vehicle  technology-based, fuel-based, and maintenance-based measures which  control the emissions from vehicles under fixed traffic conditions are  not TCMs for the purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2">Transportation improvement program (TIP) means a transportation  improvement program developed by a metropolitan planning organization  under 23 U.S.C. 134(j).</p><p class="depth2">Transportation plan means the official intermodal metropolitan  transportation plan that is developed through the metropolitan planning  process for the metropolitan planning area, developed pursuant to 23 CFR  part 450.</p><p class="depth2">Transportation project is a highway project or a transit project.</p><p class="depth2">Written commitment for the purposes of this subpart means a written  commitment that includes a description of the action to be taken; a  schedule for the completion of the action; a demonstration that funding  necessary to implement the action has been authorized by the  appropriating or authorizing body; and an acknowledgment that the  commitment is an enforceable   obligation under the applicable implementation plan.
