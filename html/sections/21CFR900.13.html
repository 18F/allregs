If a  facility's accreditation is revoked by an accreditation body, the agency  may conduct an investigation into the reasons for the revocation.  Following such investigation, the agency may determine that the  facility's certificate shall no longer be in effect or the agency may  take whatever other action or combination of actions will best protect  the public health, including the establishment and implementation of a  corrective plan of action that will permit the certificate to continue  in effect while the facility seeks reaccreditation.
