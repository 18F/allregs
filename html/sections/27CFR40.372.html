                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(a)(2) imposes a special tax of $1,000 per year on every manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reduced rate for small proprietors. Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(b) provides for a reduced rate of $500 per year with respect to any manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes whose gross receipts (for the most recent taxable year ending before the first day of the taxable period to which the special tax imposed by Sec. 40.371 relates) are less than $500,000. The ``taxable year'' to be used for determining gross receipts is the taxpayer's income tax year. All gross receipts of the taxpayer shall be included, not just the gross receipts of the business subject to special tax. Proprietors of new businesses that have not yet begun a taxable year, as well as proprietors of existing businesses that have not yet ended a taxable year, who commence a new activity subject to special tax, qualify for the reduced special (occupational) tax rate, unless the business is a member of a ``controlled group''; in that case the rules of paragraph (c) of this section shall apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Controlled group. All persons treated as one taxpayer under 26 U.S.C. 5061(e)(3) shall be treated as one taxpayer for the purpose of determining gross receipts under paragraph (b) of this section. ``Controlled group'' means a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563 and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4. Also, the rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Short taxable year. Gross receipts for any taxable year of less than 12 months shall be annualized by multiplying the gross receipts for the short period by 12 and dividing the result by the number of months in the short period as required by 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Returns and allowances. Gross receipts for any taxable year shall be reduced by returns and allowances made during such year under 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).
