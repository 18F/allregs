                            <p class="depth0">Under the Act as amended in 1966, an employer may have some employees subject to its minimum wages, maximum hours, overtime pay, equal pay, or child labor provisions who would be covered by such provisions under the prior law even if the amendments had not been enacted, and other employees whose coverage under such provisions was provided for the first time by the 1966 amendments. As explained in subparts B and C such provisions of the amended Act may apply to an employee by reason of the activities in which he is individually engaged, or because he is employed in an enterprise whose activities satisfy the conditions prescribed in the law prior to the amendments. On the other hand, such provisions of the amended Act may apply to an employee solely because he is employed in an enterprise whose activities satisfy only the conditions provided in the Act as it was amended in 1966. Previously covered employment in retail and service enterprise is subject to different monetary standards than newly covered employment in such enterprises until February 1, 1971. On and after that date, every such employee subject to the minimum wage provisions will be entitled to not less than $1.60 an hour. However, beginning February 1, 1969, every such employee subject to the overtime provisions is entitled to overtime pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek at a rate not less than one and one-half times his regular rate of pay. During the period for which different minimum wage provisions were made applicable, beginning with the effective date of the 1966 amendments on February 1, 1967, and ending on January 31, 1971, a lower minimum wage rate is authorized for employees in employment brought under the minimum wage provisions of the Act for the first time by the amendments than for those subject to the minimum wage provisions under the prior Act. Also, in the period beginning with the effective date of the amendments and ending on January 31, 1969, employees in employment brought under the overtime pay provisions for the first time by the amendments could be employed for a longer workweek without overtime pay, as specified in the Act. Accordingly, employers who do not wish to pay aIl covered employees for employment during such periods the minimum wages and overtime pay required for employment covered under the prior provisions will need to identify those employees who are covered under the prior provisions and those who are covered under the new provisions when wages are computed and paid under the Act.</p>
