                            <p class="depth0">A State Medicaid agency must screen all initial applications,  including applications for a new practice location, and any applications  received in response to a re-enrollment or revalidation of enrollment  request based on a categorical risk level of ``limited,'' ``moderate,''  or ``high.'' If a provider could fit within more than one risk level  described in this section, the highest level of screening is applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Screening for providers designated as limited categorical risk.  When the State Medicaid agency designates a provider as a limited  categorical risk, the State Medicaid agency must do all of the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Verify that a provider meets any applicable Federal regulations,  or State requirements for the provider type prior to making an  enrollment determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conduct license verifications, including State licensure  verifications in States other than where the provider is enrolling, in  accordance with Sec.  455.412.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Conduct database checks on a pre- and post-enrollment basis to  ensure that providers continue to meet the enrollment criteria for their  provider type, in accordance with Sec.  455.436.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Screening for providers designated as moderate categorical risk.  When the State Medicaid agency designates a provider as a ``moderate''  categorical risk, a State Medicaid agency must do both of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Perform the ``limited'' screening requirements described in  paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conduct on-site visits in accordance with Sec.  455.432.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Screening for providers designated as high categorical risk.  When the State Medicaid agency designates a provider as a ``high''  categorical risk, a State Medicaid agency must do both of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Perform the ``limited'' and ``moderate'' screening requirements  described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Conduct a criminal background check; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Require the submission of a set of fingerprints in accordance  with Sec.  455.434.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Denial or termination of enrollment. A provider, or any person  with 5 percent or greater direct or indirect ownership in the provider,  who is required by the State Medicaid agency or CMS to submit a set of  fingerprints and fails to do so may have its--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Application denied under Sec.  455.434; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Enrollment terminated under Sec.  455.416.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Adjustment of risk level. The State agency must adjust the  categorical risk level from ``limited'' or ``moderate'' to ``high'' when  any of the following occurs:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State Medicaid agency imposes a payment suspension on a  provider based on credible allegation of fraud, waste or abuse, the  provider has an existing Medicaid overpayment, or the provider has been  excluded by the OIG or another State's Medicaid program within the  previous 10 years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State Medicaid agency or CMS in the previous 6 months lifted  a temporary moratorium for the particular provider type and a provider  that was prevented from enrolling based on the moratorium applies for  enrollment as a provider at any time within 6 months from the date the  moratorium was lifted.</p>
