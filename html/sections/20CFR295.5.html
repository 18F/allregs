Payment will not be made to the heirs, legatees, creditors  or assignees of a spouse or former spouse, except that where an amount  is payable to a spouse or former spouse pursuant to this part, but is  unpaid at the death of that spouse or former spouse, the unpaid amount  may be paid in accordance with Sec. 234.1 of this chapter, pertaining  to employee annuities unpaid at death.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Net amount of benefits.

Conflicting decrees or property settlements received on  the same day shall be accorded priority based upon the earliest date  upon which the decree or property settlement became final.
