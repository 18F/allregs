                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Risk-weighted assets. Risk-weighted assets equal risk-weighted on-balance sheet assets (computed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section), plus risk-weighted off-balance sheet activities (computed under paragraph (a)(2) of this section), plus risk-weighted recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, and certain other positions (computed under paragraph (b) of this section).

Assets representing an indirect holding of a pool of assets, e.g., mutual funds, are assigned to risk-weight categories under this section based upon the risk weight that would be assigned to the assets in the portfolio of the pool. An investment in shares of a mutual fund whose portfolio consists primarily of various securities or money market instruments that, if held separately, would be assigned to different risk-weight categories, generally is assigned to the risk-weight category appropriate to the highest risk-weighted asset that the fund is permitted to hold in accordance with the investment objectives set forth in its prospectus. The savings association may, at its option, assign the investment on a pro rata basis to different risk-weight categories according to the investment limits in its prospectus. In no case will an investment in shares in any such fund be assigned to a total risk weight less than 20 percent. If the savings association chooses to assign investments on a pro rata basis, and the sum of the investment limits of assets in the fund's prospectus exceeds 100 percent, the savings association must assign the highest pro rata amounts of its total investment to the higher risk categories. If, in order to maintain a necessary degree of short-term liquidity, a fund is permitted to hold an insignificant amount of its assets in short-term, highly liquid securities of superior credit quality that do not qualify for a preferential risk weight, such securities will generally be disregarded in determining the risk-weight category into which the savings association's holding in the overall fund should be assigned. The prudent use of hedging instruments by a mutual fund to reduce the risk of its assets will not increase the risk weighting of the mutual fund investment. For example, the use of hedging instruments by a mutual fund to reduce the interest rate risk of its government bond portfolio will not increase the risk weight of that fund above the 20 percent category. Nonetheless, if the fund engages in any activities that appear speculative in nature or has any other characteristics

that are inconsistent with the preferential risk-weighting assigned to the fund's assets, holdings in the fund will be assigned to the 100 percent risk-weight category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Off-balance sheet items. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, risk-weighted off-balance sheet items are determined by the following two-step process. First, the face amount of the off-balance sheet item must be multiplied by the appropriate credit conversion factor listed in this paragraph (a)(2). This calculation translates the face amount of an off-balance sheet exposure into an on-balance sheet credit-equivalent amount. Second, the credit-equivalent amount must be assigned to the appropriate risk-weight category using the criteria regarding obligors, guarantors, and collateral listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, provided that the maximum risk weight assigned to the credit-equivalent amount of an interest-rate or exchange-rate contract is 50 percent. The following are the credit conversion factors and the off-balance sheet items to which they apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 100 percent credit conversion factor (Group A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Risk participations purchased in bankers' acceptances;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Forward agreements and other contingent obligations with a certain draw down, e.g., legally binding agreements to purchase assets at a specified future date. On the date an institution enters into a forward agreement or similar obligation, it should convert the principal amount of the assets to be purchased at 100 percent as of that date and then assign this amount to the risk-weight category appropriate to the obligor or guarantor of the item, or the nature of the collateral;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Indemnification of customers whose securities the savings association has lent as agent. If the customer is not indemnified against loss by the savings association, the transaction is excluded from the risk-based capital calculation. When a savings association lends its own securities, the transaction is treated as a loan. When a savings association lends its own securities or is acting as agent, agrees to indemnify a customer, the transaction is assigned to the risk weight appropriate to the obligor or collateral that is delivered to the lending or indemnifying institution or to an independent custodian acting on their behalf.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 50 percent credit conversion factor (Group B). (A) Transaction-related contingencies, including, among other things, performance bonds and performance-based standby letters of credit related to a particular transaction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Transaction-related contingencies, including, among other things, performance bonds and performance-based standby letters of credit related to a particular transaction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Unused portions of commitments (including home equity lines of credit and eligible ABCP liquidity facilities) with an original maturity exceeding one year except those listed in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section. For eligible ABCP liquidity facilities, the resulting credit equivalent amount is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the assets to be funded by the liquidity facility based on the assets or the obligor, after considering any collateral or guarantees, or external credit ratings under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, if applicable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Revolving underwriting facilities, note issuance facilities, and similar arrangements pursuant to which the savings association's customer can issue short-term debt obligations in its own name, but for which the savings association has a legally binding commitment to either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Purchase the obligations the customer is unable to sell by a stated date; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Advance funds to its customer, if the obligations cannot be sold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 20 percent credit conversion factor (Group C).

A commercial letter of credit is an example of such an instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> 10 percent credit conversion factor (Group D). Unused portions of eligible ABCP liquidity facilities with an original maturity of one year or less. The resulting credit equivalent amount is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the assets to be funded by the liquidity facility based on the assets or

the obligor, after considering any collateral or guarantees, or external credit ratings under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, if applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Zero percent credit conversion factor (Group E). (A) Unused portions of commitments with an original maturity of one year or less, except for eligible ABCP liquidity facilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Unused portions of commitments with an original maturity of one year or less, except for eligible ABCP liquidity facilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Unused commitments with an original maturity greater than one year, if they are unconditionally cancelable at any time at the option of the savings association and the savings association has the contractual right to make, and in fact does make, either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A separate credit decision based upon the borrower's current financial condition before each drawing under the lending facility; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An annual (or more frequent) credit review based upon the borrower's current financial condition to determine whether or not the lending facility should be continued; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The unused portion of retail credit card lines or other related plans that are unconditionally cancelable by the savings association in accordance with applicable law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Off-balance sheet contracts; interest-rate and foreign exchange rate contracts (Group F)--(A) Calculation of credit equivalent amounts. The credit equivalent amount of an off-balance sheet interest rate or foreign exchange rate contract that is not subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(vi)(B) of this section is equal to the sum of the current credit exposure, i.e., the replacement cost of the contract, and the potential future credit exposure of the off-balance sheet rate contract. The calculation of credit equivalent amounts is measured in U.S. dollars, regardless of the currency or currencies specified in the off-balance sheet rate contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Current credit exposure. The current credit exposure of an off-balance sheet rate contract is determined by the mark-to-market value of the contract. If the mark-to-market value is positive, then the current credit exposure equals that mark-to-market value. If the mark-to-market value is zero or negative, then the current exposure is zero. In determining its current credit exposure for multiple off-balance sheet rate contracts executed with a single counterparty, a Federal savings association may net positive and negative mark-to-market values of off-balance sheet rate contracts if subject to a bilateral netting contract as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(vi)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Potential future credit exposure. The potential future credit exposure of an off-balance sheet rate contract, including a contract with a negative mark-to-market value, is estimated by multiplying the notional principal \8\ by a credit conversion factor. Federal savings associations, subject to examiner review, should use the effective rather than the apparent or stated notional amount in this calculation. The conversion factors are: \9\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\8\ For purposes of calculating potential future credit exposure for foreign exchange contracts and other similar contracts, in which notional principal is equivalent to cash flows, total notional principal is defined as the net receipts to each party falling due on each value date in each currency.</p><p class="depth0">\9\ No potential future credit exposure is calculated for single currency interest rate swaps in which payments are made based upon two floating rate indices, so-called floating/floating or basis swaps; the credit equivalent amount is measured solely on the basis of the current credit exposure.

In determining its current credit exposure for multiple off-balance sheet rate contracts executed with a single

counterparty, a Federal savings association may net off-balance sheet rate contracts subject to a bilateral netting contract by offsetting positive and negative mark-to-market values, provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The bilateral netting contract is in writing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The bilateral netting contract creates a single legal obligation for all individual off-balance sheet rate contracts covered by the bilateral netting contract. In effect, the bilateral netting contract provides that the savings association has a single claim or obligation either to receive or pay only the net amount of the sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values on the individual off-balance sheet rate contracts covered by the bilateral netting contract. The single legal obligation for the net amount is operative in the event that a counterparty, or a counterparty to whom the bilateral netting contract has been validly assigned, fails to perform due to any of the following events: default, insolvency, bankruptcy, or other similar circumstances;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Federal savings association obtains a written and reasoned legal opinion(s) representing, with a high degree of certainty, that in the event of a legal challenge, including one resulting from default, insolvency, bankruptcy or similar circumstances, the relevant court and administrative authorities would find the savings association's exposure to be the net amount under:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered or the equivalent location in the case of noncorporate entities, and if a branch of the counterparty is involved, then also under the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The law that governs the individual off-balance sheet rate contracts covered by the bilateral netting contract; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The law that governs the bilateral netting contract;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The savings association establishes and maintains procedures to monitor possible changes in relevant law and to ensure that the bilateral netting contract continues to satisfy the requirements of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The savings association maintains in its files documentation adequate to support the netting of an off-balance sheet rate contract.\10\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\10\ By netting individual off-balance sheet rate contracts for the purpose of calculating its credit equivalent amount, a Federal savings association represents that documentation adequate to support the netting of an off-balance sheet rate contract is in the savings association's files and available for inspection by the OCC. Upon determination by the OCC that a Federal savings association's files are inadequate or that a bilateral netting contract may not be legally enforceable under any one of the bodies of law described in paragraphs (a)(2)(vi)(B)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section, the underlying individual off-balance sheet rate contracts may not be netted for the purposes of this section.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Walkaway clause. A bilateral netting contract that contains a walkaway clause is not eligible for netting for purposes of calculating the current credit exposure amount. The term ``walkaway clause'' means a provision in a bilateral netting contract that permits a nondefaulting counterparty to make a lower payment than it would make otherwise under the bilateral netting contract, or no payment at all, to a defaulter or the estate of a defaulter, even if the defaulter or the estate of the defaulter is a net creditor under the bilateral netting contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Risk weighting. Once the savings association determines the credit equivalent amount for an off-balance sheet rate contract, that amount is assigned to the risk-weight category appropriate to the counterparty, or, if relevant, to the nature of any collateral or guarantee. Collateral held against a netting contract is not recognized for capital purposes unless it is legally available for all contracts included in the netting contract. However, the maximum risk weight for the credit equivalent amount of such off-balance sheet rate contracts is 50 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Exceptions. The following off-balance sheet rate contracts are not subject to the above calculation, and therefore, are not part of the denominator of a Federal savings association's risk-based capital ratio:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A foreign exchange rate contract with an original maturity of 14 calendar days or less; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any interest rate or foreign exchange rate contract that is traded on an exchange requiring the daily payment of any variations in the market value of the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a Federal savings association has multiple overlapping exposures (such as a program-wide credit enhancement and a liquidity facility) to an ABCP program that is not consolidated for risk-based capital purposes, the savings association is not required to hold duplicative risk-based capital under this part against the overlapping position. Instead, the savings association should apply to the overlapping position the applicable risk-based capital treatment that results in the highest capital charge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, and certain other positions--(1) In general. Except as otherwise permitted in this paragraph (b), to determine the risk-weighted asset amount for a recourse obligation or a direct credit substitute (but not a residual interest):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise permitted in this paragraph (b), to determine the risk-weighted asset amount for a recourse obligation or a direct credit substitute (but not a residual interest):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Multiply the full amount of the credit-enhanced assets for which the savings association directly or indirectly retains or assumes credit risk by a 100 percent conversion factor. (For a direct credit substitute that is an on-balance sheet asset (e.g., a purchased subordinated security), a Federal savings association must use the amount of the direct credit substitute and the full amount of the asset its supports, i.e., all the more senior positions in the structure); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assign this credit equivalent amount to the risk-weight category appropriate to the obligor in the underlying transaction, after considering any associated guarantees or collateral. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section lists the risk-weight categories.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Residual interests. Except as otherwise permitted under this paragraph (b), a Federal savings association must maintain risk-based capital for residual interests as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Credit-enhancing interest-only strips. After applying the concentration limit under Sec. 167.12(e)(2) of this part, a saving association must maintain risk-based capital for a credit-enhancing interest-only strip equal to the remaining amount of the strip (net of any existing associated deferred tax liability), even if the amount of risk-based capital that must be maintained exceeds the full risk-based capital requirement for the assets transferred. Transactions that, in substance, result in the retention of credit risk associated with a transferred credit-enhancing interest-only strip are treated as if the strip was retained by the savings association and was not transferred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other residual interests. A saving association must maintain risk-based capital for a residual interest (excluding a credit-enhancing interest-only strip) equal to the face amount of the residual interest (net of any existing associated deferred tax liability), even if the amount of risk-based capital that must be maintained exceeds the full risk-based capital requirement for the assets transferred. Transactions that, in substance, result in the retention of credit risk associated with a transferred residual interest are treated as if the residual interest was retained by the savings association and was not transferred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Residual interests and other recourse obligations. Where a Federal savings association holds a residual interest (including a credit-enhancing interest-only strip) and another recourse obligation in connection with the same transfer of assets, the savings association must maintain risk-based capital equal to the greater of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The risk-based capital requirement for the residual interest as calculated under paragraph (b)(2)(i) through (ii) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The full risk-based capital requirement for the assets transferred, subject to the low-level recourse rules under paragraph (b)(7) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ratings-based approach--(i) Calculation. A Federal savings association may calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for an eligible position described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section by multiplying the face amount of the position by the appropriate risk weight determined in accordance with Table A or B of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Stripped mortgage-backed securities or other similar instruments, such as interest-only and principal-only strips, that are not credit enhancing must be assigned to the 100% risk-weight category.</p><p class="depth0">Table A------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Risk weight</p><p class="depth0">Long term rating category                  (In percent)------------------------------------------------------------------------Highest or second highest investment grade..............              20Third highest investment grade..........................              50Lowest investment grade.................................             100One category below investment grade.....................             200------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Table B------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Risk weight</p><p class="depth0">Short term rating category                  (In percent)------------------------------------------------------------------------Highest investment grade................................              20Second highest investment grade.........................              50Lowest investment grade.................................             100------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Eligibility--(A) Traded positions. A position is eligible for the treatment described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The position is a recourse obligation, direct credit substitute, residual interest, or asset- or mortgage-backed security and is not a credit-enhancing interest-only strip;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The position is a traded position; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The NRSRO has rated a long term position as one grade below investment grade or better or a short term position as investment grade. If two or more NRSROs assign ratings to a traded position, the savings association must use the lowest rating to determine the appropriate risk-weight category under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Non-traded positions. A position that is not traded is eligible for the treatment described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The position is a recourse obligation, direct credit substitute, residual interest, or asset- or mortgage-backed security extended in connection with a securitization and is not a credit-enhancing interest-only strip;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> More than one NRSRO rate the position;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All of the NRSROs that provide a rating rate a long term position as one grade below investment grade or better or a short term position as investment grade.

If a recourse obligation, direct credit substitute, residual interest, or asset- or mortgage-backed security is not rated by an NRSRO, but is senior or preferred in all features to a traded position (including collateralization and maturity), the savings association may risk-weight the face amount of the senior position under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, based on the rating of the traded position, subject to supervisory guidance. The savings association must satisfy the OCC that this treatment is appropriate. This paragraph (b)(3)(i)(C) applies only if the traded position provides substantive credit support to the unrated position until the unrated position matures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Certain positions that are not rated by NRSROs--(i) Calculation. A Federal savings association may calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for eligible position described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section based on the savings association's determination of the credit rating of the position. To risk-weight the asset, the savings association must multiply the face amount of the position by the appropriate risk weight determined in accordance with Table C of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Table C------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Risk weight</p><p class="depth0">Rating category                       (In percent)------------------------------------------------------------------------Investment grade........................................             100One category below investment grade.....................             200------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Eligibility. A position extended in connection with a securitization is eligible for the treatment described in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section if it is not rated by an NRSRO, is not a residual interest, and meets the one of the three alternative standards described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A), (B), or (C) below of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Position rated internally. A direct credit substitute, but not a purchased credit-enhancing interest-only strip, is

eligible for the treatment described under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, if the position is assumed in connection with an asset-backed commercial paper program sponsored by the savings association. Before it may rely on an internal credit risk rating system, the saving association must demonstrate to the OCC's satisfaction that the system is adequate. Adequate internal credit risk rating systems typically:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Are an integral part of the savings association's risk management system that explicitly incorporates the full range of risks arising from the savings association's participation in securitization activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Link internal credit ratings to measurable outcomes, such as the probability that the position will experience any loss, the expected loss on the position in the event of default, and the degree of variance in losses in the event of default on that position;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Separately consider the risk associated with the underlying loans or borrowers, and the risk associated with the structure of the particular securitization transaction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Identify gradations of risk among ``pass'' assets and other risk positions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Use clear, explicit criteria to classify assets into each internal rating grade, including subjective factors;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Employ independent credit risk management or loan review personnel to assign or review the credit risk ratings;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Include an internal audit procedure to periodically verify that internal risk ratings are assigned in accordance with the savings association's established criteria;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Monitor the performance of the assigned internal credit risk ratings over time to determine the appropriateness of the initial credit risk rating assignment, and adjust individual credit risk ratings or the overall internal credit risk rating system, as needed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Make credit risk rating assumptions that are consistent with, or more conservative than, the credit risk rating assumptions and methodologies of NRSROs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Program ratings. (1) A recourse obligation or direct credit substitute, but not a residual interest, is eligible for the treatment described in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, if the position is retained or assumed in connection with a structured finance program and an NRSRO has reviewed the terms of the program and stated a rating for positions associated with the program. If the program has options for different combinations of assets, standards, internal or external credit enhancements and other relevant factors, and the NRSRO specifies ranges of rating categories to them, the savings association may apply the rating category applicable to the option that corresponds to the savings association's position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To rely on a program rating, the savings association must demonstrate to the OCC's satisfaction that the credit risk rating assigned to the program meets the same standards generally used by NRSROs for rating traded positions. The savings association must also demonstrate to the OCC's satisfaction that the criteria underlying the assignments for the program are satisfied by the particular position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a Federal savings association participates in a securitization sponsored by another party, the OCC may authorize the savings association to use this approach based on a program rating obtained by the sponsor of the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Computer program. A recourse obligation or direct credit substitute, but not a residual interest, is eligible for the treatment described in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, if the position is extended in connection with a structured financing program and the savings association uses an acceptable credit assessment computer program to determine the rating of the position. An NRSRO must have developed the computer program and the savings association must demonstrate to the OCC's satisfaction that the ratings under the program correspond credibly and reliably with the rating of traded positions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Alternative capital computation for small business obligations-- (i) Definitions. For the purposes of this paragraph (b)(5):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definitions. For the purposes of this paragraph (b)(5):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Qualified Federal savings association means a savings association that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is well capitalized as defined in Sec. 165.4 of this chapter without applying the capital treatment described in this paragraph (b)(5); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is adequately capitalized as defined in Sec. 165.4 of this chapter without applying the capital treatment described in this paragraph (b)(5) and has received written permission from the OCC to apply that capital treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Small business means a business that meets the criteria for a small business concern established by the Small Business Administration in 13 CFR 121 pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 632.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Capital requirement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (b), with respect to a transfer of a small business loan or lease of personal property with recourse that is a sale under GAAP, a qualified Federal savings association may elect to include only the amount of its recourse in its risk-weighted assets. To qualify for this election, the savings association must establish and maintain a reserve under GAAP sufficient to meet the reasonable estimated liability of the savings association under the recourse obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Aggregate amount of recourse. The total outstanding amount of recourse retained by a qualified Federal savings association with respect to transfers of small business loans and leases of personal property and included in the risk-weighted assets of the savings association as described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, may not exceed 15 percent of the association's total capital computed under Sec. 167.5(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Federal savings association that ceases to be a qualified Federal savings association or that exceeds aggregate limits. If a Federal savings association ceases to be a qualified savings association or exceeds the aggregate limit described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, the savings association may continue to apply the capital treatment described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section to transfers of small business loans and leases of personal property that occurred when the association was a qualified savings association and did not exceed the limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Prompt corrective action not affected. (A) A Federal savings association shall compute its capital without regard to this paragraph (b)(5) of this section for purposes of prompt corrective action (12 U.S.C. 1831o), unless the savings association is adequately or well capitalized without applying the capital treatment described in this paragraph (b)(5) and would be well capitalized after applying that capital treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A Federal savings association shall compute its capital without regard to this paragraph (b)(5) of this section for purposes of prompt corrective action (12 U.S.C. 1831o), unless the savings association is adequately or well capitalized without applying the capital treatment described in this paragraph (b)(5) and would be well capitalized after applying that capital treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A Federal savings association shall compute its capital requirement without regard to this paragraph (b)(5) for the purposes of applying 12 U.S.C. 1831o(g), regardless of the association's capital level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Risk participations and syndications of direct credit substitutes. A Federal savings association must calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for a risk participation in, or syndication of, a direct credit substitute as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a Federal savings association conveys a risk participation in a direct credit substitute, the savings association must convert the full amount of the assets that are supported by the direct credit substitute to a credit equivalent amount using a 100 percent conversion factor. The savings association must assign the pro rata share of the credit equivalent amount that was conveyed through the risk participation to the lower of: The risk-weight category appropriate to the obligor in the underlying transaction, after considering any associated guarantees or collateral; or the risk-weight category appropriate to the party acquiring the participation. The savings association must assign the pro rata share of the credit equivalent amount that was not participated out to the risk-weight category appropriate to the obligor, after considering any associated guarantees or collateral.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a Federal savings association acquires a risk participation in a direct credit substitute, the savings association must multiply its pro rata share of the direct credit substitute by the full amount of the assets that are supported by the direct credit substitute, and convert this amount to a credit equivalent amount using a 100 percent conversion factor. The savings association must assign the resulting credit equivalent amount to the risk-weight category appropriate to the obligor in

the underlying transaction, after considering any associated guarantees or collateral.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the Federal savings association holds a direct credit substitute in the form of a syndication where each savings association or other participant is obligated only for its pro rata share of the risk and there is no recourse to the originating party, the savings association must calculate the credit equivalent amount by multiplying only its pro rata share of the assets supported by the direct credit substitute by a 100 percent conversion factor. The savings association must assign the resulting credit equivalent amount to the risk-weight category appropriate to the obligor in the underlying transaction after considering any associated guarantees or collateral.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Limitations on risk-based capital requirements--(i) Low-level exposure rule. If the maximum contractual exposure to loss retained or assumed by a Federal savings association is less than the effective risk-based capital requirement, as determined in accordance with this paragraph (b), for the assets supported by the savings association's position, the risk-based capital requirement is limited to the savings association's contractual exposure less any recourse liability account established in accordance with GAAP.

This limitation does not apply when a Federal savings association provides credit enhancement beyond any contractual obligation to support assets it has sold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Mortgage-related securities or participation certificates retained in a mortgage loan swap. If a Federal savings association holds a mortgage-related security or a participation certificate as a result of a mortgage loan swap with recourse, it must hold risk-based capital to support the recourse obligation and that percentage of the mortgage-related security or participation certificate that is not covered by the recourse obligation. The total amount of risk-based capital required for the security (or certificate) and the recourse obligation is limited to the risk-based capital requirement for the underlying loans, calculated as if the savings association continued to hold these loans as an on-balance sheet asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Related on-balance sheet assets. If an asset is included in the calculation of the risk-based capital requirement under this paragraph (b) and also appears as an asset on the savings association's balance sheet, the savings association must risk-weight the asset only under this paragraph (b), except in the case of loan servicing assets and similar arrangements with embedded recourse obligations or direct credit substitutes. In that case, the savings association must separately risk-weight the on-balance sheet servicing asset and the related recourse obligations and direct credit substitutes under this section, and incorporate these amounts into the risk-based capital calculation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Obligations of subsidiaries. If a Federal savings association retains a recourse obligation or assumes a direct credit substitute on the obligation of a subsidiary that is not an includable subsidiary, and the recourse obligation or direct credit substitute is an equity or debt investment in that subsidiary under GAAP, the face amount of the recourse obligation or direct credit substitute is deducted for capital under Secs. 167.5(a)(2) and 167.9(c). All other recourse obligations and direct credit substitutes retained or assumed by a Federal savings association on the obligations of an entity in which the savings association has an equity investment are risk-weighted in accordance with this paragraph (b).</p>
