This paragraph does not apply to test or research reactors exempted under Sec. 171.11(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> The FY 2014 annual fee for each operating power reactor which must be collected by September 30, 2014, is $5,223,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The FY 2014 annual fee for each operating power reactor which must be collected by September 30, 2014, is $5,223,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The FY 2014 annual fees are comprised of a base annual fee for power reactors licensed to operate, a base spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning annual fee, and associated additional charges (fee-relief adjustment). The activities comprising the spent storage/reactor decommissioning base annual fee are shown in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. The activities comprising the FY 2014 fee-relief adjustment are shown in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The activities comprising the FY 2014 base annual fee for operating power reactors are as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Power reactor safety and safeguards regulation except licensing and inspection activities recovered under part 170 of this chapter and generic reactor decommissioning activities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Research activities directly related to the regulation of power reactors, except those activities specifically related to reactor decommissioning.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Generic activities required largely for NRC to regulate power reactors (e.g., updating part 50 or 52 of this chapter, operating the Incident Response Center, new reactor regulatory infrastructure).

If the NRC's appropriations for these types of activities are greater than the budgeted resources for the activities included in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(1)(iii) of this section for a given FY, annual fees will be reduced.

This amount is calculated by dividing the total fee-relief adjustment costs allocated to this class by the total number of power reactor licenses, except those that permanently ceased operations and have no fuel onsite, and 10 CFR part 72 licensees who do not hold a 10 CFR part 50 license.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The FY 2014 annual fees for licensees authorized to operate a research or test (nonpower) reactor licensed under part 50 of this chapter, unless the reactor is exempted from fees under Sec. 171.11(a), are as follows:
