                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Inspection. All cut flowers imported into the United States must  be made available to an inspector for examination at the port of first  arrival and must remain at the port of first arrival until released, or  authorized further movement, by an inspector.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Actions to prevent the introduction of plant pests; notice by an  inspector. If an inspector orders any disinfection, cleaning, treatment,  reexportation, or other action with regard to imported cut flowers that  are found to be infested with injurious plant pests or infected with  diseases, the inspector will provide an emergency action notification  (PPQ Form 523) to the importer, owner, or agent or representative of the  importer or owner of the cut flowers. The importer, owner, or agent or  representative of the importer or owner must, within the time specified  in the PPQ Form 523 and at his or her own expense, destroy the cut  flowers, ship them to a point outside the United States, move them to an  authorized site, and/or apply treatments, clean, or apply other  safeguards to the cut flowers as prescribed by the inspector on the PPQ  Form 523. Further, if the importer, owner, or agent or representative of  the importer or owner fails to follow the conditions on PPQ Form 523 by  the time specified on the form, APHIS will arrange for destruction of  the cut flowers, and the importer, owner, or agent or representative of  the importer or owner will be responsible for all costs incurred. Cut  flowers that have been cleaned or treated must be made available for  further inspection, cleaning, and treatment at the option of the  inspector at any time and place indicated by the inspector before the  requirements of this subpart will have been met. Neither the Department  of Agriculture nor the inspector may be held responsible for any adverse  effects of treatment on imported cut flowers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Fumigation for agromyzids. Cut flowers imported from any country  or locality and found upon inspection to be infested with agromyzids  (insects of the family Agromyzidae) must be fumigated at the time of  importation with methyl bromide in accordance with part 305 of this  chapter, with the following exceptions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Fumigation will not be required for cut flowers imported from  Canada (including Labrador and Newfoundland) or Mexico because of the  finding of agromyzids.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fumigation will not be required for cut flowers of Chrysanthemum  spp. imported from Colombia or the Dominican Republic because of the  finding of agromyzids, when such agromyzids are identified by an  inspector to be only agromyzids of the species Liriomyza trifolii  (Burgess).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Chrysanthemum white rust hosts.

The detection of   chrysanthemum white rust in a shipment of cut flowers from a registered  production site upon arrival in the United States will result in the  prohibition of imports originating from the production site until such  time when APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country, can agree that  the eradication measures taken have been effective and that the pest  risk within the production site has been eliminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Irradiation. Cut flowers and foliage that are required under  this part to be treated or subjected to inspection to control one or  more of the plant pests for which irradiation is an approved treatment  under part 305 of this chapter may instead be treated with irradiation.  Irradiation treatment must be conducted in accordance with the  requirements of part 305 of this chapter. There is a possibility that  some cut flowers could be damaged by such irradiation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Refusal of entry. If an inspector finds that imported cut  flowers are so infested with a plant pest or infected with disease that,  in the judgment of the inspector, they cannot be cleaned or treated, or  if they contain soil or other prohibited contaminants, the entire lot  may be refused entry into the United States.
