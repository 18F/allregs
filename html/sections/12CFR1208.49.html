                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Request for administrative offset. Unless otherwise prohibited  by law, FHFA may request that monies that are due and payable to a  debtor from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund) be  offset administratively in reasonable amounts in order to collect in one  full payment or in a minimal number of payments debt owed to FHFA by the  debtor. Such requests shall be made to the appropriate officials of OPM  in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by FHFA or OPM.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents of certification. When making a request for  administrative offset under paragraph (a) of this section, FHFA shall  provide OPM with a written certification that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The debtor owes FHFA a debt, including the amount of the debt;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> FHFA has complied with the applicable statutes, regulations, and  procedures of OPM; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> FHFA has complied with the requirements of the FCCS, including  any required hearing or review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If FHFA decides to request administrative offset under paragraph  (a) of this section, it shall make the request   as soon as practicable after completion of the applicable procedures.  This will satisfy any requirement that administrative offset be  initiated prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of  limitations. At such time as the debtor makes a claim for payments from  the Fund, if at least one year has elapsed since the administrative  offset request was originally made, the debtor shall be permitted to  offer a satisfactory repayment plan in lieu of administrative offset if  he or she establishes that changed financial circumstances would render  the administrative offset unjust.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If FHFA collects part or all of the debt by other means before  deductions are made or completed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this  section, FHFA shall act promptly to modify or terminate its request for  administrative offset under paragraph (a) of this section.</p>
