                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> VA cannot award a capital grant for more than 65 percent of the total allowable costs of the project. The grantee must provide funding (``matching funding'') for the remaining 35 percent of the total cost, using non-federal funds. VA requires that applicants provide documentation of all costs related to the project including those that are not allowable under OMB Circular A-122 as codified at 2 CFR part 230. Allowable costs means those related to the portion (percentage) of the property that would be used to provide supportive housing and services under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Capital grants may include application costs, including site surveys, architectural, and engineering fees, but may not include relocation costs or developer's fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Documentation of matching funds. The matching funds described in paragraph (a) of this section must be documented as follows; no other format will be accepted as evidence of a firm commitment of matching funds:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Donations must be on the donor's letterhead, signed and dated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicant's own cash must be committed on the applicant's letterhead, signed, and dated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No conditions may be placed on the matching funds other than the organization's receipt of the capital grant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Funds must be committed to the same activity as the capital grant application (i.e., acquisition, renovation, new construction, or a van), and must not relate to operating costs or services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The value of matching funds must be for a cost that is included in the calculation of the total project cost, thereby decreasing the total expenditures of the grantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Van applications. The requirements of this section also apply to applications for a capital grant for a van under Sec. 61.18.
