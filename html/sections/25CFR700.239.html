                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Commission policy. It is the policy of the Commission to make  the records of the Commission available to the public to the greatest  extent possible, in keeping with the spirit of the Freedom of  Information Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Statutory disclosure requirement. The Freedom of Information Act  requires that the Commission, on a request from a member of the public  to inspect or copy records made in accordance with the procedures in  this subpart, shall promptly make the records available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Statutory exemptions. The Act exempts nine categories of records  from this disclosure requirement. The Act provides that disclosure is  not required of matters that are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specifically authorized under criteria established by an  Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or  foreign policy and in fact properly classified pursuant to such  Executive Order;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of  an agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specifically exempt from disclosure by statute;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained  from a person and privileged or confidential;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would  not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation  with the agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of  which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal  privacy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but  only to the extent that production of such records would</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Interfere with enforcement proceedings;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial  adjudication,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Disclose the indentity of a confidential source and, in the  case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the  course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful  national security intelligence investigation, confidential information  furnished only by the confidential source,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement  personnel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition  reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency  responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps,  concerning wells.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Decisions on requests. It is the policy of the Commission to  withhold information falling within an exemption only if (1) disclosure  is prohibited by statute or Executive Order or (2) sound grounds exist  for invocation of the exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Deletion of portions of records. If a requested record contains  material within an exemption together with material not within an  exemption and it is determined under the regulations in this subpart to  withhold the exempt material, any reasonably segregable nonexempt  material shall be separated from the exempt material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Creation of records. This subpart applies only to records which  exist at the time a request for records is made. Records are not  required to be created in response to a request by combining   or compiling selected items from the files or by preparing a new  computer program, nor are records required to be created to provide the  requester with such data as proportions, percentages, frequency  distributions, trends, or comparisons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Records of concern to other departments and agencies. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the  release of a record would be of concern to both the Commission and  another Federal agency, the record will be made available by the  Commission only if the interest of the Commission is the primary  interest. If the Commission's interest is not the primary interest, the  requester shall be referred in writing to the agency having the primary  interest. The Commission has the primary interest in a record if the  record was developed pursuant to Commission regulations, directives, or  request even though the record originated outside of the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the release of a record in which the Commission has a primary  interest would be of substantial concern to another agency, the official  processing the request, should, if administratively feasible and  appropriate, consult with that agency before releasing the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Records obtained from the public. If a requested record was  obtained by the Commission from a person or entity outside of the  Government, the official responsible for processing the request shall,  when it is administratively feasible to do so, seek the views of that  person or entity on whether the record should be released before making  a decision on the request.</p>
