                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Description. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ice cream is a food produced by freezing, while  stirring, a pasteurized mix consisting of one or more of the optional  dairy ingredients specified in paragraph (b) of this section, and may  contain one or more of the optional caseinates specified in paragraph  (c) of this section subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, one  or more of the optional hydrolyzed milk proteins as provided for in  paragraph (d) of this section subject to the conditions hereinafter set  forth, and other safe and suitable nonmilk-derived ingredients; and  excluding other food fats, except such as are natural components of  flavoring ingredients used or are added in incidental amounts to  accomplish specific functions. Ice cream is sweetened with safe and  suitable sweeteners and may be characterized by the addition of  flavoring ingredients.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ice cream contains not less than 1.6 pounds of total solids to  the gallon, and weighs not less than 4.5 pounds to the gallon. Ice cream  contains not less than 10 percent milkfat, nor less than 10 percent  nonfat milk solids, except that when it contains milkfat at 1 percent  increments above the 10 percent minimum, it may contain the following  milkfat-to-nonfat milk solids levels:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Minimum</p><p class="depth3">percent</p><p class="depth3">Percent milkfat                          nonfat</p><p class="depth3">milk</p><p class="depth3">solids ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 10..........................................................          10 11..........................................................           9 12..........................................................           8 13..........................................................           7 14..........................................................           6 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   Except that when one or more bulky flavors are used, the weights of  milkfat and total milk solids are not less than   10 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of the remainder obtained by  subtracting the weight of the bulky flavors from the weight of the  finished food; but in no case is the weight of milkfat or total milk  solids less than 8 percent and 16 percent, respectively, of the weight  of the finished food. Except in the case of frozen custard, ice cream  contains less than 1.4 percent egg yolk solids by weight of the food,  exclusive of the weight of any bulky flavoring ingredients used. Frozen  custard shall contain 1.4 percent egg yolk solids by weight of the  finished food: Provided, however, That when bulky flavors are added the  egg yolk solids content of frozen custard may be reduced in proportion  to the amount by weight of the bulky flavors added, but in no case is  the content of egg yolk solids in the finished food less than 1.12  percent. A product containing egg yolk solids in excess of 1.4 percent,  the maximum set forth in this paragraph for ice cream, may be marketed  if labeled as specified by paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When calculating the minimum amount of milkfat and nonfat milk  solids required in the finished food, the solids of chocolate or cocoa  used shall be considered a bulky flavoring ingredient. In order to make  allowance for additional sweetening ingredients needed when certain  bulky ingredients are used, the weight of chocolate or cocoa solids used  may be multiplied by 2.5; the weight of fruit or nuts used may be  multiplied by 1.4; and the weight of partially or wholly dried fruits or  fruit juices may be multiplied by appropriate factors to obtain the  original weights before drying and this weight may be multiplied by 1.4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Optional dairy ingredients. The optional dairy ingredients  referred to in paragraph (a) of this section are: Cream; dried cream;  plastic cream (sometimes known as concentrated milkfat); butter; butter  oil; milk; concentrated milk; evaporated milk; sweetened condensed milk;  superheated condensed milk; dried milk; skim milk; concentrated skim  milk; evaporated skim milk; condensed skim milk; superheated condensed  skim milk; sweetened condensed skim milk; sweetened condensed part-skim  milk; nonfat dry milk; sweet cream buttermilk; condensed sweet cream  buttermilk; dried sweet cream buttermilk; skim milk, that may be  concentrated, and from which part or all of the lactose has been removed  by a safe and suitable procedure; skim milk in concentrated or dried  form that has been modified by treating the concentrated skim milk with  calcium hydroxide and disodium phosphate; and whey and those modified  whey products (e.g., reduced lactose whey, reduced minerals whey, and  whey protein concentrate) that have been determined by FDA to be  generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in this type of food. Water  may be added, or water may be evaporated from the mix. The sweet cream  buttermilk and the concentrated sweet cream buttermilk or dried sweet  cream buttermilk, when adjusted with water to a total solids content of  8.5 percent, has a titratable acidity of not more than 0.17 percent,  calculated as lactic acid. The term ``milk'' as used in this section  means cow's milk. Any whey and modified whey products used contribute,  singly or in combination, not more than 25 percent by weight of the  total nonfat milk solids content of the finished food. The modified skim  milk, when adjusted with water to a total solids content of 9 percent,  is substantially free of lactic acid as determined by titration with  0.1N NaOH, and it has a Ph value in the range of 8.0 to 8.3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Optional caseinates. The optional caseinates referred to in  paragraph (a) of this section that may be added to ice cream mix  containing not less than 20 percent total milk solids are: Casein  prepared by precipitation with gums, ammonium caseinate, calcium  caseinate, potassium caseinate, and sodium caseinate. Caseinate may be  added in liquid or dry form, but must be free of excess alkali.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Optional hydrolyzed milk proteins. One or more of the optional  hydrolyzed milk proteins referred to in paragraph (a) of this section  may be added as stabilizers at a level not to exceed 3 percent by weight  of ice cream mix containing not less that 20 percent total milk solids,  provided that any whey and modified whey products used contribute,  singly or in combination, not more than 25 percent by weight of the  total nonfat milk solids content of the   finished food. Further, when hydrolyzed milk proteins are used in the  food, the declaration of these ingredients on the food label shall  comply with the requirements of Sec. 102.22 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Methods of analysis. The fat content shall be determined by the  method prescribed in ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association  of Official Analytical Chemists,'' 13th Ed. (1980), sections 16.287 and  16.059, under ``Fat, Roese-Gottlieb Method--Official Final Action,''  which is incorporated by reference. Copies may be obtained from the AOAC  INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD  20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records  Administration (NARA).

class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Nomenclature. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name of the food is ``ice cream''; except  that when the egg yolk solids content of the food is in excess of that  specified for ice cream by paragraph (a) of this section, the name of  the food is ``frozen custard'' or ``french ice cream'' or ``french  custard ice cream''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the food contains no artificial flavor, the name on the  principal display panel or panels of the label shall be accompanied by  the common or usual name of the characterizing flavor, e.g.,  ``vanilla'', in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters  used in the words ``ice cream''.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the food contains both a natural characterizing flavor and  an artificial flavor simulating it, and if the natural flavor  predominates, the name on the principal display panel or panels of the  label shall be accompanied by the common name of the characterizing  flavor, in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used  in the words ``ice cream'', followed by the word ``flavored'', in  letters not less than one-half the height of the letters in the name of  the characterizing flavor, e.g., ``Vanilla flavored'', or ``Peach  flavored'', or ``Vanilla flavored and Strawberry flavored''.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the food contains both a natural characterizing flavor and  an artificial flavor simulating it, and if the artificial flavor  predominates, or if artificial flavor is used alone the name on the  principal display panel or panels of the label shall be accompanied by  the common name of the characterizing flavor in letters not less than  one-half the height of the letters used in the words ``ice cream'',  preceded by ``artificial'' or ``artificially flavored'', in letters not  less than one-half the height of the letters in the name of the  characterizing flavor, e.g., ``artificial Vanilla'', or ``artifically  flavored Strawberry'' or ``artificially flavored Vanilla and  artificially flavored Strawberry''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the food is subject to the requirements of paragraph  (f)(2)(ii) of this section or if it contains any artificial flavor not  simulating the characterizing flavor, the label shall also bear the  words ``artificial flavor added'' or ``artificial ------ flavor added'',  the blank being filled with the common name of the flavor simulated by  the artificial flavor in letters of the same size and prominence as the  words that precede and follow it.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Wherever the name of the characterizing flavor appears on the  label so conspicuously as to be easily seen under customary conditions  of purchase, the words prescribed by this paragraph shall immediately  and conspicuously precede or follow such name, in a size reasonably  related to the prominence of the name of the characterizing flavor and  in any event the size of the type is not less than 6-point on packages  containing less than 1 pint, not less than 8-point on packages  containing at least 1 pint but less than one-half gallon, not less than  10-point on packages containing at least one-half gallon but less than 1  gallon, and not less than 12-point on packages containing 1 gallon or  over: Provided, however, That where the characterizing flavor and a  trademark or brand are presented together, other written, printed, or  graphic matter that is a part of or is associated with the trademark or  brand, may intervene if the required words are in such relationship with  the trademark or brand as to be clearly related to the characterizing  flavor: And provided further, That if the finished product contains more  than one flavor of ice cream subject to the   requirements of this paragraph, the statements required by this  paragraph need appear only once in each statement of characterizing  flavors present in such ice cream, e.g., ``Vanilla flavored, Chocolate,  and Strawberry flavored, artificial flavors added''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the food contains both a natural characterizing flavor and an  artificial flavor simulating the characterizing flavor, any reference to  the natural characterizing flavor shall, except as otherwise authorized  by this paragraph, be accompanied by a reference to the artificial  flavor, displayed with substantially equal prominence, e.g.,  ``strawberry and artificial strawberry flavor''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An artificial flavor simulating the characterizing flavor shall  be deemed to predominate:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of vanilla beans or vanilla extract used in  combination with vanillin if the amount of vanillin used is greater than  1 ounce per unit of vanilla constituent, as that term is defined in  Sec. 169.3(c) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of fruit or fruit juice used in combination with  artificial fruit flavor, if the quantity of the fruit or fruit juice  used is such that, in relation to the weight of the finished ice cream,  the weight of the fruit or fruit juice, as the case may be (including  water necessary to reconstitute partially or wholly dried fruits or  fruit juices to their original moisture content) is less than 2 percent  in the case of citrus ice cream, 6 percent in the case of berry or  cherry ice cream, and 10 percent in the case of ice cream prepared with  other fruits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of nut meats used in combination with artificial  nut flavor, if the quantity of nut meats used is such that, in relation  to the finished ice cream the weight of the nut meats is less than 2  percent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of two or more fruits or fruit juices, or nut  meats, or both, used in combination with artificial flavors simulating  the natural flavors and dispersed throughout the food, if the quantity  of any fruit or fruit juice or nut meat is less than one-half the  applicable percentage specified in paragraph (e)(5) (ii) or (iii) of  this section. For example, if a combination ice cream contains less than  5 percent of bananas and less than 1 percent of almonds it would be  ``artificially flavored banana-almond ice cream''. However, if it  contains more than 5 percent of bananas and more than 1 percent of  almonds it would be ``banana-almond flavored ice cream''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If two or more flavors of ice cream are distinctively combined  in one package, e.g., ``Neapolitan'' ice cream, the applicable  provisions of this paragraph shall govern each flavor of ice cream  comprising the combination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Until September 14, 1998, when safe and suitable sweeteners  other than nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners are used in the food, their  presence shall be declared by their common or usual name on the  principal display panel of the label as part of the statement of  identity in letters that shall be no less than one-half the size of the  type used in the term ``ice cream'' but in any case no smaller than one- sixteenth of an inch. If the food purports to be or is represented for  special dietary use, it shall bear labeling in accordance with the  requirements of part 105 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Label declaration. Each of the ingredients used shall be  declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts  101 and 130 of this chapter, except that the sources of milkfat or milk  solids not fat may be declared in descending order of predominance  either by the use of all the terms ``milkfat and nonfat milk'' when one  or any combination of two or more of the ingredients listed in  Sec. 101.4(b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(8), and (b)(9) of this chapter are used  or, alternatively, as permitted in Sec. 101.4 of this chapter. Under  section 403(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, artificial  color need not be declared in ice cream, except as required by  Sec. 101.22(c) or (k) of this chapter. Voluntary declaration of all  colors used in ice cream and frozen custard is recommended.
