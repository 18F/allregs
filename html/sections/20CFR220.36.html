                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. In order to receive an annuity based upon a disability,  an employee must be found disabled under the Railroad Retirement Act. If  an employee is found disabled under the Railroad Retirement Act, the  Board will determine whether he is disabled under the Social Security  Act to qualify for a period of disability as defined in that Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Period of disability--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition and effect. A period of  disability is a continuous period of time during which an employee is  disabled as that term is defined in Sec. 404.1505 of this title. A  period of disability established by the Board--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Preserves the disabled employee's earnings record as it is when  the period begins;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Protects the insured status required for entitlement to social  security overall minimum;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> May cause an increase in the rate of an employee, spouse, or  survivor annuity; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> May permit a disabled employee to receive Medicare benefits in  addition to an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effect on benefits. The establishment of a period of disability  for the employee will never cause a denial or   reduction in benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act or Social  Security Act, but it will always be used to establish Medicare  entitlement before age 65.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Who may establish a period of disability. The Railroad  Retirement Board or the Social Security Administration may establish a  period of disability. However, the decision of one agency is not binding  upon the other agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the Board may establish a period of disability. The Board  has independent authority to decide whether or not to establish a period  of disability for any employee who was awarded an annuity under the  Railroad Retirement Act, or who--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has applied for a disability annuity; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has at least 10 years of railroad service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When an employee is entitled to a period of disability. An  employee is entitled to a period of disability if he or she meets the  following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The employee is disabled under the Social Security Act, as  described in Sec. 404.1505 of this title.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employee is insured for a period of disability under Sec.  404.130 of this title based on combined railroad and social security  earnings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The employee files an application as shown in subparagraph  (b)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> At least 5 consecutive months elapse from the month in which  the period of disability begins and before the month in which it would  end.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Application for a period of disability. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An application for  an employee disability annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act or an  employee disability benefit under the Social Security Act is also an  application for a period of disability.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An employee who is receiving an age annuity or who was  previously denied a period of disability must file a separate  application for a period of disability.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In order to be entitled to a period of disability, an employee  must apply while he or she is disabled or not later than 12 months after  the month in which the period of disability ends.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An employee who is unable to apply within the 12-month period  after the period of disability ends because his or her physical  condition limited his or her activities to the extent that he or she  could not complete and sign an application or because he or she was  mentally incompetent, may apply no later than 36 months after the period  of disability ends.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A period of disability can also be established on the basis of  an application filed within 3 months after the month a disabled employee  died.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Social security overall minimum. The social security overall  minimum provision of the Railroad Retirement Act guarantees that the  total monthly annuities payable to an employee and his or her family  will not be less than the total monthly benefit which would be payable  under the Social Security Act if the employee's railroad service were  credited as employment under the Social Security Act.
