A national bank shall give prior notice  to the OCC to relocate its main office within city, town, or village  limits to an authorized branch location. A national bank shall submit an  application and obtain prior OCC approval to relocate its main office to  any other location in the city, town, or village, or within 30 miles of  the limits of the city, town, or village in which the main office of the  bank is located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scope. This section describes OCC procedures and approval  standards for an application or a notice by a national bank to change  the location of its main office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedure--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Main office relocation to an authorized branch  location within city, town, or village limits. A national bank may  change the location of its main office to an authorized branch location  (approved or existing branch site) within the limits of the same city,  town, or village. The national bank shall submit a notice to the  appropriate district office before the relocation. The notice must  include the new address of the main office and the effective date of the  relocation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To any other location. To relocate its main office to any other  location, a national bank shall file an application   to relocate with the appropriate district office. If relocating the main  office outside the limits of its city, town, or village, a national bank  shall also:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Obtain the approval of shareholders owning two-thirds of the  voting stock of the bank; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Amend its articles of association.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Establishment of a branch at site of former main office. A  national bank desiring to establish a branch at its former main office  location shall obtain OCC approval pursuant to the standards of  Sec. 5.30.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Expedited review.

However, if  the OCC concludes that the notice under paragraph (d)(1) of this section  presents a significant and novel policy, supervisory, or legal issue,  the OCC may determine that any or all parts of Secs. 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, and  5.11 apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The comment period on any application filed under paragraph  (d)(2) of this section to engage in a short-distance relocation of a  main office is 15 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Expiration of approval.
