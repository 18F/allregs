                            <p class="depth0">Section 401(c) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA) requires the Secretary of Agriculture to determine the essential uses of natural gas, and to certify to the Secretary of Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) the natural gas requirements, expressed either as volumes or percentages of use, of persons, or classes thereof, for essential agricultural uses in order to meet requirements of full food and fiber production. This rule covers establishments performing functions classed as essential agricultural uses whose natural gas supplies are distributed through the interstate pipeline systems even though such establishments may receive such gas directly from an intrastate pipeline or local distribution company. The rule provides to the Secretary of Energy (for purposes of Section 401(a) of the NGPA) and to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the following certifications:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Essential agricultural uses of natural gas, expressed as classes of establishments that use gas for essential agricultural purposes; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Essential agricultural current requirements of natural gas, expressed as percentages of use.</p>
