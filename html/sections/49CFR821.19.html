                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Depositions. After a petition for review or a complaint is filed, any party may take the testimony of any person, including a party, by deposition, upon oral examination or written questions, without seeking prior Board approval. Reasonable notice shall be given in writing to the other parties, stating the name of the witness and the time and place of the taking of the deposition, in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. A copy of any notice of deposition shall be served on the law judge to whom the proceeding has been assigned or, if no law judge has been assigned, on the Case Manager. In other respects, the taking of any deposition shall be compliance with the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 46104(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exchange of information by the parties. The parties must exchange information in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Copies of discovery requests and responses shall be served on the law judge to whom the proceeding has been assigned or, if no law judge has been assigned, on the Case Manager. In the event of a dispute, either the assigned law judge or another law judge delegated this responsibility (if a law judge has not yet been assigned or if the assigned law judge is unavailable) may issue an appropriate order, including an order directing compliance with any ruling previously made with respect to discovery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure to provide or preserve evidence. The failure of any party to comply with a law judge's order compelling discovery, or to cooperate with a timely request for the preservation of evidence, may result in a negative inference against that party with respect to the matter sought and not provided or preserved, a preclusion order, dismissal or other relief deemed appropriate by the law judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Failure to provide copy of releasable portion of Enforcement Investigative Report (EIR). (1) Except as provided in Sec. 821.55 with respect to emergency proceedings, where the respondent requests the EIR and the Administrator fails to provide the releasable portion of the EIR to the respondent by the time he or she serves the complaint on the respondent, the respondent may move to dismiss the complaint or for other relief and, unless the Administrator establishes good cause for that failure, the law judge shall order such relief as he or she deems appropriate, after considering the parties' arguments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 821.55 with respect to emergency proceedings, where the respondent requests the EIR and the Administrator fails to provide the releasable portion of the EIR to the respondent by the time he or she serves the complaint on the respondent, the respondent may move to dismiss the complaint or for other relief and, unless the Administrator establishes good cause for that failure, the law judge shall order such relief as he or she deems appropriate, after considering the parties' arguments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The releasable portion of the EIR shall include all information in the EIR, except for the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Information that is privileged;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Information that constitutes work product or reflects internal deliberative process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Information that would disclose the identity of a confidential source;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Information of which applicable law prohibits disclosure;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Information about which the law judge grants leave to withhold as not relevant to the subject matter of the proceeding or otherwise, for good cause shown; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Sensitive security information, as defined at 49 U.S.C. 40119 and 49 CFR 15.5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as preventing the Administrator from releasing to the respondent information in addition to that which is contained in the releasable portion of the EIR.
