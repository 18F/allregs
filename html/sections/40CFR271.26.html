                            <p class="depth0">The State shall have standards for used oil management which are  equivalent to 40 CFR part 279. These standards shall include:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Standards for used oil generators which are equivalent to those  under subpart C of part 279 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standards for used oil collection centers and aggregation points  which are equivalent to those under subpart D of part 279 of this  chapter;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Standards for used oil transporters and transfer facilities  which are equivalent to those under subpart E of part 279 of this  chapter;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Standards for used oil processors and re-refiners which are  equivalent to those under subpart F of part 279 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Standards for used oil burners who burn off-specification used  oil for energy recovery which are equivalent to those under subpart G of  part 279 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Standards for used oil fuel marketers which are equivalent to  those under subpart H of part 279 of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Standards for use as a dust suppressant and disposal of used oil  which are equivalent to those under subpart I of part 279 of this  chapter. A State may petition (e.g., as part of its authorization  petition submitted to EPA under Sec.  271.5) EPA to allow the use of  used oil (that is not mixed with hazardous waste and does not exhibit a  characteristic other than ignitability) as a dust suppressant. The State  must show that it has a program in place to prevent the use of used oil/ hazardous waste mixtures or used oil exhibiting a characteristic other  than ignitability as a dust suppressant. In addition, such programs must  minimize the impacts of use as a dust suppressant on the environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless otherwise provided in part 271, state programs shall  have standards for the marketing and burning of used oil for energy  recovery that are at least as stringent as the requirements and  prohibitions that EPA adopted on November 29, in 40 CFR part 266,  subpart E of this chapter. The part 279 of this chapter requirements  specified in Table 1 (except those provisions identified in footnotes 1  and 2 of Table 1) are Federally enforceable in those states that have  not adopted state requirements equivalent to 40 CFR part 279, subparts G  and H of this chapter requirements and have not been authorized to  enforce the state requirements.</p><p class="depth3">Table 1--Regulations Adopted November 29, 1985 Regarding the Burning of</p><p class="depth3">Used Oil for Energy Recovery</p><p class="depth3">[These part 279 provisions will continue to be enforced by EPA] ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Former provisions of 40 CFR part 266,    Recodified provisions within</p><p class="depth3">subpart E (1992)                      40 CFR part 279 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Sec. 266.40(a)............................
