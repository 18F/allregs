Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a creditor shall not extend a higher-priced mortgage loan to a consumer without obtaining, prior to consummation, a written appraisal of the property to be mortgaged. The appraisal must be performed by a certified or licensed appraiser who conducts a physical visit of the interior of the property that will secure the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Safe harbor. A creditor obtains a written appraisal that meets the requirements for an appraisal required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section if the creditor:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Orders that the appraiser perform the appraisal in conformity with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice and title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, as amended (12 U.S.C. 3331 et seq.), and any implementing regulations in effect at the time the appraiser signs the appraiser's certification;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Verifies through the National Registry that the appraiser who signed the appraiser's certification was a certified or licensed appraiser in the State in which the appraised property is located as of the date the appraiser signed the appraiser's certification;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Confirms that the elements set forth in appendix N to this part are addressed in the written appraisal; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Has no actual knowledge contrary to the facts or certifications contained in the written appraisal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Additional appraisal for certain higher-priced mortgage loans--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (d)(7) of this section, a creditor shall not extend a higher-priced mortgage loan to a consumer to finance the acquisition of the consumer's principal dwelling without obtaining, prior to consummation, two written appraisals, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The seller acquired the property 90 or fewer days prior to the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property and the price in the consumer's agreement to acquire the property exceeds the seller's acquisition price by more than 10 percent; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The seller acquired the property 91 to 180 days prior to the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property and the price in the consumer's agreement to acquire the property exceeds the seller's acquisition price by more than 20 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Different certified or licensed appraisers. The two appraisals required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section may not be performed by the same certified or licensed appraiser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Relationship to general appraisal requirements. If two appraisals must be obtained under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, each appraisal shall meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Required analysis in the additional appraisal. One of the two required appraisals must include an analysis of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The difference between the price at which the seller acquired the property and the price that the consumer is obligated to pay to acquire the property, as specified in the consumer's agreement to acquire the property from the seller;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Changes in market conditions between the date the seller acquired the property and the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any improvements made to the property between the date the seller acquired the property and the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> No charge for the additional appraisal. If the creditor must obtain two appraisals under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the creditor may charge the consumer for only one of the appraisals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Creditor's determination of prior sale date and price--(i) Reasonable diligence. A creditor must obtain two written appraisals under paragraph (d)(1) of this section unless the creditor can demonstrate by exercising reasonable diligence that the requirement to obtain

two appraisals does not apply. A creditor acts with reasonable diligence if the creditor bases its determination on information contained in written source documents, such as the documents listed in appendix O to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Inability to determine prior sale date or price--modified requirements for additional appraisal. If, after exercising reasonable diligence, a creditor cannot determine whether the conditions in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) are present and therefore must obtain two written appraisals in accordance with paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section, one of the two appraisals shall include an analysis of the factors in paragraph (d)(4) of this section only to the extent that the information necessary for the appraiser to perform the analysis can be determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Exemptions from the additional appraisal requirement. The additional appraisal required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall not apply to extensions of credit that finance a consumer's acquisition of property:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> From a local, State or Federal government agency;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> From a person who acquired title to the property through foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or other similar judicial or non-judicial procedure as a result of the person's exercise of rights as the holder of a defaulted mortgage loan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> From a non-profit entity as part of a local, State, or Federal government program under which the non-profit entity is permitted to acquire title to single-family properties for resale from a seller who acquired title to the property through the process of foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or other similar judicial or non-judicial procedure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> From a person who acquired title to the property by inheritance or pursuant to a court order of dissolution of marriage, civil union, or domestic partnership, or of partition of joint or marital assets to which the seller was a party;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> From an employer or relocation agency in connection with the relocation of an employee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> From a servicemember, as defined in 50 U.S.C. App. 511(1), who received a deployment or permanent change of station order after the servicemember purchased the property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Located in an area designated by the President as a federal disaster area, if and for as long as the Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies, as defined in 12 U.S.C. 3350(6), waive the requirements in title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, as amended (12 U.S.C. 3331 et seq.), and any implementing regulations in that area; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Located in a rural county, as defined in 12 CFR 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Required disclosure--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a creditor shall disclose the following statement, in writing, to a consumer who applies for a higher-priced mortgage loan: ``We may order an appraisal to determine the property's value and charge you for this appraisal. We will give you a copy of any appraisal, even if your loan does not close. You can pay for an additional appraisal for your own use at your own cost.'' Compliance with the disclosure requirement in Regulation B, 12 CFR 1002.14(a)(2), satisfies the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Timing of disclosure. The disclosure required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be delivered or placed in the mail no later than the third business day after the creditor receives the consumer's application for a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to this section. In the case of a loan that is not a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to this section at the time of application, but becomes a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to this section after application, the disclosure shall be delivered or placed in the mail not later than the third business day after the creditor determines that the loan is a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Copy of appraisals--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a creditor shall provide to the consumer a copy of any written appraisal performed in connection with a higher-priced mortgage loan pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Timing. A creditor shall provide to the consumer a copy of each written

appraisal pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No later than three business days prior to consummation of the loan; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a loan that is not consummated, no later than 30 days after the creditor determines that the loan will not be consummated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Form of copy. Any copy of a written appraisal required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section may be provided to the applicant in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> No charge for copy of appraisal. A creditor shall not charge the consumer for a copy of a written appraisal required to be provided to the consumer pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Relation to other rules. The rules in this section were adopted jointly by the Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau). These rules are substantively identical to the OCC's and the Bureau's higher-priced mortgage loan appraisal rules published separately in 12 CFR part 34, subpart G and 12 CFR part 164, subpart B (for the OCC) and 12 CFR 1026.35(a) and (c) (for the Bureau). The Board's rules apply to all creditors who are State member banks, bank holding companies and their subsidiaries (other than a bank), savings and loan holding companies and their subsidiaries (other than a savings and loan association), and insured branches and agencies of foreign banks. Compliance with the Board's rules satisfies the requirements of 15 U.S.C. 1639h.
