Formal advisory opinions will be issued when a two-pronged test is met. First, the person making the request must meet the requirements of Sec. 2638.302 and, second, the subject matter of the request must meet the criteria set forth in Sec. 2638.303.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Normally, formal advisory opinions will not be issued to individuals who wish to obtain general advice concerning their own specific present or proposed activities or financial transactions. Such questions should be directed to the designated ethics official of the agency in which the individual will serve, serves or served. If a designated agency ethics official receives a request which he or she believes should be answered by the Office of Government Ethics, a referral procedure is available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Office of Government Ethics will provide interested parties, to the extent practicable, with an opportunity to comment on any question which will be the subject of a formal advisory opinion issued by the Office. These opinions will be published in a form which will not identify specific individuals unless necessary to the understanding of the opinion. Copies will be sent to the designated ethics officials of each agency and be available at the Office of Government Ethics in that same form.</p>
