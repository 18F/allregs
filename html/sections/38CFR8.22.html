                            <p class="depth0">Where physical or mental examination is required of an applicant for  National Service Life Insurance or of an applicant for reinstatement of  National Service Life Insurance, such examination may be made by a  medical officer of the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, or Public  Health Service, or may be made free of charge to him or her by a full- time or part-time salaried physician or a physician's assistant at a  regional office or medical facility of the Department of Veterans  Affairs. Such examination may also be made, at the applicant's own  expense, by a physician duly licensed for the practice of medicine by a  State, possession of the United States, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or  the District of Columbia, or by a duly licensed osteopathic physician  who is a graduate of a recognized and approved college of osteopathy and  who is listed in the current directory of the American Osteopathic  Association. Such examination may be made by a physician or osteopath  who is not related to the applicant by blood or marriage, associated  with him or her in business, or pecuniarily interested in the insurance  or reinstatement of the policy. Examinations made in a foreign country  by a physician duly licensed for the practice of medicine and otherwise  acceptable may be accepted if submitted through the American consul. The  Secretary of Veterans Affairs may require such further medical  examination or additional medical evidence as may be deemed necessary  and proper to establish the physical and mental condition of the  applicant at the time of the application.
