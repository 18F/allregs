For such treatment works, the  decision must be made on a case-by-case basis as to whether any  attainable percentage removal level can be defined, and if so, what the  level should be.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em>,  and 133.105(e)(1)(ii) should be adjusted proportionately.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Waste stabilization ponds. The Regional Administrator, or, if  appropriate, State Director subject to EPA approval, is authorized to  adjust the minimum levels of effluent quality set forth in Sec. 133.105  (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) for treatment works subject to this part, to  conform to the SS concentrations achievable with waste stabilization  ponds, provided that: (1) Waste stablization ponds are the principal  process used for secondary treatment; and (2) operation and maintenance  data indicate that the SS values specified in Sec. 133.105 (b)(1),  (b)(2), and (b)(3) cannot be achieved. The term ``SS concentrations  achievable with waste stabilization ponds'' means a SS value, determined  by the Regional Administrator, or, if appropriate, State Director  subject to EPA approval, which is equal to the effluent concentration  achieved 90   percent of the time within a State or appropriate contiguous  geographical area by waste stabilization ponds that are achieving the  levels of effluent quality for BOD5 specified in Sec.  133.105(a)(1). [cf. 43 FR 55279].</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Less concentrated influent wastewater for separate sewers. The  Regional Administrator or, if appropriate, State Director is authorized  to substitute either a lower percent removal requirement or a mass  loading limit for the percent removal requirements set forth in  Sec. Sec. 133.102(a)(3), 133.102(a)(4)(iii), 133.102(b)(3),  102.105(a)(3), 133.105(b)(3) and 133.105(e)(1)(iii) provided that the  permittee satisfactorily demonstrates that: (1) The treatment works is  consistently meeting, or will consistently meet, its permit effluent  concentration limits but its percent removal requirements cannot be met  due to less concentrated influent wastewater, (2) to meet the percent  removal requirements, the treatment works would have to achieve  significantly more stringent limitations than would otherwise be  required by the concentration-based standards, and (3) the less  concentrated influent wastewater is not the result of excessive I/I. The  determination of whether the less concentrated wastewater is the result  of excessive I/I will use the definition of excessive I/I in 40 CFR  35.2005(b)(16) plus the additional criterion that inflow is nonexcessive  if the total flow to the POTW (i.e., wastewater plus inflow plus  infiltration) is less than 275 gallons per capita per day.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)(iii)</em>  provided that the permittee satisfactorily demonstrates that: (1) The  treatment works is consistently meeting, or will consistently meet, its  permit effluent concentration limits, but the percent removal  requirements cannot be met due to less concentrated influent wastewater;  (2) to meet the percent removal requirements, the treatment works would  have to achieve significantly more stringent effluent concentrations  than would otherwise be required by the concentration-based standards;  and (3) the less concentrated influent wastewater does not result from  either excessive infiltration or clear water industrial discharges  during dry weather periods. The determination of whether the less  concentrated wastewater results from excessive infiltration is discussed  in 40 CFR 35.2005(b)(28), plus the additional criterion that either 40  gallons per capita per day (gpcd) or 1500 gallons per inch diameter per  mile of sewer (gpdim) may be used as the threshold value for that  portion of the dry weather base flow attributed to infiltration. If the  less concentrated influent wastewater is the result of clear water  industrial discharges, then the treatment works must control such  discharges pursuant to 40 CFR part 403.
