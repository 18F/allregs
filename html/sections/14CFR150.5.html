                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 47501 et seq., this part provides for airport noise compatibility planning and land use programs necessary to the purposes of those provisions. No submittal of a map, or approval or disapproval, in whole or part, of any map or program submitted under this part is a determination concerning the acceptability or unacceptability of that land use under Federal, State, or local law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approval of a noise compatibility program under this part is neither a commitment by the FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program, nor a determination that all measures covered by the program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Approval of a noise compatibility program under this part does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action, pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332 et seq.) and guidelines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Acceptance of a noise exposure map does not constitute an FAA determination that any specific parcel of land lies within a particular noise contour. Responsibility for interpretation of the effects of noise contours upon subjacent land uses, including the relationship between noise contours and specific properties, rests with the sponsor or with other state or local government.
