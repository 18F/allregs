Upon receipt of a charge of  employment discrimination, the EEOC shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine whether it has jurisdiction over the charge under  title I of the ADA. If it has jurisdiction, except as provided in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the EEOC shall process the charge  pursuant to title I procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the EEOC determines that it does not have jurisdiction under  title I, the EEOC shall promptly refer the charge to the Civil Rights  Division. The Civil Rights Division shall determine if a Federal agency  may have jurisdiction over the charge under section 504 or title II,  and, if so, shall refer the charge to a section 504 agency or to a  designated agency with jurisdiction over the complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Retention by the EEOC for investigation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The EEOC shall  retain a charge for investigation when it determines that it has  jurisdiction over the charge under title I.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Referral to an agency. Any charge retained by the EEOC for  investigation and processing will be investigated and processed under  title I only, and will not be deemed dual filed under section 504,  except that ADA cause charges (as defined in 29 CFR 1601.21) that also  fall within the jurisdiction of a section 504 agency and that the EEOC  (or the Civil Rights Division, if such a charge is against a government,  governmental agency, or political subdivision) has declined to litigate  shall be referred to the appropriate section 504 agency for review of  the file and any administrative or other action deemed appropriate under  section 504. Such charges shall be deemed complaints, dual filed under  section 504, solely for the purposes of the agency review and action  described in this paragraph. The date of such dual filing shall be  deemed to be the date the complaint was received by the EEOC.</p>
