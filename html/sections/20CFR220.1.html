                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This part explains how disability determinations are made by the  Railroad Retirement Board. In some determinations of disability  entitlement, as described below, the Board makes the decision of  disability under the Railroad Retirement Act based on the regulations  set out in this part. However, in certain other determinations of  disability entitlement (as also described below) the Board has the  authority to decide whether the claimant is disabled as that term is  defined in the Social Security Act and the regulations of the Social  Security Administration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In order for a claimant to become entitled to a railroad  retirement annuity based on disability for his or her regular railroad  occupation, or to become entitled to a railroad retirement annuity based  on disability for any regular employment as an employee, widow(er), or  child, he or she must be disabled as those terms are defined in the  Railroad Retirement Act. In order for a claimant to become entitled to a  period of disability, to early Medicare coverage based on disability, to  benefits under the social security overall minimum, or to a disability  annuity as a surviving divorced spouse or remarried widow(er), the  claimant must be found disabled as that term is defined in the Social  Security Act.</p>
