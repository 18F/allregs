                            <p class="depth0">Small business concerns and development companies which apply for or receive any financial assistance of the kind described in Sec. 112.2(a) (1) and (2), including concerns which are identifiable beneficiaries of loans made under Sec. 112.2(a)(2), may not discriminate on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in their employment practices. Such assistance is deemed to have as a primary objective the providing of employment. Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, the provisions of Sec. 112.7(a) shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient

or other persons subject to the regulation, to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity and nondiscriminatory treatment.
