                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Either the Center or any respondent may appeal an initial  decision, including a decision not to withdraw a default judgment, or a  decision granting summary decision to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs  or other entity the Commissioner designates to decide the appeal. The  Commissioner has currently designated the Departmental Appeals Board  (DAB) to decide appeals under this part. Parties may appeal to the DAB  by filing a notice of appeal with the DAB, Appellate Division MS6127,  Departmental Appeals Board, United States Department of Health and Human  Services, 330 Independence Ave. SW., Cohen Bldg., rm. G-644, Washington,  DC 20201, and the Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), Food and  Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852,  in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A notice of appeal may be filed at any time within 30 days  after the presiding officer issues an initial decision or decision  granting summary decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commissioner or the entity designated by the Commissioner to  hear appeals may, within his or her discretion, extend the initial 30- day period for an additional period of time if the Center or any  respondent files a request for an extension within the initial 30-day  period and shows good cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A notice of appeal shall be accompanied by a written brief of no  greater length than that allowed for the posthearing brief. The notice  must identify specific exceptions to the initial decision, must support  each exception with citations to the record, and must explain the basis  for each exception.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The opposing party may file a brief of no greater length than  that allowed for the posthearing brief in opposition to exceptions  within 30 days of receiving the notice of appeal and accompanying brief,  unless such time period is extended by the Commissioner or the entity  designated by the Commissioner to hear appeals on request of the  opposing party for good cause shown. Any brief in opposition to  exceptions shall be filed with the Division of Dockets Management and  the DAB (addresses above).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The appellant may file a reply brief not more than 10 pages in  length within 10 days of being served with appellee's brief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> There is no right to appear personally before the Commissioner  of Food and Drugs or other entity deciding the appeal (currently the  DAB).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The entity deciding the appeal will consider only those issues  raised before the presiding officer, except that the appellee may make  any argument based on the record in support of the initial decision or  decision granting summary decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If on appeal the entity deciding the appeal considers issues not  adequately briefed by the parties, the entity may ask for additional  briefing. However, no such additional briefs will be considered unless  so requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the entity  deciding the appeal (currently the DAB) that additional evidence not  presented at the   hearing is relevant and material and that there were reasonable grounds  for the failure to adduce such evidence at the hearing, the entity  deciding the appeal may remand the matter to the presiding officer for  consideration of the additional evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The Commissioner of Food and Drugs or other entity deciding the  appeal (currently the DAB) will issue a decision on the appeal within 60  days, if practicable, of the due date for submission of the appellee's  brief. In the decision, the entity deciding the appeal may decline to  review the case, affirm the initial decision or decision granting  summary decision (with or without an opinion), or reverse the initial  decision or decision granting summary decision, or increase, reduce,  reverse, or remand any civil money penalty determined by the presiding  officer in the initial decision. If the entity deciding the appeal  declines to review the case, the initial decision or the decision  granting summary decision shall constitute the final decision of FDA and  shall be final and binding on the parties 30 days after the declination  by the entity deciding the appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The standard of review on a disputed issue of fact is whether  the initial decision is supported by substantial evidence on the whole  record. The standard of review on a disputed issue of law is whether the  initial decision is erroneous.  [60 FR 38626, July 27, 1995, as amended at 71 FR 5979, Feb. 6, 2006]</p>
