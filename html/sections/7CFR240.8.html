Funds withheld from States under Sec. Sec. 240.3 and 240.4 shall be disbursed to eligible program schools, service institutions, and nonresidential child care institutions by FNSRO's in the same manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unless the school food authority of a commodity school elects to have cash payments for donated-food processing and handling expenses retained for use on its behalf by the State agency, the State agency shall make such payments to the school food authority of such a school on a monthly basis in an amount equal to the number of lunches served (as reported in accordance with Sec. 210.13(a) of this chapter) times the value per lunch elected by the school food authority in accordance with Sec. 240.5 of this part. For the period November 11, 1981, through the close of the month in which this part is published in the Federal Register, a retroactive payment shall be made, where applicable, to the school food authority of a commodity school based on the number of lunches served during

that period which meet the nutritional requirements specified in Sec. 210.10 of this chapter.</p>
