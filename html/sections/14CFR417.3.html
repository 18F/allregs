A flight safety system includes:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> All hardware and software used to protect the public in the event of a launch vehicle failure; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The functions of any flight safety crew.</p><p class="depth0">Flight safety crew means the personnel, designated by a launch operator, who operate flight safety system hardware and software to monitor the flight of a launch vehicle and make a flight termination decision.</p><p class="depth0">Flight termination system means all components, onboard a launch vehicle, that provide the ability to end a launch vehicle's flight in a controlled manner. A flight termination system consists of all command destruct systems, inadvertent separation destruct systems, or other systems or components that are onboard a launch vehicle and used to terminate flight.</p><p class="depth0">Gate means the portion of a flight safety limit boundary through which the tracking icon of a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system may pass without flight termination.</p><p class="depth0">In-family means a launch vehicle component or system test result that indicates that the component or system's performance conforms to the family performance data that was established by previous test results.</p><p class="depth0">Inadvertent separation destruct system means an automatic destruct system that uses mechanical means to trigger the destruction of a launch vehicle stage.</p><p class="depth0">Launch azimuth means the horizontal angular direction initially taken by a launch vehicle at liftoff, measured clockwise in degrees from true north.</p><p class="depth0">Launch crew means all personnel who control the countdown and flight of a launch vehicle or who make irrevocable operational decisions that have the potential for impacting public safety. A launch crew includes members of the flight safety crew.</p><p class="depth0">Launch processing means all preflight preparation of a launch vehicle at a launch site, including buildup of the launch vehicle, integration of the payload, and fueling.</p><p class="depth0">Launch wait means a relatively short period of time when launch is not permitted in order to avoid a conjunction on launch or to safely accommodate temporary intrusion into a flight hazard area. A launch wait can occur within a launch window, can delay the start of a launch window, or terminate a launch window early.</p><p class="depth0">Launch window means a period of time during which the flight of a launch vehicle may be initiated.</p><p class="depth0">``Meets intent'' certification means a decision by a Federal launch range to accept a substitute means of satisfying a safety requirement where the substitute provides an equivalent level of safety to that of the original requirement.</p><p class="depth0">Normal flight means the flight of a properly performing launch vehicle whose real-time instantaneous impact point does not deviate from the nominal instantaneous impact point by more than the sum of the wind effects and the three-sigma guidance and performance deviations in the uprange, downrange, left-crossrange, or right-crossrange directions.</p><p class="depth0">Normal trajectory means a trajectory that describes normal flight.</p><p class="depth0">Non-operating environment means an environment that a launch vehicle component experiences before flight and when not otherwise being subjected to acceptance tests.

by a system or operating environment or by an unsafe act.</p><p class="depth0">Out-of-family means a component or system test result where the component or system's performance does not conform to the family performance data that was established by previous test results and is an indication of a potential problem with the component or system requiring further investigation and possible corrective action.</p><p class="depth0">Passive component means a flight termination system component that does not contain active electronic piece parts.</p><p class="depth0">Performance specification means a statement prescribing the particulars of how a component or part is expected to perform in relation to the system that contains the component or part. A performance specification includes specific values for the range of operation, input, output, or other parameters that define the component's or part's expected performance.</p><p class="depth0">Protected area means an area of land not controlled by a launch operator that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Is a populated area;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Is environmentally sensitive; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Contains a vital national asset.</p><p class="depth2">Safety-critical computer system function means any computer system function that, if not performed, if performed out of sequence, or if performed incorrectly, may directly or indirectly cause a public safety hazard.</p><p class="depth2">Service life means, for a flight termination system component, the sum total of the component's storage life and operating life.</p><p class="depth2">Storage life means, for a flight termination system component, the period of time after manufacturing of the component is complete until the component is activated or installed on a launch vehicle, whichever is earlier, during which the component may be subjected to storage environments and must remain capable of satisfying all its performance specifications.</p><p class="depth2">Sub-vehicle point means the location on an ellipsoidal Earth model where the normal to the ellipsoid passes through the launch vehicle's center of gravity.
