                                Sec. 90.375  RSU license areas, communication zones and registrations
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> DSRCS Roadside Units (RSUs) in the 5850-5925 MHz band are licensed on the basis of non-exclusive geographic areas. Governmental applicants will be issued a geographic area license based on the geo-political area encompassing the legal jurisdiction of the entity. All other applicants will be issued a geographic area license for their proposed area of operation based on county(s), state(s) or nationwide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicants who are approved in accordance with FCC Form 601 will be granted non-exclusive licenses for all non-reserved DSRCS frequencies (see Sec. 90.377). Such licenses serve as a prerequisite of registering individual RSUs located within the licensed geographic area described in paragraph (a) of this section. Licensees must register each RSU in the Universal Licensing System (ULS) before operating such RSU. RSU registrations are subject, inter alia, to the requirements of Sec. 1.923 of this chapter as applicable (antenna structure registration, environmental concerns, international coordination, and quiet zones). Additionally, RSUs at locations subject to NTIA coordination (see Sec. 90.371(b) may not begin operation until NTIA -approval is received. Registrations are not effective until the Commission posts them on the ULS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Licensees must operate each RSU in accordance with the Commission's Rules and the registration data posted on the ULS for such RSU. Licensees must register each RSU for the smallest communication zone needed (for the DSRC-based intelligent transportation systems application) using one of the following four communication zones:

Copies may be inspected at the Federal</p><p class="depth2">Communications Commission, 445 12th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20554</p><p class="depth2">or National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For</p><p class="depth2">information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-</p><p class="depth2">6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/federal--register/code--of--</p><p class="depth2">federal--regulations/ibr--locations.html. Copies of the ASTM E2213-03</p><p class="depth2">DSRC Standard can be obtained from ASTM International, 100 Barr Harbor</p><p class="depth2">Drive, PO Box C700, West Conshohocken, PA 19428-2959. Copies may also</p><p class="depth2">be obtained from ASTM via the Internet at http://www.astm.org. The</p><p class="depth2">ASTM-DSRC Standard limits output power to 28.8 dBm but allows more</p><p class="depth2">power to overcome cable losses to the antenna as long as the antenna</p><p class="depth2">input power does not exceed 28.8 dBm and the EIRP does not exceed 44.8</p><p class="depth2">dBm. However, specific channels and categories of uses have additional</p><p class="depth2">limitations under the ASTM-DSRC Standard.
