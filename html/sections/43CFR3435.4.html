[47 FR 33144, July 30, 1982, as amended at 50 FR 8627, Mar. 4, 1985]</p><p class="depth0">Subpart 3436_Coal Lease and Coal Land Exchanges: Alluvial Valley Floors</p><p class="depth0">Source: 47 FR 33145, July 30, 1982, unless otherwise noted.


Sec. 3436.0-1  Purpose.</p><p class="depth0">The purpose of this subpart is to establish criteria and procedures for the exchange of coal leases and for the exchange of fee held coal for unleased federally-owned coal in cases where surface coal mining operations on the lands that are covered by an existing coal lease or that are fee held would interrupt, discontinue or preclude farming on alluvial valley floors west of the 100th Meridian, west longitude, or materially damage the quantity or quality of water in surface or underground systems that supply those alluvial valley floors.


Sec. 3436.0-2  Objective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The objective of this subpart is to provide relief to persons holding leases for Federal coal deposits or fee title to coal deposits which underlie or are near alluvial valley floors and which cannot be mined through surface mining operations under section 510(b)(5) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, through the exchange of

lands, or interests therein, pursuant to the authority granted by the statutory provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Secretary shall exercise the authority to dispose of Federal coal deposits by lease to meet this objective when he/she determines that the exchange would serve the public interest. In determining whether such an exchange will serve the public interest, the Secretary will consider a wide variety of factors, including better Federal land management and the needs of State and local people, including needs for lands for the economy, community expansion, recreation areas, food, fiber, minerals and fish and wildlife. Unless consideration of the above factors would show otherwise, it will be assumed that an exchange will serve the public interest if substantial financial and legal commitments have been made toward development of the offered coal resource.


Sec. 3436.0-3  Authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> These regulations are issued under the authority of the statutes cited in Sec. 3400.0-3 of this title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> These regulations primarily implement section 510(b)(5) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1260(b)(5)).


Sec. 3436.0-5  Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">As used in this subpart, the term substantial financial and legal commitments is a relative one, and the determination whether such commitments have been made, so as to qualify a person for an exchange under this subpart, will be made on a case-by-case basis. In making this determination, the Secretary will consider the level of expenditures made prior to January 1, 1977, that are related to development of the coal resource which is offered in exchange, taken together with the damages for which the person would be liable as a result of any legal commitments made prior to January 1, 1977, in connection with development of said coal resource, and the Secretary will compare that level of expenditure to the estimated total cost of developing the coal resource to the point of establishing a producing surface coal mining operation.</p>
