with the following reference methods and calculation procedures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Method 2 in 40 CFR part 60 for velocity and volumetric flow rate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Method 18 or Method 25A in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, for organic content. If Method 25A is used, the organic HAP used as the calibration gas must be the single organic HAP representing the largest percent by volume of the emissions. The use of Method 25A is acceptable if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each performance test shall consist of three separate runs; each run conducted for at least 1 hour under the conditions that exist when the hazardous waste management unit is operating at the highest load or capacity level reasonably expected to occur.

where:

Operations during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a performance test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator of an affected facility shall provide, or cause to be provided, performance testing facilities as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sampling ports adequate for the test methods specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Safe sampling platform(s).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Safe access to sampling platform(s).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Utilities for sampling and testing equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For the purpose of making compliance determinations, the time-weighted average of the results of the three runs shall apply. In the event that a sample is accidentally lost or conditions occur in which one of the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown, failure of an irreplaceable portion of the sample train,

extreme meteorological conditions, or other circumstances beyond the owner or operator's control, compliance may, upon the Regional Administrator's approval, be determined using the average of the results of the two other runs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To show that a process vent associated with a hazardous waste distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, or air or steam stripping operation is not subject to the requirements of this subpart, the owner or operator must make an initial determination that the time-weighted, annual average total organic concentration of the waste managed by the waste management unit is less than 10 ppmw using one of the following two methods:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Direct measurement of the organic concentration of the waste using the following procedures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator must take a minimum of four grab samples of waste for each waste stream managed in the affected unit under process conditions expected to cause the maximum waste organic concentration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For waste generated onsite, the grab samples must be collected at a point before the waste is exposed to the atmosphere such as in an enclosed pipe or other closed system that is used to transfer the waste after generation to the first affected distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, or air or steam stripping operation. For waste generated offsite, the grab samples must be collected at the inlet to the first waste management unit that receives the waste provided the waste has been transferred to the facility in a closed system such as a tank truck and the waste is not diluted or mixed with other waste.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each sample shall be analyzed and the total organic concentration of the sample shall be computed using Method 9060A (incorporated by reference under 40 CFR 260.11) of ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,'' EPA Publication SW-846, or analyzed for its individual organic constituents.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The arithmetic mean of the results of the analyses of the four samples shall apply for each waste stream managed in the unit in determining the time-weighted, annual average total organic concentration of the waste. The time-weighted average is to be calculated using the annual quantity of each waste stream processed and the mean organic concentration of each waste stream managed in the unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Using knowledge of the waste to determine that its total organic concentration is less than 10 ppmw. Documentation of the waste determination is required. Examples of documentation that shall be used to support a determination under this provision include production process information documenting that no organic compounds are used, information that the waste is generated by a process that is identical to a process at the same or another facility that has previously been demonstrated by direct measurement to generate a waste stream having a total organic content less than 10 ppmw, or prior speciation analysis results on the same waste stream where it can also be documented that no process changes have occurred since that analysis that could affect the waste total organic concentration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The determination that distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, or air or steam stripping operations manage hazardous wastes with time-weighted, annual average total organic concentrations less than 10 ppmw shall be made as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By the effective date that the facility becomes subject to the provisions of this subpart or by the date when the waste is first managed in a waste management unit, whichever is later, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For continuously generated waste, annually, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whenever there is a change in the waste being managed or a change in the process that generates or treats the waste.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When an owner or operator and the Regional Administrator do not agree on whether a distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, or air or steam stripping operation manages a hazardous waste with organic concentrations of at least 10 ppmw based on knowledge of the waste, the dispute may be resolved

by using direct measurement as specified at paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
