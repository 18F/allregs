                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> SBA will announce interest rates with each disaster declaration.  If your business, together with its affiliates and principal owners, has  credit elsewhere, your interest rate is set by a statutory formula, but  will not exceed 8 percent per annum. If you do not have credit  elsewhere, your interest rate will not exceed 4 percent per annum. The  maturity of your loan depends upon your repayment ability, but cannot  exceed seven years if you have credit elsewhere.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Generally, you must pay equal monthly installments, of principal  and interest, beginning five months from the date of the loan as shown  on the Note. SBA will consider other payment terms if you have seasonal  or fluctuating income, and SBA may allow installment payments of varying  amounts over the first two years of the loan. There is no penalty for  prepayment for disaster loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For certain disaster business physical and economic injury  loans, an additional payment, based on a percentage of net earnings,  will be required to reduce the balance of the loan. This additional  payment will not be required until 5 years after repayment begins.  [61 FR 3304, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 75 FR 14333, Mar. 25, 2010; 77  FR 12157, Feb. 29, 2012]</p>
