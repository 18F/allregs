Sick leave is usually not  comparable to annual or vacation leave; it is generally intended to  provide income when the employee or a family member is ill and the  employee is unable to work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The employer may not require the employee to use accrued  vacation, annual, or similar leave during a period of service in the  uniformed services.</p><p class="depth2">Health Plan Coverage</p>
