However, not more than two fluids will be tested consecutively for one applicant provided other applications are pending. If a fluid fails to meet any of the requirements, it shall lose its order of precedence. If an application is submitted to resume testing after correction of the course of failure, it will be treated as a new application and the order of precedence for testing will be so determined.</p>
