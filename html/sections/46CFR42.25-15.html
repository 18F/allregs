                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Openings in the weather deck over which cargo is  stowed shall be securely closed and battened down. The ventilators shall  be efficiently protected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Timber deck cargo shall extend over at least the entire  available length which is the total length of the well or wells between  superstructures. Where there is no limiting superstructure at the after  end, the timber shall extend at least to the after end of the aftermost  hatchway. The timber shall be stowed as solidly as possible, to at least  the standard height of a superstructure other than a raised quarter  deck.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> On a vessel within a seasonal winter zone in winter, the height  of the deck cargo above the weather deck shall not exceed one-third of  the extreme breadth of the vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The timber deck cargo shall be compactly stowed, lashed, and  secured. It shall not interfere in any way with the navigation and  necessary work of the vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upright. (1) Uprights, when required by the nature of the  timber, shall be of adequate strength considering the breadth of the  vessel; the spacing shall be suitable for the length and character of  timber carried, but shall not exceed 9.8 feet. Strong angles or metal  sockets or equally efficient means shall be provided for securing the  uprights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Lashings. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Timber deck cargo shall be efficiently secured  throughout its length by independent overall lashings spaced not more  than 9.8 feet apart. Eye plates for these lashings shall be efficiently  attached to the sheer strake or to the deck stringer plate at intervals  of not more than 9.8 feet. The distance from an end bulkhead of a  superstructure to the first eye plate shall be not more than 6.6 feet.  Eye plates and lashings shall be provided 23\1/2\ inches and 4.9 feet  from the ends of timber deck cargoes where there is no bulkhead.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lashings shall be not less than \3/4\-inch close link chain or  flexible wire rope of equivalent strength, fitted with sliphooks and  turnbuckles, which shall be accessible at all times. Wire rope lashings  shall have a short length of long link chain to permit the length of  lashings to be regulated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When timber is in lengths less than 11.8 feet the spacing of the  lashings shall be reduced or other suitable provisions made to suit the  length of timber.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All fittings required for securing the lashings shall be of  strength corresponding to the length of the lashings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Stability. (1) Provision shall be made for a safe margin of  stability at all stages of the voyage, regard being given to additions  of weight, such as those due to absorption of water and icing and to  losses of weight such as those due to consumption of fuel and stores.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> guardrails or life  lines spaced not more than 13 inches apart vertically shall be provided  on each side of the deck cargo to a height of at least 39\1/2\ inches  above the cargo.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Steering arrangements. (1) Steering arrangements shall be  effectively protected from damage by cargo and, as far as practicable,  shall be accessible. Efficient provision, shall be made for steering in  the event of a breakdown in the main steering arrangements.
