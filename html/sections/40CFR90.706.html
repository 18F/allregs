Each engine will be selected from the end of the assembly line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For newly certified engine families: After two engines are tested, the manufacturer will calculate the required sample size for the model year for each pollutant (HC+NOX(NMHC+NOX) and CO) according to the Sample Size Equation in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For carry-over engine families: After one engine is tested, the manufacturer will combine the test with the last test result from the previous model year and then calculate the required sample size for the model year for each pollutant according to the Sample Size Equation in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> Manufacturers will calculate the required sample size for the model year for each pollutant for each engine family using the Sample Size Equation in this paragraph. N is calculated for each pollutant from each test result. The higher of the two values for the number N indicates the number of tests required for the model year for an engine family. N is recalculated for each pollutant after each test. Test results used to calculate the variables in the following Sample Size Equation must be final deteriorated test results as specified in Sec. 90.709(c).

However, such additional test results may be used as appropriate to ``bracket'' or define the boundaries of the production duration of any emission nonconformity determined under this subpart. Such additional test data must be identified and provided to EPA with the submittal of the official CumSum results.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The manufacturer must produce and assemble the test engines using its normal production and assembly process for engines to be distributed into commerce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No quality control, testing, or assembly procedures shall be used on any test engine or any portion thereof, including parts and subassemblies, that have not been or will not be used during the production and assembly of all other engines of that family, unless the Administrator approves the modification in production or assembly procedures in advance.
