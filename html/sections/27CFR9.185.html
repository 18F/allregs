For purposes of part 4 of this chapter, ``Texoma'' is a term of viticultural significance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approved Maps. The appropriate maps for determining the boundaries of the Texoma viticultural area are two United States Geological Survey, 1:250,000 scale, topographic maps.
