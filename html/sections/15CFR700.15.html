Therefore, the inclusion of the rating will continue from contractor to subcontractor to supplier throughout the entire supply chain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A person must use rated orders with suppliers to obtain items needed to fill an emergency preparedness rated order. That person must require acceptance or rejection, and transmission of that acceptance or rejection by the supplier within the time limit stated in the rated order that is being filled.
