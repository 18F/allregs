This paragraph applies to motors, motor circuits, and controllers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If specified in paragraph (j)(4) of this section that one piece of equipment shall be ``within sight of'' another piece of equipment, the piece of equipment shall be visible and not more than 15.24 m (50.0 ft) from the other.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An individual disconnecting means shall be provided for each controller. A disconnecting means shall be located within sight of the controller location. However, a single disconnecting means may be located adjacent to a group of coordinated controllers mounted adjacent to each other on a multi-motor continuous process machine. The controller disconnecting means for motor branch circuits over 600 volts, nominal, may be out of sight of the controller, if the controller is marked with a warning label giving the location and identification of the disconnecting means that is to be locked in the open position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The disconnecting means shall disconnect the motor and the controller from all ungrounded supply conductors and shall be so designed that no pole can be operated independently.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The disconnecting means shall plainly indicate whether it is in the open (off) or closed (on) position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The disconnecting means shall be readily accessible. If more than one disconnect is provided for the same equipment, only one need be readily accessible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> An individual disconnecting means shall be provided for each motor, but a single disconnecting means may be used for a group of motors under any one of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If a number of motors drive several parts of a single machine or piece of apparatus, such as a metal or woodworking machine, crane, or hoist;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If a group of motors is under the protection of one set of branch-circuit protective devices; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If a group of motors is in a single room within sight of the location of the disconnecting means.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Motors, motor-control apparatus, and motor branch-circuit conductors shall be protected against overheating due to motor overloads or failure to start, and against short-circuits or ground faults. These provisions do not require overload protection that will stop a motor where a shutdown is likely to introduce additional or increased hazards, as in the case of fire pumps, or where continued operation of a motor is necessary for a safe shutdown of equipment or process and motor overload sensing devices are connected to a supervised alarm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Where live parts of motors or controllers operating at over 150 volts to ground are guarded against accidental contact only by location, and where adjustment or other attendance may be necessary during the operation of the apparatus, suitable insulating mats or platforms shall be provided so that the attendant cannot readily touch live parts unless standing on the mats or platforms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Transformers.
