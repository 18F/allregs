The record should be in such form as to contain the information required to be shown on the quarterly contribution report. All records required by the regulations in this part shall be kept at a safe and convenient location accessible to inspection by the Board or any of its officers or employees, or by the Inspector General of the Railroad Retirement Board. Such records shall be at all times open for inspection by such officers or employees.
