                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Active duty members covered. In addition to Uniformed Services  beneficiaries covered by other provisions of this part, this section  also applies to active duty members of the Uniformed Services. As used  in this section, ``beneficiaries'' includes active duty members.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effect of concurrent applicability of the Federal Medical Care  Recovery Act--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. In many cases covered by this section, the  United States has a right to collect under both 10 U.S.C. 1095 and the  Federal Medical Care Recovery Act (FMCRA), Pub. L. 87-693 (42 U.S.C.  2651 et seq.). In such cases, the authority is concurrent and the United  States may pursue collection under both statutory authorities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cases involving tort liability. In cases in which the right of  the United States to collect from the automobile liability insurance  carrier is premised on establishing some tort liability on some third  person, matters regarding the determination of such tort liability shall  be governed by the same substantive standards as would be applied under  the FMCRA including reliance on state law for determinations regarding  tort liability. In addition, the provisions of 28 CFR part 43  (Department of Justice regulations pertaining to the FMCRA) shall apply  to claims made under the concurrent authority of the FMCRA and 10 U.S.C.  1095. All other matters and procedures concerning the right of the  United States to collect shall, if a claim is made under the concurrent  authority of the FMCRA and this section, be governed by 10 U.S.C. 1095  and this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exclusion of automobile liability insurance and no-fault  automobile insurance plans prior to November 5, 1990. This   section is not applicable to automobile liability insurance and no-fault  automobile insurance plans:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That have been in continuous effect without amendment since  prior to November 5, 1990; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For which the facility of the Uniformed Services (or other  authorized representative of the United States) makes a determination,  based on documentation provided by the third party payer, that the  policy or plan clearly excludes payment for services covered by this  section. Plans entered into, amended or renewed on or after November 5,  1990, are subject to this section, as are prior plans that do not  clearly exclude payment for services covered by this section.
