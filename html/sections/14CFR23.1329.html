                            <p class="depth0">If an automatic pilot system is installed, it must meet the  following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each system must be designed so that the automatic pilot can--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be quickly and positively disengaged by the pilots to prevent it  from interfering with their control of the airplane; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be sufficiently overpowered by one pilot to let him control the  airplane.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section are  applied, the quick release (emergency) control must be located on the  control wheel (both control wheels if the airplane can be operated from  either pilot seat) on the side opposite the throttles, or on the stick  control, (both stick controls, if the airplane can be operated from  either pilot seat) such that it can be operated without moving the hand  from its normal position on the control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unless there is automatic synchronization, each system must have  a means to readily indicate to the pilot the alignment of the actuating  device in relation to the control system it operates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each manually operated control for the system operation must be  readily accessible to the pilot. Each control must operate in the same  plane and sense of motion as specified in Sec. 23.779 for cockpit  controls. The direction of motion must be plainly indicated on or near  each control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each system must be designed and adjusted so that, within the  range of adjustment available to the pilot, it cannot produce hazardous  loads on the airplane or create hazardous deviations in the flight path,  under any flight condition appropriate to its use, either during normal  operation or in the event of a malfunction, assuming that corrective  action begins within a reasonable period of time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each system must be designed so that a single malfunction will  not produce a hardover signal in more than one control axis. If the  automatic pilot   integrates signals from auxiliary controls or furnishes signals for  operation of other equipment, positive interlocks and sequencing of  engagement to prevent improper operation are required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> There must be protection against adverse interaction of  integrated components, resulting from a malfunction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If the automatic pilot system can be coupled to airborne  navigation equipment, means must be provided to indicate to the flight  crew the current mode of operation. Selector switch position is not  acceptable as a means of indication.  [Doc. No. 4080, 29 FR 17955, Dec. 18, 1964; 30 FR 258, Jan. 9, 1965, as  amended by Amdt. 23-23, 43 FR 50593, Oct. 30, 1978; Amdt. 23-43, 58 FR  18976, Apr. 9, 1993; Amdt. 23-49, 61 FR 5169, Feb. 9, 1996]</p>
