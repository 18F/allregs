                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of Sec. 1.1016-9,  relating to mutual savings banks, building and loan associations, and  cooperative banks.) The basis of a fully taxable bond purchased at a  premium shall be adjusted from the date of the election to amortize such  premium in accordance with the provisions of section 171 except that no  adjustment shall be allowable for such portion of the premium  attributable to the period prior to the election.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amortization of mortgage premium. In the case of a mortgage  acquired at a premium where the principal of such mortgage is payable in  installments, adjustments to the basis for the premium must be made for  all taxable years (whether or not the association was exempt from tax  under section 521 during such years) in which installment payments are  received. Such adjustments may be made on an individual mortgage basis  or on a composite basis by reference to the average period of payments  of the mortgage loans of such association. For the purpose of this  adjustment, the term premium includes the excess of the acquisition  value of the mortgage over its maturity value. The acquisition value of  the mortgage is the cost including buying commissions, attorneys' fees,  or brokerage fees, but such value does not include amounts paid for  accrued interest.
