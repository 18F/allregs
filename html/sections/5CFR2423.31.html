                                Sec. 2423.31  Powers and duties of the Administrative Law Judge at the hearing.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Conduct of hearing. The Administrative Law Judge shall conduct the hearing in a fair, impartial, and judicial manner, taking action as needed to avoid unnecessary delay and maintain order during the proceedings. The Administrative Law Judge may take any action necessary to schedule, conduct, continue, control, and regulate the hearing, including ruling on motions and taking official notice of material facts when appropriate. No provision of these regulations shall be construed to limit the powers of the Administrative Law Judge provided by 5 U.S.C. 556, 557, and other applicable provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evidence. The Administrative Law Judge shall receive evidence and inquire fully into the relevant and material facts concerning the matters that are the subject of the hearing. The Administrative Law Judge may exclude any evidence that is immaterial, irrelevant, unduly repetitious, or customarily privileged. Rules of evidence shall not be strictly followed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interlocutory appeals. Motions for an interlocutory appeal shall be filed in writing with the Administrative Law Judge within 5 days after the date of the contested ruling. The motion shall state why interlocutory review is appropriate, and why the Authority should modify or reverse the contested ruling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Judge shall grant the motion and certify the contested ruling to the Authority if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The ruling involves an important question of law or policy about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Immediate review will materially advance completion of the proceeding, or the denial of immediate review will cause undue harm to a party or the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the motion is granted, the Judge or Authority may stay the hearing during the pendency of the appeal. If the motion is denied, exceptions to the contested ruling may be filed in accordance with Sec. 2423.40 of this subchapter after the Judge issues a decision and recommended order in the case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Bench decisions. Upon joint motion of the parties, the Administrative Law Judge may issue an oral decision at the close of the hearing when, in the Judge's discretion, the nature of the case so warrants. By so moving, the parties waive their right to file posthearing briefs with the Administrative Law Judge, pursuant to Sec. 2423.33. If the decision is announced orally, it shall satisfy the requirements of Sec. 2423.34(a)(1)-(5) and a copy thereof, excerpted from the transcript, together with any supplementary matter the judge may deem necessary to complete the decision, shall be transmitted to the Authority, in accordance with Sec. 2423.34(b), and furnished to the parties in accordance with Sec. 2429.12 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Settlements after the opening of the hearing. As set forth in Sec. 2423.25(a), settlements may be either informal or formal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Informal settlement procedure: Judge's approval of withdrawal. If the Charging Party and the Respondent enter into an informal settlement agreement that is accepted by the Regional Director, the Regional Director may request the Administrative Law Judge for permission to withdraw the complaint and, having been granted such permission, shall withdraw the complaint and approve the informal settlement between the Charging Party and Respondent. If the Charging Party fails or refuses to become a party to an informal settlement agreement offered by the Respondent, and the Regional Director concludes that the offered settlement will effectuate the policies of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, the Regional Director shall enter into the agreement with the Respondent and shall, if

granted permission by the Administrative Law Judge, withdraw the complaint. The Charging Party then may obtain a review of the Regional Director's decision as provided in subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Formal settlement procedure: Judge's approval of settlement. If the Charging Party and the Respondent enter into a formal settlement agreement that is accepted by the Regional Director, the Regional Director may request the Administrative Law Judge to approve such formal settlement agreement, and upon such approval, to transmit the agreement to the Authority for approval. If the Charging Party fails or refuses to become a party to a formal settlement agreement offered by the Respondent, and the Regional Director concludes that the offered settlement will effectuate the policies of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, the agreement shall be between the Respondent and the Regional Director. After the Charging Party is given an opportunity to state on the record or in writing the reasons for opposing the formal settlement, the Regional Director may request the Administrative Law Judge to approve such formal settlement agreement, and upon such approval, to transmit the agreement to the Authority for approval.</p>
