                                Sec. 134.205  The appeal file, confidential information, and protective
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The appeal file. The appeal file includes: all pleadings and  other submissions; all admitted evidence; any recordings and transcripts  of proceedings; the solicitation and amendments; in the case of an  appeal of an SBA determination, the entire record on which that  determination was based (i.e., the administrative record, protest file,  area office file); and any orders and decisions that have been issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Confidential business and financial information. An appeal file  usually contains confidential business and financial information  pertaining to the party whose eligibility (as a small business, SDVO  SBC, etc.) is at issue. A party may redact its own confidential business  and financial information from the copies of its submissions it must  serve on other non-government parties (usually protesters). A party  served with redacted submissions must file and serve any objections to  the redactions within two business days of its receipt of the  submissions. The Judge then will rule on the objections   and, if necessary, order the service of revised submissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Public access. Except for confidential business and financial  information, source selection sensitive information, income tax returns,  and other exempt information, the appeal file is available to the public  pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Party access. A party in a pending appeal may examine and copy  the party's own submissions as well as any information in the appeal  file that is not exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. Party access to  the appeal file in a pending appeal does not require a FOIA request or a  protective order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Counsel's access under a protective order. On request, OHA will  issue a protective order under which outside counsel for a non- government party in a pending appeal may be admitted, to examine and  copy the appeal file (except for tax returns and privileged  information). The protective order will set out the terms to which  counsel must agree. The terms will restrict counsel's use of the  protected information to the pending appeal and will prohibit any  further disclosure. Violations of the terms of a protective order may  result in sanctions to the party and referral of the attorney to bar  disciplinary authorities. OHA's Web site contains detailed information  on the protective order procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Decisions. OHA decisions are normally published without  redactions on OHA's Web site. A decision may contain confidential  business and financial information where that information is either  decisionally-significant or otherwise necessary for a comprehensible  decision. Where no protective order is in place, a party may request a  redacted public decision by contacting OHA. Where a protective order is  in place, the Judge will usually issue the unredacted decision under the  protective order and then a redacted version for public release.
