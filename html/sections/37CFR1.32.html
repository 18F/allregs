The principal executes a power of attorney designating one or more patent practitioners or joint inventors to act on the principal's behalf.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Revocation means the cancellation by the principal of the authority previously given to a patent practitioner or joint inventor to act on the principal's behalf.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Customer Number means a number that may be used to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Designate the correspondence address of a patent application or patent such that the correspondence address for the patent application, patent or other patent proceeding would be the address associated with the Customer Number;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Designate the fee address (Sec.  1.363) of a patent such that the fee address for the patent would be the address associated with the Customer Number; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Submit a list of patent practitioners such that those patent practitioners associated with the Customer Number would have power of attorney.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Patent practitioner of record means a patent practitioner who has been granted a power of attorney in an application, patent, or other proceeding in compliance with paragraph (b) of this section. The phrases practitioner of record and attorney or agent of record also mean a patent practitioner who has been granted a power of attorney in an application, patent, or other proceeding in compliance with paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A power of attorney must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be in writing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Name one or more representatives in compliance with paragraph (c) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Give the representative power to act on behalf of the principal; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Be signed by the applicant for patent (Sec.  1.42) or the patent owner.

This provision does not preclude a practitioner from acting pursuant to Sec.  1.34, if applicable.
