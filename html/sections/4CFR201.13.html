                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Business information obtained by the Board from a  submitter shall be disclosed under the FOIA only under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Business information--commercial or financial records obtained  by the Board that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of  the FOIA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submitter--any person or entity from which the Board obtains  business records, either directly or indirectly. The term includes but  is not limited to corporations and state, local, tribal, and foreign  governments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Designation of business information. Submitters of business  information shall designate any part of the record considered to be  protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA by appropriately  marking the material. This may be done either at the time the record is  submitted or at a reasonable time thereafter. This designation lasts for  10 years after submittal unless the submitter requests and provides  justification for a longer period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice to submitters. The Board shall provide a business  submitter with prompt written notice of any FOIA request or appeal that  seeks its business information under paragraph (e) of this section,  except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, to give the  submitter an opportunity to object to that disclosure under paragraph  (f) of this section. The notice shall either describe the records  requested or include copies of the records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Required notice. The Board shall give notice of a FOIA request  seeking business information when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The submitter has designated that the information is considered  protected   from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Board has reason to believe that the information may be  protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Objecting to disclosure. A submitter shall have 30 days to  respond to the notice described in paragraph (d) of this section. If a  submitter has an objection to disclosure, it is required to submit a  detailed written statement including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All grounds for withholding any of the information under any  exemption of the FOIA, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of Exemption 4, the reason why the information is a  trade secret, commercial, or financial information that is privileged or  confidential.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a submitter fails to respond to the notice in paragraph (d)  of this section within 30 days, the Board shall assume that the  submitter has no objection to disclosure. The Board shall not consider  information not received by the Board until after a disclosure decision  has been made. Information provided by a submitter under this paragraph  might itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notice of intent to disclose. The Board shall consider a  submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in  deciding whether to disclose the business records. Whenever the Board  decides to disclose business records over the objection of a submitter,  it shall give the submitter written notice, that will include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of the reason(s) the submitter's objections were not  sustained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the business records to be disclosed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A specified disclosure date at a reasonable time subsequent to  the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Exceptions to notice requirements. The notice requirements in  paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section shall not apply if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Board determines that the information should not be  disclosed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information has been published legally or has been  officially made available to the public;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclosure of the information is required by another statute or  by a regulation issued in accordance with Executive Order 12600 (3 CFR,  1987 Comp., p. 235); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The objection made by the submitter under paragraph (f) of this  section appears frivolous. In such a case, the Board shall promptly  notify the submitter of its decision using the guidelines in paragraph  (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Notice of FOIA lawsuit. When a requestor files a lawsuit seeking  to compel the disclosure of business information, the Board shall  promptly notify the submitter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Corresponding notice to requestors. When the Board provides a  submitter with either notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure  under paragraph (d) of this section or with its intent to disclose  requested information under paragraph (g) of this section, the Board  also shall notify the requestor(s). When a submitter files a lawsuit  seeking to prevent the disclosure of business information, the Board  shall notify the requestor(s).</p>
