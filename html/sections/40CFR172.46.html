                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When to submit a Notification. A Notification shall be submitted  for approval at least 90 days prior to the initiation of the proposed  test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>,  Attention: Biotechnology Notification Review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> How to format a Notification. A Notification submitted under  this section must comply with the following procedures, but is not  required to comply with the format and other provisions governing  submission of data in Sec. Sec. 158.32 and 158.33 or Sec. Sec. 161.32  and 161.33 of this chapter. However, because data submitted with the  Notification may subsequently be used to support other regulatory  actions (e.g., used in EUP or registration applications), it is  recommended that such data comply with EPA requirements in Sec. Sec.  158.32 and 158.33 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each Notification must be accompanied by a transmittal document  that clearly identifies the EPA action supported as a Biotechnology  Notification Review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Five copies of each Notification must be submitted to EPA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any claims of confidentiality for information submitted in the  Notification must be made as described in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> How to make confidential business information (CBI) claims in a  Notification. Although it is strongly recommended that the submitter  minimize the amount of data and other information claimed as CBI, a  submitter may assert a claim of confidentiality for all or part of the  information submitted to EPA in a Notification (See part 2, subpart B of  this chapter). To assert such a claim, the submitter must comply with  the following procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any claim of confidentiality must accompany the information at  the time the information is submitted to EPA. Failure to assert a claim  at that time will be considered a waiver of confidentiality for the  information submitted, and the information may be made available to the  public, subject to section 10(g) of the Act, with no further notice to  the submitter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Of the five copies of the Notification required by paragraph (c)  of this section, four copies must be complete with the information that  is claimed confidential clearly marked in the manner described in Sec.  2.203(b) of this chapter. All information claimed as confidential must  be deleted from the fifth copy, but it must be otherwise complete. The  first page of the fifth copy must be marked ``Contains no information  claimed as confidential.'' EPA may include the fifth copy in a public  file without further notice. EPA will consider incomplete a Notification  containing information claimed as CBI that is not submitted in  accordance with this paragraph and will suspend the review period on the  Notification until such procedures are followed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any claim of confidentiality must be accompanied, at the time  the claim is made, by comments substantiating the claim and explaining  why the submitter believes that the information should not be disclosed.  The submitter should refer to Sec. 2.204(e)(4) of this chapter for  points to address in the substantiation. If such comments are themselves  claimed confidential and are marked confidential when submitted to EPA,  they will be treated as such in accordance with Sec. 2.205(c) of this  chapter. EPA will consider incomplete all Notifications containing  information claimed as CBI that are not accompanied by substantiation,  and will suspend the review period on such Notifications until the  required substantiation is provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> EPA will disclose information that is subject to a claim of  confidentiality asserted under this section only to the extent and by  means of the procedures set forth in section 10 of the Act, in this  subpart, and in part 2 of this chapter.
