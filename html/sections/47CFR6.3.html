Provide at least one mode that does not require user vision.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Operable with low vision and limited or no hearing. Provide at least one mode that permits operation by users with visual acuity between 20/70 and 20/200, without relying on audio output.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Operable with little or no color perception. Provide at least one mode that does not require user color perception.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Operable without hearing. Provide at least one mode that does not require user auditory perception.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Operable with limited manual dexterity. Provide at least one mode that does not require user fine motor control or simultaneous actions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Operable with limited reach and strength. Provide at least one mode that is operable with user limited reach and strength.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Operable with a Prosthetic Device. Controls shall be operable without requiring body contact or close body proximity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Operable without time-dependent controls. Provide at least one mode that does not require a response time or allows response time to be by-passed or adjusted by the user over a wide range.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Operable without speech. Provide at least one mode that does not require user speech.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Operable with limited cognitive skills. Provide at least one mode that minimizes the cognitive, memory, language, and learning skills required of the user.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All information necessary to operate and use the product, including but not limited to, text, static or dynamic images, icons, labels, sounds, or incidental operating cues, comply with each of the following, assessed independently:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Availability of visual information. Provide visual information through at least one mode in auditory form.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Availability of visual information for low vision users. Provide visual information through at least one mode to users with visual acuity between 20/70 and 20/200 without relying on audio.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Access to moving text. Provide moving text in at least one static presentation mode at the option of the user.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Availability of auditory information. Provide auditory information through at least one mode in visual form and, where appropriate, in tactile form.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Availability of auditory information for people who are hard of hearing. Provide audio or acoustic information, including any auditory feedback tones that are important for the use of the product, through at least one mode in enhanced auditory fashion (i.e., increased amplification, increased signal-to-noise ratio, or combination).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Prevention of visually-induced seizures. Visual displays and indicators shall minimize visual flicker that might induce seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Availability of audio cutoff. Where a product delivers audio output through an external speaker, provide an industry standard connector for headphones or personal listening devices (e.g., phone-like handset or earcup) which cuts off the speaker(s) when used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Non-interference with hearing technologies. Reduce interference to hearing technologies (including hearing aids, cochlear implants, and assistive listening devices) to the lowest possible level that allows a user to utilize the product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Hearing aid coupling. Where a product delivers output by an audio transducer which is normally held up

to the ear, provide a means for effective wireless coupling to hearing aids.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The term compatibility shall mean compatible with peripheral devices and specialized customer premises equipment commonly used by individuals with disabilities to achieve accessibility to telecommunications services, and in compliance with the following provisions, as applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> External electronic access to all information and control mechanisms. Information needed for the operation of products (including output, alerts, icons, on-line help, and documentation) shall be available in a standard electronic text format on a cross-industry standard port and all input to and control of a product shall allow for real time operation by electronic text input into a cross-industry standard external port and in cross-industry standard format. The cross-industry standard port shall not require manipulation of a connector by the user.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Connection point for external audio processing devices. Products providing auditory output shall provide the auditory signal at a standard signal level through an industry standard connector.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> TTY connectability. Products which provide a function allowing voice communication and which do not themselves provide a TTY functionality shall provide a standard non-acoustic connection point for TTYs. It shall also be possible for the user to easily turn any microphone on and off to allow the user to intermix speech with TTY use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> TTY signal compatibility. Products, including those providing voice communication functionality, shall support use of all cross-manufacturer non-proprietary standard signals used by TTYs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The term customer premises equipment shall mean equipment employed on the premises of a person (other than a carrier) to originate, route, or terminate telecommunications. For purposes of this part, the term customer premises equipment shall include equipment employed on the premises of a person (other than a carrier) that is specially designed to provide interconnected VoIP service and that is needed for the effective use of an interconnected VoIP service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The term disability shall mean a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual; a record of such an impairment; or being regarded as having such an impairment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The term interconnected VoIP service shall have the same meaning as in Sec. 9.3 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The term manufacturer shall mean an entity that makes or produces a product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The term peripheral devices shall mean devices employed in connection with equipment covered by this part to translate, enhance, or otherwise transform telecommunications into a form accessible to individuals with disabilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The term readily achievable shall mean, in general, easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense.
