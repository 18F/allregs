ground water in the region surrounding Yucca Mountain;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Careful sealing of the borehole does not occur, instead natural degradation processes gradually modify the borehole;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Only releases of radionuclides that occur as a result of the intrusion and that are transported through the resulting borehole to the saturated zone are projected; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> No releases are included which are caused by unlikely natural processes and events.</p><p class="depth2">Ground Water Protection Standards</p>
