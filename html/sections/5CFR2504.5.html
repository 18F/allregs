Due to security measures at the Old and New Executive Office Buildings, requests made in person can only be accepted from current Office employees, who should make access requests to the Privacy Act Officer on regularly scheduled work days between 9:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The request for access should contain the same information set forth in Sec. 2504.4(b). However, if the request for access follows a request made under Sec. 2504.4(a) and (b) of this part, the same identifying information need not be included: Provided, That a copy of the prior request or a copy of the Office's response to that request is attached. The request should state if a copy of the record is desired.
