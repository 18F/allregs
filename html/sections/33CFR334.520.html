An area in the eastern part of Lake George  described as follows: Beginning at latitude 291316", longitude  813428"; thence along a line parallel to the navigation channel to  latitude 292005", longitude 813615"; thence along a line about  three-fifths mile southerly from the Putnam-Volusia County line to  latitude 292019", longitude 813512"; thence to latitude 291836",  longitude 813353"; thence to latitude 291322", longitude 813238";  and thence to the point of beginning. The area will be marked by  appropriate warnings signs at the five corners and at the midpoint of  the longer side.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The regulations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Bombing operations will be confined, as  nearly as practicable, to the north-south center line of the danger  zone, keeping well clear of the navigation channel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to each bombing operation the danger zone will be  patrolled by naval aircraft which will warn all persons and vessels to  leave the area by ``zooming'' a safe distance to the side and at least  500 feet above the surface. Upon being so warned, such persons and  vessels shall leave the danger zone immediately and shall not re-enter  the danger zone until bombing operations have ceased.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At intervals of not more than three months, public notices will  be issued that bombing operations are continuing. Such notices will  appear in the local newspaper and in ``Notice to Mariners''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The regulations in this section shall not deny passage through  Lake George by regular cargo-carrying vessels proceeding along  established lanes for such vessels. When any such vessel is within the  danger zone the officer in charge of the bombing operations will cause  the cessation or postponement of such operations until the vessel has  cleared the area. The vessel shall proceed on its normal course and  shall not delay its progress.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The regulations in this section shall be enforced by the  Commander, Naval Air Bases, Sixth Naval District, Naval Air Station,  Jacksonville, Florida, and such agencies as he may designate.
