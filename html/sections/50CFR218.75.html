The Navy shall provide NMFS with species or description of the animal(s), the condition of the animal(s) (including carcass condition if the animal is dead), location, time of first discovery, observed behaviors (if alive), and photo or video (if available). The Navy shall consult the Stranding Response Plan to obtain more specific reporting requirements for specific circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Vessel Strike--In the event that a Navy vessel strikes a whale, the Navy shall do the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Immediately report to NMFS (pursuant to the established Communication Protocol) the:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Species identification if known;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Location (latitude/longitude) of the animal (or location of the strike if the animal has disappeared);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether the animal is alive or dead (or unknown); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The time of the strike.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> As soon as feasible, the Navy shall report to or provide to NMFS, the:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Size, length, and description (critical if species is not known) of animal;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An estimate of the injury status (e.g., dead, injured but alive, injured and moving, blood or tissue observed in the water, status unknown, disappeared, etc.);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Description of the behavior of the whale during event, immediately after the strike, and following the strike (until the report is made or the animal is no long sighted);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Vessel class/type and operation status;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Vessel length</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Vessel speed and heading; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> To the best extent possible, obtain</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Within 2 weeks of the strike, provide NMFS:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A detailed description of the specific actions of the vessel in the 30-minute timeframe immediately preceding the strike, during the event, and immediately after the strike (e.g., the speed and changes in speed, the direction and changes in the direction, other maneuvers, sonar use, etc., if not classified); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A narrative description of marine mammal sightings during the event and immediately after, and any information as to sightings prior to the strike, if available; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Use established Navy shipboard procedures to make a camera available to attempt to capture photographs following a ship strike.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Annual HSTT Monitoring Plan Report--(1) The Navy shall submit an annual report for the HSTT Monitoring Plan in April of each year, describing the implementation and results from the previous calendar year. Data collection methods will be standardized across range complexes and study areas to allow for comparison in different geographic locations. Although additional information will be gathered, the protected species observers collecting marine mammal data pursuant to the HSTT Monitoring Plan shall, at a minimum, provide the same marine mammal observation data required in Sec.  218.75. (2) As an alternative, the Navy may submit a multi-Range Complex annual Monitoring Plan report to fulfill this requirement. Such a report would describe progress of knowledge made with respect to monitoring plan study questions across all Navy ranges associated with the ICMP. Similar study questions shall be treated together so that progress on each topic shall be summarized across all Navy ranges. The report need not include analyses and content that does not provide direct assessment of cumulative progress on the monitoring plan study questions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Annual HSTT Exercise and Testing Reports--The Navy shall submit preliminary reports detailing the status of authorized sound sources within 21 days after the end of the annual authorization cycle.
