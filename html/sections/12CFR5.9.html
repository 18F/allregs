                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The OCC provides a copy of the public file to any  person who requests it. A requestor should submit a request for the  public file concerning a pending application to the appropriate district  office. A requestor should submit a request for the public file  concerning a decided or closed application to the Disclosure Officer,  Communications Division, at the address listed in the Manual. Requests  should be in writing. The OCC may impose a fee in accordance with 12 CFR  4.17 and with the rates the OCC publishes annually in the ``Notice of  Comptroller of the Currency Fees'' described in 12 CFR 8.8.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Public file. A public file consists of the portions of the  filing, supporting data, supplementary information, and information  submitted by interested persons, to the extent that those documents have  not been afforded confidential treatment. Applicants and other  interested persons may request that confidential treatment be afforded  information submitted to the OCC pursuant to paragraph (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Confidential treatment. The applicant or an interested person  submitting information may request that specific information be treated  as confidential under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 (see  12 CFR 4.12(b)). A submitter should draft its request for confidential  treatment narrowly to extend only to those portions of a document it  considers to be confidential. If a submitter requests confidential  treatment for information that the OCC does not consider to be  confidential, the OCC may include that information in the public file  after providing notice to the submitter. Moreover, at its own  initiative, the OCC may determine that certain information should be  treated as confidential and withhold that information from the public  file. A person requesting information withheld from the public file  should submit the request to the Disclosure Officer, Communications  Division, under the procedures described in 12 CFR part 4, subpart B.  That request may be subject to the predisclosure notice procedures of 12  CFR 4.16.</p>
