                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must record the information specified in Sec. 63.11553(c)(2) to document conformance with the management practices plan required in Sec. 63.11550(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, if you own or operate an existing affected source at a large foundry, you must conduct visible emissions monitoring according to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must conduct visual monitoring of the fabric filter discharge point(s) (outlets) for any VE according to the schedule specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must perform a visual determination of emissions once per day, on each day the process is in operation, during melting operations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If no VE are detected in consecutive daily visual monitoring performed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for 30 consecutive days or more of operation of the process, you may decrease the frequency of visual monitoring to once per calendar week of time the process is in operation, during melting operations. If VE are detected during these inspections, you must resume daily visual monitoring of that operation during each day that the process is in operation, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section until you satisfy the criteria of this section to resume conducting weekly visual monitoring.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the visual monitoring reveals the presence of any VE, you must initiate procedures to determine the cause of the emissions within 1 hour of the initial observation and alleviate the cause of the emissions within 3 hours of initial observation by taking whatever corrective action(s) are necessary. You may take more than 3 hours to alleviate a specific condition that causes VE if you identify in the monitoring plan this specific condition as one that could lead to VE in advance, you adequately explain why it is not feasible to alleviate this condition within 3 hours of the time the VE occurs, and you demonstrate that the requested time will ensure alleviation of this condition as expeditiously as practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As an alternative to the monitoring requirements for an existing affected source in paragraphs (b)(1) and

(2) of this section, you may install, operate, and maintain a bag leak detection system for each fabric filter according to the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you own or operate a new affected source located at a large foundry subject to the PM requirements in Sec. 63.11550(b)(2) that is equipped with a fabric filter, you must install, operate, and maintain a bag leak detection system for each fabric filter according to paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each bag leak detection system must meet the specifications and requirements in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (viii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting PM emissions at concentrations of 1 milligram per actual cubic meter (0.00044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of relative PM loadings. You must continuously record the output from the bag leak detection system using electronic or other means (e.g., using a strip chart recorder or a data logger).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm system that will sound when the system detects an increase in relative particulate loading over the alarm set point established according to paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, and the alarm must be located such that it can be heard by the appropriate plant personnel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In the initial adjustment of the bag leak detection system, you must establish, at a minimum, the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity (range) and the averaging period of the device, the alarm set points, and the alarm delay time.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Following initial adjustment, you must not adjust the averaging period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time without approval from the Administrator or delegated authority, except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Once per quarter, you may adjust the sensitivity of the bag leak detection system to account for seasonal effects, including temperature and humidity, according to the procedures identified in the site-specific monitoring plan required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> You must install the bag leak detection sensor downstream of the fabric filter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must prepare a site-specific monitoring plan for each bag leak detection system. You must operate and maintain each bag leak detection system according to the plan at all times. Each monitoring plan must describe the items in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Installation of the bag leak detection system;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection system, including how the alarm set-point and alarm delay time will be established;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Operation of the bag leak detection system, including quality assurance procedures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> How the bag leak detection system will be maintained, including a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> How the bag leak detection system output will be recorded and stored; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Corrective action procedures as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, you must initiate procedures to determine the cause of every alarm from a bag leak detection system within 1 hour of the alarm and alleviate the cause of the alarm within 3 hours of the alarm by taking whatever corrective action(s) are necessary. Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Inspecting the fabric filter for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in PM emissions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sealing off defective bags or filter media;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Replacing defective bags or filter media, or otherwise repairing the control device;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Sealing off a defective fabric filter compartment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe, or otherwise repairing the bag leak detection system; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You may take more than 3 hours to alleviate a specific condition that causes an alarm if you identify in the monitoring plan this specific condition as one that could lead to an alarm, adequately explain why it is not feasible to alleviate this condition within 3 hours of the time the alarm occurs, and demonstrate that the requested time will ensure alleviation of this condition as expeditiously as practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If you use a control device other than a fabric filter for new or existing affected sources subject to Sec. 63.11550(b), you must submit a request to use an alternative monitoring procedure as required in Sec. 63.8(f)(4).</p>
