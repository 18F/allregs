                                Sec. 1021.330  Exceptions to the reporting requirements of 31 U.S.C. 5331.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Receipt of currency by certain casinos having gross annual gaming revenue in excess of $1,000,000--In general. If a casino receives currency in excess of $10,000 and is required to report the receipt of such currency directly to the Treasury Department under Sec. 1010.306, Sec. 1021.311, or Sec. 1021.313 and is subject to the recordkeeping requirements of Sec. 1021.410, then the casino is not required to make a report with respect to the receipt of such currency under 31 U.S.C. 5331 and this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Casinos exempt under Sec. 1010.970(c). Pursuant to Sec. 1010.970, the Secretary may exempt from the reporting and recordkeeping requirements under Sec. 1010.306, Sec. 1021.311, Sec. 1021.313 or Sec. 1021.410 casinos in any state whose regulatory system substantially meets the reporting and recordkeeping requirements of this chapter. Such casinos shall not be required to report receipt of currency under 31 U.S.C. 5331 and this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reporting of currency received in a non-gaming business. Non-gaming businesses (such as shops, restaurants, entertainment, and hotels) at casino hotels and resorts are separate trades or businesses in which the receipt of currency in excess of $10,000 is reportable under section 5331 and these regulations. Thus, a casino exempt under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section must report with respect to currency in excess of $10,000 received in its non-gaming businesses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of the rules in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth2">Example. A and B are casinos having gross annual gaming revenue in excess of $1,000,000. C is a casino with gross annual gaming revenue of less than $1,000,000. Casino

A receives $15,000 in currency from a customer with respect to a gaming transaction which the casino reports to the Treasury Department under Sec. Sec. 1010.306, 1021.311, and 1021.313. Casino B receives $15,000 in currency from a customer in payment for accommodations provided to that customer at Casino B's hotel. Casino C receives $15,000 in currency from a customer with respect to a gaming transaction. Casino A is not required to report the transaction under 31 U.S.C. 5331 or this section because the exception for certain casinos provided in paragraph (a) of this section (``the casino exception'') applies. Casino B is required to report under 31 U.S.C. 5331 and this section because the casino exception does not apply to the receipt of currency from a nongaming activity. Casino C is required to report under 31 U.S.C. 5331 and this section because the casino exception does not apply to casinos having gross annual gaming revenue of $1,000,000 or less which do not have to report to the Treasury Department under Sec. Sec. 1010.306, 1021.311, and 1021.313.</p>
