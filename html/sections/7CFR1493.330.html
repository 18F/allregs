Any assignment may be made to one party as agent or trustee for two or more parties participating in the assignment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The exporter may assign the proceeds which are, or may become, payable by CCC under a facility payment guarantee or the right to such proceeds only to a financial institution in the U.S. The assignment must cover all amounts payable under the facility payment guarantee not already paid, may not be made to more than one party, and may not, unless approved in advance by CCC, be subject to further assignment.

In cases where a financial institution is determined to be ineligible to receive an assignment, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, CCC will provide notice thereof to such financial institution and to the exporter issued the facility payment guarantee in lieu of an acknowledgment of assignment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The name and address of the assignee must be included on the written notice of assignment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive an assignment. A financial institution will be ineligible to receive an assignment of proceeds which may become payable under a facility payment guarantee if, at the time of assignment, such financial institution:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is not in sound financial condition, as determined by the Treasurer of CCC; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is the financial institution issuing the letter of credit or a branch, agency or subsidiary of such institution; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the financial institution issuing the letter of credit; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Is the U.S. parent of the foreign bank issuing the letter of credit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive proceeds.

CCC may, with the agreement of the exporter (or if the right to proceeds payable under the facility payment guarantee has been assigned, with the agreement of the exporter's assignee), establish procedures, terms or conditions for the satisfaction of CCC's obligations under a facility payment guarantee other than those provided for in this subpart if CCC determines that those alternative procedures, terms or conditions are appropriate in rescheduling the debts arising out of any transaction covered by the facility payment guarantee and would not result in CCC paying more than the amount of CCC's obligation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Maintenance of records and access to premises. (1) For a period of five years after the date of expiration of the coverage of a facility payment guarantee, the exporter or the exporter's assignee,
