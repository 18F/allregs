                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definition. For purposes of this subpart, ``cost-effective'' means that the State's cost of purchasing family coverage that includes coverage for targeted low-income children is equal to or less than the State's cost of obtaining coverage under the State plan only for the eligible targeted low-income children involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Cost comparisons. A State may demonstrate cost-effectiveness by comparing the cost of coverage for the family to the cost of coverage only for the targeted low-income children under the health benefits package offered by the State under the State plan for which the child is eligible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Individual or aggregate basis. (1) The State may base its demonstration of the cost-effectiveness of family coverage on an assessment of the cost of family coverage for individual families, done on a case-by-case basis, or on the

cost of family coverage in the aggregate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The State must assess cost-effectiveness in its initial request for a waiver and then annually.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For any State that chooses the aggregate cost method, if an annual assessment of the cost-effectiveness of family coverage in the aggregate reveals that it is not cost-effective, the State must assess cost-effectiveness on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Reports on family coverage. A State with a waiver under this section must include in its annual report pursuant to Sec.  457.750, the cost of family coverage purchased under the waiver, and the number of children and adults, respectively, covered under family coverage pursuant to the waiver.</p>
