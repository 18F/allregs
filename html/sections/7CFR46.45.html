                            <p class="depth0">It is a violation of section 2(5) for a commission merchant, dealer,  or broker to misrepresent by word, act, mark, stencil, label, statement,  or deed, the character, kind, grade, quality, quantity, size, pack,  weight, condition, degree, or maturity, or State, country, region of  origin of any perishable agricultural commodity received, shipped, sold,  or offered to be sold in interstate or foreign commerce. However, a  person other than the first licensee handling misbranded perishable  agricultural commodities shall not be held liable for a violation of  section 2(5) of the Act by reason of the conduct of another if the  person did not have knowledge of the violation or lacked the ability to  correct the violation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Violations. Violations are considered to be serious, very  serious, or repeated and/or flagrant, depending upon the circumstances  of the misrepresentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Serious violations. Include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity shown by official  inspection to contain scorable defects, off-size, off-count, exceeding  the tolerance(s) in an amount up to and including double the tolerance  provided in the applicable grades, standards or inspection procedures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any lot of perishable agricultural commodity officially  certified as failing to meet the declared weight;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity in which the  State, country, or region of origin of the produce is misrepresentated  because the lot is made up of containers with various labels or markings  that reflect more than one incorrect State, country or region of origin.  Example: A lot with containers individually marked to show the origin as  Idaho or Maine or Colorado when the produce was grown in Wisconsin; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any other physical act, verbal or written declaration, or  record entry that misrepresents a lot of a perishable agricultural  commodity to the same extent as the examples listed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Very serious violations. Include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity shown by official  inspection to contain scorable defects, off-size, off-count, in excess  of double the tolerance(s) provided in the applicable grades, standards  or inspection procedures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity packed in  containers showing a single point of origin, which is other than that in  which the produce was grown, such as containers marked ``California''  when the produce was grown in Arizona;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity officially  certified as having an average net weight more than four percent below  the declared weight;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Multiple sales or shipments of a misrepresented perishable  agricultural commodity within a seven day period that can be attributed  to one cause; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any other physical act, verbal or written declaration, or record  entry that misrepresents a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity to  the same extent as the examples listed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Flagrant violations. Include, but are not necessarily limited  to, the following examples:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Shipment or sale of a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity  from shipping point after notification by official inspection that the  inspected commodity fails to comply with any marking on the container  without first correcting the misbranding;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To offer for resale or consignment, a lot of a perishable  agricultural commodity that has been officially inspected at destination  and found to be misbranded without advising a prospective receiver that  the lot is misbranded and that the misbranding must be corrected before  resale. When a resale or consignment is finalized, written notice must  be given that the lot is misbranded and must be corrected before resale;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To withhold or fail to disclose known material facts with  respect to a misrepresentation or misbranding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evidence. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Evidence concerning a misrepresentation or  misbranding includes official certificates of an inspection made by any  person authorized by the Department to inspect fruits and vegetables or  other public certifiers, and includes investigations and audit findings  and any business records, testimony or other evidence bearing on the  subject.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity has been  officially inspected, and certification is made that the descriptive  container markings are correct, but a subsequent inspection reverses the  original findings, both inspection certificates will be accepted as  evidence to show that the shipper/seller has not misrepresented the lot.  The receiver of the commodity will be in violation if the  misrepresentation is not corrected before the commodity is shipped, sold  or offered for resale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sanctions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Informal. When liability for a violation of  section 2(5) of the Act is to be settled informally, the violator may:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be given written warnings; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Be given notice that liability for a violation may be settled  by admitting the violation in writing and paying a penalty in an amount  satisfactory to the Secretary in lieu of formal disciplinary action. In  the event of a formal proceeding to suspend or revoke the license of  such person because he has committed other violation(s), the admitted  violation(s) will not be used to support the formal complaint but may be  admitted to show a course of conduct prior to the filing of the formal  complaint;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The schedule for informal disposition is as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth5">Violation                                 Disposition ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1st...........................................  ...........

Formal proceedings to suspend or revoke a license may be  instituted at any time against a person who has committed repeated and/ or flagrant violations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cumulative record. A cumulative record of licensee's  misrepresentation violations will be maintained with the following  limitations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Two years after the date it was committed or after payment of a  monetary penalty, the violation will not be used as a basis for  instituting formal disciplinary action. However, it may be cited as a  part of the pattern of violations if formal proceedings are instituted  and will be used in determining the level of monetary penalty for  informal settlements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The record of violations not involved in formal proceedings will  be expunged if there are no violations during a twenty-four (24) month  period from the date of the most recent violation, or after thirty-six  (36) months from the date of said violation, unless it was made a part  of a formal disciplinary complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Summary of procedure--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compilation of authority. The rules  defining misrepresentation, including misbranding, and for determining  liability and disposition of violations are contained in the Act (7  U.S.C. 499 et seq.), in particular sections 2(5) and 8 (7 U.S.C. 449b(5)  and 499h), Sec. 46.45 of the Regulations (7 CFR 46.45), the Rules of  Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Administrative Proceedings  Instituted By the Secretary (7 CFR 1.130 et seq.), and in the  Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evidence of misrepresentation. Evidence of misrepresentation or  misbranding violations includes results of official inspections, audit  findings, business records, or other documentation or testimony bearing  on the subject. When a lot of fruits and vegetables has been officially  inspected, and certification made that the descriptive markings on the  container do not misrepresent the produce, but a subsequent inspection  reverses the original finding (such as to grade, size, weight, etc.),  the shipper/seller will not be charged with violation of the Act.  However, the misrepresentation must be corrected before the lot is  shipped, sold, or offered for resale.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Warning letters. When informal settlement of liability is  appropriate, violators are given two written warnings and an opportunity  to take preventive action before formal action is considered. Warning  letters include an explanation of the requirements of the Act and  recommendations of actions which the violator can take to avoid future  violations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Informal sanctions. Violations subsquent to the sending of the  warning letters referred to above, other than flagrant violations, may  be settled informally pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. This  procedure permits the violator to resolve the matter by payment of a  monetary penalty pursuant to a schedule set out in lieu of a formal  proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Formal sanctions. In cases involving repeated or flagrant  violations of the Act, formal proceedings seeking the suspension or  revocation of the violator's license may be instituted pursuant to the  Rules of Practice governing such matters (7 CFR 1.130 et seq.). Except  in cases of willfulness or where the public health, interest, or safety  requires otherwise, a violator must be given written warning and  opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with the Act before its  license can be suspended or revoked (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.). The warning  letters referred to above serve this purpose. If formal proceedings are  instituted, the violator is afforded an oral hearing, if requested,  before an Administrative Law Judge,   an opportunity to appeal an adverse decision to the Department's  Judicial Officer, and a further opportunity to appeal an adverse final  decision to the appropriate United States Circuit Court of Appeals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Use of record of misrepresentation. A cumulative record of  misrepresentation is maintained. It is used as a basis for determining  whether a warning letter should be considered, and, if so, the amount of  monetary penalty which is appropriate, or whether there is cause for  instituting a formal disciplinary proceeding seeking suspension or  revocation of the violator's license. But after payment of a monetary  penalty or after two years from the date of the last violation, no  formal disciplinary use can be made of the previous record of violation.  The record of misrepresentation shall be erased if there are no further  violations in the twenty-four (24) month period immediately following  the most recent violation, or after 36 months from the date of each  individual violation unless it is involved in formal disciplinary  proceedings.
