                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. An optical impression system for computer  assisted design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) is a device used to record  the topographical characteristics of teeth, dental impressions, or stone  models by analog or digital methods for use in the computer-assisted  design and manufacturing of dental restorative prosthetic devices. Such  systems may consist of a camera, scanner, or equivalent type of sensor  and a computer with software.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II (Special Controls). The device is  exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part  807 of the chapter subject to the limitations in Sec. 872.9. The  special control for these devices is the FDA guidance document entitled  ``Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Optical Impression  Systems for Computer Assisted Design and Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) of  Dental Restorations; Guidance for Industry and FDA.'' For the  availability of this guidance document, see Sec. 872.1(e).  [68 FR 19738, Apr. 22, 2003]</p>
