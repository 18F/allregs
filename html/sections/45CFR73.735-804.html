                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An employee may request approval to participate in his or her  official capacity in a matter in which he or she has a direct or  indirect financial interest if the employee believes the interest is so  remote and inconsequential that it would not affect the integrity of his  or her official duties. Also an employee who has a financial interest  that would otherwise be prohibited under these regulations may request  an exemption from the prohibition for the reason stated in the preceding  sentence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The request shall be in writing and shall include the following  information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Employee's name, occupational title, grade or rank and Federal  salary;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Full description of financial interest: including whether  ownership, service as officer, partner, etc.;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Business or activity in which financial interest exists;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Description of official matter in which employee is requesting  approval to participate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Basis for requesting determination that the interest is ``not so  substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the  services which the Government may expect.'' (If based on a small total  value of investment, supply appropriate information on total value, such  as total shares held and latest quoted market price. If other basis,  explain fully.)  The request should be sent through usual administrative channels to the  official responsible for reviewing financial disclosure reports or  statements for the employee's organization (Subpart I). That official,  after conferring with a deputy ethics counselor or with the Department  Ethics Counselor as appropriate, will make a decision about the  exemption or exception and inform the employee in writing.</p>
