                                Sec. 20.6163-1  Extension of time for payment of estate tax on value
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In case there is included in the gross estate a reversionary  or remainder interest in property, the payment of the part of the tax  attributable to that interest may, at the election of the executor, be  postponed until six months after the termination of the precedent  interest or interests in the property. The provisions of this section  are limited to cases in which the reversionary or remainder interest is  included in the decedent's gross estate as such and do not extend to  cases in which the decedent creates future interests by his own  testamentary act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the district director finds that the payment of the tax at  the expiration of the period of postponement described in subparagraph  (1) of this   paragraph would result in undue hardship to the estate, he may--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> After September 2, 1958, and before February 27, 1964, extend  the time for payment for a reasonable period or periods not to exceed in  all 2 years from the expiration of the period of postponement, but only  if the precedent interest or interests in the property terminated after  March 2, 1958, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of Sec. 20.6161-1 for the meaning of the term  ``undue hardship''. An example of undue hardship is a case where, by  reason of the time required to settle the complex issues involved in a  trust, the decedent's heirs or beneficiaries cannot reasonably expect to  receive the decedent's remainder interest in the trust before the  expiration of the period of postponement. The extension will be granted  only in the manner provided in paragraph (b) of Sec. 20.6161-1, and the  amount of the tax for which the extension is granted, with the additions  thereto, shall be paid on or before the expiration of the period of  extension without the necessity of notice and demand from the district  director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of the exercise of the election to postpone the payment  of the tax attributable to a reversionary or remainder interest should  be filed with the district director before the date prescribed for  payment of the tax. The notice of election may be made in the form of a  letter addressed to the district director. There shall be filed with the  notice of election a certified copy of the will or other instrument  under which the reversionary or remainder interest, was created, or a  copy verified by the executor if the instrument is not filed of record.  The district director may require the submission of such additional  proof as he deems necessary to disclose the complete facts. If the  duration of the precedent interest is dependent upon the life of any  person, the notice of election must show the date of birth of that  person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the decedent's gross estate consists of both a reversionary  or remainder interest in property and other property, the tax  attributable to the reversionary or remainder interest, within the  meaning of this section, is an amount which bears the same ratio to the  total tax as the value of the reversionary or remainder interest  (reduced as provided in the following sentence) bears to the entire  gross estate (reduced as provided in the last sentence of this  paragraph). In applying this ratio, the value of the reversionary or  remainder interest is reduced by (1) the amount of claims, mortgages,  and indebtedness which is a lien upon such interest; (2) losses in  respect of such interest during the settlement of the estate which are  deductible under the provisions of section 2054 or section 2106(a)(1);  (3) any amount deductible in respect of such interest under section 2055  or 2106(a)(2) for charitable, etc., transfers; and (4) the portion of  the marital deduction allowed under the provisions of section 2056 on  account of bequests, etc., of such interests to the decedent's surviving  spouse. Likewise, in applying the ratio, the value of the gross estate  is reduced by such deductions having similar relationship to the items  comprising the gross estate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> of the Act of Jan. 3,  1975 (Pub. L. 93-625, 88 Stat. 2115). For provisions requiring the  furnishing of security for the payment of the tax for which the  extension is granted, see paragraph (b) of Sec. 20.6165-1. For  provisions concerning the time within which credit for State and foreign  death taxes on such a reversionary or remainder interest may be taken,  see section 2015 and the regulations thereunder.
