                                Sec. 199.20  Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP).
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The CHCBP is a premium-based temporary health care coverage program that will be available to beneficiaries who meet the eligibility and enrollment criteria as set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The CHCBP is not part of the TRICARE program. However, as set forth in this section, it functions under similar rules and procedures of the TRICARE Standard program. Because the purpose of the CHCBP is to provide a continuation health care benefit for the Department of Defense and the other uniformed services (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Public Health Service (PHS), and Coast Guard) beneficiaries losing eligibility, it will be administered so that it appears, to the maximum extent possible, to be part of the TRICARE Standard program. Medical coverage under this program will be the same as the benefits payable under the TRICARE Standard program. However, unlike the Standard program there is a cost for enrollment to the CHCBP and these premium costs are payable by enrollees before any care may be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General provisions. Except for any provisions the Director of the TRICARE Management Activity may exclude, the general provisions of Sec. 199.1 shall apply to the CHCBP as they do to TRICARE.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. Except as may be specifically provided in this section, to the extent terms defined in Sec. 199.2 are relevant to the administration of the CHCBP, the definitions contained in that section shall apply to the CHCBP as they do to the TRICARE Standard program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Eligibility and enrollment. (1) Eligibility, Enrollment in the CHCBP is open to any individual, except as noted in this section, who:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Eligibility, Enrollment in the CHCBP is open to any individual, except as noted in this section, who:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Ceases to meet the requirements for eligibility under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55 or 10 U.S.C. 1145, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Who on the day before they cease to meet the eligibility requirements for such care they were covered under a health benefit plan under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55 or transitional healthcare under 10 U.S.C. 1145, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Who would otherwise not be eligible for any benefits under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55 or 10 U.S.C. 1145 except for CHCBP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions.

Eligibility in the CHCBP is limited to individuals who lost their entitlement to benefits under the MHS on or after October 1, 1994. The effective date of their coverage under CHCBP shall begin on the day after they cease to be eligible for care under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55 or 10 U.S.C. 1145.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Notification of eligibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Department of Defense and the other uniformed services (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Public Health Service (PHS), and Coast Guard) will notify persons in the uniformed services eligible to receive health benefits under the CHCBP.

The CHCBP contractor may request additional information and documentation to confirm the applicant's eligibility for CHCBP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Period of coverage. Except as noted below CHCBP coverage may not extend beyond 18 months from the date the individual becomes eligible for CHCBP. Although beneficiaries have sixty (60) days to elect coverage under the CHCBP, upon enrolling, the period of coverage must begin the day after entitlement or eligibility to a military health care plan ends as though no break in coverage had occurred notwithstanding the date the enrollment

form with any applicable premium is submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Exceptions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In the case of a child of a member or former member, the date which is 36 months after the date on which the person first ceases to meet the requirements for being considered an unmarried dependent child under 10 U.S.C. 1072(2)(D) or 10 U.S.C. 1072(2)(I).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of an unremarried former spouse (as this term is defined in 10 U.S.C. 1072(2)(G) or (H)) of a member or former member, the date which is 36 months after the later of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The date on which the final decree of divorce, dissolution, or annulment occurs; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If applicable, the date the one-year extension of dependency under 10 U.S.C. 1072(2)(H) expires.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In the case of an unremarried surviving spouse (widow or widower) (under 10 U.S.C. 1072(2)(B) or (C)) of a member or former member of the uniformed services who is not otherwise eligible for care under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, the date which is 36 months after the date the surviving spouse becomes ineligible under 10 U.S.C chapter 55 or 10 U.S.C. 1145(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> In the case of a former spouse of a retiree whose marriage was dissolved after the member retired from the service, the period of coverage under the CHCBP is unlimited, if the former spouse:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Has not remarried before the age of 55 after the marriage to the former member was dissolved; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Was enrolled in the CHCBP or TRICARE as the dependent of a retiree during the 18-month period before the date of the divorce, dissolution, or annulment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Is receiving a portion of the retired or retainer pay of a member or former member or an annuity based on the retainer pay of the member; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Has a court order for payment of any portion of the retired or retainer pay or has a written agreement (whether voluntary or pursuant to a court order) which provides for an election by the member or former member to provide an annuity to the former spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> For the beneficiary who becomes eligible for the CHCBP by ceasing to meet the requirements for being considered an unmarried dependent child of a member or former member, health care coverage may not extend beyond the date which is 36 months after the date the member becomes ineligible for medical and dental care under 10 U.S.C. 1074(a) and any transitional health care under 10 U.S.C. 1145(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> CHCBP benefits--(1) In general.
