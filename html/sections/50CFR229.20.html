                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determinations. During a period of up to 3 consecutive years,  NMFS will allow the incidental, but not the intentional, taking by  persons using vessels of the United States or foreign vessels that have  valid fishing permits issued by the Assistant Administrator in  accordance with section 204(b) of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and  Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1824(b)), while engaging in commercial fishing  operations, of marine mammals from a species or stock designated as  depleted because of its listing as an endangered species or threatened  species under the   Endangered Species Act of 1973 if the Assistant Administrator determines  that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The incidental mortality and serious injury from commercial  fisheries will have a negligible impact on such species or stock;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A recovery plan has been developed or is being developed for  such species or stock pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where required under regulations in subpart A of this part:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A monitoring program has been established under Sec. 229.7;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Vessels engaged in such fisheries are registered in accordance  with Sec. 229.4; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A take reduction plan has been developed or is being developed  for such species or stock in accordance with regulations at subpart C of  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures for making determinations. In making any of the  determinations listed in paragraph (a) of this section, the Assistant  Administrator will publish an announcement in the Federal Register of  fisheries having takes of marine mammals listed under the Endangered  Species Act, including a summary of available information regarding the  fisheries interactions with listed species. Any interested party may,  within 45 days of such publication, submit to the Assistant  Administrator written data or views with respect to the listed  fisheries. As soon as practicable after the end of the 45 days following  publication, NMFS will publish in the Federal Register a list of the  fisheries for which the determinations listed in paragraph (a) of this  section have been made. This publication will set forth a summary of the  information used to make the determinations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Issuance of authorization. The Assistant Administrator will  issue appropriate permits for vessels in fisheries that are required to  register under Sec. 229.4 and for which determinations under the  procedures of paragraph (b) of this section can be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Category III fisheries. Vessel owners engaged only in Category  III fisheries for which determinations are made under the procedures of  paragraph (b) of this section will not be subject to the penalties of  this Act for the incidental taking of marine mammals to which this  subpart applies, as long as the vessel owner or operator of such vessel  reports any incidental mortality or injury of such marine mammals in  accordance with the requirements of Sec. 229.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Emergency authority. During the course of the commercial fishing  season, if the Assistant Administrator determines that the level of  incidental mortality or serious injury from commercial fisheries for  which such a determination was made under this section has resulted or  is likely to result in an impact that is more than negligible on the  endangered or threatened species or stock, the Assistant Administrator  will use the emergency authority of Sec. 229.9 to protect such species  or stock, and may modify any permit granted under this paragraph as  necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Suspension, revocation, modification and amendment. The  Assistant Administrator may, pursuant to the provisions of 15 CFR part  904, suspend or revoke a permit granted under this section if the  Assistant Administrator determines that the conditions or limitations  set forth in such permit are not being complied with. The Assistant  Administrator may amend or modify, after notification and opportunity  for public comment, the list of fisheries published in accordance with  paragraph (b) of this section whenever the Assistant Administrator  determines there has been a significant change in the information or  conditions used to determine such a list.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Southern sea otters. This subpart does not apply to the taking  of Southern (California) sea otters.  [60 FR 45100, Aug. 30, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 9088, Feb. 24, 1999]</p>
