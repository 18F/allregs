                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Processing of applications. The local HUD Office will determine whether participation in a preapplication conference is required as a condition to submission of an initial application for either a conditional or firm commitment. After the preapplication conference an application for a conditional or firm commitment for insurance of a mortgage on a project shall be submitted by the sponsor and an approved mortgagee. Such application shall be submitted to the local HUD Office on a HUD approved form. An application may, at the option of the applicant, be submitted for a firm commitment omitting the conditional commitment stage. No application shall be considered unless accompanied by all exhibits required by the form and program handbooks. An application may be made for a commitment which provides for the insurance of the mortgage upon completion of any improvements or for a commitment which provides, in accordance with standards established by the Commissioner, for the completing of specified repairs and improvements after endorsement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application fee--conditional commitment. An application-commitment fee of $3 per thousand dollars of the requested mortgage amount shall accompany an application for conditional commitment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application fee--firm commitment. An application for firm commitment shall be accompanied by an application-commitment fee of $5 per thousand dollars of the requested mortgage amount to be insured less any amount previously received for a conditional commitment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Inspection fee. Where an application provides for the completion of repairs, replacements and/or improvements (repairs), the Commissioner will charge an inspection fee equal to one percent (1%) of the cost of the repairs. However, where the Commissioner determines the cost of repairs is minimal, the Commissioner may establish a minimum inspection fee that exceeds one percent of the cost of repairs and can periodically increase or decrease this minimum fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Cross-reference. The provisions of paragraphs (f)(1) (Fee on increases), (g) (Reopening of expired commitments), (h) (Transfer fee), (i) (Refund of fees), and (j) (Fees not required) of Sec. 200.40 of this chapter apply to applications submitted under subpart E of this part.
