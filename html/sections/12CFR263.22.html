                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Consolidation. (1) On the motion of any party, or on the administrative law judge's own motion, the administrative law judge may consolidate, for some or all purposes, any two or more proceedings, if each such proceeding involves or arises out of the same transaction, occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences, or involves at least one common respondent or a material common question of law or fact, unless such consolidation would cause unreasonable delay or injustice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the event of consolidation under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, appropriate adjustment to the prehearing schedule shall be made to avoid unnecessary expense, inconvenience, or delay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Severance. The administrative law judge may, upon the motion of any party, sever the proceeding for separate resolution of the matter as to any respondent only if the administrative law judge finds that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Undue prejudice or injustice to the moving party would result from not severing the proceeding; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such undue prejudice or injustice would outweigh the interests of judicial economy and expedition in the

complete and final resolution of the proceeding.</p>
