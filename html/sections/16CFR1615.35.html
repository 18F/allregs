See 16 CFR 1615.4 (b), (c) and (d). The Standard prescribes an apparatus and procedure for performing tests of fabric and garments subject to its provisions. See 16 CFR 1615.4 (a), (f), and (g).

The Commission considers a test utilizing alternate apparatus or procedures to be ``as stringent as, or more stringent than'' a test utilizing the apparatus and procedures specified in the standard if, when testing identical specimens, a test utilizing alternate apparatus or procedures yields failing results as often as, or more often than, a test utilizing the apparatus and procedures specified in the Standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By issuance of this Sec. 1615.35, the Commission gives its approval to any person or firm desiring to use test apparatus or procedures other than those prescribed by the Standard for purposes of compliance with the Standard, if that person or firm has data or other information to demonstrate that a test utilizing such alternate apparatus or procedures is as stringent as, or more stringent than, a test utilizing the apparatus and procedures specified in the Standard.

approval of alternate test apparatus or procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use of any alternate test apparatus or procedure without the data or information required by paragraph (b), of this section, may result in violation of the Standard and section 3 of the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1192).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Commission will test fabrics and garments subject to the Standard for compliance with the requirements of the Standard using the apparatus and procedures set forth in the Standard. The Commission will consider any failing results from compliance testing as evidence of a violation of the Standard and section 3 of the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C 1192).
