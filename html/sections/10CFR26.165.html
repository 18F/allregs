                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Testing split specimens. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a specimen has been split into  Bottle A and Bottle B at the collection site, and the specimen was not  initially tested at a licensee testing facility, then the HHS-certified  laboratory shall perform initial and confirmatory validity and drug  testing, if required, of the specimen in Bottle A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a specimen was initially tested at a licensee testing  facility and positive or questionable validity test results were  obtained, then the HHS-certified laboratory shall perform initial and  confirmatory testing, if required, of the specimen in Bottle A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At the licensee's or other entity's discretion, Bottle B must  either be forwarded to the HHS-certified laboratory or maintained in  secure storage at the licensee testing facility, as required by Sec.  26.135(a) and (c), as applicable. If the specimen in Bottle A is free of  any evidence of drugs or drug metabolites, and is a valid specimen, then  the licensee testing facility or HHS-certified laboratory may discard  the specimens in Bottles A and B.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Donor request to MRO for a retest of a single specimen or  testing Bottle B of a split specimen. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a confirmed positive,  adulterated, or substituted result reported on a single specimen of 30  mL or more, or a specimen in Bottle A of a split specimen which the  donor submitted to the licensee or other entity, a donor may request  (through the MRO) that an aliquot from the single specimen or the split  (Bottle B) specimen be tested by a second HHS-certified laboratory to  verify the result reported by the first laboratory. For an invalid test  result, a donor may not request that an aliquot from the single specimen  or the split specimen in Bottle B be tested by a second HHS-certified  laboratory.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The MRO shall inform the donor that he or she may, within 3  business days of notification by the MRO of the confirmed positive,  adulterated, or substituted test result, request the retesting of an  aliquot of the single specimen or the testing of the Bottle B split  specimen. The MRO shall provide the donor with specific instructions for  making this request (i.e., providing   telephone numbers or other contact information). The MRO shall have the  ability to receive the donor's calls at all times during the 3-day  period (e.g., by use of an answering machine with a ``time stamp''  feature when there is no one in the MRO's office to answer the phone).  The donor's request may be oral or in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The donor shall provide his or her permission for retesting an  aliquot of the single specimen or the testing of Bottle B. Neither the  licensee, MRO, NRC, nor any other entity may order retesting of the  single specimen or testing of the specimen in Bottle B without the  donor's written permission, except as permitted in Sec. 26.185(l).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the donor has not requested a retest of an aliquot of a  single specimen or a test of the split specimen (Bottle B) within 3  business days, the donor may present to the MRO information documenting  that serious injury, illness, lack of actual notice of the confirmed  test result, inability to contact the MRO (e.g., there was no one in the  MRO's office and the answering machine was not working), or other  circumstances unavoidably prevented the donor from making a timely  request. If the MRO concludes from the donor's information that there  was a legitimate reason for the donor's failure to contact the MRO  within the 3 business days permitted, the MRO shall direct the retesting  of an aliquot of the single specimen or the test of the split specimen  (Bottle B) take place, as if the donor had made a timely request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> As soon as reasonably practical and not more than 1 business day  following the day of the donor's request, as permitted in paragraph  (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section, the MRO shall ensure that the HHS- certified laboratory forwards an aliquot of a single specimen, or that  the HHS-certified laboratory (or licensee testing facility, as  appropriate) forwards Bottle B of a split specimen, to a second HHS- certified laboratory that did not test the specimen in Bottle A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The HHS-certified laboratory that retests an aliquot of a single  specimen or tests the specimen in Bottle B shall provide quantitative  test results to the MRO and the MRO shall provide them to the donor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Retesting a specimen for drugs. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The second laboratory shall  use its confirmatory drug test when retesting an aliquot of a single  specimen or testing Bottle B of a split specimen for the drug(s) or drug  metabolite(s) for which the first laboratory reported a positive  result(s), including retesting specimens that have been subject to the  special analysis permitted in Sec. 26.163(a)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Because some drugs or drug metabolites may deteriorate during  storage, the retest by the second laboratory is not subject to a  specific drug cutoff level, but must provide data sufficient to  reconfirm the presence of the drug(s) or drug metabolite(s) down to the  assay's LOD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the second laboratory fails to reconfirm the presence of the  drug(s) or drug metabolite(s) for which the first laboratory reported a  positive result(s), the second laboratory shall attempt to determine the  reason for not reconfirming the first laboratory's findings by  conducting specimen validity tests. The second laboratory shall conduct  the same specimen validity tests it would conduct on a single specimen  or the specimen in Bottle A of a split specimen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The second laboratory shall report all results to the licensee's  or other entity's MRO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Retesting a specimen for adulterants. A second laboratory shall  use the required confirmatory validity test and criteria in Sec.  26.161(c) to reconfirm an adulterant result when retesting an aliquot  from a single specimen or when testing Bottle B of a split specimen. The  second laboratory may only conduct the confirmatory validity test needed  to reconfirm the adulterant result reported by the first laboratory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Retesting a specimen for substitution. A second laboratory shall  use its confirmatory creatinine and confirmatory specific gravity tests,  when retesting an aliquot of a single specimen or testing Bottle B of a  split specimen, to reconfirm that the creatinine concentration was less  than 2 mg/dL and the specific gravity was less than or equal to 1.0010  or equal to or greater than 1.0200. The second laboratory may   only conduct the confirmatory creatinine and specific gravity tests to  reconfirm the substitution result reported by the first laboratory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Management actions and sanctions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the MRO confirms a  positive, adulterated, or substituted test result(s) from the first HHS- certified laboratory and the donor requests testing of Bottle B of a  split specimen or retesting of an aliquot from a single specimen, the  licensee or other entity shall administratively withdraw the  individual's authorization on the basis of the first confirmed positive,  adulterated, or substituted test result until the results of testing  Bottle B or retesting an aliquot of the single specimen are available  and have been reviewed by the MRO. If the MRO reports that the results  of testing Bottle B or retesting the aliquot of a single specimen  reconfirm any of the original positive, adulterated, or substituted test  result(s), the licensee or other entity shall impose the appropriate  sanctions specified in subpart D. If the results of testing Bottle B or  retesting the aliquot of a single specimen are negative, the licensee or  other entity--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> May not impose any sanctions on the individual;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Shall eliminate from the donor's personnel file and other  records any matter that could link the individual to the temporary  administrative action;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> May not disclose the temporary administrative action in  response to a suitable inquiry conducted under the provisions of Sec.  26.63 or to any other inquiry or investigation required in this chapter.  To ensure that no records have been retained, access to the system of  files and records must be provided to personnel conducting reviews,  inquiries into allegations, or audits under the provisions of Sec.  26.41, or to NRC inspectors; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Shall provide the tested individual with a written statement  that the records specified in Sec. Sec. 26.713 and 26.715 have not been  retained and shall inform the individual in writing that the temporary  administrative action that was taken will not be disclosed and need not  be disclosed by the individual in response to requests for self- disclosure of potentially disqualifying FFD information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a donor requests that Bottle B be tested or that an aliquot  of a single specimen be retested, and either Bottle B or the single  specimen are not available due to circumstances outside of the donor's  control (including, but not limited to, circumstances in which there is  an insufficient quantity of the single specimen or the specimen in  Bottle B to permit retesting, either Bottle B or the original single  specimen is lost in transit to the second HHS-certified laboratory, or  Bottle B has been lost at the HHS-certified laboratory or licensee  testing facility), the MRO shall cancel the test and inform the licensee  or other entity that another collection is required under direct  observation as soon as reasonably practical. The licensee or other  entity shall eliminate from the donor's personnel and other records any  matter that could link the donor to the original positive, adulterated,  or substituted test result(s) and any temporary administrative action,  and may not impose any sanctions on the donor for a cancelled test. If  test results from the second specimen collected are positive,  adulterated, or substituted and the MRO determines that the donor has  violated the FFD policy, the licensee or other entity shall impose the  appropriate sanctions specified in subpart D of this part, but may not  consider the original confirmed positive, adulterated, or substituted  test result in determining the appropriate sanctions.</p>
