                                Sec. 700.11  Written warranty, service contract, and insurance
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Act recognizes two types of agreements which may provide  similar coverage of consumer products, the written warranty, and the  service contract. In addition, other agreements may meet the statutory  definitions of either ``written warranty'' or ``service contract,'' but  are sold and regulated under state law as contracts of insurance. One  example is the automobile breakdown insurance policies sold in many  jurisdictions and regulated by the state as a form of casualty  insurance. The McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. 1011 et seq., precludes  jurisdiction under federal law over ``the business of insurance'' to the  extent an agreement is regulated by state law as insurance. Thus, such  agreements are subject to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act only to the  extent they are not regulated in a particular state as the business of  insurance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> ``Written warranty'' and ``service contract'' are defined in  sections 101(6) and 101(8) of the Act, respectively. A written warranty  must be ``part of the basis of the bargain.'' This means that it must be  conveyed at the time of sale of the consumer product and the consumer  must not give any consideration beyond the purchase price of the  consumer product in order to benefit from the agreement. It is not a  requirement of the Act that an agreement obligate a supplier of the  consumer product to a written warranty, but merely that it be part of  the basis of the bargain between a supplier and a consumer. This  contemplates written warranties by third-party non-suppliers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A service contract under the Act must meet the definitions of  section 101(8). An agreement which would meet the definition of written  warranty in section 101(6) (A) or (B) but for its failure to satisfy the  basis of the bargain test is a service contract. For example, an  agreement which calls for some consideration in addition to the purchase  price of the consumer product, or which is entered into at some date  after the purchase of the consumer product to which it applies, is a  service contract. An agreement which relates only to the performance of  maintenance and/or inspection services and which is not an undertaking,  promise, or affirmation with respect to a specified level of  performance, or that the product is free of defects in materials or  workmanship, is a service contract. An agreement to perform periodic  cleaning and inspection of a product over a specified period of time,  even when offered at the time of sale and without charge to the  consumer, is an example of such a service contract.</p>
