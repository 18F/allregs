other discontinuities of the supporting structure or scaffold components.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Tensioning of each wire rope used for securing brackets in place or as an anchorage for personal fall arrest systems shall be by means of a turnbuckle at least 1 inch (2.54 cm) in diameter, or by equivalent means.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Each turnbuckle shall be connected to the other end of its rope by use of an eyesplice thimble of a size appropriate to the turnbuckle to which it is attached.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> U-bolt wire rope clips shall not be used on any wire rope used to secure brackets or to serve as an anchor for personal fall arrest systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> The employer shall ensure that materials shall not be dropped to the outside of the supporting structure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Scaffold erection shall progress in only one direction around any structure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(y)</em> Stilts.
