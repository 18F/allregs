                            <p class="depth0">This section is applicable for vehicles which are tested using a  simulation of the environmental test cell approved under the provisions  of Sec. 86.162-00(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Administrator may select up to five emission data vehicles  (one emission data vehicle for small volume manufacturers), including  vehicles submitted for running change approval, each model year for any  manufacturer undergoing the spot checking procedures of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Testing conducted under this section (including testing  performed in an environmental test cell) will be considered as official  data as described in Sec. 86.091-29 and used in determining compliance  with the standards. Such testing must comply with all applicable  emission standards of subpart A of this part. Retests for the purpose of  emission compliance will be allowed using the procedures described in  Sec. 86.091-29.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Spot check procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subject to the limitations of  paragraphs (a) and (d)(2)(iii) of this section, the Administrator may  require that one or more of the test vehicles which use a simulation  rather than actual testing in an environmental test cell for air  conditioning emission testing be submitted at a place the Administrator  will designate for air conditioning emission testing in an environmental  test cell as described in Sec. 86.160-00. The Administrator may order  this testing to be conducted at a manufacturer facility. All  manufacturers which use a simulation instead of environmental cell  testing must have access to an environment test cell meeting the  requirements of Sec. 86.161-00 to perform this testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An air conditioning emission test will be performed as described  in Sec. 86.162-00 in a full environmental test cell.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The results of the original simulation test and the full  environmental test cell required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are  compared. In order to pass the spot check, the test results must pass  both the following two criteria:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The NOX emission results of the simulation test must  be at least 85% of the NOX emission results of the  environmental chamber test.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The fuel consumption of the simulation test must be at least 95%  of the fuel consumption of the environmental chamber test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If either of two criteria of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this  section were not met, a retest is allowed. The manufacturer may elect to  conduct either a retest of the simulation procedure or the environmental  chamber testing. In order to pass the spot check, the test results must  pass both the following two criteria using the retest test result.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The NOX emission results of the simulation test must  be at least 85% of the NOX emission results of the  environmental chamber test.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The fuel consumption of the simulation test must be at least 95%  of the fuel consumption of the environmental chamber test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If either of the two criteria of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this  section were not met, a second retest is allowed. The procedure not  selected for the first retest must be used for the second retest,  yielding two test results for each procedure. In order to pass the spot  check, the test results must pass both the following two criteria using  the average test result for each procedure:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The NOX emission results of the simulation test must  be at least 85% of the NOX emission results of the  environmental chamber test.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The fuel consumption of the simulation test must be at least 95%  of the fuel consumption of the environmental chamber test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the spot check criteria have not passed after any of the  initial test, the first retest, or the second retest the spot check is  considered failed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Consequences of failing a spot check. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the emission  results of the testing using the environmental test chamber passes all  the applicable standards, those test results may be used to obtain a  certificate of conformity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator will allow up to 60 days for the manufacturer  to supply additional data addressing the correlation of the simulation  with a full environmental test cell.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If that data prove to the satisfaction of the Administrator that  the simulation produces results that correlate sufficiently with the  environmental test chamber, the Administrator may allow the continued  use of the simulation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Otherwise, the Administrator will determine that the simulation  fails to meet adequate correlation levels with full environmental  testing. As a consequence of this finding, all future air conditioning  emission testing on the population of vehicles represented by the  failing-spot-check test vehicle (which may include past model year  configurations) will be conducted using an environment chamber or a  different (or corrected) approved simulation procedure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For each vehicle that fails a spot check, the Administrator  may select up to two additional vehicles to test for the spot check that  do not count against the five vehicle limit of paragraph (a) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> EPA will monitor the aggregate results of spot check testing and  full environmental test cells. If EPA determines, based on such  aggregate results, that any simulation (other than the AC1 and AC2  procedures described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section for the  2000, 2001, and 2002 model years) is producing test results consistently  below those from a full environmental test cell, EPA may review its  approval of the simulation.
