                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When amendment is required. You must amend your Form ADV (17 CFR 279.1):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least annually, within 90 days of the end of your fiscal year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> More frequently, if required by the instructions to Form ADV.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Electronic filing of amendments. (1) Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, you must file all amendments to Part 1A of Form ADV and Part 2A of Form ADV electronically with the IARD, unless you have received a continuing hardship exemption under Sec. 275.203-3. You are not required to file with the Commission amendments to brochure supplements required by Part 2B of Form ADV.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, you must file all amendments to Part 1A of Form ADV and Part 2A of Form ADV electronically with the IARD, unless you have received a continuing hardship exemption under Sec. 275.203-3. You are not required to file with the Commission amendments to brochure supplements required by Part 2B of Form ADV.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you have received a continuing hardship exemption under Sec. 275.203-3, you must, when you are required to amend your Form ADV, file a completed Part 1A and Part 2A of Form ADV on paper with the SEC by mailing it to FINRA.</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraphs (a) and (b):</p><p class="depth3">Information on how to file with the IARD is available on our Web site at http://www.sec.gov/iard. For the annual updating amendment: Summaries of material changes that are not included in the adviser's brochure must be filed with the Commission as an exhibit to Part 2A in the same electronic file; and if you are not required to prepare a brochure, a summary of material changes, or an annual updating amendment to your brochure, you are not required to file them with the Commission. See the instructions for Part 2A of Form ADV.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transition to electronic filing. If you are required to file a brochure and your fiscal year ends on or after December 31, 2010, you must amend your Form ADV by electronically filing with the IARD one or more brochures that satisfy the requirements of Part 2A of Form ADV (as amended effective October 12, 2010) as part of the next annual updating amendment that you are required to file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Filing fees. You must pay FINRA (the operator of the IARD) an initial filing fee when you first electronically file Part 1A of Form ADV. After you pay the initial filing fee, you must pay an annual filing fee each time you file your annual updating amendment. No portion of either fee is refundable. The Commission has approved the filing fees. Your amended Form ADV will not be accepted by FINRA, and thus will not be considered filed with the Commission, until you have paid the filing fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Amendments to Form ADV are reports. Each amendment required to be filed under this section is a ``report'' within the meaning of sections 204 and 207 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80b-4 and 80b-7).
