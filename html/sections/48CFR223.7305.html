                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The prohibition in 223.7303 does not apply to critical defense  applications if no substitute can meet performance requirements. The DoD  policy of April 8, 2009, ``Minimizing the Use of Hexavalent Chromium,''  contains requirements for weighing hexavalent chromium versus  substitutes. DoD Program Managers must consider the following factors--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cost effectiveness of alternative materials or processes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Technical feasibility of alternative materials or processes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Environment, safety, and occupational health risks associated  with the use of the hexavalent chromium or substitute materials in each  specific application;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Achieving a DoD Manufacturing Readiness Level of at least eight  for any qualified alternative;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Materiel availability of hexavalent chromium and the proposed  alternatives over the projected life span of the system; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Corrosion performance difference of alternative materials or  processes as determined by agency corrosion subject matter experts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> However, unless an exception in 223.7304 applies, the  incorporation of hexavalent chromium in items acquired by DoD shall be  specifically authorized at a level no lower than a general or flag  officer or a member of the Senior Executive Service from the Program  Executive Office or equivalent level, in coordination with the component  Corrosion Control and Prevention Executive. Follow the procedures in PGI  223.7305.</p>
