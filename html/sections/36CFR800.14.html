                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)(E)</em> of the act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Development of procedures. The agency official shall consult  with the Council, the National Conference of State Historic Preservation  Officers, or individual SHPO/THPOs, as appropriate, and Indian tribes  and Native Hawaiian organizations, as specified in paragraph (f) of this  section, in the development of alternate procedures, publish notice of  the availability of proposed alternate procedures in the Federal  Register and take other appropriate steps to seek public input during  the development of alternate procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Council review. The agency official shall submit the proposed  alternate procedures to the Council for a 60-day review period. If the  Council finds the procedures to be consistent with this part, it shall  notify the agency official and the agency official may adopt them as  final alternate procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notice. The agency official shall notify the parties with which  it has consulted and publish notice of final alternate procedures in the  Federal Register.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Legal effect. Alternate procedures adopted pursuant to this  subpart substitute for the Council's regulations for the purposes of the  agency's compliance with section 106, except that where an Indian tribe  has entered into an agreement with the Council to substitute tribal  historic preservation regulations for the Council's regulations under  section 101(d)(5) of the act, the agency shall follow those regulations  in lieu of the agency's procedures regarding undertakings on tribal  lands. Prior to the Council entering into such agreements, the Council  will provide Federal agencies notice and opportunity to comment on the  proposed substitute tribal regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Programmatic agreements. The Council and the agency official may  negotiate a programmatic agreement to govern the implementation of a  particular program or the resolution of adverse effects from certain  complex project situations or multiple undertakings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use of programmatic agreements. A programmatic agreement may be  used:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When effects on historic properties are similar and repetitive  or are multi-State or regional in scope;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When effects on historic properties cannot be fully determined  prior to approval of an undertaking;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When nonfederal parties are delegated major decisionmaking  responsibilities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Where routine management activities are undertaken at Federal  installations, facilities, or other land-management units; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Where other circumstances warrant a departure from the normal  section 106 process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Developing programmatic agreements for agency programs. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The  consultation shall involve, as appropriate, SHPO/THPOs, the National  Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers (NCSHPO), Indian  tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations, other Federal agencies, and  members of the public. If the programmatic agreement has the potential  to affect historic properties on tribal lands or historic properties of  religious and cultural significance to an Indian tribe or Native  Hawaiian organization, the agency official shall also follow paragraph  (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Public participation. The agency official shall arrange for  public participation appropriate to the subject matter and the scope of  the program and in accordance with subpart A of this part. The agency  official shall consider the nature of the program and its likely effects  on historic properties and take steps to involve the individuals,  organizations and entities likely to be interested.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Effect. The programmatic agreement shall take effect when  executed by the Council, the agency official and the appropriate SHPOs/ THPOs when the programmatic agreement concerns a specific region or the  president of NCSHPO when NCSHPO has participated in the consultation. A  programmatic agreement shall take effect on tribal lands only when the  THPO, Indian tribe, or a designated representative of the tribe is a  signatory to the agreement. Compliance with the procedures established  by an approved programmatic agreement satisfies the agency's section 106  responsibilities for all individual undertakings of the program covered  by the agreement until it expires or is terminated by the agency, the  president of NCSHPO when a signatory, or the Council. Termination by an  individual SHPO/THPO shall only terminate the application of a regional  programmatic agreement within the jurisdiction of the SHPO/THPO. If a  THPO assumes the responsibilities of a SHPO pursuant to section  101(d)(2) of the act and the SHPO is signatory to programmatic  agreement, the THPO assumes the role of a signatory, including the right  to terminate a regional programmatic agreement on lands under the  jurisdiction of the tribe.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Notice. The agency official shall notify the parties with which  it has consulted that a programmatic agreement has been executed under  paragraph (b) of this section, provide appropriate public notice before  it takes effect, and make any internal agency procedures implementing  the agreement readily available to the Council, SHPO/THPOs, and the  public.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If the Council determines that the terms of a programmatic  agreement are not being carried out, or if such an   agreement is terminated, the agency official shall comply with subpart B  of this part with regard to individual undertakings of the program  covered by the agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Developing programmatic agreements for complex or multiple  undertakings. Consultation to develop a programmatic agreement for  dealing with the potential adverse effects of complex projects or  multiple undertakings shall follow Sec. 800.6. If consultation pertains  to an activity involving multiple undertakings and the parties fail to  reach agreement, then the agency official shall comply with the  provisions of subpart B of this part for each individual undertaking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Prototype programmatic agreements. The Council may designate an  agreement document as a prototype programmatic agreement that may be  used for the same type of program or undertaking in more than one case  or area. When an agency official uses such a prototype programmatic  agreement, the agency official may develop and execute the agreement  with the appropriate SHPO/THPO and the agreement shall become final  without need for Council participation in consultation or Council  signature.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exempted categories--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Criteria for establishing. The Council  or an agency official may propose a program or category of undertakings  that may be exempted from review under the provisions of subpart B of  this part, if the program or category meets the following criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The actions within the program or category would otherwise  qualify as ``undertakings'' as defined in Sec. 800.16;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The potential effects of the undertakings within the program or  category upon historic properties are foreseeable and likely to be  minimal or not adverse; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Exemption of the program or category is consistent with the  purposes of the act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Public participation. The proponent of the exemption shall  arrange for public participation appropriate to the subject matter and  the scope of the exemption and in accordance with the standards in  subpart A of this part. The proponent of the exemption shall consider  the nature of the exemption and its likely effects on historic  properties and take steps to involve individuals, organizations and  entities likely to be interested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consultation with SHPOs/THPOs. The proponent of the exemption  shall notify and consider the views of the SHPOs/THPOs on the exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Consultation with Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian  organizations. If the exempted program or category of undertakings has  the potential to affect historic properties on tribal lands or historic  properties of religious and cultural significance to an Indian tribe or  Native Hawaiian organization, the Council shall follow the requirements  for the agency official set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Council review of proposed exemptions. The Council shall review  an exemption proposal that is supported by documentation describing the  program or category for which the exemption is sought, demonstrating  that the criteria of paragraph (c)(1) of this section have been met,  describing the methods used to seek the views of the public, and  summarizing any views submitted by the SHPO/THPOs, the public, and any  others consulted. Unless it requests further information, the Council  shall approve or reject the proposed exemption within 30 days of  receipt, and thereafter notify the relevant agency official and SHPO/ THPOs of the decision. The decision shall be based on the consistency of  the exemption with the purposes of the act, taking into consideration  the magnitude of the exempted undertaking or program and the likelihood  of impairment of historic properties in accordance with section 214 of  the act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Legal consequences. Any undertaking that falls within an  approved exempted program or category shall require no further review  pursuant to subpart B of this part, unless the agency official or the  Council determines that there are circumstances under which the normally  excluded undertaking should be reviewed under subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Termination. The Council may terminate an exemption at the  request of the agency official or when the Council determines that the  exemption no longer meets the criteria of paragraph   (c)(1) of this section. The Council shall notify the agency official 30  days before termination becomes effective.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Notice. The proponent of the exemption shall publish notice of  any approved exemption in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Standard treatments--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Establishment. The Council, on its own  initiative or at the request of another party, may establish standard  methods for the treatment of a category of historic properties, a  category of undertakings, or a category of effects on historic  properties to assist Federal agencies in satisfying the requirements of  subpart B of this part. The Council shall publish notice of standard  treatments in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Public participation. The Council shall arrange for public  participation appropriate to the subject matter and the scope of the  standard treatment and consistent with subpart A of this part. The  Council shall consider the nature of the standard treatment and its  likely effects on historic properties and the individuals, organizations  and entities likely to be interested. Where an agency official has  proposed a standard treatment, the Council may request the agency  official to arrange for public involvement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consultation with SHPOs/THPOs. The Council shall notify and  consider the views of SHPOs/THPOs on the proposed standard treatment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Consultation with Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian  organizations. If the proposed standard treatment has the potential to  affect historic properties on tribal lands or historic properties of  religious and cultural significance to an Indian tribe or Native  Hawaiian organization, the Council shall follow the requirements for the  agency official set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Termination. The Council may terminate a standard treatment by  publication of a notice in the Federal Register 30 days before the  termination takes effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Program comments. An agency official may request the Council to  comment on a category of undertakings in lieu of conducting individual  reviews under Sec. Sec. 800.4 through 800.6. The Council may provide  program comments at its own initiative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Agency request. The agency official shall identify the category  of undertakings, specify the likely effects on historic properties,  specify the steps the agency official will take to ensure that the  effects are taken into account, identify the time period for which the  comment is requested and summarize any views submitted by the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Public participation. The agency official shall arrange for  public participation appropriate to the subject matter and the scope of  the category and in accordance with the standards in subpart A of this  part. The agency official shall consider the nature of the undertakings  and their likely effects on historic properties and the individuals,  organizations and entities likely to be interested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consultation with SHPOs/THPOs. The Council shall notify and  consider the views of SHPOs/THPOs on the proposed program comment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Consultation with Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian  organizations. If the program comment has the potential to affect  historic properties on tribal lands or historic properties of religious  and cultural significance to an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian  organization, the Council shall follow the requirements for the agency  official set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Council action. Unless the Council requests additional  documentation, notifies the agency official that it will decline to  comment, or obtains the consent of the agency official to extend the  period for providing comment, the Council shall comment to the agency  official within 45 days of the request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the Council comments, the agency official shall take into  account the comments of the Council in carrying out the undertakings  within the category and publish notice in the Federal Register of the  Council's comments and steps the agency will take to ensure that effects  to historic properties are taken into account.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the Council declines to comment, the agency official shall  continue to comply with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 800.3 through  800.6 for the individual undertakings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Withdrawal of comment. If the Council determines that the  consideration of historic properties is not being   carried out in a manner consistent with the program comment, the Council  may withdraw the comment and the agency official shall comply with the  requirements of Sec. Sec. 800.3 through 800.6 for the individual  undertakings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Consultation with Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian  organizations when developing program alternatives. Whenever an agency  official proposes a program alternative pursuant to paragraphs (a)  through (e) of this section, the agency official shall ensure that  development of the program alternative includes appropriate government- to-government consultation with affected Indian tribes and consultation  with affected Native Hawaiian organizations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identifying affected Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian  organizations. If any undertaking covered by a proposed program  alternative has the potential to affect historic properties on tribal  lands, the agency official shall identify and consult with the Indian  tribes having jurisdiction over such lands. If a proposed program  alternative has the potential to affect historic properties of religious  and cultural significance to an Indian tribe or a Native Hawaiian  organization which are located off tribal lands, the agency official  shall identify those Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations  that might attach religious and cultural significance to such properties  and consult with them. When a proposed program alternative has  nationwide applicability, the agency official shall identify an  appropriate government to government consultation with Indian tribes and  consult with Native Hawaiian organizations in accordance with existing  Executive orders, Presidential memoranda, and applicable provisions of  law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Results of consultation. The agency official shall provide  summaries of the views, along with copies of any written comments,  provided by affected Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations to  the Council as part of the documentation for the proposed program  alternative.
