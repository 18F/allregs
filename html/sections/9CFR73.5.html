                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Cattle of any herd in any quarantined area, which herd is not  diseased with scabies, may be shipped, transported, or otherwise moved  interstate for any purpose upon inspection by an APHIS or State  inspector within 10 days prior to the date of shipment and when  accompanied by a certificate from such inspector showing the cattle to  be free from such disease or exposure thereto. When it is determined by  the Administrator that all cattle of all herds in any quarantined area  have been inspected for scabies by an APHIS or State inspector, that all  the infected or exposed herds have been identified, and that all the  infected herds have been dipped twice, and all the exposed herds have  been dipped in a permitted   dip as prescribed in Sec. 73.10, under supervision of an APHIS or  APHIS-approved inspector, cattle of herds in such area which are not  diseased with or exposed to scabies may be moved interstate in  accordance with this section, without further APHIS inspection or  certification, directly to a slaughtering plant where Federal Meat  Inspection is maintained: Provided further, that treatment with  ivermectin may be used in lieu of dipping for a herd of cattle treated  together if the herd is physically separated for 14 days following  treatment from all cattle not a part of the herd treated together with  ivermectin. Information may be obtained from an APHIS inspector whether  a determination as required by this section is currently applicable to  authorize such movement. Cattle moved interstate under this section  shall not be diverted en route and must be accompanied by a waybill or  similar document, or a statement signed by the owner or shipper of the  cattle, stating: (a) That the cattle are not known to be infected with  scabies or exposed thereto; (b) [Reserved]; (c) the purpose for which  the cattle are to be moved; (d) the number of the cattle; (e) the point  from which the cattle are to be moved interstate; (f) that the cattle  shall not be diverted en route; and (g) the name and address of the  owner or shipper of the cattle.
