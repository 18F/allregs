                            <p class="depth0">The interest rate for the guaranteed loan will be negotiated between the lender and the applicant and may be either fixed or variable as long as it is a legal rate. Interest rates will not be more than those rates customarily charged borrowers in similar circumstances in the ordinary course of business and are subject to Agency review and approval. Lenders are encouraged to utilize the secondary market and pass interest-rate savings on to the borrower.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A variable interest rate agreed to by the lender and borrower must be a rate that is tied to a base rate agreed to by the lender and the Agency. The variable interest rate may be adjusted at different intervals during the term of the loan, but the adjustments may not be more often than quarterly and must be specified in the Loan Agreement. The lender must incorporate, within the variable rate Promissory Note at loan closing, the provision for adjustment of payment installments coincident with an interest-rate adjustment. The lender will ensure that the outstanding principal balance is properly amortized within the prescribed loan maturity to eliminate the possibility of a balloon payment at the end of the loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any change in the interest rate between the date of issuance of the Conditional Commitment and before the issuance of the Loan Note Guarantee must be approved in writing by the Agency approval official. Approval of such a change will be shown as an amendment to the Conditional Commitment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It is permissible to have one interest rate on the guaranteed portion of the loan and another rate on the unguaranteed portion of the loan provided that the rate on the guaranteed

portion does not exceed the rate on the unguaranteed portion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A combination of fixed and variable rates will be allowed.</p>
