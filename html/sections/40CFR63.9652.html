                            <p class="depth0">Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in Sec. 63.2, and in this section as follows.</p><p class="depth0">Affected source means each new or existing ore crushing and handling operation, ore dryer, indurating furnace, or finished pellet handling operation, at your taconite iron ore processing plant.</p><p class="depth0">Bag leak detection system means a system that is capable of continuously monitoring relative particulate matter (dust) loadings in the exhaust of a baghouse to detect bag leaks and other upset conditions. A bag leak detection system includes, but is not limited to,

an instrument that operates on triboelectric, light scattering, light transmittance, or other effect to continuously monitor relative particulate matter loadings.</p><p class="depth0">Conveyor belt transfer point means a point in the conveying operation where the taconite ore or taconite pellets are transferred to or from a conveyor belt, except where the taconite ore or taconite pellets are being transferred to a bin or stockpile.</p><p class="depth0">Crusher means a machine used to crush taconite ore and includes feeders or conveyors located immediately below the crushing surfaces. Crushers include, but are not limited to, gyratory crushers and cone crushers.</p><p class="depth0">Deviation means any instance in which an affected source subject to this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this subpart, including but not limited to any emission limitation (including operating limits) or operation and maintenance requirement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement an applicable requirement in this subpart and that is included in the operating permit for any affected source required to obtain such a permit; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fails to meet any emission limitation in this subpart during startup, shutdown, or malfunction, regardless of whether or not such failure is permitted by this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Dynamic wet scrubber means an air emissions control device which utilizes a mechanically powered fan to cause contact between the process exhaust gas stream and the scrubbing liquid which are introduced concurrently into the fan inlet.</p><p class="depth0">Emission limitation means any emission limit, opacity limit, or operating limit.</p><p class="depth0">Finished pellet handling means the transfer of fired taconite pellets from the indurating furnace to the finished pellet stockpiles at the plant. Finished pellet handling includes, but is not limited to, furnace discharge or grate discharge, and finished pellet screening, transfer, and storage. The atmospheric pellet cooler vent stack and gravity conveyor gallery vents designed to remove heat and water vapor from the structure are not included as a part of the finished pellet handling affected source.</p><p class="depth0">Fugitive dust emission source means a stationary source from which particles are discharged to the atmosphere due to wind or mechanical inducement such as vehicle traffic. Fugitive dust sources include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Stockpiles (includes, but is not limited to, stockpiles of uncrushed ore, crushed ore, or finished pellets);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Material transfer points;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Plant roadways;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Tailings basins;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Pellet loading areas; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Yard areas.</p><p class="depth0">Grate feed means the transfer of unfired taconite pellets from the pelletizer into the indurating furnace.</p><p class="depth0">Grate kiln indurating furnace means a furnace system that consists of a traveling grate, a rotary kiln, and an annular cooler. The grate kiln indurating furnace begins at the point where the grate feed conveyor discharges the green balls onto the furnace traveling grate and ends where the hardened pellets exit the cooler. The atmospheric pellet cooler vent stack is not included as part of the grate kiln indurating furnace.</p><p class="depth0">Indurating means the process whereby unfired taconite pellets, called green balls, are hardened at high temperature in an indurating furnace. Types of indurating furnaces include straight grate indurating furnaces and grate kiln indurating furnaces.</p><p class="depth0">Ore crushing and handling means the process whereby dry taconite ore is crushed and screened. Ore crushing and handling includes, but is not limited to, all dry crushing operations (e.g., primary, secondary, and tertiary crushing), dry ore conveyance and transfer points, dry ore classification and screening, dry ore storage and stockpiling, dry milling, dry cobbing (i.e., dry magnetic separation), and the grate feed. Ore crushing and handling specifically excludes any operations where the dry crushed ore is saturated with water, such as wet milling and wet magnetic separation.</p><p class="depth0">Ore dryer means a rotary dryer that repeatedly tumbles wet taconite ore concentrate through a heated air

stream to reduce the amount of entrained moisture in the taconite ore concentrate.</p><p class="depth0">Pellet cooler vent stacks means atmospheric vents in the cooler section of the grate kiln indurating furnace that exhaust cooling air that is not returned for recuperation. Pellet cooler vent stacks are not to be confused with the cooler discharge stack, which is in the pellet loadout or dumping area.</p><p class="depth0">Pellet loading area means that portion of a taconite iron ore processing plant where taconite pellets are loaded into trucks or railcars.</p><p class="depth0">Responsible official means responsible official as defined in Sec. 63.2.</p><p class="depth0">Rod-deck venturi scrubber means a wet scrubber emission control device in which the inlet air flows through a bed of parallel metal pipes spaced apart to produce a series of parallel venturi throats.</p><p class="depth0">Screen means a device for separating material according to size by passing undersize material through one or more mesh surfaces (screens) in series and retaining oversize material on the mesh surfaces (screens).</p><p class="depth0">Storage bin means a facility for storage (including surge bins and hoppers) of taconite ore or taconite pellets prior to further processing or loading.</p><p class="depth0">Straight grate indurating furnace means a furnace system that consists of a traveling grate that carries the taconite pellets through different furnace temperature zones. In the straight grate indurating furnace a layer of fired pellets, called the hearth layer, is placed on the traveling grate prior to the addition of unfired pellets. The straight grate indurating furnace begins at the point where the grate feed conveyor discharges the green balls onto the furnace traveling grate and ends where the hardened pellets drop off of the traveling grate.</p><p class="depth0">Taconite iron ore processing means the separation and concentration of iron ore from taconite, a low-grade iron ore, to produce taconite pellets.</p><p class="depth0">Taconite ore means a low-grade iron ore suitable for concentration of magnetite or hematite by fine grinding and magnetic or flotation treatment, from which pellets containing iron can be produced.</p><p class="depth0">Tailings basin means a natural or artificial impoundment in which gangue or other refuse material resulting from the washing, concentration or treatment of ground taconite iron ore is confined.</p><p class="depth0">Wet grinding and milling means the process whereby wet taconite ore is finely ground using rod and/or ball mills.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Table 1 to Subpart RRRRR of Part 63--Emission Limits</p><p class="depth0">As required in Sec. 63.9590(a), you must comply with each applicable emission limit in the following table:
