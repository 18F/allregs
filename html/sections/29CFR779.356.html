How  duties relating to the processing or manufacturing of such materials  affect the application of these exemptions is discussed in further  detail in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, (c), and (d) of Sec. 779.354). Employees engaged in such  activities at a manufacturing plant, central yard, or other place not  qualifying as an exempt establishment under section 13(a) (2) and (4)  are not exempt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Employees serving exempt and nonexempt operations. In lumber and  building materials establishments which qualify for exemption under  section 13(a)(2) but engage in some activities in which their employees  are not exempt, such as construction or the making or processing of  materials for sale where no exemption under section 13(a)(4) is  applicable, there may be auxiliary employees of the establishment whose  duties relate to both the exempt sales portion of the business and the  non-exempt operations. For example, office workers may keep records of  both the retail sales and construction or manufacturing activities;  custodial workers may clean the entire premises, including portions  devoted to nonexempt manufacturing; and warehousemen, messengers, and  stock clerks may handle material for all departments, including material  used in the nonexempt operations. These employees do not qualify for the  exemption except when they are primarily engaged in the sales portion of  the business and only incidentally perform clerical, custodial, or  messenger service for the other operations. As an enforcement policy,  such an employee will not be considered to be engaged in nonexempt  activities which render him ineligible for exemption under section  13(a)(2) if, in the particular workweek, an insubstantial amount of his  time (20 percent or less) is allocable to the clerical, custodial, or  messenger services performed by him which relate to such nonexempt  operations of the employer.</p><p class="depth2">Coal Dealers</p>
