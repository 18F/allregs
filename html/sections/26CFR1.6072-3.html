However, the  postponement of the due date shall not apply to an income tax return for  any such taxable year if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The books of account and business records are available so as to  permit the filing of a proper return, and the corporation has otherwise  been in a position to carry on its commercial operations and corporate  activities and to make a proper distribution of its earnings or profits,  if any, so as to permit the certification required by section 941(b); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All the commercial operations and corporate activities of such  corporation have been carried on in Hong Kong, Macao, or Taiwan  (Formosa).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of  this section, the postponed due date referred to in this section will  apply if a corporation satisfies the Commissioner that special  circumstances exist, related to the unsettled conditions in China, which  warrant such postponement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The postponed due date provided for in this section is expressly  subject to the power of the Commissioner to extend, as in other cases,  the time for filing the income tax return. See section 6081 and the  regulations thereunder.</p>
