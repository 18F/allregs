CSB employees are not permitted to appear and testify  in court in such actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Normally, depositions will be taken and interrogatories answered  at the CSB's headquarters in Washington, DC, and at a time arranged with  the employee reasonably fixed to avoid substantial interference with the  performance of his or her duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> CSB employees are authorized to testify only once in connection  with any investigation they have made of an incident. Consequently, when  more than one civil lawsuit arises as a result of an incident, it shall  be the duty of counsel seeking the employee's deposition to ascertain  the identity of all parties to the multiple lawsuits and their counsel,  and to advise them of the fact that a deposition has been granted, so  that all interested parties may be afforded the opportunity to  participate therein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Upon completion of the deposition of a CSB employee, the  original of the transcript will be provided to the deponent for  signature and correction, which the CSB does not waive. A copy of the  transcript of the testimony and any videotape shall be furnished, at the  expense of the party requesting the deposition, to the CSB's General  Counsel at Washington, DC headquarters for the CSB's files.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If CSB employees are required to travel to testify, under the  relevant substantive and procedural laws and regulations the party  requesting the testimony must pay for the costs, including travel  expenses. Costs must be paid by check or money order payable to the  Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board.</p>
