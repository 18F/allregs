Any Service officer, or Customs officer acting under  Sec.  14.54, may detain imported or exported wildlife and any associated  property. As soon as practicable following the importation or  exportation and decision to detain, the Service will mail a notice of  detention by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to  the importer or consignee, or exporter, if known or easily  ascertainable. Such notice must describe the detained wildlife or other  property, indicate the reason for the detention, describe the general  nature of the tests or inquiries to be conducted, and indicate that if  the releasability of the wildlife has not been determined within 30 days  after the date of the notice, or a longer period if specifically stated,  that the Service will deem the wildlife to be seized and will issue no  further notification of seizure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Refusal of clearance. Any Service officer may refuse clearance  of imported or exported wildlife and any Customs officer acting under  Sec.  14.54 may refuse clearance of imported wildlife when there are  responsible grounds to believe that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A Federal law or regulation has been violated;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The correct identity and country of origin of the wildlife has  not been established (in such cases, the burden is upon the owner,  importer, exporter, consignor, or consignee to establish such identity  by scientific name to the species level or, if any subspecies is  protected by the laws of this country or the country of origin to the  subspecies level);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any permit, license, or other documentation required for  clearance of such wildlife is not available, is not   currently valid, has been suspended or revoked, or is not authentic;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The importer, exporter, or the importer's or exporter's agent  has filed an incorrect or incomplete declaration for importation or  exportation as provided in Sec.  14.61 or Sec.  14.63; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The importer, exporter, or the importer's or exporter's agent  has not paid any fee or portion of balance due for inspection fees  required by Sec.  14.93 or Sec.  14.94, or penalties assessed against  the importer or exporter under 50 CFR part 11. This paragraph does not  apply to penalty assessments on appeal in accordance with the provisions  of part 11.  [61 FR 31869, June 21, 1996]</p>
