                                Sec. 81.73  GSE request for proprietary treatment.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A GSE may request proprietary treatment of any mortgage  data or AHAR information that the GSE submits to the Secretary. Such a  request does not affect the GSE's responsibility to provide data or  information required by the Secretary. Where the Secretary grants a  request for proprietary treatment, HUD will not include the data or  information in the public-use database or publicly disclose the data or  information, except as otherwise provided in accordance with this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Request for proprietary treatment of mortgage data and AHAR  information. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a GSE  requesting proprietary treatment of mortgage data or AHAR information  shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Clearly designate those portions of the mortgage data or AHAR  information to be treated as proprietary, with a prominent stamp, typed  legend, or other suitable form of notice, stating ``Proprietary  Information--Confidential Treatment Requested by [name of GSE]'' on each  page or portion of page to which the request applies. If such marking is  impractical, the GSE shall attach to the mortgage data or information  for which confidential treatment is requested a cover sheet prominently  marked ``Proprietary Information--Confidential Treatment Requested by  [name of GSE];''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Accompany its request with a certification by an officer or  authorized representative of the GSE that the mortgage data or  information is proprietary; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Submit any additional statements in support of proprietary  designation that the GSE chooses to provide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Alternative procedure available for mortgage data or AHAR  information subject to a temporary order, final order, or regulation in  effect. When the request for proprietary treatment pertains to mortgage  data or AHAR information that has been deemed proprietary by the  Secretary under a temporary order, final order, or regulation in effect,  the GSE may reference such temporary order, final order, or regulation  in lieu of complying with paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Nondisclosure during pendency. Except as may otherwise be  required by law, during the time any Request for Proprietary Treatment  under Sec. 81.73 is pending determination by the Secretary, the data or  information submitted by the GSE that is the subject of the request  shall not be disclosed to, or be subject to examination by, the public  or any person or representative of any person or agency outside of HUD.</p>
