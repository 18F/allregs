Immuno-compromised persons such as persons with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, persons who have undergone organ transplants, people with HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders, some elderly, and infants can be particularly at risk from infections. These people should seek advice about drinking water from their health care providers. EPA/CDC guidelines on appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by Cryptosporidium and other microbial contaminants are available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ending in the report due by July 1, 2001, a system which detects arsenic at levels above 0.025 mg/L, but below the 0.05 mg/L, and beginning in the report due by July 1, 2002, a system that detects arsenic above 0.005 mg/L and up to and including 0.010 mg/L:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Must include in its report a short informational statement about arsenic, using language such as: While your drinking water meets EPA's standard for arsenic, it does contain low levels of arsenic. EPA's standard balances the current understanding of arsenic's possible health effects against the costs of removing arsenic from drinking water. EPA continues to research the health effects of low levels of arsenic, which is a mineral known to cause cancer in humans at high concentrations and is linked to other health effects such as skin damage and circulatory problems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> May write its own educational statement, but only in consultation with the Primacy Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A system which detects nitrate at levels above 5 mg/l, but below the MCL:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Must include a short informational statement about the impacts of nitrate on children using language such as: Nitrate in drinking water at levels above 10 ppm is a health risk for infants of less than six months of age. High nitrate levels in drinking water can cause blue baby syndrome. Nitrate levels may rise quickly for short periods of time because of rainfall or agricultural activity. If you are caring for an infant you should ask advice from your health care provider.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> May write its own educational statement, but only in consultation with the Primacy Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Every report must include the following lead-specific information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A short informational statement about lead in drinking water and its effects on children. The statement must include the following information:
If present, elevated levels of lead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. Lead in drinking water is primarily from materials and components associated with service lines and home plumbing. [NAME OF UTILITY] is responsible for providing high quality drinking water, but cannot control the variety of materials used in plumbing components. When your water has been sitting for several hours, you can minimize the potential for lead exposure by flushing your tap for 30 seconds to 2 minutes before using water for drinking or cooking. If you are concerned about lead in your water, you may wish to have your water tested. Information on lead in drinking water, testing methods, and steps you can take to minimize exposure is available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline or at http://www.epa.gov/safewater/lead.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A system may write its own educational statement, but only in consultation with the State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Community water systems that detect TTHM above 0.080 mg/l, but below the MCL in Sec.  141.12, as an annual average, monitored and calculated under the provisions of Sec.  141.30, must include health effects language for TTHMs prescribed by appendix A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Beginning in the report due by July 1, 2002, and ending January 22, 2006, a community water system that detects arsenic above 0.010 mg/L and up to and including 0.05 mg/L must include the arsenic health effects language prescribed by appendix A to subpart O of this part.
