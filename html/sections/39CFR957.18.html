                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Not later than 7 days prior to the scheduled date of the hearing  any party may file application with the Recorder for the taking of  testimony by deposition. In support of such application the applicant  shall submit under oath or affirmation a statement setting out the  reasons why such testimony should be taken by deposition, the time and  the place, and the name and address of the witness whose deposition is  desired, the subject matter of the testimony of each witness, its  relevancy, and the name and address of the person before whom the  deposition is to be taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the application be granted, the order for the taking of the  deposition will specify the time and place thereof, the name of the  witness, the person before whom the deposition is to be taken and any  other necessary information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each witness testifying upon deposition shall be duly sworn, and  the adverse party shall have the right to cross-examine. The questions  and answers together with all objections, shall be reduced to writing  and, unless waived by stipulation of the parties, shall be read to and  subscribed by the witness in the presence of the deposition officer who  shall certify it in the usual form. The deposition officer shall file  the testimony taken by deposition as directed in the order. The  deposition officer shall put the witness on oath. All objections made at  the time of examination shall be noted by the deposition officer and the  evidence objected to shall be taken subject to the objections. In lieu  of participating in the oral examination, a party may transmit written  interrogatories to the officer, who shall propound them to the witness  and record the answers verbatim. Objections to relevancy or materiality  of testimony, or to errors and irregularities occurring at the oral  examination in the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the  questions or answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of  the parties and errors of any kind which might be obviated, cured or  removed if promptly presented, are waived unless timely objection is  made at the taking of the deposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> At the hearing any part or all of the deposition may be offered  in evidence by any party who was present or represented at the taking of  the deposition or who had notice thereof. If the deposition is not  offered and received in evidence, it shall not be considered as a part  of the record in the proceeding. The admissibility of depositions or  parts thereof shall be governed by the rules of evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The party requesting the deposition shall pay all fees required  to be paid to witnesses and the deposition officer, and shall provide an  original and one copy of the deposition for the official record, and  shall serve one copy upon the opposing party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Within the United States or within a territory or insular  possession, subject to the dominion of the United States, depositions  may be taken before an officer authorized to administer oaths by the  laws of the United States or of the place where the examination is held;  within a foreign country, depositions may be taken before a secretary of  an embassy or legation, consul general, vice consul or consular agent of  the United States, or any other person designated in the order for the  taking of a deposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Depositions may also be taken and submitted on written  interrogatories in substantially the same manner as depositions taken by  oral examination. When a deposition is taken upon written  interrogatories and cross-interrogatories, none of the parties shall be  present or represented, and no person, other than the witness, a  stenographic reporter, and the officer shall be present at the  examination of the witness, which fact shall be certified by the  officer, who shall propound the interrogatories and cross- interrogatories to the witness in their order and reduce the testimony  to writing in the witness' own words.
