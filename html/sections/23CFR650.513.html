                            <p class="depth0">Each State DOT, Federal agency, or tribal government tunnel inspection organization, to carry out its inspection responsibilities, shall perform or cause to be performed all of the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Inspect tunnel structural elements and functional systems in accordance with the inspection guidance provided in the Tunnel Operations, Maintenance, Inspection and Evaluation (TOMIE) Manual (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 650.517).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Provide at least one Team Leader, who meets the minimum qualifications stated in Sec. 650.509, at the tunnel at all times during each initial, routine, and in-depth inspection. The State DOT, Federal agency, or tribal government shall report the nationally certified tunnel inspector identification for each Team Leader that is wholly or partly responsible for a tunnel inspection must be reported to the National Tunnel Inventory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prepare and document tunnel-specific inspection procedures for each tunnel inspected and inventoried that shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Take into account the design assumptions and the tunnel complexity; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify the--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Tunnel structural elements and functional systems to be inspected;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Methods of inspection to be used;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Frequency of inspection for each method; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Inspection equipment, access equipment, and traffic coordination needed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Establish requirements for functional system testing, direct observation of critical system checks, and testing documentation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For complex tunnels, identify specialized inspection procedures and additional inspector training and experience required to inspect complex tunnels. Inspect complex tunnels according to the specialized inspection procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Conduct tunnel inspections with qualified staff not associated with the operation or maintenance of the tunnel structure or functional systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Rate each tunnel's safe vehicular load-carrying capacity in accordance with the Sections 6 or 8, AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 650.517). A State DOT, Federal agency, or tribal government shall conduct a load rating evaluation as soon as practical, but not later than three months after the completion of the inspection, if a change in condition is identified. Post or restrict the highways in or over the tunnel in accordance with Section 6, AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 650.517), or in accordance with State law, when the

maximum unrestricted legal loads or State routine permit loads exceed those allowed under the operating rating or equivalent rating factor. Postings shall be made as soon as possible but not later than 30 days after a valid load rating determines a need for such posting. At-grade roadways in tunnels are exempt from load rating. A State DOT, Federal agency, or tribal government, shall maintain load rating calculations or input files with a summary of results as a part of the tunnel record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Prepare tunnel inspection documentation as described in the Tunnel Operations, Maintenance, Inspection and Evaluation (TOMIE) Manual (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 650.517), and maintain written reports or electronic files on the results of tunnel inspections, together with notations of any action taken to address the findings of such inspections. Maintain relevant maintenance and inspection data to allow assessment of current tunnel condition. At a minimum, information collected will include data regarding basic tunnel information (e.g., tunnel location, posted speed, inspection reports, repair recommendations, and repair and rehabilitation work completed), tunnel and roadway geometrics, interior tunnel structural features, portal structure features, and tunnel systems information. When available, tunnel data collected shall include diagrams, photos, condition of each structural and functional system component, notations of any action taken to address the findings of such inspections, and the national tunnel inspector certification registry identification for each Team Leader responsible in whole or in part for the inspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Use systematic quality control and quality assurance procedures to maintain a high degree of accuracy and consistency in the inspection program. Include periodic field review of inspection teams, data quality checks, and independent review of inspection reports and computations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Establish a Statewide, Federal agency-wide, or tribal government-wide procedure to ensure that critical findings are addressed in a timely manner. Notify FHWA within 24 hours of any critical finding and the activities taken, underway, or planned to resolve or monitor the critical finding. Update FHWA regularly or as requested on the status of each critical finding until it is resolved. Annually provide a written report to FHWA with a summary of the current status of the resolutions for each critical finding identified within that year or unresolved from a previous year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Provide information at least annually, or more frequently upon request, in cooperation with any FHWA review of State DOT, Federal agency, or tribal government compliance with the NTIS. The FHWA will assess annually State DOT compliance using statistical assessments and well-defined measures based on the requirements of this subpart.</p>
