The incorporation by reference of this APTA standard was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. You may obtain a copy of the incorporated document from the American Public Transit Association, 1201 New York Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20005.

A railroad may move a car in this fashion only after visually verifying an application and release of the brakes on both sides of the car that was repaired, and provided that the car is appropriately tagged to indicate the need to perform a single car test. The single car test shall be completed prior to, or as a part of, the car's next calendar day mechanical inspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If one or more of the following conventional air brake equipment items is removed, repaired, or replaced only that portion which is renewed or replaced must be tested to satisfy the provisions of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Brake reservoir;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Brake cylinder;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Piston assembly;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Vent valve;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Quick service valve;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Brake cylinder release valve;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Modulating valve or slack adjuster; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Angle cock or cutout cock.
