                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Acquisition planning is an indispensable component of the total  acquisition process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For the acquisition of health-care resources consisting of  commercial services or the use of medical equipment or space, where the  acquisition is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold  (SAT), an acquisition team must be assembled. The team shall be tailored  by the contracting officer for each particular acquisition expected to  exceed the SAT. The team should consist of a mix of staff, appropriate  to the complexity of the acquisition, and may include contracting,  fiscal, legal, administrative, and technical personnel, and such other  expertise as necessary to assure a comprehensive acquisition plan. The  team should include the small business advocate representing the  contracting activity or a higher level designee and the SBA Procurement  Center Representative (PRC), if available. As a minimum, the team must  include the   contracting officer and a representative of the requesting service. (38  U.S.C. 8153)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prior to determining whether a requirement is suitable for  acquisition using these simplified acquisition procedures, the  contracting officer or the acquisition team, as appropriate, must  conduct market research to identify interested businesses. It is the  responsibility of the contracting officer to ensure the requirement is  appropriately publicized and information about the procurement  opportunity is adequately disseminated as set forth in 873.108. (38  U.S.C. 8153)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In lieu of the requirements of FAR part 7 addressing  documentation of the acquisition plan, the contracting officer may  conduct an acquisition strategy meeting with cognizant offices to seek  approval for the proposed acquisition approach. If a meeting is  conducted, briefing materials shall be presented to address the  acquisition plan topics and structure in FAR 7.105. Formal written  minutes--summarizing decisions, actions, and conclusions--shall be  prepared and included in the contract file, along with a copy of the  briefing materials. (38 U.S.C. 8153)</p>
