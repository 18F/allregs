                            <p class="depth0">You must identify a single primary intended service class for each  compression-ignition engine family. Select the class that best describes  vehicles for which you design and market the engine. The three primary  intended service classes are light heavy-duty, medium heavy-duty, and  heavy heavy-duty. Note that provisions that apply based on primary  intended service class often treat spark-ignition engines as if they  were a separate service class.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Light heavy-duty engines usually are not designed for rebuild  and do not have cylinder liners. Vehicle body types in this group might  include any   heavy-duty vehicle built for a light-duty truck chassis, van trucks,  multi-stop vans, motor homes and other recreational vehicles, and some  straight trucks with a single rear axle. Typical applications would  include personal transportation, light-load commercial delivery,  passenger service, agriculture, and construction. The GVWR of these  vehicles is normally below 19,500 pounds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Medium heavy-duty engines may be designed for rebuild and may  have cylinder liners. Vehicle body types in this group would typically  include school buses, straight trucks with dual rear axles, city  tractors, and a variety of special purpose vehicles such as small dump  trucks, and refuse trucks. Typical applications would include commercial  short haul and intra-city delivery and pickup. Engines in this group are  normally used in vehicles whose GVWR ranges from 19,500 to 33,000  pounds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Heavy heavy-duty engines are designed for multiple rebuilds and  have cylinder liners. Vehicles in this group are normally tractors,  trucks, and buses used in inter-city, long-haul applications. These  vehicles normally exceed 33,000 pounds GVWR.</p>
