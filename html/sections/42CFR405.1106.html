                                Sec. 405.1106  Where a request for review or escalation may be filed.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When a request for a MAC review is filed after an ALJ has issued a decision or dismissal, the request for review must be filed with the entity specified in the notice of the ALJ's action. The appellant must also send a copy of the request for review to the other parties to the ALJ decision or dismissal who received a copy of the hearing decision under Sec. 405.1046(a) or a copy of the notice of dismissal under Sec. 405.1052(b). Failure to copy the other parties tolls the MAC's adjudication deadline set forth in Sec. 405.1100 until all parties to the hearing receive notice of the request for MAC review. If the request for review is timely filed with an entity other than the entity specified in the notice of the ALJ's action, the MAC's adjudication period to conduct a review begins on the date the request for review is received by the entity specified in the notice of the ALJ's action. Upon receipt of a request for review from an entity other than the entity specified in the notice of the ALJ's action, the MAC sends written notice to the appellant of the date of receipt of the request and commencement of the adjudication timeframe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an appellant files a request to escalate an appeal to the MAC level because the ALJ has not completed his or her action on the request for hearing within the adjudication deadline under Sec. 405.1016, the request for escalation must be filed with both the ALJ and the MAC. The appellant must also send a copy of the request for escalation to the other parties. Failure to copy the other parties tolls the MAC's adjudication deadline set forth in Sec. 405.1100 until all parties to the hearing receive notice of the request for MAC review. In a case that has been escalated from the ALJ, the MAC's 180 calendar day period to issue a final decision, dismissal order, or remand order begins on the date the request for escalation is received by the MAC.
