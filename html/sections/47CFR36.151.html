The basic method of making this assignment is the identification of the facilities assignable to each category and the determination of the cost of the facilities so identified. Because of variations among companies in the character of the facilities and operating conditions, and in the accounting and engineering records

maintained, the detailed methods followed, of necessity, will vary among the companies. The general principles to be followed, however, will be the same for all companies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The second step is the apportionment of the cost of the facilities in each category among the operations through the application of appropriate factors or by direct assignment.</p>
