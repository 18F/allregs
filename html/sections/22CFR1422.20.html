                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Regional Director shall issue to the parties a certification of results of the election or a certification of representative, where appropriate: Provided, however, That no objections are filed within the time limit set forth below; the challenged ballots are insufficient in number to affect the results of the election; and no rerun election is to be held.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Within twenty (20) days after the tally of ballots has been furnished, a party may file objections to the procedural conduct of the election, or to conduct which may have improperly affected the results of the election, setting forth a clear and concise statement of the reasons therefor. The objecting party shall bear the burden of proof at all stages of the proceeding regarding all matters raised in its objections. An original and two (2) copies of the objections shall be filed with the Regional Director and copies shall be served on the parties. A statement of such service shall be filed with the Regional Director. Such filing must be timely whether or not the challenged ballots are sufficient in number to affect the results of the election. Within

ten (10) days after the filing of the objections, unless an extension of time has been granted by the Regional Director, the objecting party shall file with the Regional Director evidence, including signed statements, documents and other material supporting the objections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If objections are filed or challenged ballots are sufficient in number to affect the results of the election, the Regional Director shall investigate the objections or challenged ballots, or both.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When the Regional Director determines that no relevant question of fact exists, the Regional Director (1) shall find whether improper conduct occurred of such a nature as to warrant the setting aside of the election and, if so, indicate an intention to set aside the election, or (2) shall rule on determinative challenged ballots, if any, or both. The Regional Director shall issue a report and findings on objections and/or challenged ballots which shall be served upon all parties to the proceeding. Such report and findings shall state therein any additional pertinent matters such as an intent to rerun the election or count ballots at a specified date, time, and place, and if appropriate, that the Regional Director will cause to be issued a revised tally of ballots.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When the Regional Director determines that no relevant question of fact exists, but that a substantial question of interpretation or policy exists, the Regional Director shall notify the parties in the report and findings and transfer the case to the Board in accordance with of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any party aggrieved by the findings of a Regional Director with respect to objections to an election or challenged ballots may obtain a review of such action by the Board by following the procedure set forth in Sec. 1422.6(d) of this subchapter: Provided, however, That a determination by the Regional Director to issue a notice of hearing shall not be subject to review by the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Where it appears to the Regional Director that the objections or challenged ballots raise any relevant question of fact which may have affected the results of the election, the Regional Director shall cause to be issued a notice of hearing. Hearings shall be conducted and decisions issued by Administrative Law Judges and exceptions and related submissions filed with the Board in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1423.14 through 1423.28 of this subchapter excluding Sec. 1423.18 and Sec. 1423.19(j), with the following exceptions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Administrative Law Judge may not recommend remedial action to be taken or notices to be posted, as provided under Sec. 1423.26(a); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reference to ``charge, complaint'' in Sec. 1423.26(b) shall be read as ``report and findings of the Regional Director.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> At a hearing conducted pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section the party filing the objections shall have the burden of proving all matters alleged in its objections by a preponderance of the evidence. With respect to challenged ballots, no burden of proof is imposed on any party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The Board shall take action which may consist of the following, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Issue a decision adopting, modifying, or rejecting the Administrative Law Judge's decision;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Issue a decision in any case involving a substantial question of interpretation or policy transferred pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Issue a ruling with respect to a request for review filed pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section affirming or reversing, in whole or in part, the Regional Director's findings, or make such other disposition as may be appropriate.</p>
