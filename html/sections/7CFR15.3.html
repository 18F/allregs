                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity of the applicant or recipient to which these regulations apply. These regulations apply, but are not restricted, to unequal treatment in priority, quality, quantity, methods or charges for service, use, occupancy or benefit, participation in the service or

benefit available, or in the use, occupancy or benefit of any structure, facility, or improvement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Specific discriminatory actions prohibited. (1) A recipient under any program to which the regulations in this part apply may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements on the ground of race, color, or national origin:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A recipient under any program to which the regulations in this part apply may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements on the ground of race, color, or national origin:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit, to an individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that provided to others under the program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege, enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program through the provisions of services or otherwise or afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program as an employee but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (c) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Deny a person the opportunity to participate as a member of a planning or advisory body which is an integral part of the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program or the class of individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respects individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In determining the site or location of facilities, an applicant or recipient may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any of its programs or activities to which the regulations in this part apply, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act and the regulations in this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> As used in this section, the services, financial aid, or other benefit provided under a program or activity of an applicant or recipient receiving Federal financial assistance shall be deemed to include any and all services, financial aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility provided or improved in whole or part with the aid of Federal financial assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in these regulations does not limit the applicability of the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)(i)</em> In administering a program regarding which the recipient has previously discriminated against persons on the ground of race, color, or national origin, the recipient must take affirmative action to overcome the effects of prior discrimination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In administering a program regarding which the recipient has previously discriminated against persons on the ground of race, color, or national origin, the recipient must take affirmative action to overcome the effects of prior discrimination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Even in the absence of such prior discrimination, a recipient in administering a program may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular race, color or national origin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Employment practices. Where a primary objective of the Federal financial

assistance to a program to which the regulations in this part apply is to provide employment, a recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, subject an individual to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under the program including recruitment or recruitment advertising, employment, layoff or termination, upgrading, demotion, or transfer, rates of pay or other forms of compensation, and use of facilities. This paragraph applies to programs where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is (1) to reduce unemployment, (2) to assist individuals in meeting expenses incident to the commencement or continuation of their education or training, or (3) to provide work experience which contributes to education or training. Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulations in this part, tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity of the applicant or recipient to which these regulations apply, the foregoing provisions of this Sec. 15.3(c) shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to these regulations, to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries. The requirements applicable to construction employment under any program or activity of the applicant or recipient shall be those specified in or pursuant to part III of Executive Order 11246 or any Executive order which supersedes it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples.

These illustrations and examples, however, are not intended to be all inclusive. The fact that a particular type of Federal financial assistance is not listed does not, of course, indicate that a program is not covered by the regulations in this part.
