                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility. A tenant or owner-occupant displaced from a dwelling is entitled to a payment not to exceed $5,250 for rental assistance, as computed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, or downpayment assistance, as

computed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, if such displaced person:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has actually and lawfully occupied the displacement dwelling for at least 90 days immediately prior to the initiation of negotiations; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has rented, or purchased, and occupied a decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling within 1 year (unless the Agency extends this period for good cause) after:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For a tenant, the date he or she moves from the displacement dwelling; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For an owner-occupant, the later of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The date he or she receives final payment for the displacement dwelling, or in the case of condemnation, the date the full amount of the estimate of just compensation is deposited with the court; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The date he or she moves from the displacement dwelling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rental assistance payment--(1) Amount of payment. An eligible displaced person who rents a replacement dwelling is entitled to a payment not to exceed $5,250 for rental assistance. (See Sec. 24.404.) Such payment shall be 42 times the amount obtained by subtracting the base monthly rental for the displacement dwelling from the lesser of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amount of payment. An eligible displaced person who rents a replacement dwelling is entitled to a payment not to exceed $5,250 for rental assistance. (See Sec. 24.404.) Such payment shall be 42 times the amount obtained by subtracting the base monthly rental for the displacement dwelling from the lesser of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The monthly rent and estimated average monthly cost of utilities for a comparable replacement dwelling; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The monthly rent and estimated average monthly cost of utilities for the decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling actually occupied by the displaced person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Base monthly rental for displacement dwelling. The base monthly rental for the displacement dwelling is the lesser of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The average monthly cost for rent and utilities at the displacement dwelling for a reasonable period prior to displacement, as determined by the Agency (for an owner-occupant, use the fair market rent for the displacement dwelling. For a tenant who paid little or no rent for the displacement dwelling, use the fair market rent, unless its use would result in a hardship because of the person's income or other circumstances);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Thirty (30) percent of the displaced person's average monthly gross household income if the amount is classified as ``low income'' by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Annual Survey of Income Limits for the Public Housing and Section 8 Programs \4\. The base monthly rental shall be established solely on the criteria in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section for persons with income exceeding the survey's ``low income'' limits, for persons refusing to provide appropriate evidence of income, and for persons who are dependents.

A rental assistance payment may, at the Agency's discretion, be disbursed in either a lump sum or in installments. However, except as limited by Sec. 24.403(f), the full amount vests immediately, whether or not there is any later change in the person's income or rent, or in the condition or location of the person's housing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Downpayment assistance payment--(1) Amount of payment. An eligible displaced person who purchases a replacement dwelling is entitled to a downpayment assistance payment in the amount the person would receive under paragraph (b) of this section if the person rented a comparable replacement dwelling. At the Agency's discretion, a downpayment assistance payment that is less than $5,250 may be increased to any amount not to exceed $5,250. However, the payment to a displaced homeowner shall not exceed the amount the owner would receive under Sec. 24.401(b) if he or she met the 180-day occupancy requirement. If the Agency elects to provide the maximum payment of $5,250 as

a downpayment, the Agency shall apply this discretion in a uniform and consistent manner, so that eligible displaced persons in like circumstances are treated equally. A displaced person eligible to receive a payment as a 180-day owner-occupant under Sec. 24.401(a) is not eligible for this payment.
