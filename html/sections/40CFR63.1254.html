If the owner or operator can demonstrate that a process vent is controlled by a control device meeting the criteria specified in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A)(1) of this section, then the control device is required to be operated according to paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A)(2), (3), and (4) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The control device was installed on any process vent that met the conditions of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section on or before April 2, 1997, and was operated to reduce uncontrolled emissions of total HAP by greater than or equal to 93 percent by weight, but less than 98 percent by weight;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The device must be operated to reduce inlet emissions of total HAP by 93 percent or by the percent reduction specified for that control device in any preconstruction permit issued pursuant to regulations approved or promulgated through rulemaking under title I (including parts C or D) of the Clean Air Act, whichever is greater;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The device must be replaced or upgraded to achieve at least 98 percent reduction of HAP or meet any of the conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section upon reconstruction or replacement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The device must be replaced or upgraded to achieve at least 98 percent reduction of HAP or meet any of the conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section by April 2, 2007, or 15 years after issuance of the preconstruction permit, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Process operations. If a process meets all of the conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(B)(1) through (3) of this section, the required level of control for the process is the level that was achieved on or before April 2, 1997.

For each PMPU that is controlled with a CCCD, the owner or operator must comply with the provisions specified in either paragraph (a)(4)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section during periods of planned routine maintenance of the CCCD. The owner or operator is not required to comply with the same provision for all of the PMPU's controlled by the CCCD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Shutdown the affected process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section by using other means.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For a non-dedicated PMPU, implement the procedures described in paragraphs (a)(4)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section for those process vents that are normally controlled by the CCCD.

As an alternative standard, the owner or operator of an existing or new affected source may comply with the process vent standards by routing vents from a process to a combustion control device achieving an outlet TOC concentration, as calibrated on methane or the predominant HAP, of 20 ppmv or less, and an outlet concentration of hydrogen halides and halogens of 20 ppmv or less. If the owner or operator is routing emissions to a noncombustion control device, it must achieve an outlet TOC concentration, as calibrated on methane or the predominant HAP, of 50 ppmv or less, and an outlet concentration of hydrogen halides and halogens of 50 ppmv or less. Any process vents within a process that are not routed to this control device must be controlled in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, as applicable. Initial compliance with the outlet concentrations is demonstrated in accordance with the initial compliance procedures described in Sec.  63.1257(d)(1)(iv), and continuous compliance is demonstrated in accordance with the emission monitoring requirements described in Sec.  63.1258(b)(5).[65 FR 52601, Aug. 29, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 40132, Aug. 2, 2001]</p>
