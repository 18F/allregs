                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You are exempted from the tampering prohibition with respect to  outside useful life vehicles/engines if you properly document and notify  EPA that the conversion system satisfies all the provisions in this  section; you meet the labeling requirements in Sec. 85.530 before you  sell, import or otherwise facilitate the use of a clean alternative fuel  conversion system; and you meet the applicable requirements in  Sec. 85.535. You may also meet the requirements under this section by  complying with the provisions in Sec. 85.515.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Documenting and notifying EPA under this section includes the  following provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must notify us as described in this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must use good engineering judgment to specify, use, and  assemble fuel system components and other hardware and software that are  properly designed and matched for the vehicles/engines in which they  will be installed. Good engineering judgment also dictates that any  testing or data   used to satisfy demonstration requirements be generated at a quality  laboratory that follows good laboratory practices and that is capable of  performing official EPA emission tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> OBD requirements. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The OBD system must properly detect and  identify malfunctions in all monitored emission-related powertrain  systems or components including any new monitoring capability necessary  to identify potential emission problems associated with the new fuel.  These include but are not limited to: Fuel trim lean and rich monitors,  catalyst deterioration monitors, engine misfire monitors, oxygen sensor  deterioration monitors, EGR system monitors, if applicable, and vapor  leak monitors, if applicable. No original OBD system monitor that is  still applicable to the vehicle/engine may be aliased, removed,  bypassed, or turned-off. No MILs shall be illuminated after the  conversion. Readiness flags must be properly set for all monitors that  identify any malfunction for all monitored components.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Subsequent to the vehicle/engine fuel conversion, you must  clear all OBD codes and reset all OBD monitors to not-ready status using  an OBD scan tool appropriate for the OBD system in the vehicle/engine in  question. You must operate the vehicle/engine with the new fuel on  representative road operation or chassis dynamometer/engine dynamometer  testing cycles to satisfy the monitors' enabling criteria. When all  monitors have reset to a ready status, you must submit an OBD scan tool  report showing that with the vehicle/engine operating in the key-on/ engine-on mode, all supported monitors have reset to a ready status and  no emission related ``pending'' (or potential) or ``confirmed'' (or MIL- on) diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) have been stored. The MIL must not  be commanded ``On'' or be illuminated. A MIL check must also be  conducted in a key-on/engine-off mode to verify that the MIL is  functioning properly. You must include the VIN/EIN number of the test  vehicle/engine. If necessary, the OEM evaporative emission readiness  monitor may remain unset for dedicated gaseous fuel conversion systems.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In addition to conducting OBD testing described in this  paragraph (b)(4), you must submit to EPA the following statement of  compliance if the OEM vehicles/engines were required to be OBD-equipped:</p><p class="depth4">The test group/engine family converted to an alternative fuel has  fully functional OBD systems and therefore meets the OBD requirements  specified in 40 CFR part 86 when operating on the alternative fuel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Conversion test groups/engine families for conversions to dual- fuel or mixed-fuel vehicles/engines may not include vehicles/engines  subject to different emissions standards unless applicable exhaust and  OBD demonstrations are also conducted for the original fuel(s)  demonstrating compliance with the most stringent standard represented in  the test group. However the data generated from testing on the new fuel  for dual-fuel or mixed-fuel test vehicles/engines may be carried over to  vehicles/engines that otherwise meet the conversion test group/engine  family criteria and for which the test vehicle/engine data demonstrate  compliance with the applicable vehicle/engine standards. Clean  alternative fuel conversion evaporative families for dual-fuel or mixed- fuel vehicles/engines cannot include vehicles/engines that were  originally certified to different evaporative emissions standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> You must notify us by electronic submission in a format  specified by the Administrator with all required documentation. The  following must be submitted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must describe how your conversion system complies with the  good engineering judgment criteria in Sec. 85.520(b)(3) and/or other  requirements under this subpart or other applicable subparts such that  the conversion system qualifies as a clean alternative fuel conversion.  The submission must provide a level of technical detail sufficient for  EPA to confirm the conversion system's ability to maintain or improve on  emission levels in a worst case vehicle/engine. The submission of  technical information must include a complete characterization of  exhaust and evaporative emissions control strategies, the fuel delivery  system, durability, and specifications related to OBD system  functionality. You must present detailed information to   confirm the durability of all relevant new and existing components and  to explain why the conversion system will not harm the emission control  system or degrade the emissions. EPA may ask you to supply additional  information, including test data, to support the claim that the  conversion system does not increase emissions and involves good  engineering judgment that is being applied for purposes of conversion to  a clean alternative fuel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must describe the group of vehicles/engines (conversion  test group/conversion engine family) that is covered by your  notification based on the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In lieu of specific test data, you may submit the following  attestations for the appropriate statements of compliance, if you have  sufficient basis to prove the statement is valid.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The test group/engine family converted to an alternative fuel  has properly exercised the optional and applicable statements of  compliance or waivers in the certification regulations such as those  specified in 40 CFR part 86, subparts A, B, and S and 40 CFR part 1065.  Attest to each statement or waiver in your notification.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The test group/engine family converted to dual-fuel or mixed- fuel operation retains all the OEM fuel system, engine calibration, and  emission control system functionality when operating on the fuel with  which the vehicle/engine was originally certified.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The test group/engine family converted to dual-fuel or mixed- fuel operation retains all the functionality of the OEM OBD system (if  the OEM vehicles/engines were required to be OBD equipped) when  operating on the fuel with which the vehicle/engine was originally  certified.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The test group/engine family converted to dual-fuel or mixed- fuel operation properly purges hydrocarbon vapor from the evaporative  emission canister when the vehicle/engine is operating on the  alternative fuel.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The test group/engine family converted to an alternative fuel  uses fueling systems, evaporative emission control systems, and engine  powertrain components that are compatible with the alternative fuel and  designed with the principles of good engineering judgment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> You must include any other information as the Administrator may  deem appropriate, which may include test data, to establish the  conversion system is for the purpose of conversion to a clean  alternative fuel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Conversion systems must be properly installed and adjusted such  that the vehicle/engine operates consistent with the principles of good  engineering judgment and in accordance with all applicable regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> EPA may ask for any documentation and/or ask you to conduct  emission testing to demonstrate the conversion is for the purpose of a  clean alternative fuel.
