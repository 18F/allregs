                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> NMFS shall advise the permit holder or the designated agent of  any observer requirement at least 24 hours (not including weekends and  Federal holidays) before any trip for which NMFS received timely notice  in compliance with these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ``Notice Prior to Fishing Trip'' requirements in this  subpart commit the permit holder to the representations in the notice.  The notice can be modified by the permit holder or designated agent  because of changed circumstance, if the Regional Administrator is  promptly provided a modification to the notice that complies with the  notice requirements. The notice will also be considered modified if the  Regional Administrator and the permit holder or designated agent agrees  to placement changes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When NMFS notifies the permit holder or designated agent of the  obligation to carry an observer in response to a notification under this  subpart, or as a condition of an EFP issued under Sec. 665.17, the  vessel may not engage in the fishery without taking the observer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A NMFS observer shall arrive at the observer's assigned vessel  30 minutes before the time designated for departure in the notice or the  notice as modified, and will wait 1 hour for departure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A permit holder must accommodate a NMFS observer assigned under  these regulations. The Regional Administrator's office, and not the  observer, will address any concerns raised over accommodations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The permit holder, vessel operator, and crew must cooperate with  the observer in the performance of the observer's duties, including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Allowing for the embarking and debarking of the observer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Allowing the observer access to all areas of the vessel  necessary to conduct observer duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Allowing the observer access to communications equipment and  navigation equipment as necessary to perform observer duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Allowing the observer access to VMS units to verify operation,  obtain data, and use the communication capabilities of the units for  official purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Providing accurate vessel locations by latitude and longitude or  loran coordinates, upon request by the observer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Providing sea turtle, marine mammal, or seabird specimens as  requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Notifying the observer in a timely fashion when commercial  fishing operations are to begin and end.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The permit holder, operator, and crew must comply with other  terms and conditions to ensure the effective deployment and use of  observers that the Regional Administrator imposes by written notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The permit holder must ensure that assigned observers are  provided living quarters comparable to crew members and are provided the  same meals, snacks, and amenities as are normally provided to other  vessel personnel. A mattress or futon on the floor or a cot is not  acceptable if a regular bunk is provided to any crew member, unless  other arrangements are approved in advance by the Regional  Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Reimbursement requirements are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon observer verification of vessel accommodations and the  number of assigned days on board, NMFS will reimburse vessel owners a  reasonable amount for observer subsistence as determined by the Regional  Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If requested and properly documented, NMFS will reimburse the  vessel owner for the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Communications charges incurred by the observer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Lost fishing time arising from a seriously injured or seriously  ill observer, provided that notification of the nature of the emergency  is transmitted to the Observer Program, NMFS (see address for PIRO  Regional Administrator) at the earliest practical time. NMFS will  reimburse the owner only for those days during which the vessel is  unable to fish as a direct result of helping the NMFS employee who is  seriously injured or seriously ill. Lost fishing time is based on time  traveling to and from the fishing grounds and any documented out-of- pocket expenses for medical services. Payment will be based on the  current target fish market prices and that vessel's average target fish  catch retained per day at sea for the previous 2 years, but shall not  exceed $5,000 per day or $20,000 per claim. Detailed billing with  receipts and supporting records are required for allowable communication  and lost fishing time claims. The claim must be completed in ink,  showing the claimant's printed name, address, vessel name, observer  name, trip dates, days observer was on board, an explanation of the  charges, and claimant's dated signature with a statement verifying the  claim to be true and correct. Requested reimbursement claims must be  submitted to the Fisheries Observer Branch, Pacific Islands Region,  NMFS. NMFS will not process reimbursement invoices and documentation  submitted more than 120 days after the occurrence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> If a vessel normally has cabins for crew members, female  observers on a vessel with an all-male crew must be accommodated either  in a single person cabin or, if NMFS concludes that adequate privacy can  be ensured by installing a curtain or other temporary divider, in a two- person shared cabin. If the vessel normally does not have cabins for  crew members, alternative accommodations must be approved by NMFS. If a  cabin assigned to a female observer does not have its own toilet and  shower facilities that can be provided for the exclusive use of the  observer, or if no cabin is assigned, then arrangements for sharing  common facilities must be established and approved in advance by NMFS.</p>
