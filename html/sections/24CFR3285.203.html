Drainage must be provided to direct surface water away  from the home to protect against erosion of foundation supports and to  prevent water build-up under the home, as shown in Figure to Sec.  3285.203.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The home site must be graded as shown in Figure to Sec.  3285.203, or other methods, such as a drain tile and automatic sump pump  system, must be provided to remove any water that may collect under the  home.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All drainage must be diverted away from the home and must slope  a minimum of one-half inch per foot away from the foundation for the  first ten feet. Where property lines, walls, slopes, or other physical  conditions prohibit this slope, the site must be   provided with drains or swales or otherwise graded to drain water away  from the structure, as shown in Figure to Sec. 3285.203.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Sloped site considerations. The home, where sited, must be  protected from surface runoff from the surrounding area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Refer to Sec. 3285.902 regarding the use of drainage structures  to drain surface runoff.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Gutters and downspouts. Manufacturers must specify in their  installation instructions whether the home is suitable for the  installation of gutters and downspouts. If suitable, the installation  instructions must indicate that when gutters and downspouts are  installed, the runoff must be directed away from the home.   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC07.006</p>
