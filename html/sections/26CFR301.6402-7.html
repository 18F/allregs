If no claim for refund is filed by the common parent for the consolidated carryback year or the fiduciary does not accept a claim for refund filed by the common parent, the fiduciary may claim a refund under this section by filing its own claim for refund under section 6402, based on all information pertaining to the institution and all information pertaining to other members of the carryback year group and the loss year group to which the fiduciary has reasonable access. Any claim for refund filed by the fiduciary under this paragraph (e)(1) must contain the title ``Claim for refund under section 6402(i) of the Code'' at the top of the first page of the claim, and the following must be attached to the claim:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Claim for refund by the fiduciary.

Any election filed after December 30, 1991, by the common parent of a loss year group under section 172(b)(3) to relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to a consolidated net operating loss arising in a loss year is not effective with respect to the portion of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to a subsidiary that is an institution. Instead, the fiduciary may make the election under section 172(b)(3) with respect to the portion attributable to the institution after the notice described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is filed. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(5), the portion attributable to an institution is determined under the principles of paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Processing and reconciliation of information by the Internal Revenue Service--(1) Loss year return if the insolvent financial institution is a member of a loss year group. The Internal Revenue Service may, in its sole discretion, adjust a loss year return filed by the common parent of a loss year group to take into account information filed by the fiduciary in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, or accept or adjust a loss year return for the loss year group filed by the fiduciary. Nothing in this section relieves the common parent of a loss year group of its duty to file a consolidated return taking into account an institution's items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit for any taxable year, or obligates the Internal Revenue Service to accept a return filed by the fiduciary as the return of the loss year group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Loss year return if the insolvent financial institution is a member of a loss year group. The Internal Revenue Service may, in its sole discretion, adjust a loss year return filed by the common parent of a loss year group to take into account information filed by the fiduciary in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, or accept or adjust a loss year return for the loss year group filed by the fiduciary. Nothing in this section relieves the common parent of a loss year group of its duty to file a consolidated return taking into account an institution's items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit for any taxable year, or obligates the Internal Revenue Service to accept a return filed by the fiduciary as the return of the loss year group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Claim for refund with respect to consolidated carryback year. The Internal Revenue Service may, in its sole discretion, adjust a claim for refund filed by the common parent of a carryback year group to take into account information filed by the fiduciary in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, or accept or adjust a claim for refund for the carryback year group filed by the fiduciary. Nothing in this section obligates the Internal Revenue Service to pay a claim for refund, or to accept a claim for refund, filed by the fiduciary as a claim for refund for the carryback year group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Additional information. In determining the amount of any refund that may be paid to the fiduciary under paragraph (g) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service may, in its sole discretion, take into account any information that the Internal Revenue Service deems relevant and may require the fiduciary to file any additional information the Internal Revenue Service deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Payment of a refund or a tentative carryback adjustment to fiduciary--(1) In general. If a claim for refund or an application for a tentative carryback adjustment is filed for the consolidated carryback year in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service may, in its sole discretion, pay to the fiduciary all or any portion of the refund or tentative carryback adjustment that the Internal Revenue Service determines under this section to be attributable to the net operating losses of the institution. Nothing in this section obligates the Internal Revenue Service to pay to the fiduciary all or any portion of a claim for refund or application for tentative carryback adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If a claim for refund or an application for a tentative carryback adjustment is filed for the consolidated carryback year in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service may, in its sole discretion, pay to the fiduciary all or any portion of the refund or tentative carryback adjustment that the Internal Revenue Service determines under this section to be attributable to the net operating losses of the institution. Nothing in this section obligates the Internal Revenue Service to pay to the fiduciary all or any portion of a claim for refund or application for tentative carryback adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Portion of refund or tentative carryback adjustment attributable to the

net operating loss of an insolvent financial institution--(i) In general. The portion of a refund or tentative carryback adjustment attributable to a net operating loss of an institution that is carried to a consolidated carryback year is determined based on the absorption, as described in paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section, of the institution's net operating loss carried to the consolidated carryback year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The portion of a refund or tentative carryback adjustment attributable to a net operating loss of an institution that is carried to a consolidated carryback year is determined based on the absorption, as described in paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section, of the institution's net operating loss carried to the consolidated carryback year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Member's net operating loss. If the loss year is a consolidated return year, references in this section to the net operating loss of a member of the loss year group is a reference to the portion of the loss year group's consolidated net operating loss attributable to the member. The consolidated net operating loss for a taxable year that is attributable to a member is determined by a fraction, the numerator of which is the separate net operating loss of the member for the year of the loss and the denominator of which is the sum of the separate net operating losses for that year of all members having such losses. For this purpose, the separate net operating loss of a member is determined by computing the consolidated net operating loss by taking into account only the member's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss, including the member's losses and deductions actually absorbed by the group in the taxable year (whether or not absorbed by the member).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Absorption of net operating losses. The absorption of net operating losses generally is determined under applicable principles of the Code and regulations, including the principles of section 172 and Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21(b) or 1.1502-21A(b) (as appropriate) of this chapter. Notwithstanding any contrary rule or principle of the Code or regulations, if an institution and another member of the carryback year group have net operating losses that arise in taxable years ending on the same date and are carried to the same consolidated carryback year, the carryback year group's consolidated taxable income for that year is treated as offset first by the loss attributable to the institution to the extent thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. For purposes of the examples in this section, all groups file consolidated returns, all corporations have calendar taxable years, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, the fiduciary has met the notice and filing requirements of this section, and the common parent has filed a return for the loss year and a claim for refund. The principles of this paragraph (g) are illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> P owns all the stock of S1, an insolvent financial institution, and S2, a corporation that is not a financial institution. For Year 1, P, S1, and S2 each have $50 of income, and the P group's consolidated taxable income is $150. On May 31 of Year 2, S1 becomes insolvent and is placed in receivership under the supervision of a fiduciary. For Year 2, the P group has a consolidated net operating loss of $200, of which $100 is attributable to S1 and $100 is attributable to S2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Under paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section, the $150 of consolidated taxable income for Year 1 is offset first by the $100 portion of the consolidated net operating loss for Year 2 attributable to S1. The remaining $50 is treated as offset by $50 of the $100 of consolidated net operating loss attributable to S2. Thus, the refund attributable to $100 of the loss may be payable to the fiduciary and the refund attributable to $50 of the loss may be payable to P. The remaining $50 consolidated net operating loss, available to be carried forward, is entirely attributable to S2.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Separate return net operating loss, The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that S1 left the P group at the end of Year 1 and its $100 of loss in Year 2 is incurred in a separate return limitation year. Under paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section, the generally applicable absorption principles of section 172 and Sec. 1.1502-21 of this chapter apply. Although S1 and S2 are carrying back losses to Year 1 from taxable years ending on the same date (Year 2), S1's loss is subject to a $50 limitation under Sec. 1.1502-21(c) of this chapter and only $50 of S1's loss is absorbed before S2's net operating loss. Therefore, the refund attributable to $50 of the net operating loss of S1 may be payable to the fiduciary, and the refund attributable to $100 of the net operating loss of S2 may be payable to P. The remaining $50 net operating loss of S1 is available to be carried forward.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Refund or tentative carryback adjustment allocation agreement. The determination of the portion of any refund or tentative carryback adjustment payable to the fiduciary under this paragraph (g) shall be made without regard to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any agreement among the members of the consolidated group; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the fiduciary is otherwise entitled to any portion of the refund or tentative carryback adjustment under applicable law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Credits, net capital losses, and subgroups--(1) Credits and net capital losses--(i) In general. The principles of this section also apply to credits and net capital losses, with appropriate adjustments to reflect differences between the rules applicable to net operating losses and those applicable to credits and net capital losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Credits and net capital losses--(i) In general. The principles of this section also apply to credits and net capital losses, with appropriate adjustments to reflect differences between the rules applicable to net operating losses and those applicable to credits and net capital losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The principles of this section also apply to credits and net capital losses, with appropriate adjustments to reflect differences between the rules applicable to net operating losses and those applicable to credits and net capital losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The principles of this paragraph (h)(1) are illustrated by the following example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> P owns all the stock of S1, an insolvent financial institution, and S2, a corporation that is not a financial institution. For Year 1, P, S1, and S2 each have $50 of capital gain, and the P group's consolidated capital gain net income is $150. On May 31 of Year 2, S1 becomes insolvent and is placed in receivership under the supervision of a fiduciary. For Year 2, the P group has a consolidated net operating loss of $100 that is attributable to S1, and a consolidated net capital loss of $100 that is attributable to S2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Under paragraphs (g)(2)(iii) and (h)(1) of this section, the generally applicable absorption principles of sections 172 and 1212 and Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21(b) and 1.1502-22(b) of this chapter apply. Consequently, S2's capital loss is absorbed before S1's net operating loss. Therefore, the $150 of consolidated capital gain net income is offset first by S2's $100 capital loss and the remaining $50 by S1's net operating loss. The refund attributable to $50 of the net operating loss may be payable to the fiduciary, and the refund attributable to the $100 of capital loss may be payable to P. The remaining $50 consolidated net operating loss available to be carried forward is entirely attributable to S1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Insolvent financial institution subgroup--(i) In general. The principles of this section apply to all members included in an insolvent financial institution subgroup with appropriate adjustments to reflect differences resulting from the application to more than one corporation in a group. Unless otherwise determined by the Internal Revenue Service in its sole discretion, an insolvent financial institution subgroup is composed of an insolvent financial institution and those other members of a loss year group that, at any time during the conservatorship or receivership of the institution, bear the same relationship to the institution that the members of a group bear to their common parent under section 1504(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The principles of this section apply to all members included in an insolvent financial institution subgroup with appropriate adjustments to reflect differences resulting from the application to more than one corporation in a group. Unless otherwise determined by the Internal Revenue Service in its sole discretion, an insolvent financial institution subgroup is composed of an insolvent financial institution and those other members of a loss year group that, at any time during the conservatorship or receivership of the institution, bear the same relationship to the institution that the members of a group bear to their common parent under section 1504(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The principles of this paragraph (h)(2) are illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> S1 is a financial institution, and P, S2, and S3 are not financial institutions. P owns all the stock of S1, S1 owns all the stock of S2, and the stock of S3 is owned 20 percent by S2 and 80 percent by P. For Year 1, P, S1, and S2 each have $100 of income, S3 has no income or loss, and the P group's consolidated taxable income is $300. On May 31 of Year 2, S1 becomes insolvent and is placed in receivership under the supervision of a fiduciary. For Year 2, the P group has a consolidated net operating loss of $300, of which $200 is attributable to S1 and $100 is attributable to S2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> S1 and S2 compose a subgroup because S2 bears the same relationship to S1 that the member of a group bears to its common parent under section 1504(a). S3 is not included in the subgroup because it is not connected to S1 through 80 percent stock ownership as described in section 1504(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Because S1 and S2 are members of a subgroup, a claim for refund under paragraph (e) of this section must be based on the aggregate consolidated net operating loss of both S1 and S2. Under paragraph (e)(5) of this section, P may not elect under section 172(b)(3) to relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to the $300 of consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 2 that is attributable to S1 and S2. Any refund payable under paragraph (g)(1) of this section with respect to the $300 loss of S1 and S2 may be paid by the Internal Revenue Service directly to the fiduciary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that S2 has $100 of income in Year 2 rather than $100 of loss. Any refund payable under paragraph (g) of this section with respect to the loss of S1 in Year 2 must take into account the income of S2, and therefore the refund will be based on a $100 loss of the subgroup.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Although P and S3 are not members included in the subgroup, the loss year return and the claim for refund filed by the fiduciary under paragraph (e) of this section must be completed based on all information to which the fiduciary has reasonable access. Under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, if P does not file a loss year return that is accepted by S1, and S1 has reasonable access to information indicating that P and S3 have income in Year 2, S1 must take that income into account in filing the P group's return for Year 2 and reduce the amount of S1's loss

that may be carried to Year 1 accordingly. However, if P or S3 has a loss in Year 2, any refund attributable to that loss will not be paid to the fiduciary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Determination of ownership. This section determines the party to whom a refund or tentative carryback adjustment will be paid but is not determinative of ownership of any such amount among current or former members of a consolidated group (including the institution).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Liability of the Government. Any refund or tentative carryback adjustment paid to the fiduciary discharges any liability of the Government to the same extent as payment to the common parent under Sec. 1.1502-77 or Sec. 1.1502-78 of this chapter. Furthermore, any refund or tentative carryback adjustment paid to the fiduciary is considered a payment to all members of the carryback year group. Any determination made by the Internal Revenue Service under this section to pay a refund or tentative carryback adjustment to a fiduciary or the common parent may not be challenged by the common parent, any member of the group, or the fiduciary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Effective dates. This section applies to refunds and tentative carryback adjustments paid after December 30, 1991.
