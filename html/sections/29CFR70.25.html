                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(6)(C)</em>. A component  will notify a requester whenever the component is unable to respond to  or process the request or appeal within the time limits established by  the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Multitrack processing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A component may use two or more  processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex  requests based on the amount of work and/or time needed to process the  request, including through limits based on the number of pages involved.  If a component does so, it will advise requesters in its slower track(s)  of the limits of its faster track(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A component using multitrack processing may provide requesters  in its slower track(s) with an opportunity to limit the scope of their  requests in order to qualify for faster processing within the specified  limits of the component's faster track(s). A component doing so will  contact the requester either by telephone or by letter, whichever is  more efficient in each case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unusual circumstances. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where the statutory time limits for  processing a request cannot be met because of ``unusual circumstances,''  as defined in the FOIA, and the component determines to extend the time  limits on that basis, the component will as soon as practicable notify  the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances and of the date by  which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. Where  the extension is for more than ten working days, the component will  provide the requester with an opportunity either to modify the request  so that it may be processed within the time limits or to arrange an  alternative time period with the component for processing the request or  a modified request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where a component reasonably believes that multiple requests  submitted by a requester, or by a group of requesters acting in concert,  constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual  circumstances, and the requests involve clearly related matters, they  may be aggregated. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will  not be aggregated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Expedited processing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests and appeals will be taken out  of order and given expedited treatment whenever it is determined that  they involve:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could  reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or  physical safety of an individual;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged  federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in  disseminating information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The loss of substantial due process rights; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which  there exists possible questions about the government's integrity which  affect public confidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of  the initial request for records or at any later time. For a prompt  determination, a request for expedited processing must be received by  the proper component. Requests based on the categories in paragraphs  (d)(1)(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section must be submitted to  the component that maintains the records requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a  statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's  knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting  expedited processing. For example, a requester within the category in  paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, if not a full-time member of the  news media, must establish that he or she is a person whose main  professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though  it need not be his or her sole occupation. A requester within the  category in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section also must establish a  particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity  involved in the request, beyond the public's right to know about  government activity generally. The formality of certification may be  waived as a matter of administrative discretion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within ten calendar days of its receipt of a request for  expedited processing, the proper component will decide whether to grant  it and will notify the requester of the decision. If a request for  expedited treatment is granted, the request will be given priority and  will be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited  processing is denied, any appeal of that decision will be acted on  expeditiously.</p>
