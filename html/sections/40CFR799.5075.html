To assess and evaluate the toxic characteristics of a substance, the determination of subacute toxicity should be carried out after initial information on toxicity has been obtained by acute testing. The 14-day repeated dose oral study provides information on the health hazard likely to arise from repeated short-term exposure by the oral route over a very limited period of time. It has been designed to permit the determination of the no-observed-adverse-effect level

and toxic effects associated with continuous or repeated exposure to a test substance for 14 days and to evaluate reversibility, persistence, and delayed occurrence of toxic effects during a 14-day follow-up recovery period. The test is not capable of determining those effects that have a long latency period for development (e.g., carcinogenicity and life shortening). It will provide information on target organs and the possibility of accumulation, and can be used in selecting dose levels for subchronic studies and for establishing safety criteria for short-term human exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. Subacute oral toxicity is the manifestation of adverse effect(s) occurring as a result of the repeated daily exposure of experimental animals to a substance by the oral route for 14 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Principle of the test method. The test substance is administered orally in graduated daily doses to several groups of experimental animals, one dose level per group, for a period of 14 days. During the period of administration the animals are observed daily to detect signs of toxicity. Animals which die during the period of administration are necropsied. At the conclusion of the test, all animals, except the satellite group, are necropsied and histopathological examinations are carried out. The satellite group is necropsied after the 14-day recovery period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Satellite group (Rodent only). A satellite group of 20 animals (10 animals per sex) shall be treated with the high dose level for 14 days and observed for reversibility, persistence, and delayed occurrence of toxic effects for a post-treatment recovery period of at least 14 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Dose levels and dose selection. In subacute toxicity tests, it is desirable to have a dose response relationship as well as a NOAEL. Therefore, at least 3 dose levels with a control and, where appropriate, a vehicle control (corresponding to the concentration of vehicle at the highest exposure level) shall be used. Doses shall be spaced appropriately to produce test groups with a range of toxic effects. The data should be sufficient to produce a dose-response curve.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Exposure conditions. The animals are dosed with the test substance every day for 14 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Observation period. All animals shall be observed daily during the 14-day exposure period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Observation period of satellite group. Animals in the satellite group scheduled for follow-up observations shall be kept for at least 14 days further without treatment to detect recovery from, or persistence of, and delayed onset of toxic effects and shall be observed daily.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Administration of test substance. For substances of low toxicity, it is important to ensure that when administered in the drinking water, by gavage, in the diet, or in capsules, the quantities of the test substance involved do not interfere with normal nutrition. When the test substance is administered in the diet, either a constant dietary concentration (ppm) or a constant dose level in terms of the animals' body weight shall be used; the alternative used shall be specified in the final test report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Time of administration of test substance. For a substance administered by gavage or capsule, the dose shall be given at approximately the same time each day, and adjusted on day 7 to maintain a constant dose level in terms of animal body weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Observation of animals. At the end of the 14-day exposure period, all survivors, except those in the satellite group, shall be necropsied. All survivors in the satellite group shall be necropsied after a recovery period of at least 14 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Hematology determinations. Certain hematology determinations shall be carried out at least two times during the test period: Just prior to initiation of dosing if adequate historical baseline data are not available (baseline data) and just prior to terminal sacrifice at the end of the test period. Hematology determinations which are appropriate to all studies are: Hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte count, total and differential leukocyte count, and a measure of clotting potential such as clotting time, prothrombin time, thromboplastin time, or platelet count.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Clinical biochemical determinations. Certain clinical biochemistry determinations on blood should be carried out at least two times: Just prior to initiation of dosing (if adequate historical baseline data are not available) and just prior to terminal sacrifice at the end of the test period. Test areas which are considered appropriate to all studies are: Electrolyte balance, carbohydrate metabolism, and liver and kidney function. The selection of specific tests will be influenced by observations on the mode of action of the substance. Suggested determinations are: Calcium, phosphorus, chloride, sodium, potassium, fasting glucose (with the period of fasting appropriate to the species), serum alanine aminotransferase, serum aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, urea nitrogen, albumin, blood creatinine, and total serum protein measurements. Other determinations which may be necessary for an adequate toxicological evaluation include: analyses of lipids, hormones, acid/base balance, methemoglobin, and cholinesterase activity. Additional clinical biochemistry may be employed, where necessary, to extend the investigation of observed effects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Histopathology. Histopathology of the lungs of all animals shall be performed. Special attention to examination of the lungs of rodents shall be made for evidence of infection since this provides a convenient assessment of the state of health of the animals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Evaluation of the study results. The findings of a subacute oral toxicity study should be evaluated in conjunction with the findings of preceding studies and considered in terms of the toxic effects and the necropsy and histopathological findings. The evaluation will include the relationship between the dose of the test substance and the presence or absence, the incidence and severity, of abnormalities, including behavioral and clinical abnormalities, gross lesions, identified target organs, body weight changes, effects on mortality and any other general or specific toxic effects. A properly conducted subacute test should provide a satisfactory estimation of a NOAEL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reporting requirements.
