Repayment in full means receipt by the TSP record keeper of a payment, by personal check or guaranteed funds made payable to the Thrift Savings Plan, of all principal and interest due on the loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a participant returns a loan check to the TSP record keeper, it will be treated as a repayment; however, additional interest may be owed, which, if not paid, could result in a taxable distribution. The loan, even though repaid, will also be taken into account in determining the maximum amount available for future loans, in accordance with Sec. 1655.6(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The amount outstanding on a loan can be obtained from the TSP Web site, the ThriftLine, or a TSPSO participant service representative, or by a written request to the TSP record keeper.</p>
