                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the interest of encouraging full interagency discussion of  these matters and expediting the coordination process, the EEOC will not  discuss the proposed issuances of other agencies at an open Commission  meeting where disclosure of information would be likely to significantly  frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action. The Commission  will make this determination on a case by case basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requests by the public for drafts of proposed issuances of  another agency will be coordinated, in appropriate circumstances, with  that agency and the person submitting the request shall be so notified.  The decision made by that agency with respect to such proposed issuances  will be honored by the Commission.  [45 FR 68361, Oct. 14, 1980, as amended at 45 FR 71799, Oct. 30, 1980]</p>
