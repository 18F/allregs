(1) The CAIR designated representative of each CAIR SO2 source required to have a title V operating permit and each CAIR SO2 unit required to have a title V operating permit at the source shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Submit to the permitting authority a complete CAIR permit application under Sec. 97.222 in accordance with the deadlines specified in Sec. 97.221; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Submit in a timely manner any supplemental information that the permitting authority determines is necessary in order to review a CAIR permit application and issue or deny a CAIR permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The owners and operators of each CAIR SO2 source required to have a title V operating permit and each CAIR SO2 unit required to have a title V operating permit at the source shall have a CAIR permit issued by the permitting authority under subpart CCC of this part for the source and operate the source and the unit in compliance with such CAIR permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in subpart III of this part, the owners and operators of a CAIR SO2 source that is not otherwise required to have a title V operating permit and each CAIR SO2 unit that is not otherwise required to have

a title V operating permit are not required to submit a CAIR permit application, and to have a CAIR permit, under subpart CCC of this part for such CAIR SO2 source and such CAIR SO2 unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements. (1) The owners and operators, and the CAIR designated representative, of each CAIR SO2 source and each CAIR SO2 unit at the source shall comply with the monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements of subpart HHH of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The emissions measurements recorded and reported in accordance with subpart HHH of this part shall be used to determine compliance by each CAIR SO2 source with the CAIR SO2 emissions limitation under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Sulfur dioxide emission requirements. (1) As of the allowance transfer deadline for a control period, the owners and operators of each CAIR SO2 source and each CAIR SO2 unit at the source shall hold, in the source's compliance account, a tonnage equivalent in CAIR SO2 allowances available for compliance deductions for the control period, as determined in accordance with Sec. 97.254(a) and (b), not less than the tons of total sulfur dioxide emissions for the control period from all CAIR SO2 units at the source, as determined in accordance with subpart HHH of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A CAIR SO2 unit shall be subject to the requirements under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for the control period starting on the later of January 1, 2010 or the deadline for meeting the unit(s monitor certification requirements under Sec. 97.270(b)(1),(2), or (5) and for each control period thereafter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A CAIR SO2 allowance shall not be deducted, for compliance with the requirements under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for a control period in a calendar year before the year for which the CAIR SO2 allowance was allocated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> CAIR SO2 allowances shall be held in, deducted from, or transferred into or among CAIR SO2 Allowance Tracking System accounts in accordance with subparts FFF, GGG, and III of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A CAIR SO2 allowance is a limited authorization to emit sulfur dioxide in accordance with the CAIR SO2 Trading Program. No provision of the CAIR SO2 Trading Program, the CAIR permit application, the CAIR permit, or an exemption under Sec. 97.205 and no provision of law shall be construed to limit the authority of the United States to terminate or limit such authorization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A CAIR SO2 allowance does not constitute a property right.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Upon recordation by the Administrator under subpart FFF, GGG, or III of this part, every allocation, transfer, or deduction of a CAIR SO2 allowance to or from a CAIR SO2 source's compliance account is incorporated automatically in any CAIR permit of the source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Excess emissions requirements. If a CAIR SO2 source emits sulfur dioxide during any control period in excess of the CAIR SO2 emissions limitation, then:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The owners and operators of the source and each CAIR SO2 unit at the source shall surrender the CAIR SO2 allowances required for deduction under Sec. 97.254(d)(1) and pay any fine, penalty, or assessment or comply with any other remedy imposed, for the same violations, under the Clean Air Act or applicable State law; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each ton of such excess emissions and each day of such control period shall constitute a separate violation of this subpart, the Clean Air Act, and applicable State law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Recordkeeping and reporting requirements. (1) Unless otherwise provided, the owners and operators of the CAIR SO2 source and each CAIR SO2 unit at the source shall keep on site at the source each of the following documents for a period of 5 years from the date the document is created.

such 5-year period until such documents are superseded because of the submission of a new certificate of representation under Sec. 97.213 changing the CAIR designated representative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All emissions monitoring information, in accordance with subpart HHH of this part, provided that to the extent that subpart HHH of this part provides for a 3-year period for recordkeeping, the 3-year period shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Copies of all reports, compliance certifications, and other submissions and all records made or required under the CAIR SO2 Trading Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Copies of all documents used to complete a CAIR permit application and any other submission under the CAIR SO2 Trading Program or to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the CAIR SO2 Trading Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The CAIR designated representative of a CAIR SO2 source and each CAIR SO2 unit at the source shall submit the reports required under the CAIR SO2 Trading Program, including those under subpart HHH of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Liability.

No provision of the CAIR SO2 Trading Program, a CAIR permit application, a CAIR permit, or an exemption under Sec. 97.205 shall be construed as exempting or excluding the owners and operators, and the CAIR designated representative, of a CAIR SO2 source or CAIR SO2 unit from compliance with any other provision of the applicable, approved State implementation plan, a federally enforceable permit, or the Clean Air Act.</p>
