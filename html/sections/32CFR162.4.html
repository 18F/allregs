The PECI program is a major DoD strategy to achieve productivity goals under E.O. 12637.\5\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\4\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 162.1(a).</p><p class="depth2">\5\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 162.1(a).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> PECI projects shall be selected to improve quality and productivity, or to reduce unit cost of outputs in defense operations. PECI projects shall be evaluated and approved for funding based on recognized principles of economic analysis. Each PECI project shall be subject to all restrictions established by public law, DoD policy, and other regulatory constraints.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> DoD personnel at all levels shall be encouraged to seek out and identify opportunities for quality and productivity improvement. Those efforts shall be supported by using the PECI as a means of financing the improvements. The PECI Program shall provide incentives for participation, supported by the financial management system and policies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Individuals or groups who successfully identify PECI opportunities that result in significant savings or improvements in quality or productivity or who aggressively promote PECI incentives within their organizations should be recognized through the DoD Incentive Awards Program, DoD Instruction 5120.16,\6\ the Secretary of Defense Productivity Excellence Awards Program, performance appraisal, or other appropriate means. All these savings derived through PECI will remain with the originating DoD Component.

As an incentive a portion of these savings, when possible, should remain at the submitting activity.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\6\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 162.1(a).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Funds provided through FY 1993 from the centrally managed OSD PIF may not be reprogrammed for non-PIF purposes without prior approval of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force Management and Personnel) (ASD(FM&P;)). The Heads of DoD Components shall monitor obligation rates to ensure PIF projects are executed quickly. If project funding cannot be obligated within the specified fiscal year(s) for the type of funding, the Head of the DoD Component must reprogram PIF funds to alternate approved PIF projects. The PIF projects shall be monitored to ensure timely implementation and to validate savings through the amortization period. The PECIs are subject to audit as established by DoD Instruction 7600.2 \7\ (reference (g)) policy.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\7\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 162.1(a).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
