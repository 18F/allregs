                            <p class="depth0">Only upon proper identification will any individual be granted  access to records which pertain to him/her. Identification is required  both for accurate record identification and to avoid disclosing records  to unauthorized individuals. Individuals must provide their full name  and as much information as possible in order that a proper search for  records can be accomplished. Requests made by mail shall be signed by  the individual requesting his/her records. Inclusion of a telephone  number for the requester is recommended to expedite certain matters.  Requesters applying in person must provide an identification with  photograph, such as a driver's license, military or annuitant  identification card, or any official document as acceptable  identification validation. Personal requests can only be accepted on  regularly scheduled workdays (Monday through Friday, excluding Federal  holidays) between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.</p>
