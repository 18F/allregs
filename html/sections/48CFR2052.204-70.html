                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed at 2004.404(a), the contracting officer shall insert  the following clause in solicitations and contracts during which the  contractor may have access to, or contact with classified information,  including National Security information, restricted data, formerly  restricted data, and other classified data:</p><p class="depth0">Security (OCT 1999)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Security/Classification Requirements Form. The attached NRC Form  187 (See List of Attachments) furnishes the basis for providing security  and classification requirements to prime contractors, subcontractors, or  others (e.g., bidders) who have or may have an NRC contractual  relationship that requires access to classified information or matter,  access on a continuing basis (in excess of 90 or more days) to NRC  Headquarters controlled buildings, or otherwise requires NRC photo  identification or card-key badges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is the contractor's duty to safeguard National Security  Information, Restricted Data, and Formerly Restricted Data. The  contractor shall, in accordance with the Commission's security  regulations and requirements, be responsible for safeguarding National  Security Information, Restricted Data, and Formerly Restricted Data, and  for protecting against sabotage, espionage, loss, and theft, the  classified documents and material in the contractor's possession in  connection with the performance of work under this contract. Except as  otherwise expressly provided in this contract, the contractor shall  transmit to the Commission any classified matter in the possession of  the contractor or any person under the contractor's control in  connection with performance of this contract upon completion or  termination of this contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contractor shall complete a certificate of possession to be  furnished to the Commission specifying the classified matter to be  retained if the retention is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Required after the completion or termination of the contract;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Approved by the contracting officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The certification must identify the items and types or  categories of matter retained, the conditions governing the retention of  the matter and their period of retention, if known. If the retention is  approved by the contracting officer, the security provisions of the  contract continue to be applicable to the matter retained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In connection with the performance of the work under this  contract, the contractor may be furnished, or may develop or acquire,  proprietary data (trade secrets) or confidential or privileged  technical, business, or financial information, including Commission  plans, policies, reports, financial plans, internal data protected by  the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-579), or other information which has  not been released to the public or has been determined by the Commission  to be otherwise exempt from disclosure to the public. The contractor  agrees to hold the information in confidence and not to directly or  indirectly duplicate, disseminate, or disclose the information, in whole  or in part, to any other person or organization except as necessary to  perform the work under this contract. The contractor agrees to return  the information to the Commission or otherwise dispose of it at the  direction of the contracting officer. Failure to comply with this clause  is grounds for termination of this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Regulations. The contractor agrees to conform to all security  regulations and requirements of the Commission which are subject to  change as directed by the NRC Division of Facilities and Security and  the Contracting Officer. These changes will be under the authority of  the FAR Changes clause referenced in Section I of this document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Definition of national security information. As used in this  clause, the term national security information means information that  has been determined pursuant to Executive Order 12958 or any predecessor  order to require protection against unauthorized disclosure and that is  so designated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Definition of restricted data. As used in this clause, the term  Restricted Data means all data concerning design, manufacture, or  utilization of atomic weapons; the production of special nuclear  material; or the use of special nuclear material in the production of  energy, but does not include data declassified or removed from the  Restricted Data category under to Section 142 of the Atomic Energy Act  of 1954, as amended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Definition of formerly restricted data. As used in this clause  the term Formerly Restricted Data means all data removed from the  Restricted Data category under Section 142-d of the Atomic Energy Act of  1954, as amended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Security clearance personnel. The contractor may not permit any  individual to have access to Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data,  or other classified information, except in accordance with the Atomic  Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations or  requirements applicable to the particular type or category of classified  information to which access is required. The contractor shall also  execute a Standard Form 312, Classified Information Nondisclosure  Agreement, when access to classified information is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Criminal liabilities. Disclosure of National Security  Information, Restricted Data, and Formerly Restricted Data relating to  the work or services ordered hereunder to any person not entitled to  receive it, or failure to safeguard any Restricted Data, Formerly  Restricted Data, or any other classified matter that may come to the  contractor or any person under the contractor's control in connection  with work under this contract, may subject the contractor, its agents,  employees, or subcontractors to criminal liability under the laws of the  United States. (See the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 42 U.S.C.  2011 et seq.; 18 U.S.C. 793 and 794; and Executive Order 12958.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Subcontracts and purchase orders. Except as otherwise  authorized, in writing, by the contracting officer, the contractor shall  insert provisions similar to the foregoing in all subcontracts and  purchase orders under this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> In performing contract work, the contractor shall classify all  documents, material, and equipment originated or generated by the  contractor in accordance with guidance issued by the Commission. Every  subcontract and purchase order issued under the contract that involves  originating or generating classified documents, material, and equipment  must provide that the subcontractor or supplier assign the proper  classification to all documents, material, and equipment in accordance  with guidance furnished by the contractor.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)</p>
