                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Background and scope--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. This section permits an  eligible QBU to elect to use the dollar as its functional currency for  taxable years beginning on or before August 24, 1994. An election to use  a dollar functional currency is not permitted for a QBU other than an  eligible QBU. Paragraph (b) of this section defines an eligible QBU.  Paragraph (c) of this section describes the time and manner for making  the dollar election and paragraph (d) of this section describes the  effect of making the election. For the definition of a QBU, see section  989(a). See Sec. 1.985-1(b)(2)(ii) for rules requiring a QBU to use the  dollar as its functional currency in taxable years beginning after  August 24, 1994.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(E)</em> to elect the dollar as  its (or its QBU branch's) functional currency and the application of  Sec. 1.985-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligible QBU--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term ``eligible QBU'' means a  QBU that could have used a hyperinflationary currency as its functional  currency absent the dollar election. See Sec. 1.985-1 for how a QBU  determines its functional currency absent the dollar election.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)(D)</em> for  the definition of hyperinflationary currency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time and manner for dollar election--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> QBUs that are branches  of United States persons--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Rule. If an eligible QBU is a branch of a  United States person, the dollar election shall be made by attaching a  completed Form 8819 to the United States person's timely filed (taking  extensions into account) tax return for the first taxable year for which  the election is to be effective.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Procedure prior to the issuance of Form 8819. In the absence of  Form 8819, the election shall be made in accordance with Sec. 1.985- 2T(c)(1). Failure to file an amended return within the time period  prescribed in Sec. 1.985-2T(c)(1) shall not invalidate the dollar  election if it is established to the satisfaction of the district  director that reasonable cause existed for such failure. A subsequent  election for 1988 will not prejudice the taxpayer with respect to such  reasonable cause determination. Nevertheless, each United States person  making an election under the Sec. 1.985-2T(c)(1) must file a Form 8819  in the time and manner provided in the Form's instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Eligible QBUs that are controlled foreign corporations or  branches of controlled foreign corporations--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Rule. If an eligible  QBU is a controlled foreign corporation (as described in section 957),  or a branch of a controlled foreign corporation, the election may be  made either by the foreign corporation or by the controlling United  States shareholders on behalf of the foreign corporation by--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Filing a completed Form 8819 in the time and manner provided in  the Form's instructions, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Providing the written notice required by paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of  this section at the time and in the manner prescribed therein.  The term controlling United States shareholders means those United  States shareholders (as defined in section 951(b)) who, in the  aggregate, own (within the meaning of section 958(a)) greater than 50  percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of  the foreign corporation entitled to vote. If the foreign corporation is  a controlled foreign corporation (as described in section 957) but the  United States shareholders do not, in the aggregate, own the requisite  voting power, the term ``controlling United States shareholders'' means  all the United States shareholders (as defined in section 951(b)) who  own (within the meaning of section 958(a)) stock of the controlled  foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notice. Prior to filing Form 8819, the controlling United  States shareholders (or the foreign corporation, if the dollar election  is made by the corporation) shall provide written notice that the dollar  election will be made to all United States persons known to be  shareholders who own (within the meaning of section 958(a)) stock of the  foreign corporation. Such notice shall   also include all information required in Form 8819.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reasonable cause exception. Failure of the controlling United  States shareholders (or the foreign corporation, if the dollar election  is made by the corporation) to timely file Form 8819 or provide written  notice to a United States person required to be notified by paragraph  (c)(2)(ii) of this section shall not invalidate the dollar election, if  it is established to the satisfaction of the district director that  reasonable cause existed for such failure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Procedure prior to the issuance of Form 8819. In the absence of  Form 8819, an eligible QBU described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this  section shall make the dollar election in accordance with Sec. 1.985- 2T(c)(2). Nevertheless, the person or persons that made such election  must file a Form 8819 in the time and manner provided in the Form's  instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Eligible QBUs that are noncontrolled foreign corporations or  branches of noncontrolled foreign corporations--(i) Rule. If an eligible  QBU is a noncontrolled foreign corporation (a foreign corporation not  described in section 957), or a branch of a noncontrolled foreign  corporation, the dollar election must be made by the corporation or the  majority domestic corporate shareholders on behalf of the corporation by  applying the rules provided in paragraph (c)(2)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(A)</em> and (B), (ii),  (iii), and (iv) of this section substituting ``majority domestic  corporate shareholders'' for ``controlling United States shareholders''  wherever it appears therein. The term ``majority domestic corporate  shareholders'' means those domestic corporate shareholders (as described  in section 902(a)) who, in the aggregate, own (within the meaning of  section 958(a)) greater than 50 percent of the total combined voting  stock of all classes of stock of the noncontrolled foreign corporation  entitled to vote that is owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)) by  all the domestic corporate shareholders.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Procedure prior to the issuance of Form 8819. In the absence of  Form 8819, an eligible QBU described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this  section shall make the dollar election in accordance with Sec. 1.985- 2T(c)(3). Nevertheless, the person or persons that made such election  must file a Form 8819 in the time and manner provided in the Form's  instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Others. Any other person making a dollar election under this  section shall elect by filing Form 8819 and fulfilling any other notice  requirements that may be required by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effect of dollar election--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. If a dollar  election is made (or considered made under paragraph (d)(3) of this  section) by or on behalf of an eligible QBU, the QBU shall be deemed to  have the dollar as its functional currency. Each United States person  that owns (within the meaning of section 958(a)) stock of a foreign  corporation which has the dollar as its functional currency under  Sec. 1.985-2 must make all of its federal income tax calculations with  respect to the foreign corporation using the dollar as the corporation's  functional currency (regardless of when ownership was acquired or  whether the United States person received the written notice required by  paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Computation--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph  (d)(2)(ii) of this section, any eligible QBU that pursuant to this  Sec. 1.985-2 has a dollar functional currency must compute income or  loss or earnings and profits (or deficit in earnings and profits) in  dollars using the dollar approximate separate transactions method  described in Sec. 1.985-3.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Alternative method. An eligible QBU that has a dollar  functional currency pursuant to this Sec. 1.985-2 may use a method other  than the dollar approximate separate transactions method described in  Sec. 1.985-3 only if the QBU demonstrates to the satisfaction of the  Commissioner that it can properly employ such method. Generally, the QBU  must show that it could compute foreign currency gain or loss under the  principles of section 988 with respect to each of its section 988  transactions. If subsequently the QBU can no longer demonstrate to the  satisfaction of the district director that it can properly employ such  an alternative method, then the QBU will be deemed to have changed its  method of accounting to   the dollar approximate separate transactions method described in  Sec. 1.985-3. This change in accounting will be treated as having been  made with the consent of the Commissioner. No adjustments under either  Sec. 1.985-5T (or any succeeding final regulation) or section 481(a)  shall be required solely because of the change. Rather the QBU shall  begin accounting for its operations under Sec. 1.985-3 based on its  dollar books and records as of the time of the change.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Conformity--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General rule. If a dollar election is made under  this Sec. 1.985-2 for an eligible QBU (``electing QBU''), then the  dollar shall be the functional currency of any related person  (regardless of when such person became related to the electing QBU) that  is an eligible QBU, or any branch of any such related person that is an  eligible QBU. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term ``related  person'' means any person with a relationship defined in section 267 (b)  to the electing QBU (or to the United States or foreign person of which  the electing QBU is a part). In determining whether two or more  corporations are members of the same controlled group under section  267(b)(3), a person is considered to own stock owned directly by such  person, stock owned with the application of section 1563(e)(1), and  stock owned with the application of section 267(c).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Branches of United States and foreign persons. If a dollar  election is made for a QBU branch of any person, each eligible QBU  branch of such person shall have the dollar as its functional currency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Required adjustments. If an eligible QBU's functional currency  changes due to a dollar election, or due to the conformity requirements  of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, such change shall be deemed for  purposes of Sec. 1.9B5-4 to be consented to by the Commissioner. No  adjustments under section 481(a) shall be required solely because of the  change. However, the QBU must make those adjustments required by  Sec. 1.985-5T (or any succeeding final regulation).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Taxable year conformity required. Generally, the adjustments  required by paragraph (d)(4) of this section shall be made for a related  person's taxable year--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That includes the date in which the electing QBU made the dollar  election if the person was related to such electing QBU at any time  during the QBU's taxable year that includes such date, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> During which the person first becomes related to any electing  QBU, in all other cases.  For purposes of this paragraph (d)(5), the date in which the electing  QBU makes the dollar election shall be the last day of the electing  QBU's taxable year. The district director may permit the related party  to make such adjustments beginning one taxable year later if, in the  district director's sole judgment, reasonable cause exists for the  related party not being able to make the required adjustments for the  earlier year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Availability of election. A dollar election may be made by or on  behalf of a QBU, or considered made under the conformity rule of  paragraph (d)(3), in any year in which the QBU is an eligible QBU. If a  dollar election is not made by or on behalf of a QBU for its first  taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986 in which it is an  eligible QBU, then any dollar election made by or on behalf of the QBU,  or considered made under the conformity rules of paragraph (d)(3) of  this section, that results in a change in the QBU's functional currency  shall be treated as having been made with the consent of the  Commissioner. In such a case, however, the taxpayer must make those  adjustments required by Sec. 1.985-5T (or any succeeding final  regulation).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Effect of changed circumstances. Regardless of any change in  circumstances (e.g., a currency ceases to qualify as hyperinflationary),  a QBU whose functional currency is the dollar under this section may  change its functional currency only if the QBU complies with Sec. 1.985- 4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the  following examples.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. X is a calendar year domestic corporation that in 1987  establishes a branch, A, in Country Z. A's functional currency under  sections 985(b)(1) and (2) and Sec. 1.985-1 is the ``h'', the currency  of Country Z. The cumulative inflation in Country Z exceeds 100 percent  for the thirty-six months prior to   January 1987, as measured by the consumer price index of Country Z  listed in the monthly issues of the ``International Financial  Statistics''. Accordingly, A is an eligible QBU in 1987 because the h is  a hyperinflationary currency. Thus, X may elect the dollar as the  functional currency of A for 1987.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1). X does not  elect the dollar as the functional currency of A for 1987. Rather, X  elects the dollar as the functional currency of A for l991, a year A is  an eligible QBU. The election constitutes a change in A's functional  currency that is made with the consent of the Commissioner. However, A  must make the adjustments required under Sec. 1.985-5T (or any  succeeding final regulation).</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. X is a domestic corporation that establishes A, an  eligible QBU branch. X is wholly owned by domestic corporation Y. Y has  an eligible QBU branch, B. Both X and Y are calendar year taxpayers. X  makes a dollar election for A in 1987. Thus, A is an electing QBU. X and  Y are related persons as defined in section 267(b) (i.e., Y has a  relationship under section 267(b)(3) to X, the corporation of which A is  a part). Therefore, the dollar election by X for A in 1987 results in B,  the eligible QBU branch of Y, also having the dollar as its functional  currency for 1987.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that Y  does not have an eligible QBU branch but owns all the stock of C, a  calendar year controlled foreign corporation, which is not itself an  eligible QBU but which has an eligible QBU branch, D. X and C are  related persons as defined in section 267(b) (i.e., C has a relationship  under section 267(b)(3) to X, the corporation of which A is a part).  Therefore, the dollar election by X for A in 1987 results in D, the  eligible QBU branch of C, also having the dollar as its functional  currency for 1987.</p><p class="depth3">Example 5. X, whose taxable year ends September 30, is an eligible  QBU that does not use the dollar as its functional currency. X is  wholly-owned by domestic corporation W. On January 1, 1989, X acquires  all the stock of Y, an unrelated eligible QBU that made the dollar  election under Sec. 1.985-2. Y is a calendar year taxpayer. After the  stock purchase, X and Y are related persons as defined in section  267(b). Under Secs. 1.985-2(d)(3) and (5), the dollar shall be the  functional currency of X, any person related to X, and any branch of  such related person that is an eligible QBU beginning with the taxable  year that includes December 31, 1989. Thus, X must change to the dollar  for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1988. However, the district  director may allow X to change to the dollar for its taxable year  beginning October 1, 1989, provided reasonable cause exists. Those QBUs  changing to the dollar as their functional currency as the result of the  conformity requirements must make the adjustments required under  Sec. 1.985-5T (or any succeeding final regulation).</p><p class="depth3">Example 6. The facts are the same as in Example 5, except that  before X purchased the Y stock, X made the dollar election under  Sec. 1.985-2 but Y did not use the dollar as its functional currency.  Under Secs. 1.985-2(d)(3) and (5) the dollar shall be the functional  currency of Y, any person related to Y, and any branch of such related  person that is an eligible QBU beginning with the taxable year that  includes September 30, 1989. Thus, Y must change to the dollar for its  taxable year beginning January 1, 1989. However the district director  may allow Y to change to the dollar for its taxable year beginning  January 1, 1990, provided reasonable cause exists. Those QBUs changing  to the dollar as their functional currency as the result of the  conformity requirements must make the adjustments required under  Sec. 1.985-5T (or any succeeding final regulation).  [T.D. 8263, 54 FR 38656, Sept. 20, 1989, as amended by T.D. 8556, 59 FR  37673, July 25, 1994]</p>
