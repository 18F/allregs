                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Secretary is responsible for increases in tuition and other educational costs only if the same increase is charged to all students in the same category (for example, the same class year or place of residence) and without regard to whether the student is receiving support under the scholarship programs. A student participating in the scholarship programs may not be denied eligibility because of this participation for any discounts or rebates in tuition or other educational costs given to all other students in the same category at the institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Institutions whose enrollment contains 25 percent or more students participating in the scholarship programs, and whose percentage increase in tuition and other educational costs in any school year exceeds the previous calendar year's average inflation rate as indicated by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Areas, may be requested to provide the Secretary with detailed cost breakdowns justifying the increase.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the case of a school which is requested to provide the Secretary with cost increase justification under paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary will be responsible for increases in tuition and other educational costs charged to students participating in the scholarship programs over the amount charged for the school year immediately preceding the increase only to the extent that they are: (1) Attributable to uncontrollable costs, such as fuel costs, mandated cost-of-living increases in wages, salaries and fringe benefits, (2) attributable to costs of maintaining and improving the quality of the health professions education provided by the institution, such as hiring additional faculty to improve the faculty-student ratio, costs incurred in off-site training of students, and necessary improvements in teaching equipment. Increases in patient care and research costs are allowable as part of an increase in tuition and other educational costs only to the extent that they can be documented as clearly necessary to maintain and improve the quality of the education being supported; or (3) attributable to loss of revenue from other sources which was used solely for the maintenance and improvement of the educational system.
These three categories of valid escalators of tuition and other educational costs are exclusive. However, the examples within each category are merely illustrative and not meant to be inclusive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the Secretary, after reviewing all available data, information, and justifications submitted by an institution, determines that an increase in tuition and other educational costs is not allowable under the criteria described in paragraph (a) or (c) of this section, the Secretary will provide the affected institution a detailed written explanation of the basis of that determination. The Secretary will be responsible for that portion of tuition and other educational costs the Secretary determines to be allowable.
