                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Referral to mediation. CRC will promptly refer to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or the mediation agency designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under 45 CFR part 90, all complaints that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fall within the jurisdiction of the Act or this part, unless the age distinction complained of is clearly within an exception; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contain all information necessary for further processing, as provided in Sec. 35.31(c)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Participation in mediation process. Both the complainant and the recipient shall participate in the mediation process to the extent necessary to reach an agreement or to make an informed judgment that an agreement is not possible. The recipient and the complainant do not need to meet with the mediator at the same time, and a meeting may be conducted by telephone or other means of effective dialogue if a personal meeting between the party and the mediator is impractical.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When agreement is reached. If the complainant and the recipient reach an agreement, the mediator shall prepare a written statement of the agreement, have the complainant and recipient sign it, and send a copy of the agreement to CRC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Confidentiality. The mediator shall protect the confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of the mediation process. No mediator may testify in any adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or otherwise disclose any information obtained in the course of the mediation process, unless the mediator has obtained prior approval of the head of the mediation agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Maximum time period for mediation. The mediation shall proceed for a maximum of 60 days after a complaint is filed with CRC. This 60-day period may be extended by the mediator, with the concurrence of the Director, for not more than 30 days, if the mediator determines that agreement is likely to be reached during the extended period. In the absence of such an extension, mediation ends if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sixty days elapse from the time the complaint is filed; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to the end of the 60-day period, either</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An agreement is reached; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The mediator determines that agreement cannot be reached.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Unresolved complaints. The mediator shall return unresolved complaints to CRC.</p>
