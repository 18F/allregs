This part applies to all savings associations except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. This part applies to all savings associations except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certain special purpose savings associations. This part does not apply to special purpose savings associations that do not perform commercial or retail banking services by granting credit to the public in the ordinary course of business, other than as incident to their specialized operations.
