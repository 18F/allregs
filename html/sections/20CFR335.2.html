To claim sickness benefits  for a period of inability to work due to an illness or injury, or in the  case of a female employee, pregnancy, miscarriage, or childbirth, an  employee must file the following forms:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An application for sickness benefits at the beginning of each  period of continuing sickness;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement of sickness to accompany the employee's application;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A claim for sickness benefits for each 14-day registration  period during the employee's period of continuing sickness; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A supplemental doctor's statement, if the adjudicating office  requests additional proof of the employee's inability to work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mailing or delivering the forms. The forms required by paragraph  (a) of this section may be mailed or delivered to any Board office. If  the Board is satisfied that the employee is too sick or injured to  execute the required forms, the Board may accept forms executed by  someone in the employee's behalf. Instructions for completing and filing  the forms are printed on the forms themselves.  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers  3220-0034, 3220-0039 and 3220-0045)</p>
