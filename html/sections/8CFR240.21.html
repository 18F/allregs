(1) As used in this section, the term cap means the numerical limitation of 4,000 grants of suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal in any fiscal year (except fiscal year 1998, which has a limitation of 8,000 grants) pursuant to section 240A(e) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As used in this section, the term cap means the numerical limitation of 4,000 grants of suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal in any fiscal year (except fiscal year 1998, which has a limitation of 8,000 grants) pursuant to section 240A(e) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The provisions of this section apply to grants of suspension of deportation pursuant to section 244(a) of the Act (as in effect before April 1, 1997) or cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(b) of the Act that are subject to a numerical limitation in section 240A(e) of the Act for any fiscal year. This section does not apply to grants of suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal to aliens described in section 309(c)(5)(C)(i) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), as amended by section 203(a)(1) of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA), or

aliens in deportation proceedings prior to April 1, 1997, who apply for suspension of deportation pursuant to section 244(a)(3) of the Act (as in effect prior to April 1, 1997).

The Service shall provide the applicant with notice of the date, time, and place at which the applicant must appear before a Service officer to perfect the request for NACARA adjustment. Such notice shall include an attestation form, Attestation of Alien and Memorandum of Creation of Record of Lawful Permanent Residence, Form I-895, regarding the applicant's eligibility for NACARA adjustment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> NACARA adjustment request. An application for suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal filed by a national of Nicaragua or Cuba that was granted on a conditional basis on or before September 30, 1998, shall be deemed to be a request for adjustment of status pursuant to section 202 of NACARA (``NACARA adjustment'') for the period starting September 30, 1998 and ending December 31, 1998. The Service shall provide the applicant with notice of the date, time, and place at which the applicant must appear before a Service officer to perfect the request for NACARA adjustment. Such notice shall include an attestation form, Attestation of Alien and Memorandum of Creation of Record of Lawful Permanent Residence, Form I-895, regarding the applicant's eligibility for NACARA adjustment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Submission of documentation. To perfect the request for NACARA adjustment, the applicant must appear before a Service officer on the date scheduled with the following documentation:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The order granting suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal on a conditional basis issued on or before September 30, 1998;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A completed, but unsigned Form I-895, which the applicant shall be required to sign and to attest to the veracity of the information contained therein in the presence of a Service officer;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Any applicable applications for waiver of inadmissibility; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Two ``ADIT-style'' photographs; meeting the specifications in the instructions attached to Form I-895.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Waiver of documentation and fees. The provisions of Sec. 245.13(e) and (f) of this chapter relating to documentary requirements for NACARA adjustment are waived with respect to an alien seeking to perfect a request for adjustment of status pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In addition, the fees for the NACARA adjustment and for any applications for waivers of inadmissibility submitted in conjunction with perfecting a request for NACARA adjustment shall be waived.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> NACARA adjustment determination. In determining an applicant's eligibility for NACARA adjustment under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, unless the Service officer before whom the applicant appears is not satisfied that the applicant is admissible to the United States in accordance with section 202(a)(1)(B) of NACARA, and has continuously resided in the United States from December 1, 1995, through the date of appearance before the Service officer (not counting an absence or absences from the United States totaling 180 days or less or any absences that occurred pursuant to advance authorization for parole (Form I-512 issued by the Service)), the Service officer shall accept an alien's attestation of admissibility and/or continuous physical presence as sufficient evidence that the applicant has met the admissibility and/or continuous physical presence requirement for NACARA adjustment. If the Service officer grants NACARA adjustment, then the Service officer shall create a record of lawful permanent residence and the prior order granting suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal on a

conditional basis shall be automatically vacated and the deportation or removal proceedings shall be automatically terminated. The Service officer (whose decision in this regard is not subject to appeal) shall not adjust the applicant to lawful permanent resident status pursuant to section 202 of NACARA if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The Service officer is not satisfied that the applicant is eligible for NACARA adjustment and so indicates on the attestation form; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The applicant indicates on the attestation form that he or she does not wish to receive NACARA adjustment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Automatic conversion. If the Service officer does not adjust the applicant to lawful permanent resident status pursuant to section 202 of NACARA, the applicant's conditional grant of suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal shall be automatically converted to a grant of suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal. Upon such a conversion, the Service shall create a record of lawful permanent residence based upon the grant of suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Failure to appear. An alien who fails to appear to perfect his or her request for NACARA adjustment shall have his or her conditional grant of suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal automatically converted by the Immigration Court or the Board to a grant of suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal effective December 31, 1998.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Conditional grants not converted in fiscal year 1998. The provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section for granting relief shall not apply with respect to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any case in which a conditional grant of suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal is pending on appeal before the Board as of September 30, 1998 or, if the right to appeal to the Board has not been waived, the time for an appeal has not expired. After the Board issues its decision or the time for appeal has expired, the conditional grant shall be converted to a grant when a grant is available.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any other conditional grant not described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section, which was not converted to a grant in fiscal year 1998. Such a conditional grant shall be converted to a grant when a grant is available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Motion to reopen. The Service may file a motion to reopen within 90 days after the alien is issued a grant of suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section, if after the issuance of a conditional grant by the Immigration Court or the Board the applicant committed an act that would have rendered him or her ineligible for suspension of deportation or cancellation or removal at the time of the conversion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Travel for aliens conditionally granted suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal. If the Immigration Court or the Board granted suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal on a conditional basis or, if the conditional grant by the Immigration Court was appealed to the Board and the Board issued such a conditional grant, the alien shall retain the conditional grant of suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal upon return to the United States following a temporary absence abroad and be permitted to resume completion of his or her case, provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The alien departed on or before September 30, 1998 with or without a grant of advance parole from the District Director; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The alien, prior to his or her departure from the United States after September 30, 1998, obtained a grant of advance parole from the District Director in accordance with section 212(d)(5) of the Act and Sec. 212.5 of this chapter and complied with the terms and conditions of the advance parole.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Grants of suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal in fiscal years subsequent to fiscal year 1998. On and after October 1, 1998, the Immigration Court and the Board may grant applications for suspension of deportation and adjustment of status under section 244(a) of the Act (as in effect prior to April 1, 1997) or cancellation of removal and adjustment of status under section 240A(b) of the Act that meet the statutory requirements for such relief and

warrant a favorable exercise of discretion until the annual numerical limitation has been reached in that fiscal year. The awarding of such relief shall be determined according to the date the order granting such relief becomes final as defined in Sec. Sec. 3.1(d)(3) and 3.39 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicability of the annual cap. When grants are no longer available in a fiscal year, further decisions to grant or deny such relief shall be reserved until such time as a grant becomes available under the annual limitation in a subsequent fiscal year. Immigration judges and the Board may deny without reserving decision or may pretermit those suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal applications in which the applicant has failed to establish statutory eligibility for relief. The basis of such denial or pretermission may not be based on an unfavorable exercise of discretion, a finding of no good moral character on a ground not specifically noted in section 101(f) of the Act, a failure to establish exceptional or extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative in cancellation cases, or a failure to establish extreme hardship to the applicant and/or qualifying relative in suspension cases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Aliens applying for additional forms of relief. Whether or not the cap has been reached, the Immigration Court or the Board shall adjudicate concurrently all other forms of relief for which the alien has applied. Applications for suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal shall be denied in the exercise of discretion if the alien is granted asylum or adjustment of status, including pursuant to section 202 of NACARA, while the suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal application is pending. Where an appeal of a decision granting asylum or adjustment is sustained by the Board, a decision to deny as a matter of discretion an application for suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal on this basis shall be reconsidered.
