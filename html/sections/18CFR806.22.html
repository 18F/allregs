                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The project sponsors of all consumptive water uses subject to review and approval under Sec. 806.4, Sec. 806.5 or Sec. 806.6 of this part shall comply with this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mitigation. All project sponsors whose consumptive use of water is subject to review and approval under Sec. 806.4, Sec. 806.5 or Sec. 806.6 of this part shall mitigate such consumptive use. Except to the extent that the project involves the diversion of the waters out of the basin, public water supplies shall be exempt from the requirements of this section regarding consumptive use; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt individual consumptive users connected to any such public water supply from the requirements of this section. Mitigation may be provided by one, or a combination of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During low flow periods as may be designated by the Commission for consumptive use mitigation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reduce withdrawal from the approved source(s), in an amount equal to the project's total consumptive use, and withdraw water from alternative surface water storage or aquifers or other underground storage chambers or facilities approved by the Commission, from which water can be withdrawn for a period of 90 days without impact to surface water flows.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Release water for flow augmentation, in an amount equal to the project's total consumptive use, from surface water storage or aquifers, or other underground storage chambers or facilities approved by the Commission, from which water can be withdrawn for a period of 90 days without impact to surface water flows.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Discontinue the project's consumptive use, except that reduction of project sponsor's consumptive use to less than 20,000 gpd during periods of low flow shall not constitute discontinuance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use, as a source of consumptive use water, surface storage that is subject to maintenance of a conservation release acceptable to the Commission. In any case of failure to provide the specified conservation release, such project shall provide mitigation in accordance with paragraph (3), below, for the calendar year in which such failure

occurs, and the Commission will reevaluate the continued acceptability of the conservation release.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide monetary payment to the Commission, for annual consumptive use, in an amount and manner prescribed by the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Implement other alternatives approved by the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination of manner of mitigation. The Commission will, in its sole discretion, determine the acceptable manner of mitigation to be provided by project sponsors whose consumptive use of water is subject to review and approval. Such a determination will be made after considering the project's location, source characteristics, anticipated amount of consumptive use, proposed method of mitigation and their effects on the purposes set forth in Sec. 806.2 of this part, and any other pertinent factors. The Commission may modify, as appropriate, the manner of mitigation, including the magnitude and timing of any mitigating releases, required in a project approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Quality of water released for mitigation. The physical, chemical and biological quality of water released for mitigation shall at all times meet the quality required for the purposes listed in Sec. 806.2, as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Approval by rule for consumptive uses. (1) Except with respect to projects involving hydrocarbon development subject to the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section, any project whose sole source of water for consumptive use is a public water supply, may be approved by the Executive Director under this paragraph (e) in accordance with the following, unless the Executive Director determines that the project cannot be adequately regulated under this approval by rule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except with respect to projects involving hydrocarbon development subject to the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section, any project whose sole source of water for consumptive use is a public water supply, may be approved by the Executive Director under this paragraph (e) in accordance with the following, unless the Executive Director determines that the project cannot be adequately regulated under this approval by rule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Metering, daily use monitoring and quarterly reporting. The project sponsor shall comply with metering, daily use monitoring and quarterly reporting as specified in Sec. 806.30.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Standard conditions. The standard conditions set forth in Sec. 806.21 above shall apply to projects approved by rule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Mitigation. The project sponsor shall comply with mitigation in accordance with Sec. 806.22 (b)(2) or (b)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Compliance with other laws. The project sponsor shall obtain all necessary permits or approvals required for the project from other federal, state or local government agencies having jurisdiction over the project. The Commission reserves the right to modify, suspend or revoke any approval under this paragraph (e) if the project sponsor fails to obtain or maintain such approvals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The Executive Director may grant, deny, suspend, rescind, modify or condition an approval to operate under this approval by rule, or renew an existing approval by rule previously granted hereunder, and will notify the project sponsor of such determination, including the quantity of consumptive use approved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Approval by rule shall be effective upon issuance by the Executive Director to the project sponsor, shall expire 15 years from the date of such issuance, and supersede any previous consumptive use approvals to the extent applicable to the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Approval by rule for consumptive use related to unconventional natural gas and other hydrocarbon development projects. (1) Any unconventional natural gas development project subject to review and approval under Sec. 806.4(a)(8), or any other hydrocarbon development project subject to review and approval under Sec. 806.4, Sec. 806.5, or Sec. 806.6, shall be subject to review and approval by the Executive Director under this paragraph (f) regardless of the source or sources of water being used consumptively.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any unconventional natural gas development project subject to review and approval under Sec. 806.4(a)(8), or any other hydrocarbon development project subject to review and approval under Sec. 806.4, Sec. 806.5, or Sec. 806.6, shall be subject to review and approval by the Executive Director under this paragraph (f) regardless of the source or sources of water being used consumptively.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notification of Intent: Prior to undertaking a project or increasing a previously approved quantity of consumptive use, the project sponsor shall submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) on forms prescribed by the Commission, and the appropriate application fee, along with any required attachments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Within 10 days after submittal of an NOI under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the project sponsor shall satisfy the notice requirements set forth in Sec. 806.15.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The project sponsor shall comply with metering, daily use monitoring and quarterly reporting as specified in Sec. 806.30, or as otherwise required by the approval by rule.
