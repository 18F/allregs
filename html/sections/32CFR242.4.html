Individuals whose service obligation is waived may, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Military Department concerned, be required to reimburse the Government for all or a part of the tuition and other educational costs incurred. However, a member of the program may not be relieved of his Service obligation solely because he is willing and able to reimburse the Government for all educational expenses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Periods of time spent in sponsored graduate medical education shall not count toward satisfying the medical school Federal-duty obligation.
