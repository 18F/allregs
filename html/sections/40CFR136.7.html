When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for any or all of the compounds above, compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method describes analytical conditions for a second gas chromatographic column that can be used to confirm measurements made with the primary column. Method 624 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for most of the parameters listed above.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 12.1) \1\ for each parameter is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.</p><p class="depth0">1.5 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the operation of a purge and trap system and a gas chromatograph and in the interpretation of gas chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 An inert gas is bubbled through a 5-mL water sample contained in a specially-designed purging chamber at ambient temperature. The halocarbons are efficiently transferred from the aqueous phase to the vapor phase. The vapor is swept through a sorbent trap where the halocarbons are trapped. After purging is completed, the trap is heated and backflushed with the inert gas to desorb the halocarbons onto a gas chromatographic column. The gas chromatograph is temperature programmed to separate the halocarbons which are then detected with a halide-specific detector. \2 3\</p><p class="depth0">2.2 The method provides an optional gas chromatographic column that may be helpful in resolving the compounds of interest from interferences that may occur.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interferences</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Impurities in the purge gas and organic compounds outgassing from the plumbing ahead of the trap account for the majority of contamination problems. The analytical system must be demonstrated to be free from contamination under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3. The use of non-Teflon plastic tubing, non-Teflon thread sealants, or flow controllers with rubber components in the purge and trap system should be avoided.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Samples can be contaminated by diffusion of volatile organics (particularly fluorocarbons and methylene chloride) through the septum seal ilto the sample during shipment and storage. A field reagent blank prepared from reagent water and carried through the sampling and handling protocol can serve as a check on such contamination.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Contamination by carry-over can occur whenever high level and low level samples are sequentially analyzed. To reduce carry-over, the purging device and sample syringe must be rinsed with reagent water between sample analyses. Whenever an unusually concentrated sample is encountered, it should be followed by an analysis of reagent water to check for cross contamination. For samples containing large amounts of water-soluble materials, suspended solids, high boiling compounds or high organohalide levels, it may be necessary to wash out the purging device with a detergent solution, rinse it with distilled water, and then dry it in a 105 [deg]C oven between analyses. The trap and other parts of the system are also subject to contamination; therefore, frequent bakeout and purging of the entire system may be required.</p><p class="depth0">4. Safety</p><p class="depth0">4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified \4 6\ for the information of the analyst.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 The following parameters covered by this method have been tentatively classified as known or suspected, human or mammalian carcinogens: carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, and vinyl chloride. Primary standards of these toxic compounds should be prepared in a hood. A NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be worn when the analyst handles high concentrations of these toxic compounds.</p><p class="depth0">5. Apparatus and Materials</p><p class="depth0">5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete sampling.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.1 Vial--25-mL capacity or larger, equipped with a screw cap with a hole in the center (Pierce 13075 or equivalent). Detergent wash, rinse with tap and distilled water, and dry at 105 [deg]C before use.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.2 Septum--Teflon-faced silicone (Pierce 12722 or equivalent). Detergent wash, rinse with tap and distilled water, and dry at 105 [deg]C for 1 h before use.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Purge and trap system--The purge and trap system consists of three separate pieces of equipment: a purging device, trap, and desorber. Several complete systems are now commercially available.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.1 The purging device must be designed to accept 5-mL samples with a water column at least 3 cm deep. The gaseous head space between the water column and the trap must have a total volume of less than 15 mL. The purge gas must pass through the water column as finely divided bubbles with a diameter of less than 3 mm at the origin. The purge gas must be introduced no more than 5 mm from the base of the water column. The purging device illustrated in Figure 1 meets these design criteria.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.2 The trap must be at least 25 cm long and have an inside diameter of at least 0.105 in. The trap must be packed to contain the following minimum lengths of adsorbents: 1.0 cm of methyl silicone coated packing (Section 6.3.3), 7.7 cm of 2,6-diphenylene oxide polymer (Section 6.3.2), 7.7 cm of silica gel (Section 6.3.4), 7.7 cm of coconut charcoal (Section 6.3.1). If it is not necessary to analyze for dichlorodifluoromethane, the charcoal can be eliminated, and the polymer section lengthened to 15 cm. The minimum

specifications for the trap are illustrated in Figure 2.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.3 The desorber must be capable of rapidly heating the trap to 180 [deg]C. The polymer section of the trap should not be heated higher than 180 [deg]C and the remaining sections should not exceed 200 [deg]C. The desorber illustrated in Figure 2 meets these design criteria.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.4 The purge and trap system may be assembled as a separate unit or be coupled to a gas chromatograph as illustrated in Figures 3 and 4.</p><p class="depth0">5.3 Gas chromatograph--An analytical system complete with a temperature programmable gas chromatograph suitable for on-column injection and all required accessories including syringes, analytical columns, gases, detector, and strip-chart recorder. A data system is recommended for measuring peak areas.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.1 Column 1--8 ft long x 0.1 in. ID stainless steel or glass, packed with 1% SP-1000 on Carbopack B (60/80 mesh) or equivalent. This column was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 12. Guidelines for the use of alternate column packings are provided in Section 10.1.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.2 Column 2--6 ft long x 0.1 in. ID stainless steel or glass, packed with chemically bonded n-octane on Porasil-C (100/120 mesh) or equivalent.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.3 Detector--Electrolytic conductivity or microcoulometric detector. These types of detectors have proven effective in the analysis of wastewaters for the parameters listed in the scope (Section 1.1). The electrolytic conductivity detector was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 12. Guidelines for the use of alternate detectors are provided in Section 10.1.</p><p class="depth0">5.4 Syringes--5-mL glass hypodermic with Luerlok tip (two each), if applicable to the purging device.</p><p class="depth0">5.5 Micro syringes--25-[micro]L, 0.006 in. ID needle.</p><p class="depth0">5.6 Syringe valve--2-way, with Luer ends (three each).</p><p class="depth0">5.7 Syringe--5-mL, gas-tight with shut-off valve.</p><p class="depth0">5.8 Bottle--15-mL, screw-cap, with Teflon cap liner.</p><p class="depth0">5.9 Balance--Analytical, capable of accurately weighing 0.0001 g.</p><p class="depth0">6. Reagents</p><p class="depth0">6.1 Reagent water--Reagent water is defined as a water in which an interferent is not observed at the MDL of the parameters of interest.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.1 Reagent water can be generated by passing tap water through a carbon filter bed containing about 1 lb of activated carbon (Filtrasorb-300, Calgon Corp., or equivalent).</p><p class="depth0">6.1.2 A water purification system (Millipore Super-Q or equivalent) may be used to generate reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.3 Reagent water may also be prepared by boiling water for 15 min. Subsequently, while maintaining the temperature at 90 [deg]C, bubble a contaminant-free inert gas through the water for 1 h. While still hot, transfer the water to a narrow mouth screw-cap bottle and seal with a Teflon-lined septum and cap.</p><p class="depth0">6.2 Sodium thiosulfate--(ACS) Granular.</p><p class="depth0">6.3 Trap Materials:</p><p class="depth0">6.3.1 Coconut charcoal--6/10 mesh sieved to 26 mesh, Barnabey Cheney, CA-580-26 lot  M-2649 or equivalent.</p><p class="depth0">6.3.2 2,6-Diphenylene oxide polymer--Tenax, (60/80 mesh), chromatographic grade or equivalent.</p><p class="depth0">6.3.3 Methyl silicone packing--3% OV-1 on Chromosorb-W (60/80 mesh) or equivalent.</p><p class="depth0">6.3.4 Silica gel--35/60 mesh, Davison, grade-15 or equivalent.</p><p class="depth0">6.4 Methanol--Pesticide quality or equivalent.</p><p class="depth0">6.5 Stock standard solutions--Stock standard solutions may be prepared from pure standard materials or purchased as certified solutions. Prepare stock standard solutions in methanol using assayed liquids or gases as appropriate. Because of the toxicity of some of the organohalides, primary dilutions of these materials should be prepared in a hood. A NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be used when the analyst handles high concentrations of such materials.</p><p class="depth0">6.5.1 Place about 9.8 mL of methanol into a 10-mL ground glass stoppered volumetric flask. Allow the flask to stand, unstoppered, for about 10 min or until all alcohol wetted surfaces have dried. Weigh the flask to the learest 0.1 mg.</p><p class="depth0">6.5.2 Add the assayed reference material:</p><p class="depth0">6.5.2.1 Liquid--Using a 100 [micro]L syringe, immediately add two or more drops of assayed reference material to the flask, then reweigh. Be sure that the drops fall directly into the alcohol without contacting the neck of the flask.</p><p class="depth0">6.5.2.2 Gases--To prepare standards for any of the six halocarbons that boil below 30 [deg]C (bromomethane, chloroethane, chloromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, vinyl chloride), fill a 5-mL valved gas-tight syringe with the reference standard to the 5.0-mL mark. Lower the needle to 5 mm above the methanol meniscus. Slowly introduce the reference standard above the surface of the liquid (the heavy gas will rapidly dissolve into the methanol).</p><p class="depth0">6.5.3 Reweigh, dilute to volume, stopper, then mix by inverting the flask several times. Calculate the concentration in [micro]g/[micro]L from the net gain in weight. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards can be used at any concentration if they are

certified by the malufacturer or by an independent source.</p><p class="depth0">6.5.4 Transfer the stock standard solution into a Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottle. Store, with minimal headspace, at -10 to -20 [deg]C and protect from light.</p><p class="depth0">6.5.5 Prepare fresh standards weekly for the six gases and 2-chloroethylvinyl ether. All other standards must be replaced after one month, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicates a problem.</p><p class="depth0">6.6 Secondary dilution standards--Using stock standard solutions, prepare secondary dilution standards in methanol that contain the compounds of interest, either singly or mixed together. The secondary dilution standards should be prepared at concentrations such that the aqueous calibration standards prepared in Section 7.3.1 or 7.4.1 will bracket the working range of the analytical system. Secondary dilution standards should be stored with minimal headspace and should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards from them.</p><p class="depth0">6.7 Quality control check sample concentrate--See Section 8.2.1.</p><p class="depth0">7. Calibration</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Assemble a purge and trap system that meets the specifications in Section 5.2. Condition the trap overnight at 180 [deg]C by backflushing with an inert gas flow of at least 20 mL/min. Condition the trap for 10 min once daily prior to use.</p><p class="depth0">7.2 Connect the purge and trap system to a gas chromatograph. The gas chromatograph must be operated using temperature and flow rate conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1. Calibrate the purge and trap-gas chromatographic system using either the external standard technique (Section 7.3) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.4).</p><p class="depth0">7.3 External standard calibration procedure:</p><p class="depth0">7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a miminum of three concentration levels for each parameter by carefully adding 20.0 [micro]L of one or more secondary dilution standards to 100, 500, or 1000 [micro]L of reagent water. A 25-[micro]L syringe with a 0.006 in. ID needle should be used for this operation. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector. These aqueous standards can be stored up to 24 h, if held in sealed vials with zero headspace as described in Section 9.2. If not so stored, they must be discarded after 1 h.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.2 Analyze each calibration standard according to Section 10, and tabulate peak height or area responses versus the concentration in the standard. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to concentration (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (<10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.</p><p class="depth0">7.4 Internal standard calibration procedure--To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples. The compounds recommended for use as surrogate spikes in Section 8.7 have been used successfully as internal standards, because of their generally unique retention times.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest as described in Section 7.3.1.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.2 Prepare a spiking solution containing each of the internal standards using the procedures described in Sections 6.5 and 6.6. It is recommended that the secondary dilution standard be prepared at a concentration of 15 [micro]g/mL of each internal standard compound. The addition of 10 [micro]L of this standard to 5.0 mL of sample or calibration standard would be equivalent to 30 [micro]g/L.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.3 Analyze each calibration standard according to Section 10, adding 10 [micro]L of internal standard spiking solution directly to the syringe (Section 10.4). Tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard, and calculate response factors (RF) for each compound using Equation 1.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]</p><p class="depth0">Equation 1where:
As=Response for the parameter to be measured.Ais=Response for the internal standard.Cis=Concentration of the internal standard.Cs=Concentration of the parameter to be measured.
If the RF value over the working range is a constant (<10% RSD), the RF can be assumed to be invariant and the average RF can be used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to plot a calibration curve of response ratios, As/Ais, vs. RF.</p><p class="depth0">7.5 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on

each working day by the measurement of a QC check sample.</p><p class="depth0">7.5.1 Prepare the QC check sample as described in Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">7.5.2 Analyze the QC check sample according to Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">7.5.3 For each parameter, compare the response (Q) with the corresponding calibration acceptance criteria found in Table 2. If the responses for all parameters of interest fall within the designated ranges, analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual Q falls outside the range, proceed according to Section 7.5.4.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The large number of parameters in Table 2 present a substantial probability that one or more will not meet the calibration acceptance criteria when all parameters are analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">7.5.4 Repeat the test only for those parameters that failed to meet the calibration acceptance criteria. If the response for a parameter does not fall within the range in this second test, a new calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be prepared for that parameter according to Section 7.3 or 7.4.</p><p class="depth0">8. Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Section 10.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.3 Each day, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system are under control.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at a concentration of 10 [micro]g/mL in methanol. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Prepare a QC check sample to contain 20 [micro]g/L of each parameter by adding 200 [micro]L of QC check sample concentrate to 100 mL of reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3 Analyze four 5-mL aliquots of the well-mixed QC check sample according to Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X) in [micro]g/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in [micro]g/L, for each parameter of interest using the four results.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 2. If s and X for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X falls outside the range for accuracy, then the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The large number of parameters in Table 2 present a substantial probability that one or more will fail at least one of the acceptance criteria when all parameters are analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6 When one or more of the parameters tested fail at least one of the acceptance criteria, the analyst must proceed according to Section 8.2.6.1 or 8.2.6.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6.1 Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6.2 Beginning with Section 8.2.3, repeat the test only for those parameters that failed to meet criteria. Repeated failure, however, will confirm a general problem with the measurement system. If this occurs, locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all compounds of interest beginning with Section 8.2.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at 20 [micro]g/L or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Analyze one 5-mL sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second 5-mL sample aliquot with 10 [micro]L of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100(A-B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1. \7\ If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than 20 [micro]g/L, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 2, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X') using the equation in Table 3, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S') using the equation in Table 3, substituting X' for X; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X'/T)2.44(100 S'/T)%. \7\</p><p class="depth0">8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory. If the entire list of parameters in Table 2 must be measured in the sample in Section 8.3, the probability that the analysis of a QC check standard will be required is high. In this case the QC check standard should be routinely analyzed with the spiked sample.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 10 [micro]L of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 5 mL of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (Ps) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (Ps) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (sp). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P-2sp to P+2sp. If p=90% and sp=10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).</p><p class="depth0">8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of

the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.</p><p class="depth0">8.7 The analyst should monitor both the performance of the analytical system and the effectiveness of the method in dealing with each sample matrix by spiking each sample, standard, and reagent water blank with surrogate halocarbons. A combination of bromochloromethane, 2-bromo-1-chloropropane, and 1,4-dichlorobutane is recommended to encompass the range of the temperature program used in this method. From stock standard solutions prepared as in Section 6.5, add a volume to give 750 [micro]g of each surrogate to 45 mL of reagent water contained in a 50-mL volumetric flask, mix and dilute to volume for a concentration of 15 ng/[micro]L. Add 10 [micro]L of this surrogate spiking solution directly into the 5-mL syringe with every sample and reference standard analyzed. Prepare a fresh surrogate spiking solution on a weekly basis. If the internal standard calibration procedure is being used, the surrogate compounds may be added directly to the internal standard spiking solution (Section 7.4.2).</p><p class="depth0">9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling</p><p class="depth0">9.1 All samples must be iced or refrigerated from the time of collection until analysis. If the sample contains free or combined chlorine, add sodium thiosulfate preservative (10 mg/40 mL is sufficient for up to 5 ppm Cl2) to the empty sample bottle just prior to shipping to the sampling site. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine. \8\ Field test kits are available for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers having a total volume of at least 25 mL. Fill the sample bottle just to overflowing in such a manner that no air bubbles pass through the sample as the bottle is being filled. Seal the bottle so that no air bubbles are entrapped in it. If preservative has been added, shake vigorously for 1 min. Maintain the hermetic seal on the sample bottle until time of analysis.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 All samples must be analyzed within 14 days of collection. \3\</p><p class="depth0">10. Procedure</p><p class="depth0">10.1 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are estimated retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. An example of the separations achieved by Column 1 is shown in Figure 5. Other packed columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Adjust the purge gas (nitrogen or helium) flow rate to 40 mL/min. Attach the trap inlet to the purging device, and set the purge and trap system to purge (Figure 3). Open the syringe valve located on the purging device sample introduction needle.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Allow the sample to come to ambient temperature prior to introducing it to the syringe. Remove the plunger from a 5-mL syringe and attach a closed syringe valve. Open the sample bottle (or standard) and carefully pour the sample into the syringe barrel to just short of overflowing. Replace the syringe plunger and compress the sample. Open the syringe valve and vent any residual air while adjusting the sample volume to 5.0 mL. Since this process of taking an aliquot destroys the validity of the sample for future analysis, the analyst should fill a second syringe at this time to protect against possible loss of data. Add 10.0 [micro]L of the surrogate spiking solution (Section 8.7) and 10.0 [micro]L of the internal standard spiking solution (Section 7.4.2), if applicable, through the valve bore, then close the valve.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 Attach the syringe-syringe valve assembly to the syringe valve on the purging device. Open the syringe valves and inject the sample into the purging chamber.</p><p class="depth0">10.6 Close both valves and purge the sample for 11.0 0.1 min at ambient temperature.</p><p class="depth0">10.7 After the 11-min purge time, attach the trap to the chromatograph, adjust the purge and trap system to the desorb mode (Figure 4), and begin to temperature program the gas chromatograph. Introduce the trapped materials to the GC column by rapidly heating the trap to 180 [deg]C while backflushing the trap with an inert gas between 20 and 60 mL/min for 4 min. If rapid heating of the trap cannot be achieved, the GC column must be used as a secondary trap by cooling it to 30 [deg]C (subambient temperature, if poor peak geometry or random retention time problems persist) instead of the initial program temperature of 45 [deg]C</p><p class="depth0">10.8 While the trap is being desorbed into the gas chromatograph, empty the purging chamber using the sample introduction syringe. Wash the chamber with two 5-mL flushes of reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">10.9 After desorbing the sample for 4 min, recondition the trap by returning the purge and trap system to the purge mode. Wait 15 s then close the syringe valve on the purging device to begin gas flow through the trap. The trap temperature should be maintained at 180 [deg]C After approximately 7 min, turn off the trap heater and open the syringe valve to

stop the gas flow through the trap. When the trap is cool, the next sample can be analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">10.10 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.</p><p class="depth0">10.11 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, prepare a dilution of the sample with reagent water from the aliquot in the second syringe and reanalyze.</p><p class="depth0">11. Calculations</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Determine the concentration of individual compounds in the sample.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.1 If the external standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the concentration of the parameter being measured from the peak response using the calibration curve or calibration factor determined in Section 7.3.2.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.2 If the internal standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the concentration in the sample using the response factor (RF) determined in Section 7.4.3 and Equation 2.</p><p class="depth0">Equation 2[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

As=Response for the parameter to be measured.Ais=Response for the internal standard.Cis=Concentration of the internal standard.</p><p class="depth0">11.2 Report results in [micro]g/L without correction for recovery data. All QC data obtained should be reported with the sample results.</p><p class="depth0">12. Method Performance</p><p class="depth0">12.1 The method detection limit (MDL) is defined as the minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the value is above zero. \1\ The MDL concentration listed in Table 1 were obtained using reagent water. \11\. Similar results were achieved using representative wastewaters. The MDL actually achieved in a given analysis will vary depending on instrument sensitivity and matrix effects.</p><p class="depth0">12.2 This method is recommended for use in the concentration range from the MDL to 1000xMDL. Direct aqueous injection techniques should be used to measure concentration levels above 1000xMDL.</p><p class="depth0">12.3 This method was tested by 20 laboratories using reagent water, drinking water, surface water, and three industrial wastewaters spiked at six concentrations over the range 8.0 to 500 [micro]g/L. \9\ Single operator precision, overall precision, and method accuracy were found to be directly related to the concentration of the parameter and essentially independent of the sample matrix. Linear equations to describe these relationships are presented in Table 3.</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">1. 40 CFR part 136, appendix B.</p><p class="depth0">2.

When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for any or all of the compounds above, compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method describes analytical conditions for a second gas chromatographic column that can be used to confirm measurements made with the primary column. Method 624 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for all of the parameters listed above.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 12.1) \1\ for each parameter is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.</p><p class="depth0">1.5 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the operation of a purge and trap system and a gas chromatograph and in the interpretation of gas chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 An inert gas is bubbled through a 5-mL water sample contained in a specially-designed purging chamber at ambient temperature. The aromatics are efficiently transferred from the aqueous phase to the vapor phase. The vapor is swept through a sorbent trap where the aromatics are trapped. After purging is completed, the trap is heated and backflushed with the inert gas to desorb the aromatics onto a gas chromatographic column. The gas chromatograph is temperature programmed to separate the aromatics which are then detected with a photoionization detector. \2 3\</p><p class="depth0">2.2 The method provides an optional gas chromatographic column that may be helpful in resolving the compounds of interest from interferences that may occur.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interferences</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Impurities in the purge gas and organic compounds outgassing from the plumbing ahead of the trap account for the majority of contamination problems. The analytical system must be demonstrated to be free from contamination under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3. The use of non-Teflon plastic tubing, non-Teflon thread sealants, or flow controllers with rubber components in the purge and trap system should be avoided.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Samples can be contaminated by diffusion of volatile organics through the septum seal into the sample during shipment and storage. A field reagent blank prepared from reagent water and carried through the sampling and handling protocol can serve as a check on such contamination.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Contamination by carry-over can occur whenever high level and low level samples are sequentially analyzed. To reduce carry-over, the purging device and sample syringe must be rinsed with reagent water between sample analyses. Whenever an unusually concentrated sample is encountered, it should be followed by an analysis of reagent water to check for cross contamination. For samples containing large amounts of water-soluble materials, suspended solids, high boiling compounds or high aromatic levels, it may be necessary to wash the purging device with a detergent solution, rinse it with distilled water, and then dry it in an oven at 105 [deg]C between analyses. The trap and other parts of the system are also subject to contamination; therefore, frequent bakeout and purging of the entire system may be required.</p><p class="depth0">4. Safety</p><p class="depth0">4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety

are available and have been identified \4 6\ for the information of the analyst.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 The following parameters covered by this method have been tentatively classified as known or suspected, human or mammalian carcinogens: benzene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene. Primary standards of these toxic compounds should be prepared in a hood. A NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be worn when the analyst handles high concentrations of these toxic compounds.</p><p class="depth0">5.

Several complete systems are now commercially available.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.1 The purging device must be designed to accept 5-mL samples with a water column at least 3 cm deep. The gaseous head space between the water column and the trap must have a total volume of less than 15 mL. The purge gas must pass through the water column as finely divided bubbles with a diameter of less than 3 mm at the origin. The purge gas must be introduced no more than 5 mm from the base of the water column. The purging device illustrated in Figure 1 meets these design criteria.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.2 The trap must be at least 25 cm long and have an inside diameter of at least 0.105 in.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.2.1 The trap is packed with 1 cm of methyl silicone coated packing (Section 6.4.2) and 23 cm of 2,6-diphenylene oxide polymer (Section 6.4.1) as shown in Figure 2. This trap was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 12.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.2.2 Alternatively, either of the two traps described in Method 601 may be used, although water vapor will preclude the measurement of low concentrations of benzene.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.3 The desorber must be capable of rapidly heating the trap to 180 [deg]C. The polymer section of the trap should not be heated higher than 180 [deg]C and the remaining sections should not exceed 200 [deg]C. The desorber illustrated in Figure 2 meets these design criteria.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.4 The purge and trap system may be assembled as a separate unit or be coupled to a gas chromatograph as illustrated in Figures 3, 4, and 5.</p><p class="depth0">5.3 Gas chromatograph--An analytical system complete with a temperature programmable gas chromatograph suitable for on-column injection and all required accessories including syringes, analytical columns, gases, detector, and strip-chart recorder.

Calculate the concentration in [micro]g/[micro]L from the net gain in weight. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards can be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.</p><p class="depth0">6.6.4 Transfer the stock standard solution into a Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottle. Store at 4 [deg]C and protect from light.</p><p class="depth0">6.6.5 All standards must be replaced after one month, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicates a problem.</p><p class="depth0">6.7 Secondary dilution standards--Using stock standard solutions, prepare secondary dilution standards in methanol that contain the compounds of interest, either singly or mixed together. The secondary dilution standards should be prepared at concentrations such that the aqueous calibration standards prepared in Section 7.3.1 or 7.4.1 will bracket the working range of the analytical system. Secondary solution standards must be stored with zero headspace and should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards from them.</p><p class="depth0">6.8 Quality control check sample concentrate--See Section 8.2.1.</p><p class="depth0">7. Calibration</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Assemble a purge and trap system that meets the specifications in Section 5.2. Condition the trap overnight at 180 [deg]C by backflushing with an inert gas flow of at least 20 mL/min. Condition the trap for 10 min once daily prior to use.</p><p class="depth0">7.2 Connect the purge and trap system to a gas chromatograph. The gas chromatograph must be operated using temperature and flow rate conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1. Calibrate the purge and trap-gas chromatographic system using either the external standard technique (Section 7.3) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.4).</p><p class="depth0">7.3 External standard calibration procedure:</p><p class="depth0">7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter by carefully adding 20.0 [micro]L of one or more secondary dilution standards to 100, 500, or 1000 mL of reagent water. A 25-[micro]L syringe with a 0.006 in. ID needle should be used for this operation. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector. These aqueous standards must be prepared fresh daily.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.2 Analyze each calibration standard according to Section 10, and tabulate peak height or area responses versus the concentration in the standard. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to concentration (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (<10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.</p><p class="depth0">7.4 Internal standard calibration procedure--To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples. The compound, [alpha],[alpha],[alpha],-trifluorotoluene, recommended as a surrogate spiking compound in Section 8.7 has been used successfully as an internal standard.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest as described in Section 7.3.1.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.2 Prepare a spiking solution containing each of the internal standards using the procedures described in Sections 6.6 and 6.7. It is recommended that the secondary dilution standard be prepared at a concentration of 15 [micro]g/mL of each internal standard compound. The addition of 10 [micro]l of this

standard to 5.0 mL of sample or calibration standard would be equivalent to 30 [micro]g/L.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.3 Analyze each calibration standard according to Section 10, adding 10 [micro]L of internal standard spiking solution directly to the syringe (Section 10.4). Tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard, and calculate response factors (RF) for each compound using Equation 1.
RF = (As)(Cis (Ais)(Cs)
Equation 1
where:As=Response for the parameter to be measured.Ais=Response for the internal standard.Cis=Concentration of the internal standardCs=Concentration of the parameter to be measured.
If the RF value over the working range is a constant (<10% RSD), the RF can be assumed to be invariant and the average RF can be used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to plot a calibration curve of response ratios, As/Ais, vs. RF.</p><p class="depth0">7.5 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of a QC check sample.</p><p class="depth0">7.5.1 Prepare the QC check sample as described in Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">7.5.2 Analyze the QC check sample according to Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">7.5.3 For each parameter, compare the response (Q) with the corresponding calibration acceptance criteria found in Table 2. If the responses for all parameters of interest fall within the designated ranges, analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual Q falls outside the range, a new calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be prepared for that parameter according to Section 7.3 or 7.4.</p><p class="depth0">8. Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The mimimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Section 10.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.3 Each day, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system are under control.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at a concentration of 10 [micro]g/mL in methanol. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Prepare a QC check sample to contain 20 [micro]g/L of each parameter by adding 200 [micro]L of QC check sample concentrate to 100 mL of reagant water.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3 Analyze four 5-mL aliquots of the well-mixed QC check sample according to Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X) in [micro]g/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in [micro]g/L, for each parameter of interest using the four results.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively,

found in Table 2. If s and X for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The large number of parameters in Table 2 present a substantial probability that one or more will fail at least one of the acceptance criteria when all parameters are analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6 When one or more of the parameters tested fail at least one of the acceptance criteria, the analyst must proceed according to Section 8.2.6.1 or 8.2.6.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6.1 Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6.2 Beginning with Section 8.2.3, repeat the test only for those parameters that failed to meet criteria. Repeated failure, however, will confirm a general problem with the measurement system. If this occurs, locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all compounds of interest beginning with Section 8.2.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at 20 [micro]g/L or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Analyze one 5-mL sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second 5-mL sample aliquot with 10 [micro]L of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100(A-B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1. \7\ If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than 20 [micro]g/L, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 2, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X') using the equation in Table 3, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S') using the equation in Table 3, substituting X' for X; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X'/T) 2.44(100 S'/T)%. \7\</p><p class="depth0">8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 10 [micro]L of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 5 mL of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (Ps) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (Ps) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P)

and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (sp). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P-2sp to P+2sp. If P=90% and sp=10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).</p><p class="depth0">8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.</p><p class="depth0">8.7 The analyst should monitor both the performance of the analytical system and the effectiveness of the method in dealing with each sample matrix by spiking each sample, standard, and reagent water blank with surrogate compounds (e.g. [alpha], [alpha], [alpha],-trifluorotoluene) that encompass the range of the temperature program used in this method. From stock standard solutions prepared as in Section 6.6, add a volume to give 750 [micro]g of each surrogate to 45 mL of reagent water contained in a 50-mL volumetric flask, mix and dilute to volume for a concentration of 15 mg/[micro]L. Add 10 [micro]L of this surrogate spiking solution directly into the 5-mL syringe with every sample and reference standard analyzed. Prepare a fresh surrogate spiking solution on a weekly basis. If the internal standard calibration procedure is being used, the surrogate compounds may be added directly to the internal standard spiking solution (Section 7.4.2).</p><p class="depth0">9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling</p><p class="depth0">9.1 The samples must be iced or refrigerated from the time of collection until analysis. If the sample contains free or combined chlorine, add sodium thiosulfate preservative (10 mg/40 mL is sufficient for up to 5 ppm Cl2) to the empty sample bottle just prior to shipping to the sampling site. EPA Method 330.4 or 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine. \8\ Field test kits are available for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 Collect about 500 mL of sample in a clean container. Adjust the pH of the sample to about 2 by adding 1+1 HCl while stirring. Fill the sample bottle in such a manner that no air bubbles pass through the sample as the bottle is being filled. Seal the bottle so that no air bubbles are entrapped in it. Maintain the hermetic seal on the sample bottle until time of analysis.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 All samples must be analyzed within 14 days of collection. \3\</p><p class="depth0">10. Procedure</p><p class="depth0">10.1 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are estimated retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. An example of the separations achieved by Column 1 is shown in Figure 6. Other packed columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Adjust the purge gas (nitrogen or helium) flow rate to 40 mL/min. Attach the trap inlet to the purging device, and set the purge and trap system to purge (Figure 3). Open the syringe valve located on the purging device sample introduction needle.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Allow the sample to come to ambient temperature prior to introducing it to the syringe. Remove the plunger from a 5-mL syringe and attach a closed syringe valve. Open the sample bottle (or standard) and carefully pour the sample into the syringe barrel to just short of overflowing. Replace the syringe plunger and compress the sample. Open the syringe valve and vent any residual air while adjusting the sample volume to 5.0 mL. Since this process of taking an aliquot destroys the validity of the sample for future analysis, the analyst should fill a second syringe at this time to protect against possible loss of data. Add 10.0 [micro]L of the surrogate spiking solution (Section 8.7) and 10.0 [micro]L of the internal standard spiking solution (Section 7.4.2), if applicable, through the valve bore, then close the valve.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 Attach the syringe-syringe valve assembly to the syringe valve on the purging device. Open the syringe valves and inject the sample into the purging chamber.</p><p class="depth0">10.6 Close both valves and purge the sample for 12.0 0.1 min at ambient temperature.</p><p class="depth0">10.7 After the 12-min purge time, disconnect the purging device from the trap. Dry the trap by maintaining a flow of 40 mL/min of dry purge gas through it for 6 min (Figure 4). If the purging device has no provision for bypassing the purger for this step, a dry purger should be inserted into the device to minimize moisture in the gas. Attach the trap to the chromatograph, adjust the purge and trap system to the desorb mode (Figure 5), and begin to temperature program the gas chromatograph. Introduce the trapped materials to the GC column by rapidly heating the trap to 180 [deg]C while backflushing the trap with an inert gas between 20 and 60 mL/min for 4 min. If rapid heating of the trap cannot be achieved, the GC column must be used as

a secondary trap by cooling it to 30 [deg]C (subambient temperature, if poor peak geometry and random retention time problems persist) instead of the initial program temperature of 50 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0">10.8 While the trap is being desorbed into the gas chromatograph column, empty the purging chamber using the sample introduction syringe. Wash the chamber with two 5-mL flushes of reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">10.9 After desorbing the sample for 4 min, recondition the trap by returning the purge and trap system to the purge mode. Wait 15 s, then close the syringe valve on the purging device to begin gas flow through the trap. The trap temperature should be maintained at 180 [deg]C. After approximately 7 min, turn off the trap heater and open the syringe valve to stop the gas flow through the trap. When the trap is cool, the next sample can be analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">10.10 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.</p><p class="depth0">10.11 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, prepare a dilution of the sample with reagent water from the aliquot in the second syringe and reanalyze.</p><p class="depth0">11. Calculations</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Determine the concentration of individual compounds in the sample.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.1 If the external standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the concentration of the parameter being measured from the peak response using the calibration curve or calibration factor determined in Section 7.3.2.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.2 If the internal standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the concentration in the sample using the response factor (RF) determined in Section 7.4.3 and Equation 2.

When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for either or both of the compounds above, compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method describes analytical conditions for a second gas chromatographic column that can be used to confirm measurements made with the primary column. Method 624 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for the parameters listed above, if used with the purge and trap conditions described in this method.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 12.1) \1\ for each parameter is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.</p><p class="depth0">1.5 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the operation of a purge and trap system and a gas chromatograph and in the interpretation of gas chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 An inert gas is bubbled through a 5-mL water sample contained in a heated purging chamber. Acrolein and acrylonitrile are transferred from the aqueous phase to the vapor phase. The vapor is swept through a sorbent trap where the analytes are trapped. After the purge is completed, the trap is heated and backflushed with the inert gas to desorb the compound onto a gas chromatographic column. The gas chromatograph is temperature programmed to separate the analytes which are then detected with a flame ionization detector. \2 3\</p><p class="depth0">2.2 The method provides an optional gas chromatographic column that may be helpful in resolving the compounds of interest from the interferences that may occur.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interferences</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Impurities in the purge gas and organic compound outgassing from the plumbing of the trap account for the majority of contamination problems. The analytical system must be demonstrated to be free from contamination under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3. The use of non-Teflon plastic tubing, non-Teflon thread sealants, or flow controllers with rubber components in the purge and trap system should be avoided.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Samples can be contaminated by diffusion of volatile organics through the septum seal into the sample during shipment and storage. A field reagent blank prepared from reagent water and carried through the sampling and handling protocol can serve as a check on such contamination.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Contamination by carry-over can occur whenever high level and low level samples are sequentially analyzed. To reduce carry-over, the purging device and sample syringe must be rinsed between samples with reagent water. Whenever an unusually concentrated sample is encountered, it should be followed by an analysis of reagent water to check for cross contamination. For samples containing large amounts of water-soluble materials, suspended solids, high boiling compounds or high analyte levels, it may be necessary to wash the purging device with a detergent solution, rinse it with distilled water, and then dry it in an oven at 105 [deg]C between analyses. The trap and other parts of the system are also subject to contamination, therefore, frequent bakeout and purging of the entire system may be required.</p><p class="depth0">4. Safety</p><p class="depth0">4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this view point, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified \4 6\ for the information of the analyst.</p><p class="depth0">5.

Several complete systems are now commercially available.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.1 The purging device must be designed to accept 5-mL, samples with a water column at least 3 cm deep. The gaseous head space between the water column and the trap must have a total volume of less than 15 mL.

The purge gas must be introduced no more than 5 mm from the base of the water column. The purging device must be capable of being heated to 85 [deg]C within 3.0 min after transfer of the sample to the purging device and being held at 85 2 [deg]C during the purge cycle. The entire water column in the purging device must be heated. Design of this modification to the standard purging device is optional, however, use of a water bath is suggested.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.1.1 Heating mantle--To be used to heat water bath.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.1.2 Temperature controller--Equipped with thermocouple/sensor to accurately control water bath temperature to 2 [deg]C. The purging device illustrated in Figure 1 meets these design criteria.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.2 The trap must be at least 25 cm long and have an inside diameter of at least 0.105 in. The trap must be packed to contain 1.0 cm of methyl silicone coated packing (Section 6.5.2) and 23 cm of 2,6-diphenylene oxide polymer (Section 6.5.1). The minimum specifications for the trap are illustrated in Figure 2.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.3 The desorber must be capable of rapidly heating the trap to 180 [deg]C, The desorber illustrated in Figure 2 meets these design criteria.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.4 The purge and trap system may be assembled as a separate unit as illustrated in Figure 3 or be coupled to a gas chromatograph.</p><p class="depth0">5.3 pH paper--Narrow pH range, about 3.5 to 5.5 (Fisher Scientific Short Range Alkacid No. 2, 14-837-2 or equivalent).</p><p class="depth0">5.4 Gas chromatograph--An analytical system complete with a temperature programmable gas chromatograph suitable for on-column injection and all required accessories including syringes, analytical columns, gases, detector, and strip-chart recorder.

Prepare stock standard solutions in reagent water using assayed liquids. Since acrolein and acrylonitrile are lachrymators, primary dilutions of these compounds should be prepared in a hood. A NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be used when the analyst handles high concentrations of such materials.</p><p class="depth0">6.6.1 Place about 9.8 mL of reagent water into a 10-mL ground glass stoppered volumetric flask. For acrolein standards the reagent water must be adjusted to pH 4 to 5. Weight the flask to the nearest 0.1 mg.</p><p class="depth0">6.6.2 Using a 100-[micro]L syringe, immediately add two or more drops of assayed reference material to the flask, then reweigh. Be sure that the drops fall directly into the water without contacting the neck of the flask.</p><p class="depth0">6.6.3 Reweigh, dilute to volume, stopper, then mix by inverting the flask several times. Calculate the concentration in [micro]g/[micro]L from the net gain in weight. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock staldard. Optionally, stock standard solutions may be prepared using the pure standard material by volumetrically measuring the appropriate amounts and determining the weight of the material using the density of the material. Commercially prepared stock standards may be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufactaurer or by an independent source.</p><p class="depth0">6.6.4 Transfer the stock standard solution into a Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottle. Store at 4 [deg]C and protect from light.</p><p class="depth0">6.6.5 Prepare fresh standards daily.</p><p class="depth0">6.7 Secondary dilution standards--Using stock standard solutions, prepare secondary dilution standards in reagent water that contain the compounds of interest, either singly or mixed together. The secondary dilution standards should be prepared at concentrations such that the aqueous calibration standards prepared in Section 7.3.1 or 7.4.1 will bracket the working range of the analytical system. Secondary dilution standards should be prepared daily and stored at 4 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0">6.8 Quality control check sample concentrate--See Section 8.2.1.</p><p class="depth0">7. Calibration</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Assemble a purge and trap system that meets the specifications in Section 5.2. Condition the trap overnight at 180 [deg]C by backflushing with an inert gas flow of at least 20 mL/min. Condition the trap for 10 min once daily prior to use.</p><p class="depth0">7.2 Connect the purge and trap system to a gas chromatograph. The gas chromatograph must be operated using temperature and flow rate conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1. Calibrate the purge and trap-gas chromatographic system using either the external standard technique (Section 7.3) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.4).</p><p class="depth0">7.3 External standard calibration procedure:</p><p class="depth0">7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter by carefully adding 20.0 [micro]L of one or more secondary dilution standards to 100, 500, or 1000 mL of reagent water. A 25-[micro]L syringe with a 0.006 in. ID needle should be used for this operation. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector. These standards must be prepared fresh daily.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.2 Analyze each calibration standard according to Section 10, and tabulate peak height or area responses versus the concentration of the standard. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to concentration (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (<10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.</p><p class="depth0">7.4 Internal standard calibration procedure--To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest as described in Section 7.3.1.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.2 Prepare a spiking solution containing each of the internal standards using the procedures described in Sections 6.6 and 6.7. It is recommended that the secondary dilution standard be prepared at a concentration of 15 [micro]g/mL of each internal standard compound. The addition of 10 [micro]L of this standard to 5.0 mL of sample or calibration standard would be equivalent to 30 [micro]g/L.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.3 Analyze each calibration standard according to Section 10, adding 10 [micro]L of internal standard spiking solution directly to the syringe (Section 10.4). Tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard, and calculate response factors (RF) for each compound using Equation 1.</p><p class="depth0">RF = (As)(Cis (Ais)(Cs)</p><p class="depth0">Equation 1



where:
As=Response for the parameter to be measured.Ais=Response for the internal standard.Cis=Concentration of the internal standard.Cs=Concentration of the parameter to be measured.
If the RF value over the working range is a constant (<10% RSD), the RF can be assumed to be invariant and the average RF can be used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to plot a calibration curve of response ratios, As/Ais, vs. RF.</p><p class="depth0">7.5 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of a QC check sample.</p><p class="depth0">7.5.1 Prepare the QC check sample as described in Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">7.5.2 Analyze the QC check sample according to Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">7.5.3 For each parameter, compare the response (Q) with the corresponding calibration acceptance criteria found in Table 2. If the responses for all parameters of interest fall within the designated ranges, analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual Q falls outside the range, a new calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be prepared for that parameter according to Section 7.3 or 7.4.</p><p class="depth0">8. Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Section 10.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.3 Each day, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system are under control.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at a concentration of 25 [micro]g/mL in reagent water. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Prepare a QC check sample to contain 50 [micro]g/L of each parameter by adding 200 [micro]L of QC check sample concentrate to 100 mL of reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3 Analyze four 5-mL aliquots of the well-mixed QC check sample according to Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X) in [micro]g/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in [micro]g/L, for each parameter using the four results.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 3. If s and X for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If either s exceeds the precision limit or X falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter. Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for each compound of interest.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to

ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at 50 [micro]g/L or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Analyze one 5-mL sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second 5-mL sample aliquot with 10 [micro]L of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100(A-B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 3. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1. \7\</p><p class="depth0">8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 10 [micro]L of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 5 mL of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (Ps) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (Ps) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 3. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (sp). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P-2sp to P+2sp. If P=90% and sp=10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).</p><p class="depth0">8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.</p><p class="depth0">9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling</p><p class="depth0">9.1 All samples must be iced or refrigerated from the time of collection until analysis. If the sample contains free or combined chlorine, add sodium thiosulfate preservative (10 mg/40 mL is sufficient for up to 5 ppm Cl2) to the empty sample bottle just prior to shipping to the sampling site. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine. \8\ Field test kits are available for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 If acrolein is to be analyzed, collect about 500 mL of sample in a clean glass container. Adjust the pH of the sample to 4 to 5 using acid or base, measuring with narrow range pH paper. Samples for acrolein analysis receiving no pH adjustment must be analyzed within 3 days of sampling.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers having a total volume of at

least 25 mL. Fill the sample bottle just to overflowing in such a manner that no air bubbles pass through the sample as the bottle is being filled. Seal the bottle so that no air bubbles are entrapped in it. If preservative has been added, shake vigorously for 1 min. Maintain the hermetic seal on the sample bottle until time of analysis.</p><p class="depth0">9.4 All samples must be analyzed within 14 days of collection. \3\</p><p class="depth0">10. Procedure</p><p class="depth0">10.1 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are estimated retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. An example of the separations achieved by Column 1 is shown in Figure 5. Other packed columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Adjust the purge gas (nitrogen or helium) flow rate to 20 mL-min. Attach the trap inlet to the purging device, and set the purge and trap system to purge (Figure 3). Open the syringe valve located on the purging device sample introduction needle.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Remove the plunger from a 5-mL syringe and attach a closed syringe valve. Open the sample bottle (or standard) and carefully pour the sample into the syringe barrel to just short of overflowing. Replace the syringe plunger and compress the sample. Open the syringe valve and vent any residual air while adjusting the sample volume to 5.0 mL. Since this process of taking an aliquot destroys the validity of the sample for future analysis, the analyst should fill a second syringe at this time to protect against possible loss of data. Add 10.0 [micro]L of the internal standard spiking solution (Section 7.4.2), if applicable, through the valve bore then close the valve.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 Attach the syringe-syringe valve assembly to the syringe valve on the purging device. Open the syringe valves and inject the sample into the purging chamber.</p><p class="depth0">10.6 Close both valves and purge the sample for 15.0 0.1 min while heating at 85 2 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0">10.7 After the 15-min purge time, attach the trap to the chromatograph, adjust the purge and trap system to the desorb mode (Figure 4), and begin to temperature program the gas chromatograph. Introduce the trapped materials to the GC column by rapidly heating the trap to 180 [deg]C while backflushing the trap with an inert gas between 20 and 60 mL/min for 1.5 min.</p><p class="depth0">10.8 While the trap is being desorbed into the gas chromatograph, empty the purging chamber using the sample introduction syringe. Wash the chamber with two 5-mL flushes of reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">10.9 After desorbing the sample for 1.5 min, recondition the trap by returning the purge and trap system to the purge mode. Wait 15 s then close the syringe valve on the purging device to begin gas flow through the trap. The trap temperature should be maintained at 210 [deg]C. After approximately 7 min, turn off the trap heater and open the syringe valve to stop the gas flow through the trap. When the trap is cool, the next sample can be analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">10.10 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.</p><p class="depth0">11. Calculations</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Determine the concentration of individual compounds in the sample.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.1 If the external standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the concentration of the parameter being measured from the peak response using the calibration curve or calibration factor determined in Section 7.3.2.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.2 If the internal standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the concentration in the sample using the response factor (RF) determined in Section 7.4.3 and Equation 2.

Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is acidified and extracted with methylene chloride using a separatory funnel. The methylene chloride extract is dried and exchanged to 2-propanol during concentration to a volume of 10 mL or less. The extract is separated by gas chromatography and the phenols are then measured with an FID. \2\</p><p class="depth0">2.2 A preliminary sample wash under basic conditions can be employed for samples having high general organic and organic base interferences.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 The method also provides for a derivatization and column chromatography cleanup procedure to aid in the elimination of interferences. \2 3\ The derivatives are analyzed by ECDGC.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interferences</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated baselines in gas chromatograms. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned. \4\ Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 [deg]C for 15 to 30 min. Some thermally stable materials, such as PCBs, may not be eliminated by this treatment. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Thorough rinsing with such solvents usually eliminates PCB interference. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants. Store inverted or capped with aluminum foil.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.2 The use of high purity reagents and solvents helps to minimize interference problems. Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants that are coextracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. The derivatization cleanup procedure in Section 12 can be used to overcome many of these interferences, but unique samples may require additional cleanup approaches to achieve the MDL listed in Tables 1 and 2.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 The basic sample wash (Section 10.2) may cause significantly reduced recovery of phenol and 2,4-dimethylphenol. The analyst must recognize that results obtained under these conditions are minimum concentrations.</p><p class="depth0">4. Safety</p><p class="depth0">4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this mothod has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified \5 7\ for the information of analyst.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Special care should be taken in handling pentafluorobenzyl bromide, which is a lachrymator, and 18-crown-6-ether, which is highly toxic.</p><p class="depth0">5.

Sample containers must be kept refrigerated at 4 [deg]C and protected from light during compositing. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be

used. Before use, however, the compressible tubing should be thoroughly rinsed with methanol, followed by repeated rinsings with distilled water to minimize the potential for contamination of the sample.

The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to amount injected (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (<10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.</p><p class="depth0">7.3 Internal standard calibration procedure for FIDGC--To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask. To each calibration standard, add a known constant amount of one or more internal standards, and dilute to volume with 2-propanol. One of the standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 [micro]L, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 11 and tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard.

Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.6 and 11.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.3 Before processing any samples the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system and glassware are under control. Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at a concentration of 100 [micro]g/mL in 2-propanol. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Using a pipet, prepare QC check samples at a concentration of 100 [micro]g/L by adding 1.00 mL of QC check sample concentrate to each of four 1-L aliquots of reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3 Analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X) in [micro]g/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in [micro]g/L, for each parameter using the four results.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 3. If s and X for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The large number of parameters in Talbe 3 present a substantial probability that one or more will fail at least one of the acceptance criteria when all parameters are analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6 When one or more of the parameters tested fail at least one of the acceptance criteria, the analyst must proceed according to Section 8.2.6.1 or 8.2.6.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6.1 Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6.2 Beginning with Section 8.2.2, repeat the test only for those parameters that failed to meet criteria. Repeated failure, however, will confirm a general problem

with the measurement system. If this occurs, locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all compounds of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at 100 [micro]g/L or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determine background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any, or, if none, (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or 100 [micro]g/L.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100(A-B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 3. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1. \8\ If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than 100 [micro]g/L, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 3, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X') using the equation in Table 4, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S') using the equation in Table 4, substituting X' for X; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X'/T)2.44(100 S'/T)%. \8\</p><p class="depth0">8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 mL of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (Ps) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (Ps) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 3. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (sp). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P-2sp to P+2sp. If P=90% and sp=10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).</p><p class="depth0">8.6. It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak

on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.</p><p class="depth0">9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practices \9\ should be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 All samples must be iced or refrigerated at 4 [deg]C from the time of collection until extraction. Fill the sample bottles and, if residual chlorine is present, add 80 mg of sodium thiosulfate per liter of sample and mix well. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine. \10\ Field test kits are available for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection and completely analyzed within 40 days of extraction. \2\</p><p class="depth0">10. Sample Extraction</p><p class="depth0">10.1 Mark the water meniscus on the side of sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Pour the entire sample into a 2-L separatory funnel.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 For samples high in organic content, the analyst may solvent wash the sample at basic pH as prescribed in Sections 10.2.1 and 10.2.2 to remove potential method interferences. Prolonged or exhaustive contact with solvent during the wash may result in low recovery of some of the phenols, notably phenol and 2,4-dimethylphenol. For relatively clean samples, the wash should be omitted and the extraction, beginning with Section 10.3, should be followed.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.1 Adjust the pH of the sample to 12.0 or greater with sodium hydroxide solution.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.2 Add 60 mL of methylene chloride to the sample by shaking the funnel for 1 min with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Discard the solvent layer. The wash can be repeated up to two additional times if significant color is being removed.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Adjust the sample to a pH of 1 to 2 with sulfuric acid.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Add 60 mL of methylene chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake 30 s to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min. with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the methylene chloride extract in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 Add a second 60-mL volume of methylene chloride to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the Erlenmeyer flask. Perform a third extraction in the same manner.</p><p class="depth0">10.6 Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) concentrator by attaching a 10-mL concentrator tube to a 500-mL evaporative flask. Other concentration devices or techniques may be used in place of the K-D concentrator if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">10.7 Pour the combined extract through a solvent-rinsed drying column containing about 10 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and collect the extract in the K-D concentrator. Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask and column with 20 to 30 mL of methylene chloride to complete the quantitative transfer.</p><p class="depth0">10.8 Add one or two clean boiling chips to the evaporative flask and attach a three-ball Snyder column. Prewet the Snyder column by adding about 1 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 [deg]C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15 to 20 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 1 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.</p><p class="depth0">10.9 Increase the temperature of the hot water bath to 95 to 100 [deg]C. Remove the Synder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of 2-propanol. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation. Attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column to the concentrator tube and prewet the column by adding about 0.5 mL of 2-propanol to the top. Place the micro-K-D apparatus on the water bath so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete concentration in 5 to 10 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will

not flood. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 2.5 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min. Add an additional 2 mL of 2-propanol through the top of the micro-Snyder column and resume concentrating as before. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 0.5 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.</p><p class="depth0">10.10 Remove the micro-Snyder column and rinse its lower joint into the concentrator tube with a minimum amount of 2-propanol. Adjust the extract volume to 1.0 mL. Stopper the concentrator tube and store refrigerated at 4 [deg]C if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extract will be stored longer than two days, it should be transferred to a Teflon-sealed screw-cap vial. If the sample extract requires no further cleanup, proceed with FIDGC analysis (Section 11). If the sample requires further cleanup, proceed to Section 12.</p><p class="depth0">10.11 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1000-mL graduated cylinder.

The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound may be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.</p><p class="depth0">11.6 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, dilute the extract and reanalyze.</p><p class="depth0">11.7 If the measurement of the peak response is prevented by the presence of interferences, an alternative gas chromatographic procedure is required.

When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for the compounds above, identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method describes electrochemical conditions at a second potential which can be used to confirm measurements made with this method. Method 625 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for the parameters listed above, using the extract produced by this method.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 14.1) \1\ for each parameter is

listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of the interferences in the sample matrix.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.</p><p class="depth0">1.5 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of HPLC instrumentation and in the interpretation of liquid chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is extracted with chloroform using liquid-liquid extractions in a separatory funnel. The chloroform extract is extracted with acid. The acid extract is then neutralized and extracted with chloroform. The final chloroform extract is exchanged to methanol while being concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The extract is mixed with buffer and separated by HPLC. The benzidine compounds are measured with an electrochemical detector. \2\</p><p class="depth0">2.2 The acid back-extraction acts as a general purpose cleanup to aid in the elimination of interferences.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interferences</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated baselines in chromatograms. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned. \3\ Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 [deg]C for 15 to 30 min. Some thermally stable materials may not be eliminated by this treatment. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants. Store inverted or capped with aluminum foil.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.2 The use of high purity reagents and solvents helps to minimize interference problems. Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants that are co-extracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. The cleanup procedures that are inherent in the extraction step are used to overcome many of these interferences, but unique samples may require additional cleanup approaches to achieve the MDL listed in Table 1.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Some dye plant effluents contain large amounts of components with retention times closed to benzidine. In these cases, it has been found useful to reduce the electrode potential in order to eliminate interferences and still detect benzidine. (See Section 12.7.)</p><p class="depth0">4. Safety</p><p class="depth0">4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health harzard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified \4 6\ for the information of the analyst.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 The following parameters covered by this method have been tentatively classified as known or suspected, human or mammalian carcinogens: benzidine and 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine. Primary standards of these toxic compounds should be prepared in a hood. A NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be worn when the analyst handles high concentrations of these toxic compounds.</p><p class="depth0">4.3 Exposure to chloroform should be minimized by performing all extractions and extract concentrations in a hood or other well-ventiliated area.</p><p class="depth0">5. Apparatus and Materials</p><p class="depth0">5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete or composite sampling.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.1 Grab sample bottle--1-L or 1-qt, amber glass, fitted with a screw cap lined with Teflon.

The bottle and cap liner must be washed, rinsed with acetone or methylene

chloride, and dried before use to minimize contamination.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.2 Automatic sampler (optional)--The sampler must incorporate glass sample containers for the collection of a minimum of 250 mL of sample. Sample containers must be kept refrigerated at 4 [deg]C and protected from light during compositing. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be used. Before use, however, the compressible tubing should be thoroughly rinsed with methanol, followed by repeated rinsings with distilled water to minimize the potential for contamination of the sample. An integrating flow meter is required to collect flow proportional composites.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Glassware (All specifications are suggested):</p><p class="depth0">5.2.1 Separatory funnels--2000, 1000, and 250-mL, with Teflon stopcock.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.2 Vials--10 to 15-mL, amber glass, with Teflon-lined screw cap.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.3 Rotary evaporator.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.4 Flasks--Round bottom, 100-mL, with 24/40 joints.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.5 Centrifuge tubes--Conical, graduated, with Teflon-lined screw caps.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.6 Pipettes--Pasteur, with bulbs.</p><p class="depth0">5.3 Balance--Analytical, capable of accurately weighing 0.0001 g.</p><p class="depth0">5.4 High performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC)--An analytical system complete with column supplies, high pressure syringes, detector, and compatible recorder.

Dissolve the material in methanol and dilute to volume in a 10-mL volumetric flask. Larger volumes can be used at the convenience of the analyst. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards can be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.</p><p class="depth0">6.11.2 Transfer the stock standard solutions into Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottles. Store at 4 [deg]C and protect from light. Stock standard solutions should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards from them.</p><p class="depth0">6.11.3 Stock standard solutions must be replaced after six months, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicates a problem.</p><p class="depth0">6.12 Quality control check sample concentrate--See Section 8.2.1.</p><p class="depth0">7. Calibration</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Establish chromatographic operating conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1. The HPLC system can be calibrated using the external standard technique (Section 7.2) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.3).</p><p class="depth0">7.2 External standard calibration procedure:</p><p class="depth0">7.2.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask and diluting to volume with mobile phase. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.2 Using syringe injections of 5 to 25 [micro]L or a constant volume injection loop, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against the mass injected. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to amount injected (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (<10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.</p><p class="depth0">7.3 Internal standard calibration procedure--To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask. To each calibration standard, add a known constant amount of one or more internal standards, and dilute to volume with mobile phase. One of the standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.2 Using syringe injections of 5 to 25 [micro]L or a constant volume injection loop, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard. Calculate response factors (RF) for each compound using Equation 1.</p><p class="depth0">RF = (As)(Cis (Ais)(Cs)</p><p class="depth0">Equation 1
where:As=Response for the parameter to be measured.Ais=Response for the internal standard.Cis=Concentration of the internal standard ([micro]g/L).Cs=Concentration of the parameter to be measured ([micro]g/</p><p class="depth0">L).</p><p class="depth0">If the RF value over the working range is a constant (<10% RSD), the RF can be assumed to be invariant and the average RF can be used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to plot a calibration curve of response ratios, As/Ais, vs. RF.</p><p class="depth0">7.4 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of one or more calibration standards. If the response for any parameter varies from the predicted response by more than 15%, a new calibration curve must be prepared for that compound. If serious loss of response occurs, polish the electrode and recalibrate.</p><p class="depth0">7.5 Before using any cleanup procedure, the analyst must process a series of calibration standards through the procedure to validate elution patterns and the absence of interferences from the reagents.</p><p class="depth0">8. Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.9, 11.1, and 12.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.3 Before processing any samples, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system and glassware are under control. Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed, a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing benzidine and/or 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine at a concentration of 50 [micro]g/mL each in methanol. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Using a pipet, prepare QC check samples at a concentration of 50 [micro]g/L by adding 1.00 mL of QC check sample concentrate to each of four 1-L-L aliquots of reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3 Analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X) in [micro]g/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in [micro]g/L, for each parameter using the four results.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 2. If s and X for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter. Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at 50 [micro]g/L or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determine background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any; or, if none (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or 50 [micro]g/L.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100(A-B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1. \7\ If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than 50 [micro]g/L, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 2, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X') using the equation in Table 3, substituting

the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S') using the equation in Table 3, substituting X' for X; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X'/T)2.44(100 S'/T)%. \7\</p><p class="depth0">8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 mL of QC check sample concentrate (Sections 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (Ps) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (Ps) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (sp). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P-2sp to P+2sp. If P=90% and sp=10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).</p><p class="depth0">8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as HPLC with a dissimilar column, gas chromatography, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.</p><p class="depth0">9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practices \8\ should be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 All samples must be iced or refrigerated at 4 [deg]C and stored in the dark from the time of collection until extraction. Both benzidine and 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine are easily oxidized. Fill the sample bottles and, if residual chlorine is present, add 80 mg of sodium thiosulfate per liter of sample and mix well. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine. \9\ Field test kits are available for this purpose. After mixing, adjust the pH of the sample to a range of 2 to 7 with sulfuric acid.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 If 1,2-diphenylhydrazine is likely to be present, adjust the pH of the sample to 4.0 0.2 to prevent rearrangement to benzidine.</p><p class="depth0">9.4 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection. Extracts may be held up to 7 days before analysis, if stored under an inert (oxidant free) atmosphere. \2\ The extract should be protected from light.</p><p class="depth0">10. Sample Extraction</p><p class="depth0">10.1 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Pour the entire sample into a 2-L separatory funnel. Check the pH of the sample with wide-range pH paper and adjust to within the range of 6.5 to 7.5 with sodium hydroxide solution or sulfuric acid.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Add 100 mL of chloroform to the sample bottle, seal, and shake 30 s to rinse the inner surface. (Caution: Handle chloroform in a well ventilated area.) Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation. The optimum technique depends

upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the chloroform extract in a 250-mL separatory funnel.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Add a 50-mL volume of chloroform to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the separatory funnel. Perform a third extraction in the same manner.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Separate and discard any aqueous layer remaining in the 250-mL separatory funnel after combining the organic extracts. Add 25 mL of 1 M sulfuric acid and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min. Transfer the aqueous layer to a 250-mL beaker. Extract with two additional 25-mL portions of 1 M sulfuric acid and combine the acid extracts in the beaker.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 Place a stirbar in the 250-mL beaker and stir the acid extract while carefully adding 5 mL of 0.4 M sodium tribasic phosphate. While monitoring with a pH meter, neutralize the extract to a pH between 6 and 7 by dropwise addition of 5 N sodium hydroxide solution while stirring the solution vigorously. Approximately 25 to 30 mL of 5 N sodium hydroxide solution will be required and it should be added over at least a 2-min period. Do not allow the sample pH to exceed 8.</p><p class="depth0">10.6 Transfer the neutralized extract into a 250-mL separatory funnel. Add 30 mL of chloroform and shake the funnel for 2 min. Allow the phases to separate, and transfer the organic layer to a second 250-mL separatory funnel.</p><p class="depth0">10.7 Extract the aqueous layer with two additional 20-mL aliquots of chloroform as before. Combine the extracts in the 250-mL separatory funnel.</p><p class="depth0">10.8 Add 20 mL of reagent water to the combined organic layers and shake for 30 s.</p><p class="depth0">10.9 Transfer the organic extract into a 100-mL round bottom flask. Add 20 mL of methanol and concentrate to 5 mL with a rotary evaporator at reduced pressure and 35 [deg]C. An aspirator is recommended for use as the source of vacuum. Chill the receiver with ice. This operation requires approximately 10 min. Other concentration techniques may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">10.10 Using a 9-in. Pasteur pipette, transfer the extract to a 15-mL, conical, screw-cap centrifuge tube. Rinse the flask, including the entire side wall, with 2-mL portions of methanol and combine with the original extract.</p><p class="depth0">10.11 Carefully concentrate the extract to 0.5 mL using a gentle stream of nitrogen while heating in a 30 [deg]C water bath. Dilute to 2 mL with methanol, reconcentrate to 1 mL, and dilute to 5 mL with acetate buffer. Mix the extract thoroughly. Cap the centrifuge tube and store refrigerated and protected from light if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extract will be stored longer than two days, it should be transferred to a Teflon-sealed screw-cap vial. If the sample extract requires no further cleanup, proceed with HPLC analysis (Section 12). If the sample requires further cleanup, proceed to Section 11.</p><p class="depth0">10.12 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1,000-mL graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL.</p><p class="depth0">11. Cleanup and Separation</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Cleanup procedures may not be necessary for a relatively clean sample matrix. If particular circumstances demand the use of a cleanup procedure, the analyst first must demonstrate that the requirements of Section 8.2 can be met using the method as revised to incorporate the cleanup procedure.</p><p class="depth0">12. High Performance Liquid Chromatography</p><p class="depth0">12.1 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the HPLC. Included in this table are retention times, capacity factors, and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. An example of the separations achieved by this HPLC column is shown in Figure 1. Other HPLC columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met. When the HPLC is idle, it is advisable to maintain a 0.1 mL/min flow through the column to prolong column life.</p><p class="depth0">12.2 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.</p><p class="depth0">12.3 If the internal standard calibration procedure is being used, the internal standard must be added to the sample extract and mixed thoroughly immediately before injection into the instrument.</p><p class="depth0">12.4 Inject 5 to 25 [micro]L of the sample extract or standard into the HPLC. If constant volume injection loops are not used, record the volume injected to the nearest 0.05 [micro]L, and the resulting peak size in area or peak height units.</p><p class="depth0">12.5 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.</p><p class="depth0">12.6 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, dilute the extract with mobile phase and reanalyze.</p><p class="depth0">12.7 If the measurement of the peak response for benzidine is prevented by the presence of interferences, reduce the electrode potential to +0.6 V and reanalyze. If the benzidine peak is still obscured by interferences, further cleanup is required.</p><p class="depth0">13. Calculations</p><p class="depth0">13.1 Determine the concentration of individual compounds in the sample.</p><p class="depth0">13.1.1 If the external standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the amount of material injected from the peak response using the calibration curve or calibration factor determined in Section 7.2.2.

Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is extracted with methylene chloride using a separatory funnel. The methylene chloride extract is dried and exchanged to hexane during concentration to a volume of 10 mL or less. The extract is separated by gas chromatography and the phthalate esters are then measured with an electron capture detector. \2\</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Analysis for phthalates is especially complicated by their ubiquitous occurrence in the environment. The method provides Florisil and alumina column cleanup procedures to aid in the elimination of interferences that may be encountered.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interferences</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated baselines in gas chromatograms. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned. \3\ Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 [deg]C for 15 to 30 min. Some thermally stable materials, such as PCBs, may not be eliminated by this treatment. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Thorough rinsing with such solvents usually eliminates PCB interference. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants.

Stock standard solutions should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards from them.</p><p class="depth0">6.7.3 Stock standard solutions must be replaced after six months, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicates a problem.</p><p class="depth0">6.8 Quality control check sample concentrate--See Section 8.2.1.</p><p class="depth0">7. Calibration</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Establish gas chromatograph operating conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1. The gas chromatographic system can be calibrated using the external standard technique (Section 7.2) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.3).</p><p class="depth0">7.2 External standard calibration procedure:</p><p class="depth0">7.2.1 Prepared calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask and diluting to volume with isooctane. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 [micro]L, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against the mass injected. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to amount injected (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (<10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.</p><p class="depth0">7.3 Internal standard calibration procedure--To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flash. To each calibration standard, add a known constant amount of one or more internal standards, and dilute to volume with isooctane. One of the standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 [micro]L, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard.

Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.4, 11.1, and 12.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.3 Before processing any samples, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system and glassware are under control. Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed, a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 A quality contrml (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at the following concentrations in acetone: butyl benzyl phthalate, 10 [micro]g/mL; bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, 50 [micro]g/mL; di-n-octyl phthalate, 50 [micro]g/mL; any other phthlate, 25 [micro]g/mL. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agancy, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Using a pipet, prepare QC check samples at the test concentrations shown in Table 2 by adding 1.00 mL of QC check sample concentrate to each of four 1-L aliquots of reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3 Analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X) in [micro]g/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in [micro]g/L, for each parameter using the four results.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively,

found in Table 2. If s and X for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter. Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at the test concentration in Section 8.2.2 or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determine background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any; or, if none (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or the test concentration in Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100(A-B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1. \9\ If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than the test concentration in Section 8.2.2, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 2, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X') using the equation in Table 3, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S') using the equation in Table 3, substituting X' for X; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X'/T)2.44(100 S'/T)%. \9\</p><p class="depth0">8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 mL of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (Ps) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (Ps) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (sp). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P-2sp to P+2sp. If P=90% and sp=10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).</p><p class="depth0">8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.</p><p class="depth0">9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practices \10\ should be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 All samples must be iced or refrigerated at 4 [deg]C from the time of collection until extraction.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection and completely analyzed within 40 days of extraction. \2\</p><p class="depth0">10. Sample Extraction</p><p class="depth0">10.1 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume.

Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min. with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phrase separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the methylene chloride extract in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Add a second 60-mL volume of methylene chloride to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the Erlenmeyer flask. Perform a third extraction in the same manner.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) concentrator by attaching a 10-mL concentrator tube to a 500-mL evaporative flask. Other concentrator devices or techniques may be used in place of the K-D concentrator if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 Pour the combined extract through a solvent-rinsed drying column containing about 10 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and collect the extract in the K-D concentrator. Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask and column with 20 to 30 mL of methylene chloride to complete the quantitative transfer.</p><p class="depth0">10.6 Add one or two clean boiling chips to the evaporative flask and attach a three-ball Snyder column. Prewet the Snyder column by adding about 1 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 [deg]C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15 to 20 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 1 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.</p><p class="depth0">10.7 Increase the temperature of the hot water bath to about 80 [deg]C. Momentarily remove the Snyder column, add 50 mL of hexane and a new boiling chip, and reattach the Snyder column. Concentrate the extract as in Section 10.6, except use hexane to prewet the column. The elapsed time of concentration should be 5 to 10 min.</p><p class="depth0">10.8 Remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of hexane. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation. Adjust the extract volume to 10 mL. Stopper the concentrator tube and store refrigerated if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extract will be stored longer than two days, it should be transferred to a Teflon-sealed screw-cap vial. If the sample extract requires no further cleanup, proceed with gas chromatographic analysis (Section 12). If the sample requires further cleanup, proceed to Section 11.</p><p class="depth0">10.9 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1000-mL graduated cylinder.

Place the micro-K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (80 [deg]C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 5 to 10 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches about 0.5 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.

The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.</p><p class="depth0">12.6 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, dilute the extract and reanalyze.</p><p class="depth0">12.7 If the measurement of the peak response is prevented by the presence of interferences, further cleanup is required.</p><p class="depth0">13.

When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for any or all of the compmunds above, compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method describes analytical conditimns for a second gas chromatographic column that can be used to confirm measurements made with the primary column. Method 625 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine. In order to confirm the presence of N-nitrosodiphenylamine, the cleanup procedure specified in Section 11.3 or 11.4 must be used. In order to confirm the presence of N-nitrosodimethylamine by GC/MS, Column 1 of this method must be substituted for the column recommended in Method 625. Confirmation of these parameters using GC-high resolution mass spectrometry or a Thermal Energy Analyzer is also recommended. \1 2\</p><p class="depth0">1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 14.1) \3\ for each parameter is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.</p><p class="depth0">1.5 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of a gas chromatograph and in the interpretation of gas chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is extracted with methylene chloride using a separatory funnel. The methylene chloride extract is washed with dilute hydrochloric acid to remove free amines, dried, and concentrated to a volume of 10 mL or less. After the extract has been exchanged to methanol, it is separated by gas chromatography and the parameters are then measured with a nitrogen-phosphorus detector. \4\</p><p class="depth0">2.2 The method provides Florisil and alumina column cleanup procedures to separate diphenylamine from the nitrosamines and to aid in the elimination of interferences that may be encountered.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interferences</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated baselines in gas chromatograms. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned. \5\ Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 [deg]C for 15 to 30 min. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants. Store inverted or capped with aluminum foil.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.2 The use of high purity reagents and solvents helps to minimize interference problems. Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants that are co-extracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. The cleanup procedures in Section 11 can be used to overcome many of these interferences, but unique samples may require additional cleanup approaches to achieve the MDL listed in Table 1.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 N-Nitrosodiphenylamine is reported \6-9\ to undergo transnitrosation reactions. Care must be exercised in the heating or concentrating of solutions containing this compound in the presence of reactive amines.</p><p class="depth0">3.4 The sensitive and selective Thermal Energy Analyzer and the reductive Hall detector may be used in place of the nitrogen-phosphorus detector when interferences are encountered. The Thermal Energy Analyzer offers the highest selectivity of the non-MS detectors.</p><p class="depth0">4. Safety</p><p class="depth0">4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified \10-12\ for the information of the analyst.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 These nitrosamines are known carcinogens, \13-17\ therefore, utmost care must be exercised in the handling of these materials. Nitrosamine reference standards and standard solutions should be handled and prepared in a ventilated glove box within a properly ventilated room.</p><p class="depth0">5.

Sample containers must be kept refrigerated at 4 [deg]C and protected from light during compositing. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be used. Before use, however, the compressible tubing should be thoroughly rinsed with methanol, followed by repeated rinsings with distilled water to minimize the potential for contamination of the sample.

To prepare for use, place 100 g of alumina into a 500-mL reagent bottle and add 2 mL of reagent water. Mix the alumina preparation thoroughly by shaking or rolling for 10 min and let it stand for at least 2 h. The preparation should be homogeneous before use.

Calibration</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Establish gas chromatographic operating conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1. The gas chromatographic system can be calibrated using the external standard technique (Section 7.2) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.3).</p><p class="depth0">7.2 External standard calibration procedure:</p><p class="depth0">7.2.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask and diluting to volume with methanol. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 [micro]L, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against the mass injected. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to amount injected (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (<10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.</p><p class="depth0">7.3 Internal standard calibration procedure--To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask. To each calibration standard, add a known constant amount of one or more internal standards, and dilute to volume with methanol. One of the standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 [micro]L, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard. Calculate response factors (RF) for each compound using Equation 1.</p><p class="depth0">RF = (As)(Cis (Ais)(Cs)</p><p class="depth0">Equation 1

Alternatively, the results can be used to plot a calibration curve of response ratios, As/Ais, vs. RF.</p><p class="depth0">7.4 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of one or more calibration standards. If the response for any parameter varies from the predicted response by more than 15%, a new calibration curve must be prepared for that compound.</p><p class="depth0">7.5 Before using any cleanup procedure, the analyst must process a series of calibration standards through the procedure to validate elution patterns and the absence of interferences from the reagents.</p><p class="depth0">8. Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.4, 11.1, and 12.2) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.3 Before processing any samples, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system and glassware are under control. Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed, a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at a concentration of 20 [micro]g/mL in methanol. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Using a pipet, prepare QC check samples at a concentration of 20 [micro]g/L by adding 1.00 mL of QC check sample concentrate to each of four 1-L aliquots of reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3 Analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X) in [micro]g/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in [micro]g/L, for each parameter using the four results.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 2. If s and X for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If

any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter. Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at 20 [micro]g/L or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determine background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any; or, if none (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or 20 [micro]g/L.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100(A-B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. These acceptance criteria were caluclated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1. \18\ If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than 20 [micro]g/L, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 2, or optional QC acceptance criteria caluclated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance crtieria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X') using the equation in Table 3, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S') using the equation in Table 3, substituting X' for X; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X'/T) 2.44(100 S'/T)%. \18\</p><p class="depth0">8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 mL of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (Ps) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (Ps) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (sp). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P-2sp to P+2sp. If P=90% and sp=10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).</p><p class="depth0">8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of

the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.</p><p class="depth0">9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practices \19\ should be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 All samples must be iced or refrigerated at 4 [deg]C from the time of collection until extraction. Fill the sample bottles and, if residual chlorine is present, add 80 mg of sodium thiosulfate per liter of sample and mix well. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine. \20\ Field test kits are available for this purpose. If N-nitrosodiphenylamine is to be determined, adjust the sample pH to 7 to 10 with sodium hydroxide solution or sulfuric acid.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection and completely analyzed within 40 days of extraction. \4\</p><p class="depth0">9.4 Nitrosamines are known to be light sensitive. \7\ Samples should be stored in amber or foil-wrapped bottles in order to minimize photolytic decomposition.</p><p class="depth0">10. Sample Extraction</p><p class="depth0">10.1 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Pour the entire sample into a 2-L separatory funnel. Check the pH of the sample with wide-range pH paper and adjust to within the range of 5 to 9 with sodium hydroxide solution or sulfuric acid.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Add 60 mL of methylene chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake 30 s to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the methylene chloride extract in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Add a second 60-mL volume of methylene chloride to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the Erlenmeyer flask. Perform a third extraction in the same manner.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) concentrator by attaching a 10-mL concentrator tube to a 500-mL evaporative flask. Other concentration devices or techniques may be used in place of the K-D concentrator if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 Add 10 mL of hydrochloric acid to the combined extracts and shake for 2 min. Allow the layers to separate. Pour the combined extract through a solvent-rinsed drying column containing about 10 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and collect the extract in the K-D concentrator. Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask and column with 20 to 30 mL of methylene chloride to complete the quantitative transfer.</p><p class="depth0">10.6 Add one or two clean boiling chips to the evaporative flask and attach a three-ball Snyder column. Prewet the Snyder column by adding about 1 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 [deg]C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15 to 20 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 1 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.</p><p class="depth0">10.7 Remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of methylene chloride. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation. Stopper the concentrator tube and store refrigerated if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extract will be stored longer than two days, it should be transferred to a Teflon-sealed screw-cap vial. If N-nitrosodiphenylamine is to be measured by gas chromatography, the analyst must first use a cleanup column to eliminate diphenylamine interference (Section 11). If N-nitrosodiphenylamine is of no interest, the analyst may proceed directly with gas chromatographic analysis (Section 12).</p><p class="depth0">10.8 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1000-mL graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL.</p><p class="depth0">11. Cleanup and Separation</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Cleanup procedures may not be necessary for a relatively clean sample matrix. If particular circumstances demand the use of a cleanup procedure, the analyst may use either procedure below or any other appropriate procedure. However, the analyst first must demonstrate that the requirements of Section 8.2 can be met using the method as revised to incorporate the cleanup procedure. Diphenylamine, if present in the original sample extract, must be separated from the nitrosamines if N-nitrosodiphenylamine is to be determined by this method.</p><p class="depth0">11.2 If the entire extract is to be cleaned up by one of the following procedures, it must be concentrated to 2.0 mL. To the concentrator tube in Section 10.7, add a clean boiling chip and attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column. Prewet the column by adding about 0.5 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the micr-K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 [deg]C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 5 to 10 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches about 0.5 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min. Remove the micro-Snyder column and rinse its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 0.2 mL of methylene chloride. Adjust the final volume to 2.0 mL and proceed with one of the following cleanup procedures.</p><p class="depth0">11.3 Florisil column cleanup for nitrosamines:</p><p class="depth0">11.3.1 Place 22 g of activated Florisil into a 22-mm ID chromatographic column. Tap the column to settle the Florisil and add about 5 mm of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.2 Preelute the column with 40 mL of ethyl ether/pentane (15+85)(V/V). Discard the eluate and just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, quantitatively transfer the 2-mL sample extract onto the column using an additional 2 mL of pentane to complete the transfer.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.3 Elute the column with 90 mL of ethyl ether/pentane (15+85)(V/V) and discard the eluate. This fraction will contain the diphenylamine, if it is present in the extract.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.4 Next, elute the column with 100 mL of acetone/ethyl ether (5+95)(V/V) into a 500-mL K-D flask equipped with a 10-mL concentrator tube. This fraction will contain all of the nitrosamines listed in the scope of the method.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.5 Add 15 mL of methanol to the collected fraction and concentrate as in Section 10.6, except use pentane to prewet the column and set the water bath at 70 to 75 [deg]C. When the apparatus is cool, remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of pentane. Analyze by gas chromatography (Section 12).</p><p class="depth0">11.4 Alumina column cleanup for nitrosamines:</p><p class="depth0">11.4.1 Place 12 g of the alumina preparation (Section 6.10) into a 10-mm ID chromatographic column. Tap the column to settle the alumina and add 1 to 2 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top.</p><p class="depth0">11.4.2 Preelute the column with 10 mL of ethyl ether/pentane (3+7)(V/V). Discard the eluate (about 2 mL) and just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, quantitatively transfer the 2 mL sample extract onto the column using an additional 2 mL of pentane to complete the transfer.</p><p class="depth0">11.4.3 Just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, add 70 mL of ethyl ether/pentane (3+7)(V/V). Discard the first 10 mL of eluate. Collect the remainder of the eluate in a 500-mL K-D flask equipped with a 10 mL concentrator tube. This fraction contains N-nitrosodiphenylamine and probably a small amount of N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine.</p><p class="depth0">11.4.4 Next, elute the column with 60 mL of ethyl ether/pentane (1+1)(V/V), collecting the eluate in a second K-D flask equipped with a 10-mL concentrator tube. Add 15 mL of methanol to the K-D flask. This fraction will contain N-nitrosodimethylamine, most of the N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine and any diphenylamine that is present.</p><p class="depth0">11.4.5 Concentrate both fractions as in Section 10.6, except use pentane to prewet the column. When the apparatus is cool, remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of pentane. Analyze the fractions by gas chromatography (Section 12).</p><p class="depth0">12. Gas Chromatography</p><p class="depth0">12.1 N-nitrosodiphenylamine completely reacts to form diphenylamine at the normal operating temperatures of a GC injection port (200 to 250 [deg]C). Thus, N-nitrosodiphenylamine is chromatographed and detected as diphenylamine. Accurate determination depends on removal of diphenylamine that may be present in the original extract prior to GC analysis (See Section 11).</p><p class="depth0">12.2 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. Examples of the separations achieved by Column 1 are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Other packed or capillary (open-tubular) columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">12.3 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.</p><p class="depth0">12.4 If the extract has not been subjected to one of the cleanup procedures in Section 11, it is necessary to exchange the solvent from methylene chloride to methanol before the thermionic detector can be used. To a 1 to 10-mL volume of methylene chloride extract in a concentrator tube, add 2 mL of methanol and a clean boiling chip. Attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column to the concentrator tube. Prewet the column by adding about 0.5 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the micro-K-D apparatus on a boiling (100 [deg]C) water bath so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 5 to 10 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches about 0.5 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min. Remove the micro-Snyder column and rinse its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 0.2 mL of methanol. Adjust the final volume to 2.0 mL.</p><p class="depth0">12.5 If the internal standard calibration procedure is being used, the internal standard must be added to the sample extract and mixed thoroughly immediately before injection into the gas chromatograph.</p><p class="depth0">12.6 Inject 2 to 5 [micro]L of the sample extract or standard into the gas chromatograph using the solvent-flush technique. \21\ Smaller (1.0 [micro]L) volumes may be injected if automatic devices are employed. Record the volume injected to the nearest 0.05 [micro]L, and the resulting peak size in area or peak height units.</p><p class="depth0">12.7 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.</p><p class="depth0">12.8 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, dilute the extract and reanalyze.</p><p class="depth0">12.9 If the measurement of the peak response is prevented by the presence of interferences, further cleanup is required.</p><p class="depth0">13.

When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for any or all of the compounds above, compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method describes analytical conditions for a second gas chromatographic column that can be used to confirm measurements made with the primary column. Method 625 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for all of the parameters listed above, using the extract produced by this method.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 14.1) \1\ for each parameter is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 The sample extraction and concentration steps in this method are essentially the same as in Methods 606, 609, 611, and 612. Thus, a single sample may be extracted to measure the parameters included in the scope of each of these methods. When cleanup is required, the concentration levels must be high enough to permit selecting aliquots, as necessary, to apply appropriate cleanup procedures. The analyst is allowed the latitude, under Section 12, to select chromatographic conditions appropriate for the simultaneous measurement of combinations of these parameters.</p><p class="depth0">1.5 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.</p><p class="depth0">1.6 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of a gas chromatograph and in the interpretation of gas chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is extracted with methylene chloride using a separatory funnel. The methylene chloride extract is dried and exchanged to hexane during concentration to a volume of 10 mL or less. The extract is separated by gas chromatography and the parameters are then measured with an electron capture detector. \2\</p><p class="depth0">2.2 The method provides a Florisil column cleanup procedure and an elemental sulfur removal procedure to aid in the elimination of interferences that may be encountered.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interferences</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated baselines in gas chromatograms. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned. \3\ Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 [deg]C for 15 to 30 min. Some thermally stable materials, such as PCBs, may not be eliminated by this treatment. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Thorough rinsing with such solvents usually eliminates PCB interference. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants. Store inverted or capped with aluminum foil.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.2 The use of high purity reagents and solvents helps to minimize interference problems. Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Interferences by phthalate esters can pose a major problem in pesticide analysis when using the electron capture detector. These compounds generally appear in the chromatogram as large late eluting peaks, especially in the 15 and 50% fractions from Florisil. Common flexible plastics contain varying amounts of phthalates. These phthalates are easily extracted or leached from such materials during laboratory operations. Cross contamination of clean glassware routinely occurs when plastics are handled during extraction steps, especially when solvent-wetted surfaces are handled. Interferences from phthalates can best be minimized by avoiding the use of plastics in the laboratory. Exhaustive cleanup of reagents and glassware may be required to eliminate background phthalate contamination. \4 5\ The interferences from phthalate esters can be avoided by using a microcoulometric or electrolytic conductivity detector.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants that are co-extracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. The cleanup procedures in Section 11 can be used to overcome many of these interferences, but unique samples may require additional cleanup approaches to achieve the MDL listed in Table 1.</p><p class="depth0">4. Safety</p><p class="depth0">4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified \6-8\ for the information of the analyst.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 The following parameters covered by this method have been tentatively classified as known or suspected, human or mammalian carcinogens: 4,4'-DDT, 4,4'-DDD, the BHCs, and the PCBs. Primary standards of these toxic compounds should be prepared in a hood. A NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be worn when the analyst handles high concentrations of these toxic compounds.</p><p class="depth0">5.

Sample containers must be kept refrigerated at 4 [deg]C and protected from light during composting. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be used. Before use, however, the compressible tubing should be thoroughly rinsed with methanol, followed by repeated rinsings with distilled water to minimize the potential for contamination of the sample. An integrating flow meter is required to collect flow proportional composites.</p><p class="depth0">5.2. Glassware (All specifications are suggested.

Dissolve the material in isooctane and dilute to volume in a 10-mL volumetric flask. Larger volumes can be used at the convenience of the analyst. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards can be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.</p><p class="depth0">6.11.2 Transfer the stock standard solutions into Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottles. Store at 4 [deg]C and protect from light. Stock standard solutions should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards from them.</p><p class="depth0">6.11.3 Stock standard solutions must be replaced after six months, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicates a problem.</p><p class="depth0">6.12 Quality control check sample concentrate--See Section 8.2.1.</p><p class="depth0">7. Calibration</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Establish gas chromatographic operating conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1. The gas chromatographic system can be calibrated using the external standard technique (Section 7.2) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.3).</p><p class="depth0">7.2 External standard calibration procedure:</p><p class="depth0">7.2.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask and diluting to volume with isooctane. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 [micro]L, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against the mass injected. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to amount injected (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (<10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.</p><p class="depth0">7.3 Internal standard calibration procedure--To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can

be suggested that is applicable to all samples.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask. To each calibration standard, add a known constant amount of one or more internal standards, and dilute to volume with isooctane. One of the standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 [micro]L, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard. Calculate response factors (RF) for each compound using Equation 1.

Alternatively, the results can be used to plot a calibration curve of response ratios, As/Ais, vs. RF.</p><p class="depth0">7.4 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of one or more calibration standards. If the response for any parameter varies from the predicted response by more than 15%, the test must be repeated using a fresh calibration standard. Alternatively, a new calibration curve must be prepared for that compound.</p><p class="depth0">7.5 The cleanup procedure in Section 11 utilizes Florisil column chromatography. Florisil from different batches or sources may vary in adsorptive capacity. To standardize the amount of Florisil which is used, the use of lauric acid value \9\ is suggested. The referenced procedure determines the adsorption from hexane solution of lauric acid (mg) per g of Florisil. The amount of Florisil to be used for each column is calculated by dividing 110 by this ratio and multiplying by 20 g.</p><p class="depth0">7.6 Before using any cleanup procedure, the analyst must process a series of calibration standards through the procedure to validate elution patterns and the absence of interferences from the reagents.</p><p class="depth0">8. Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.4, 11.1, and 12.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.3 Before processing any samples, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system and glassware are under control. Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed, a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each single-component parameter of interest at the following concentrations in acetone: 4,4'-DDD, 10 [micro]g/mL; 4,4'-DDT, 10 [micro]g/mL; endosulfan II, 10 [micro]g/mL; endosulfan sulfate, 10 [micro]g/mL; endrin, 10 [micro]g/mL; any other single-component pesticide, 2 [micro]g/mL. If this method is only to be used to analyze for PCBs, chlordane, or toxaphene, the QC check sample concentrate should contain the most representative multicomponent parameter at a concentration of 50 [micro]g/mL in acetone. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Using a pipet, prepare QC check samples at the test concentrations shown in Table 3 by adding 1.00 mL of QC check sample concentrate to each of four 1-L aliquots of reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3 Analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X) in [micro]g/mL; and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in [micro]g/mL, for each parameter using the four results.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 3. If s and X for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The large number of parameters in Table 3 present a substantial probability that one or more will fail at least one of the acceptance criteria when all parameters are analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6 When one or more of the parameters tested fail at least one of the acceptance criteria, the analyst must proceed according to Section 8.2.6.1 or 8.2.6.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6.1 Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6.2 Beginning with Section 8.2.2, repeat the test only for those parameters that failed to meet criteria. Repeated failure, however, will confirm a general problem with the measurement system. If this occurs, locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all compmunds of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at the test concentration in Section 8.2.2 or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determine background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any; or, if none (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or the test concentration in Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100(A-B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 3. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1. \10\ If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than the test concentration in Section 8.2.2, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 3, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X') using the equation in Table 4, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S') using the equation in Table 4, substituting X'

for X; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X'/T)2.44(100 S'/T)%. \10\</p><p class="depth0">8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory. If the entire list of parameters in Table 3 must be measured in the sample in Section 8.3, the probability that the analysis of a QC check standard will be required is high. In this case the QC check standard should be routinely analyzed with the spike sample.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 mL of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standards to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (Ps) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (Ps) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 3. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (sp). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P-2 sp to P+2 sp. If P=90% and sp=10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).</p><p class="depth0">8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.</p><p class="depth0">9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practices \11\ should be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 All samples must be iced or refrigerated at 4 [deg]C from the time of collection until extraction. If the samples will not be extracted within 72 h of collection, the sample should be adjusted to a pH range of 5.0 to 9.0 with sodium hydroxide solution or sulfuric acid. Record the volume of acid or base used. If aldrin is to be determined, add sodium thiosulfate when residual chlorine is present. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine. \12\ Field test kits are available for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection and completely analyzed within 40 days of extraction. \2\</p><p class="depth0">10. Sample Extraction</p><p class="depth0">10.1 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Pour the entire sample into a 2-L separatory funnel.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Add 60 mL of methylene chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake 30 s to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min. with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation. The optium technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the methylene chloride extract in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Add a second 60-mL volume of methylene chloride to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the Erlenmeyer flask. Perform a third extraction in the same manner.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) concentrator by attaching a 10-mL concentrator tube to a 500-mL evaporative flask. Other concentration devices or techniques may be used in place of the K-D concentrator if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 Pour the combined extract through a solvent-rinsed drying column containing about 10 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and collect the extract in the K-D concentrator. Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask and column with 20 to 30 mL of methylene chloride to complete the quantitative transfer.</p><p class="depth0">10.6 Add one or two clean boiling chips to the evaporative flask and attach a three-ball Snyder column. Prewet the Snyder column by adding about 1 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 [deg]C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15 to 20 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 1 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.</p><p class="depth0">10.7 Increase the temperature of the hot water bath to about 80 [deg]C. Momeltarily remove the Snyder column, add 50 mL of hexane and a new boiling chip, and reattach the Snyder column. Concentrate the extract as in Section 10.6, except use hexane to prewet the column. The elapsed time of concentration should be 5 to 10 min.</p><p class="depth0">10.8 Remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of hexane. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation. Stopper the concentrator tube and store refrigerated if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extract will be stored longer than two days, it should be transferred to a Teflon-sealed screw-cap vial. If the sample extract requires no further cleanup, proceed with gas chromatographic analysis (Section 12). If the sample requires further cleanup, proceed to Section 11.</p><p class="depth0">10.9 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1000-mL graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL.</p><p class="depth0">11. Cleanup and Separation</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Cleanup procedures may not be necessary for a relatively clean sample matrix. If particular circumstances demand the use of a cleanup procedure, the analyst may use either procedure below or any other appropriate procedure. However, the analyst first must demonstrate that the requirements of Section 8.2 can be met using the method as revised to incorporate the cleanup procedure. The Florisil column allows for a select fractionation of the compounds and will eliminate polar interferences. Elemental sulfur, which interferes with the electron capture gas chromatography of certain pesticides, can be removed by the technique described in Section 11.3.</p><p class="depth0">11.2 Florisil column cleanup:</p><p class="depth0">11.2.1 Place a weight of Florisil (nominally 20 g) predetermined by calibration (Section 7.5), into a chromatographic column. Tap the column to settle the Florisil and add 1 to 2 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.2 Add 60 mL of hexane to wet and rinse the sodium sulfate and Florisil. Just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, stop the elution of the hexane by closing the stopcock on the chromatographic column. Discard the eluate.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.3 Adjust the sample extract volume to 10 mL with hexane and transfer it from the K-D concentrator tube onto the column. Rinse the tube twice with 1 to 2 mL of hexane, adding each rinse to the column.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.4 Place a 500-mL K-D flask and clean concentrator tube under the chromatographic column. Drain the column into the flask until the sodium sulfate layer is nearly exposed. Elute the column with 200 mL of 6% ethyl ether in hexane (V/V) (Fraction 1) at a rate of about 5 mL/min. Remove the K-D flask and set it aside for later concentration. Elute the column again, using 200 mL of 15% ethyl ether in hexane (V/V) (Fraction 2), into a second K-D flask. Perform the third elution using 200 mL of 50% ethyl ether in hexane (V/V) (Fraction 3). The elution patterns for the pesticides and PCBs are shown in Table 2.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.5 Concentrate the fractions as in Section 10.6, except use hexane to prewet the column and set the water bath at about 85 [deg]C. When the apparatus is cool, remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with hexane. Adjust the volume of each fraction to 10 mL with hexane and analyze by gas chromatography (Section 12).</p><p class="depth0">11.3 Elemental sulfur will usually elute entirely in Fraction 1 of the Florisil column cleanup. To remove sulfur interference from this fraction or the original extract, pipet 1.00 mL of the concentrated extract into a clean concentrator tube or Teflon-sealed vial. Add one to three drops of mercury and seal. \13\ Agitate the contents of the vial for 15 to 30 s. Prolonged shaking (2 h) may be required. If so, this may be accomplished with a reciprocal shaker. Alternatively, activated

copper powder may be used for sulfur removal. \14\ Analyze by gas chromatography.</p><p class="depth0">12. Gas Chromatography</p><p class="depth0">12.1 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. Examples of the separations achieved by Column 1 are shown in Figures 1 to 10. Other packed or capillary (open-tubular) columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">12.2 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.</p><p class="depth0">12.3 If the internal standard calibration procedure is being used, the internal standard must be added to the sample extract and mixed thoroughly immediately before injection into the gas chromatograph.</p><p class="depth0">12.4 Inject 2 to 5 [micro]L of the sample extract or standard into the gas chromatograph using the solvent-flush technique. \15\ Smaller (1.0 uL) volumes may be injected if automatic devices are employed. Record the volume injected to the nearest 0.05 [micro]L, the total extract volume, and the resulting peak size in area or peak height units.</p><p class="depth0">12.5 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.</p><p class="depth0">12.6 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, dilute the extract and reanalyze.</p><p class="depth0">12.7 If the measurement of the peak response is prevented by the presence of interferences, further cleanup is required.</p><p class="depth0">13. Calculations</p><p class="depth0">13.1 Determine the concentration of individual compounds in the sample.</p><p class="depth0">13.1.1 If the external standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the amount of material injected from the peak response using the calibration curve or calibration factor determined in Section 7.2.2. The concentration in the sample can be calculated from Equation 2.

Quantitate every identifiable peak unless interference with individual peaks persist after cleanup. Add peak height or peak area of each identified peak in the chromatogram. Calculate as total response in the sample versus total response in the standard.</p><p class="depth0">13.4 Report results in [micro]g/L without correction for recovery data. All QC data obtained should be reported with the sample results.</p><p class="depth0">14. Method Performance</p><p class="depth0">14.1 The method detection limit (MDL) is defined as the minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the value is above zero. \1\ The MDL concentrations listed in Table 1 were obtained using reagent water. \17\ Similar results were achieved using representative wastewaters. The MDL actually achieved in a given analysis will vary depending on instrument sensitivity and matrix effects.</p><p class="depth0">14.2 This method has been tested for linearity of spike recovery from reagent water and has been demonstrated to be applicable over the concentration range from 4xMDL to 1000xMDL with the following exceptions: Chlordane recovery at 4xMDL was low (60%); Toxaphene recovery was demonstrated linear over the range of 10xMDL to 1000xMDL. \17\</p><p class="depth0">14.3 This method was tested by 20 laboratories using reagent water, drinking water, surface water, and three industrial

wastewaters spiked at six concentrations. \18\ Concentrations used in the study ranged from 0.5 to 30 [micro]g/L for single-component pesticides and from 8.5 to 400 [micro]g/L for multicomponent parameters. Single operator precision, overall precision, and method accuracy were found to be directly related to the concentration of the parameter and essentially independent of the sample matrix. Linear equations to describe these relationships are presented in Table 4.</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">1. 40 CFR part 136, appendix B.</p><p class="depth0">2. ``Determination of Pesticides and PCBs in Industrial and Municipal Wastewaters,'' EPA 600/4-82-023, National Technical Information Service, PB82-214222, Springfield, Virginia 22161, April 1982.</p><p class="depth0">3.

the compounds listed above in municipal and industrial discharges as provided under 40 CFR 136.1. When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for any or all of the compounds above, compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method describes analytical conditions for a second gas chromatographic column that can be used to confirm measurements made with the primary column. Method 625 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for all of the parameters listed above, using the extract produced by this method.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 14.1) \1\ for each parameter is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 The sample extraction and concentration steps in this method are essentially the same as in Methods 606, 608, 611, and 612. Thus, a single sample may be extracted to measure the parameters included in the scope of each of these methods. When cleanup is required, the concentration levels must be high enough to permit selecting aliquots, as necessary, to apply appropriate cleanup procedures. The analyst is allowed the latitude, under Section 12, to select chromatographic conditions appropriate for the simultaneous measurement of combinations of these parameters.</p><p class="depth0">1.5 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.</p><p class="depth0">1.6 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of a gas chromatograph and in the interpretation of gas chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is extracted with methylene chloride using a separatory funnel. The methylene chloride extract is dried and exchanged to hexane during concentration to a volume of 10 mL or less. Isophorone and nitrobenzene are measured by flame ionization detector gas chromatography (FIDGC). The dinitrotoluenes are measured by electron capture detector gas chromatography (ECDGC). \2\</p><p class="depth0">2.2 The method provides a Florisil column cleanup procedure to aid in the elimination of interferences that may be encountered.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interferences</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated baseliles in gas chromatograms. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned. \3\ Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 [deg]C for 15 to 30 min. Some thermally stable materials, such as PCBs, may not be eliminated by this treatment. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Thorough rinsing with such solvents usually eliminates PCB interference. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants. Store inverted or capped with aluminum foil.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.2 The use of high purity reagents and solvents helps to minimize interference problems. Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants that are co-extracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. The cleanup procedure in Section 11 can be used to overcome many of these interferences, but unique samples may require additional cleanup approaches to achieve the MDL listed in Table 1.</p><p class="depth0">4. Safety</p><p class="depth0">4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified \4-6\ for the information of the analyst.</p><p class="depth0">5.

Guidelines for the use to alternate detectors are provided in Section 12.1.</p><p class="depth0">6.

Store at 4 [deg]C and protect from light. Stock standard solutions should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards from them.</p><p class="depth0">6.7.3 Stock standard solutions must be replaced after six months, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicates a problem.</p><p class="depth0">6.8 Quality control check sample concentrate--See Section 8.2.1.</p><p class="depth0">7. Calibration</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Establish gas chromatographic operating conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1. The gas chromatographic system can be calibrated using the external standard technique (Section 7.2) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.3).</p><p class="depth0">7.2 External standard calibration procedure:</p><p class="depth0">7.2.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask and diluting to volume with hexane. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 [micro]L, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against the mass injected. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to amount injected (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (<10% relative standard deviation, RSD) linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.</p><p class="depth0">7.3 Internal standard calibration procedure--To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flash. To each calibration standard, add a known constant amount of one or more internal standards, and dilute to volume with hexane.

Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to

generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.4, 11.1, and 12.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.3 Before processing any samples, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system and glassware are under control. Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed, a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.1,5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest in acetone at a concentration of 20 [micro]g/mL for each dinitrotoluene and 100 [micro]g/mL for isophorone and nitrobenzene. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Using a pipet, prepare QC check samples at the test concentrations shown in Table 2 by adding 1.00 mL of QC check sample concentrate to each of four 1-L aliquots of reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3 Analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X) in [micro]g/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in [micro]g/L, for each parameter using the four results.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 2. If s and X for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter. Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at the test concentration in Section 8.2.2 or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determile background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any; or, if none (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or the test concentration in Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100 (A-B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement

of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1. \7\ If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than the test concentration in Section 8.2.2, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 2, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X') using the equation in Table 3, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S') using the equation in Table 3, substituting X' for X8; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X'/T) 2.44 (100 S'/T)%. \7\</p><p class="depth0">8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.</p><p class="depth0">8.4. If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 mL of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (Ps) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (Ps) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 As part of QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (sp). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P-2sp to P+2sp. If P=90% and sp = 10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).</p><p class="depth0">8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.</p><p class="depth0">9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practices \8\ should be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 All samples must be iced or refrigerated at 4 [deg]C from the time of collection until extraction.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection and completely analyzed within 40 days of extraction. \2\</p><p class="depth0">10. Sample Extraction</p><p class="depth0">10.1 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Pour the entire sample into a 2-L separatory funnel. Check the pH of the sample with wide-range pH paper and adjust to within the range of 5 to 9 with sodium hydroxide solution or sulfuric acid.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Add 60 mL of methylene chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake 30 s to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min. with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration

of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the methylene chloride extract in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Add a second 60-mL volume of methylene chloride to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the Erlenmeyer flask. Perform a third extraction in the same manner.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) concentrator by attaching a 10-mL concentrator tube to a 500-mL evaporative flask. Other concentration devices or techniques may be used in place of the K-D concentrator if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 Pour the combined extract through a solvent-rinsed drying column containing about 10 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and collect the extract in the K-D concentrator. Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask and column with 20 to 30 mL of methylene chloride to complete the quantitative transfer.</p><p class="depth0">10.6 Sections 10.7 and 10.8 describe a procedure for exchanging the methylene chloride solvent to hexane while concentrating the extract volume to 1.0 mL. When it is not necessary to achieve the MDL in Table 2, the solvent exchange may be made by the addition of 50 mL of hexane and concentration to 10 mL as described in Method 606, Sections 10.7 and 10.8.</p><p class="depth0">10.7 Add one or two clean boiling chips to the evaporative flask and attach a three-ball Snyder column. Prewet the Snyder column by adding about 1 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 [deg]C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15 to 20 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 1 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.</p><p class="depth0">10.8 Remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of methylene chloride. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation. Add 1 to 2 mL of hexane and a clean boiling chip to the concentrator tube and attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column. Prewet the column by adding about 0.5 mL of hexane to the top. Place the micro-K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 [deg]C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 5 to 10 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 0.5 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.</p><p class="depth0">10.9 Remove the micro-Snyder column and rinse its lower joint into the concentrator tube with a minimum amount of hexane. Adjust the extract volume to 1.0 mL. Stopper the concentrator tube and store refrigerated if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extract will be stored longer than two days, it should be transferred to a Teflon-sealed screw-cap vial. If the sample extract requires no further cleanup, proceed with gas chromatographic analysis (Section 12). If the sample requires further cleanup, proceed to Section 11.</p><p class="depth0">10.10 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1000-mL graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL.</p><p class="depth0">11. Cleanup and Separation</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Cleanup procedures may not be necessary for a relatively clean sample matrix. If particular circumstances demand the use of a cleanup procedure, the analyst may use the procedure below or any other appropriate procedure. However, the analyst first must demonstrate that the requirements of Section 8.2 can be met using the method as revised to incorporate the cleanup procedure.</p><p class="depth0">11.2 Florisil column cleanup:</p><p class="depth0">11.2.1 Prepare a slurry of 10 g of activated Florisil in methylene chloride/hexane (1+9)(V/V) and place the Florisil into a chromatographic column. Tap the column to settle the Florisil and add 1 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top. Adjust the elution rate to about 2 mL/min.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.2 Just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, quantitatively transfer the sample extract onto the column using an additional 2 mL of hexane to complete the transfer. Just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, add 30 mL of methylene chloride/hexane (1 + 9)(V/V) and continue the elution of the column. Discard the eluate.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.3 Next, elute the column with 30 mL of acetone/methylene chloride (1 + 9)(V/V) into a 500-mL K-D flask equipped with a 10-mL concentrator tube. Concentrate the collected fraction as in Sections 10.6, 10.7, 10.8, and 10.9 including the solvent exchange to 1 mL of hexane. This fraction should contain the nitroaromatics and isophorone. Analyze by gas chromatography (Section 12).</p><p class="depth0">12. Gas Chromatography</p><p class="depth0">12.1 Isophorone and nitrobenzene are analyzed by injection of a portion of the extract into an FIDGC. The dinitrotoluenes are analyzed by a separate injection into an ECDGC. Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph.

Included in this table are retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. Examples of the separations achieved by Column 1 are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Other packed or capillary (open-tubular) columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">12.2 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.</p><p class="depth0">12.3 If the internal standard calibration procedure is being used, the internal standard must be added to the same extract and mixed thoroughly immediately before injection into the gas chromatograph.</p><p class="depth0">12.4 Inject 2 to 5 [micro]L of the sample extract or standard into the gas chromatograph using the solvent-flush technique. \9\ Smaller (1.0 [micro]L) volumes may be injected if automatic devices are employed.

The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.</p><p class="depth0">12.6 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, dilute the extract and reanalyze.</p><p class="depth0">12.7 If the measurement of the peak response is prevented by the presence of interferences, further cleanup is required.</p><p class="depth0">13.

When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for any or all of the compounds above, compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. Method 625 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for many of the parameters listed above, using the extract produced by this method.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 This method provides for both high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) and gas chromatographic (GC) approaches for the determination of PAHs. The gas chromatographic procedure does not adequately resolve the following four pairs of compounds: Anthracene and phenanthrene; chrysene and benzo(a)anthracene; benzo(b)fluoranthene and benzo(k)fluoranthene; and dibenzo(a,h) anthracene and indeno (1,2,3-cd)pyrene. Unless the purpose for the analysis can be served by reporting the sum of an unresolved pair, the liquid chromatographic approach must be used for these compounds. The liquid chromatographic method does resolve all 16 of the PAHs listed.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 15.1) \1\ for each parameter is listed in Table 1.

Thus, a single sample may be extracted to measure the parameters included in the scope of each of these methods. When cleanup is required, the concentration levels must be high enough to permit selecting aliquots, as necessary, to apply appropriate cleanup procedures. Selection of the aliquots must be made prior to the solvent exchange steps of this method. The analyst is allowed the latitude, under Sections 12 and 13, to select chromatographic conditions appropriate for the simultaneous measurement of combinations of these parameters.</p><p class="depth0">1.6 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.</p><p class="depth0">1.7 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of HPLC and GC systems and in the interpretation of liquid and gas chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is extracted with methylene chloride using a separatory funnel. The methylene chloride extract is dried and concentrated to a volume of 10 mL or less. The extract is then separated by HPLC or GC. Ultraviolet (UV) and fluorescence detectors are used with HPLC to identify and measure the PAHs. A flame ionization detector is used with GC. \2\</p><p class="depth0">2.2 The method provides a silica gel column cleanup procedure to aid in the elimination of interferences that may be encountered.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interferences</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardward that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated baselines in the chromatograms. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned. \3\ Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 [deg]C for 15 to 30 min. Some thermally stable materials, such as PCBs, may not be eliminated by this treatment. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be

substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Thorough rinsing with such solvents usually eliminates PCB interference. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants. Store inverted or capped with aluminum foil.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.2 The use of high purity reagents and solvents helps to minimize interference problems. Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants that are co-extracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. The cleanup procedure in Section 11 can be used to overcome many of these interferences, but unique samples may require additional cleanup approaches to achieve the MDL listed in Table 1.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 The extent of interferences that may be encountered using liquid chromatographic techniques has not been fully assessed. Although the HPLC conditions described allow for a unique resolution of the specific PAH compounds covered by this method, other PAH compounds may interfere.</p><p class="depth0">4. Safety</p><p class="depth0">4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method have not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified \4-6\ for the information of the analyst.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 The following parameters covered by this method have been tentatively classified as known or suspected, human or mammalian carcinogens: benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, and dibenzo(a,h)-anthracene. Primary standards of these toxic compounds should be prepared in a hood. A NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be worn when the analyst handles high concentrations of these toxic compounds.</p><p class="depth0">5. Apparatus and Materials</p><p class="depth0">5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete or composite sampling.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.1 Grab sample bottle--1-L or 1-qt, amber glass, fitted with a screw cap lined with Teflon. Foil may be substituted for Teflon if the sample is not corrosive. If amber bottles are not available, protect samples from light. The bottle and cap liner must be washed, rinsed with acetone or methylene chloride, and dried before use to minimize contamination.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.2 Automatic sampler (optional)--The sampler must incorporate glass sample containers for the collection of a minimum of 250 mL of sample. Sample containers must be kept refrigerated at 4 [deg]C and protected from light during compositing. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be used. Before use, however, the compressible tubing should be thoroughly rinsed with methanol, followed by repeated rinsings with distilled water to minimize the potential for contamination of the sample. An integrating flow meter is required to collect flow proportional composites.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Glassware (All specifications are suggested.

The fluorescence detector is used for excitation at 280 nm and emission greater than 389 nm cutoff (Corning 3-75 or equivalent). Fluorometers should have dispersive optics for excitation and can utilize either filter or dispersive optics at the emission detector. The UV detector is used at 254 nm and should be coupled to the fluorescence detector. These detectors were used to develop the method performance statements in Section 15. Guidelines for the use of alternate detectors are provided in Section 12.2.</p><p class="depth0">5.7 Gas chromatograph--An analytical system complete with temperature programmable gas chromatograph suitable for on-column or splitless injection and all required accessories including syringes, analytical columns, gases, detector, and strip-chart recorder.

Dissolve the material in acetonitrile and dilute to volume in a 10-mL volumetric flask. Larger volumes can be used at the convenience of the analyst. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards can be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.</p><p class="depth0">6.7.2 Transfer the stock standard solutions into Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottles. Store at 4 [deg]C and protect from light. Stock standard solutions should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards from them.</p><p class="depth0">6.7.3 Stock standard solutions must be replaced after six months, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicates a problem.</p><p class="depth0">6.8 Quality control check sample concentrate--See Section 8.2.1.</p><p class="depth0">7. Calibration</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Establish liquid or gas chromatographic operating conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1 or 2. The chromatographic system can be calibrated using the external standard technique (Section 7.2) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.3).</p><p class="depth0">7.2 External standard calibration procedure:</p><p class="depth0">7.2.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask and diluting to volume with acetonitrile. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.2 Using injections of 5 to 25 [micro]L for HPLC and 2 to 5 [micro]L for GC, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 or 13, as appropriate. Tabulate peak height or area responses against the mass injected. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to amount injected (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (<10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.</p><p class="depth0">7.3 Internal standard calibration procedure--To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the

compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask. To each calibration standard, add a known constant amount of one or more internal standards, and dilute to volume with acetonitrile. One of the standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.2 Using injections of 5 to 25 [micro]L for HPLC and 2 to 5 [micro]L for GC, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 or 13, as appropriate. Tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard. Calculate response factors (RF) for each compound using Equation 1.

where:As=Response for the parameter to be measured.Ais=Response for the internal standard.Cis=Concentration of the internal standard ([micro]g/L).Cs=Concentration of the parameter to be measured ([micro]g/</p><p class="depth0">L).
If the RF value over the working range is a constant (<10% RSD), the RF can be assumed to be invariant and the average RF can be used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to plot a calibration curve of response ratios, As/Ais, vs. RF.</p><p class="depth0">7.4 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of one or more calibration standards. If the response for any parameter varies from the predicted response by more than 15%, the test must be repeated using a fresh calibration standard. Alternatively, a new calibration curve must be prepared for that compound.</p><p class="depth0">7.5 Before using any cleanup procedure, the analyst must process a series of calibration standards through the procedure to validate elution patterns and the absence of interferences from the reagents.</p><p class="depth0">8. Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.4, 11.1, 12.2, and 13.3) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.3 Before processing any samples the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system and glassware are under control. Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at the following concentrations in acetonitrile: 100 [micro]g/mL of any

of the six early-eluting PAHs (naphthalene, acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, and anthracene); 5 [micro]g/mL of benzo(k)fluoranthene; and 10 [micro]g/mL of any of the other PAHs. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Using a pipet, prepare QC check samples at the test concentrations shown in Table 3 by adding 1.00 mL of QC check sample concentrate to each of four 1-L aliquots of reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3 Analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X) in [micro]g/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in [micro]g/L, for each parameter using the four results.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 3. If s and X for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The large number of parameters in Table 3 present a substantial probability that one or more will fail at least one of the acceptance criteria when all parameters are analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6 When one or more of the parameters tested fail at least one of the acceptance criteria, the analyst must proceed according to Section 8.2.6.1 or 8.2.6.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6.1 Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6.2 Beginning with Section 8.2.2, repeat the test only for those parameters that failed to meet criteria. Repeated failure, however, will confirm a general problem with the measurement system. If this occurs, locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all compounds of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at the test concentration in Section 8.2.2 or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determine background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any; or, if none, (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or the test concentration in Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100 (A-B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 3. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1. \7\ If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than the test concentration in Section 8.2.2, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 3, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X') using the equation in Table 4, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S') using the equation in Table 4, substituting X' for X; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X'/T)2.44(100 S'/T)%. \7\</p><p class="depth0">8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter

that failed the critiera must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory. If the entire list of parameters in Table 3 must be measured in the sample in Section 8.3, the probability that the analysis of a QC check standard will be required is high. In this case the QC check standard should be routinely analyzed with the spike sample.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 mL of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (Ps) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (Ps) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 3. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (sp). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P092sp to P+2sp. If P=90% and sp=10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).</p><p class="depth0">8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.</p><p class="depth0">9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practices \8\ should be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 All samples must be iced or refrigerated at 4 [deg]C from the time of collection until extraction. PAHs are known to be light sensitive; therefore, samples, extracts, and standards should be stored in amber or foil-wrapped bottles in order to minimize photolytic decomposition. Fill the sample bottles and, if residual chlorine is present, add 80 mg of sodium thiosulfate per liter of sample and mix well. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine. \9\ Field test kits are available for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection and completely analyzed within 40 days of extraction. \2\</p><p class="depth0">10. Sample Extraction</p><p class="depth0">10.1 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Pour the entire sample into a 2-L separatory funnel.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Add 60 mL of methylene chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake 30 s to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min. with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the methylene chloride extract in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Add a second 60-mL volume of methylene chloride to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the Erlenmeyer flask. Perform a third extraction in the same manner.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) concentrator by attaching a 10-mL concentrator tube to a 500-mL evaporative flask. Other concentration devices or techniques may be used in place of the K-D concentrator if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 Pour the combined extract through a solvent-rinsed drying column containing about 10 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and collect the extract in the K-D concentrator. Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask and column with 20 to 30 mL of methylene chloride to complete the quantitative transfer.</p><p class="depth0">10.6 Add one or two clean boiling chips to the evaporative flask and attach a three-ball Snyder column. Prewet the Snyder column by adding about 1 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 [deg]C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15 to 20 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 1 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.</p><p class="depth0">10.7 Remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of methylene chloride. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation. Stopper the concentrator tube and store refrigerated if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extract will be stored longer than two days, it should be transferred to a Teflon-sealed screw-cap vial and protected from light. If the sample extract requires no further cleanup, proceed with gas or liquid chromatographic analysis (Section 12 or 13). If the sample requires further cleanup, proceed to Section 11.</p><p class="depth0">10.8 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1000-mL graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL.</p><p class="depth0">11. Cleanup and Separation</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Cleanup procedures may not be necessary for a relatively clean sample matrix. If particular circumstances demand the use of a cleanup procedure, the analyst may use the procedure below or any other appropriate procedure. However, the analyst first must demonstrate that the requirements of Section 8.2 can be met using the methods as revised to incorporate the cleanup procedure.</p><p class="depth0">11.2 Before the silica gel cleanup technique can be utilized, the extract solvent must be exchanged to cyclohexane. Add 1 to 10 mL of the sample extract (in methylene chloride) and a boiling chip to a clean K-D concentrator tube. Add 4 mL of cyclohexane and attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column. Prewet the column by adding 0.5 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the micro-K-D apparatus on a boiling (100 [deg]C) water bath so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete concentration in 5 to 10 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood. When the apparent volume of the liquid reaches 0.5 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min. Remove the micro-Snyder column and rinse its lower joint into the concentrator tube with a minimum amount of cyclohexane. Adjust the extract volume to about 2 mL.</p><p class="depth0">11.3 Silica gel column cleanup for PAHs:</p><p class="depth0">11.3.1 Prepare a slurry of 10 g of activiated silica gel in methylene chloride and place this into a 10-mm ID chromatographic column. Tap the column to settle the silica gel and elute the methylene chloride. Add 1 to 2 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top of the silica gel.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.2 Preelute the column with 40 mL of pentane. The rate for all elutions should be about 2 mL/min. Discard the eluate and just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, transfer the 2-mL cyclohexane sample extract onto the column using an additional 2 mL cyclohexane to complete the transfer. Just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, add 25 mL of pentane and continue the elution of the column. Discard this pentane eluate.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.3 Next, elute the column with 25 mL of methylene chloride/pentane (4+6)(V/V) into a 500-mL K-D flask equipped with a 10-mL concentrator tube. Concentrate the collected fraction to less than 10 mL as in Section 10.6. When the apparatus is cool, remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint with pentane. Proceed with HPLC or GC analysis.</p><p class="depth0">12. High Performance Liquid Chromatography</p><p class="depth0">12.1 To the extract in the concentrator tube, add 4 mL of acetonitrile and a new boiling chip, then attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column. Concentrate the solvent as in Section 10.6, except set the water bath at 95 to 100 [deg]C. When the apparatus is cool, remove the micro-Snyder column and rinse its lower joint into the concentrator tube with about 0.2 mL of acetonitrile. Adjust the extract volume to 1.0 mL.</p><p class="depth0">12.2 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the HPLC. Included in this table are retention times, capacity factors, and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. The UV detector is recommended for the determination of naphthalene, acenaphthylene, acenapthene, and

fluorene and the fluorescence detector is recommended for the remaining PAHs. Examples of the separations achieved by this HPLC column are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Other HPLC columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">12.3 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.</p><p class="depth0">12.4 If the internal standard calibration procedure is being used, the internal standard must be added to the sample extract and mixed thoroughly immediately before injection into the instrument.</p><p class="depth0">12.5 Inject 5 to 25 [micro]L of the sample extract or standard into the HPLC using a high pressure syringe or a constant volume sample injection loop. Record the volume injected to the nearest 0.1 [micro]L, and the resulting peak size in area or peak height units. Re-equilibrate the HPLC column at the initial gradient conditions for at least 10 min between injections.</p><p class="depth0">12.6 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention time of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.</p><p class="depth0">12.7 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, dilute the extract with acetonitrile and reanalyze.</p><p class="depth0">12.8 If the measurement of the peak response is prevented by the presence of interferences, further cleanup is required.</p><p class="depth0">13. Gas Chromatography</p><p class="depth0">13.1 The packed column GC procedure will not resolve certain isomeric pairs as indicated in Section 1.3 and Table 2. The liquid chromatographic procedure (Section 12) must be used for these parameters.</p><p class="depth0">13.2 To achieve maximum sensitivity with this method, the extract must be concentrated to 1.0 mL. Add a clean boiling chip to the methylene chloride extract in the concentrator tube. Attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column.

Adjust the final volume to 1.0 mL and stopper the concentrator tube.</p><p class="depth0">13.3 Table 2 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are retention times that were obtained under these conditions. An example of the separations achieved by this column is shown in Figure 3.

When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for any or all of the compounds above, compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method describes analytical conditions for a second gas chromatographic column that can be used to confirm measurements made with the primary column. Method 625 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for all of the parameters listed above, using the extract produced by this method.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 14.1) \1\ for each parameter is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 The sample extraction and concentration steps in this method are essentially the same as in Methods 606, 608, 609, and 612. Thus, a single sample may be extracted to measure the parameters included in the scope of each of these methods. When cleanup is required, the concentration levels must be high enough to permit selecting aliquots, as necessary, to apply appropriate cleanup procedures. The analyst is allowed the latitude, under Section 12, to select

chromatographic conditions appropriate for the simultaneous measurement of combinations of these parameters.</p><p class="depth0">1.5 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.</p><p class="depth0">1.6 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of a gas chromatograph and in the interpretation of gas chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is extracted with methylene chloride using a separatory funnel. The methylene chloride extract is dried and exchanged to hexane during concentration to a volume of 10 mL or less. The extract is separated by gas chromatography and the parameters are then measured with a halide specific detector. \2\</p><p class="depth0">2.2 The method provides a Florisil column cleanup procedure to aid in the elimination of interferences that may be encountered.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interferences</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated baselines in gas chromatograms. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned. \3\ Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed be detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 [deg]C for 15 to 30 min. Some thermally stable materials, such a PCBs, may not be eliminated by this treatment. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Thorough rinsing with such solvents usually eliminates PCB interference. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants. Store inverted or capped with aluminum foil.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.2 The use of high purity reagents and solvents helps to minimize interference problems. Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants that are co-extracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. The cleanup procedure in Section 11 can be used to overcome many of these interferences, but unique samples may require additional cleanup approaches to achieve the MDL listed in Table 1.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Dichlorobenzenes are known to coelute with haloethers under some gas chromatographic conditions. If these materials are present together in a sample, it may be necessary to analyze the extract with two different column packings to completely resolve all of the compounds.</p><p class="depth0">4. Safety</p><p class="depth0">4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified \4-6\ for the information of the analyst.</p><p class="depth0">5.

Sample containers must be kept refrigerated at 4 [deg]C and protected from light during compositing. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be used. Before use, however, the compressible tubing should be thoroughly rinsed with methanol, followed by repeated rinsings with distilled water to minimize the potential for contamination of the sample.

Calibration</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Establish gas chromatographic operating conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1. The gas chromatographic system

can be calibrated using the external standard technique (Section 7.2) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.3).</p><p class="depth0">7.2 External standard calibration procedure:</p><p class="depth0">7.2.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask and diluting to volume with hexane. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 [micro]L, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against the mass injected. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to amount injected (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (<10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.</p><p class="depth0">7.3 Internal standard calibration procedure--To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask. To each calibration standard, add a known constant amount of one or more internal standards, and dilute to volume with hexane. One of the standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 [micro]L, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard.

If the RF value over the working range is a constant (<10% RSD), the RF can be assumed to be invariant and the average RF can be used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to plot a calibration curve of response ratios, As/Ais, vs. RF.</p><p class="depth0">7.4 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of one or more calibration standards. If the response for any parameter varies from the predicted response by more than 15%, a new calibration curve must be prepared for that compound.</p><p class="depth0">7.5 The cleanup procedure in Section 11 utilizes Florisil column chromatography. Florisil from different batches or sources may vary in adsorptive capacity. To standardize the amount of Florisil which is used, the use of lauric acid value \7\ is suggested. The referenced procedure determines the adsorption from hexane solution of lauric acid (mg) per g of Florisil. The amount of Florisil to be used for each column is calculated by dividing 110 by this ratio and multiplying by 20 g.</p><p class="depth0">7.6 Before using any cleanup procedure, the analyst must process a series of calibration standards through the procedure to validate elution patterns and the absence of interferences from the reagents.</p><p class="depth0">8. Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.4, 11.1, and 12.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.3 Before processing any samples, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system and glassware are under control. Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed, a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at a concentration of 100 [micro]g/mL in acetone. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Using a pipet, prepare QC check samples at a concentration of 100 [micro]g/L by adding 1.00 mL of QC check sample concentrate to each of four 1-L aliquots of reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3 Analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X) in [micro]g/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in [micro]g/L, for each parameter using the four results.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 2. If s and X for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter. Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1. The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at 100 [micro]g/L or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determine background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any; or, if none (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or 100 [micro]g/L.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100(A-B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1. \8\ If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than 100 [micro]g/L, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 2, or optional QC

acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X') using the equation in Table 3, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S') using the equation in Table 3, substituting X' for X; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X'/T)2.44(100 S'/T)%. \8\</p><p class="depth0">8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 m/L of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (Ps) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (Ps) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (sp). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P092sp to P+2sp. If P=90% and sp=10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).</p><p class="depth0">8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.</p><p class="depth0">9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practices \9\ should be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 All samples must be iced or refrigerated at 4 [deg]C from the time of collection until extraction. Fill the sample bottles and, if residual chlorine is present, add 80 mg of sodium thiosulfate per liter of sample and mix well. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine. \10\ Field test kits are available for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection and completely analyzed within 40 days of extraction. \2\</p><p class="depth0">10. Sample Extraction</p><p class="depth0">10.1 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Pour the entire sample into a 2-L separatory funnel.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Add 60 mL methylene chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake 30 s to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the methylene chloride extract in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Add a second 60-mL volume of methylene chloride to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time,

combining the extracts in the Erlenmeyer flask. Perform a third extraction in the same manner.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) concentrator by attaching a 10-mL concentrator tube to a 500-mL evaporative flask. Other concentration devices or techniques may be used in place of the K-D concentrator if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 Pour the combined extract through a solvent-rinsed drying column containing about 10 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and collect the extract in the K-D concentrator. Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask and column with 20 to 30 mL of methylene chloride to complete the quantitative transfer.</p><p class="depth0">10.6 Add one or two clean boiling chips to the evaporative flask and attach a three-ball Snyder column. Prewet the Snyder column by adding about 1 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 [deg]C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15 to 20 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 1 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Some of the haloethers are very volatile and significant losses will occur in concentration steps if care is not exercised. It is important to maintain a constant gentle evaporation rate and not to allow the liquid volume to fall below 1 to 2 mL before removing the K-D apparatus from the hot water bath.</p><p class="depth0">10.7 Momentarily remove the Snyder column, add 50 mL of hexane and a new boiling chip, and reattach the Snyder column. Raise the temperature of the water bath to 85 to 90 [deg]C. Concentrate the extract as in Section 10.6, except use hexane to prewet the column. The elapsed time of concentration should be 5 to 10 min.</p><p class="depth0">10.8 Remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of hexane. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation. Stopper the concentrator tube and store refrigerated if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extract will be stored longer than two days, it should be transferred to a Teflon-sealed screw-cap vial. If the sample extract requires no further cleanup, proceed with gas chromatographic analysis (Section 12). If the sample requires further cleanup, proceed to Section 11.</p><p class="depth0">10.9 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1000-mL graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL.</p><p class="depth0">11. Cleanup and Separation</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Cleanup procedures may not be necessary for a relatively clean sample matrix. If particular circumstances demand the use of a cleanup procedure, the analyst may use the procedure below or any other appropriate procedure. However, the analyst first must demonstrate that the requirements of Section 8.2 can be met using the method as revised to incorporate the cleanup procedure.</p><p class="depth0">11.2 Florisil column cleanup for haloethers:</p><p class="depth0">11.2.1 Adjust the sample extract volume to 10 mL.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.2 Place a weight of Florisil (nominally 20 g) predetermined by calibration (Section 7.5), into a chromatographic column. Tap the column to settle the Florisil and add 1 to 2 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.3 Preelute the column with 50 to 60 mL of petroleum ether. Discard the eluate and just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, quantitatively transfer the sample extract onto the column by decantation and subsequent petroleum ether washings. Discard the eluate. Just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, begin eluting the column with 300 mL of ethyl ether/petroleum ether (6+94) (V/V). Adjust the elution rate to approximately 5 mL/min and collect the eluate in a 500-mL K-D flask equipped with a 10-mL concentrator tube. This fraction should contain all of the haloethers.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.4 Concentrate the fraction as in Section 10.6, except use hexane to prewet the column. When the apparatus is cool, remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with hexane. Adjust the volume of the cleaned up extract to 10 mL with hexane and analyze by gas chromatography (Section 12).</p><p class="depth0">12. Gas Chromatography</p><p class="depth0">12.1 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. Examples of the separations achieved by Columns 1 and 2 are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. Other packed or capillary (open-tubular) columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">12.2 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.</p><p class="depth0">12.3 If the internal standard calibration procedure is being used, the internal standard must be added to the sample extract and mixed thoroughly immediately before injection into the gas chromatrograph.</p><p class="depth0">12.4 Inject 2 to 5 [micro]L of the sample extract or standard into the gas chromatograph using the solvent-flush technique. \11\ Smaller (1.0 [micro]L) volumes may be injected if automatic devices are employed. Record the volume injected to the nearest 0.05 [micro]L, the total extract volume, and the resulting peak size in area or peak height units.</p><p class="depth0">12.5 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weight heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.</p><p class="depth0">12.6 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, dilute the extract and reanalyze.</p><p class="depth0">12.7 If the measurement of the peak response is prevented by the presence of interferences, further cleanup is required.</p><p class="depth0">13. Calculations</p><p class="depth0">13.1 Determine the concentration of individual compounds in the sample.</p><p class="depth0">13.1.1 If the external standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the amount of material injected from the peak response using the calibration curve or calibration factor determined in Section 7.2.2. The concentration in the sample can be calculated from Equation 2.

Method Performance</p><p class="depth0">14.1 The method detection limit (MDL) is defined as the minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the value is above zero. \1\ The MDL concentrations listed in Table 1 were obtained using reagent water. \12\ Similar results were achieved using representative wastewaters. The MDL actually achieved in a given analysis will vary depending on instrument sensitivity and matrix effects.</p><p class="depth0">14.2 This method has been tested for linearity of spike recovery from reagent water and has been demonstrated to be applicable over the concentration range from 4 x MDL to 1000 x MDL. \12\</p><p class="depth0">14.3 This method was tested by 20 laboratories using reagent water, drinking water, surface water, and three industrial wastewaters spiked at six concentrations over the range 1.0 to 626 [micro]/L. \12\ Single operator precision, overall precision, and method accuracy were found to be directly related to the concentration of the parameter and essentially independent of the sample matrix.

When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for any or all of the compounds above, compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method describes a second gas chromatographic column that can be used to confirm measurements made with the primary column. Method 625 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for all of the parameters listed above, using the extract produced by this method.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 14.1) \1\ for each parameter is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 The sample extraction and concentration steps in this method are essentially the same as in Methods 606, 608, 609, and 611. Thus, a single sample may be extracted to measure the parameters included in the scope of each of these methods. When cleanup is required, the concentration levels must be high enough to permit selecting aliquots, as necessary, to apply appropriate cleanup procedures. The analyst is allowed the latitude, under Section 12, to select chromatographic conditions appropriate for the simultaneous measurement of combinations of these parameters.</p><p class="depth0">1.5 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.</p><p class="depth0">1.6 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of a gas chromatograph and in the interpretation of gas chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is extracted with methylene chloride using a separatory funnel. The methylene chloride extract is dried and exchanged to hexane during concentration to a volume of 10 mL or less. The extract is separated by gas chromatography and the parameters are then measured with an electron capture detector. \2\</p><p class="depth0">2.2 The method provides a Florisil column cleanup procedure to aid in the elimination of interferences that may be encountered.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interferences</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated baselines in gas chromatograms. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned. \3\ Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 [deg]C for 15 to 30 min. Some thermally stable materials, such as PCBs, may not be eliminated by this treatment. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Thorough rinsing with such solvents usually eliminates PCB interference. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants. Store inverted or capped with aluminum foil.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.2 The use of high purity reagents and solvents helps to minimize interference problems. Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants that are co-extracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. The cleanup procedure in Section 11 can be used to overcome many of these interferences, but unique samples may require additional cleanup approaches to achieve the MDL listed in Table 1.</p><p class="depth0">4. Safety</p><p class="depth0">4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all

personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified \4-6\ for the information of the analyst.</p><p class="depth0">5. Apparatus and Materials</p><p class="depth0">5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete or composite sampling.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.1 Grab sample bottle--1cL or 1-qt, amber glass, fitted with a screw cap lined with Teflon.

Sample containers must be kept refrigerated at 4 [deg]C and protected from light during compositing. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be used. Before use, however, the compressible tubing should be thoroughly rinsed with methanol, followed by repeated rinsings with distilled water to minimize the potential for contamination of the sample. An integrating flow meter is required to collect flow proportional composites.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Glassware (All specifications are suggested.

Reagents</p><p class="depth0">6.1 Reagent water--Reagent water is defined as a water in which an interferent is not observed at the MDL of the parameters of interest.</p><p class="depth0">6.2 Acetone, hexane, isooctane, methanol, methylene chloride, petroleum ether (boiling range 30 to 60 [deg]C)--Pesticide quality or equivalent.</p><p class="depth0">6.3 Sodium sulfate--(ACS) Granular, anhydrous.

Dissolve the material in isooctane and dilute to volume in a 120-mL volumetric flask. Larger volumes can be used at the convenience of the analyst. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards can be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.</p><p class="depth0">6.5.2 Transfer the stock standard solutions into Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottles. Store at 4 [deg]C and protect from light. Stock standard solutions should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards from them.</p><p class="depth0">6.5.3 Stock standard solutions must be replaced after six months, or sooner if comparision with check standards indicates a problem.</p><p class="depth0">6.6 Quality control check sample concentrate--See Section 8.2.1.</p><p class="depth0">7. Calibration</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Establish gas chromatographic operating conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1. The gas chromatographic system can be calibrated using the external standard technique (Section 7.2) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.3).</p><p class="depth0">7.2 External standard calibration procedure:</p><p class="depth0">7.2.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask and diluting to volume with isooctane. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 [micro]L, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against the mass injected. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to amount injected (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (<10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.</p><p class="depth0">7.3 Internal standard calibration procedure--To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask. To each calibration standard, add a known constant amount of one or more internal standards, and dilute to volume with isooctane. One of the standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 [micro]L, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard. Calculate response factors (RF) for each compound using Equation 1.

where:As=Response for the parameter to be measured.Ais=Response for the internal standard.Cis=Concentration of the internal standard ([micro]g/L).Cs=Concentration of the parameter to be measured ([micro]g/</p><p class="depth0">L).
If the RF value over the working range is a constant (<10% RSD), the RF can be assumed to be invariant and the average RF can be used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to plot a calibration curve of response ratios, As/Ais, vs. RF.</p><p class="depth0">7.4 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of one or more calibration standards. If the response for any parameter varies from the predicted response by more than 15%, a new calibration curve must be prepared for that compound.</p><p class="depth0">7.5 Before using any cleanup procedure, the analyst must process a series of calibration standards through the procedure to validate elution patterns and the absence of interferences from the reagents.</p><p class="depth0">8. Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When the results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.4, 11.1, and 12.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.3 Before processing any samples, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system and glassware are under control. Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed, a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at the following concentrations in acetone: Hexachloro-substituted parameters, 10 [micro]g/mL; any other chlorinated hydrocarbon, 100 [micro]g/mL. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Using a pipet, prepare QC check samples at the test concentrations shown in Table 2 by adding 1.00 mL of QC check sample concentrate to each of four 1-L aliquots of reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3 Analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X) in [micro]g/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in [micro]g/L, for each parameter using the four results.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 2. If s and X for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The large number of parameters in Table 2 presents a substantial probability that one or more will fail at least one of the acceptance criteria when all parameters are analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6 When one or more of the parameters tested fail at least one of the acceptance criteria, the analyst must proceed according to Section 8.2.6.1 or 8.2.6.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6.1 Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6.2 Beginning with Section 8.2.2, repeat the test only for those parameters that failed to meet criteria. Repeated failure, however, will confirm a general problem with the measurement system. If this occurs, locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all compounds of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spike sample per month is required.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at the test concentration in Section 8.2.2 or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determine background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any; or, if none by (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or the test concentration in Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. In necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100 (A-B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1. \7\ If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than the test concentration in Section 8.2.2, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 2, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X') using the equation in Table 3, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S') using the equation in Table 3, substituting X' for X; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X'/T) 2.44 (100 S'/T)%. \7\</p><p class="depth0">8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.</p><p class="depth0">8.4. If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 mL of QC check sample concentrate (Sections 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (Ps) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (Ps) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (sp). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P-2sp to P+2sp. If P=90% and sp=10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).</p><p class="depth0">8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevent performance evaluation studies.</p><p class="depth0">9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practices \8\ should be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 All samples must be iced or refrigerated at 4 [deg]C from the time of collection until extraction.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection and completely analyzed within 40 days of extraction. \2\</p><p class="depth0">10.

Pour the entire sample into a 2-L separatory funnel.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Add 60 mL of methylele chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake 30 s to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the methylene chloride extract in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Add a second 60-mL volume of methylene chloride to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the Erlenmeyer flask. Perform a third extraction in the same manner.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) concentrator by attaching a 10-mL concentrator tube to a 500-mL evaporative flask. Other concentration devices or techniques may be used in place of the K-D concentrator if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 Pour the combined extract through a solvent-rinsed drying column containing about 10 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and collect the extract in the K-D concentrator. Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask and column with 20 to 30 mL of methylene chloride to complete the quantitative transfer.</p><p class="depth0">10.6 Add one or two clean boiling chips to the evaporative flask and attach a three-ball Snyder column. Prewet the Snyder column by adding about 1 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 [deg]C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15 to 20 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 1 to 2 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The dichloribenzenes have a sufficiently high volatility that significant losses may occur in concentration steps if care is not exercised. It is important to maintain a constant gentle evaporation rate and not to allow the liquid volume to fall below 1 to 2 mL before removing the K-D apparatus from the hot water bath.</p><p class="depth0">10.7 Momentarily remove the Snyder column, add 50 mL of hexane and a new boiling chip, and reattach the Snyder column. Raise the tempeature of the water bath to 85 to 90 [deg]C. Concentrate the extract as in Section 10.6, except use hexane to prewet the column. The elapsed time of concentration should be 5 to 10 min.</p><p class="depth0">10.8 Romove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of hexane. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation. Stopper the concentrator tube and store refrigerated if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extract will be stored longer than two days, it should be transferred to a Teflon-sealed screw-cap vial. If the sample extract requires no further cleanup, proceed with gas chromatographic analysis (Section 12). If the sample requires further cleanup, proceed to Section 11.</p><p class="depth0">10.9 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1000-mL graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL.</p><p class="depth0">11. Cleanup and Separation</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Cleanup procedures may not be necessary for a relatively clean sample matrix. If particular circumstances demand the use of a cleanup procedure, the analyst may use the procedure below or any other appropriate procedure. However, the analyst first must demonstrate that the requirements of Section 8.2 can be met using the method as revised to incorporate the cleanup procedure.</p><p class="depth0">11.2 Florisil column cleanup for chlorinated hydrocarbons:</p><p class="depth0">11.2.1 Adjust the sample extract to 10 mL with hexane.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.2 Place 12 g of Florisil into a chromatographic column. Tap the column to settle the Florisil and add 1 to 2 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.3 Preelute the column with 100 mL of petroleum ether. Discard the eluate and just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, quantitatively transfer the sample extract onto the column by decantation and subsequent petroleum ether washings. Discard the eluate. Just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, begin eluting the column with 200 mL of petroleum ether and collect the eluate in a 500-mL K-D flask equipped with a 10-mL concentrator tube. This fraction should contain all of the chlorinated hydrocarbons.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.4 Concentrate the fraction as in Section 10.6, except use hexane to prewet the column. When the apparatus is cool, remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with hexane. Analyze by gas chromatography (Section 12).</p><p class="depth0">12. Gas Chromatography</p><p class="depth0">12.1 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. Examples of the separations achieved by Columl 2 are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Other packed or capillary (open-tubular) columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">12.2 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.</p><p class="depth0">12.3 If the internal standard calibration procedure is being used, the internal standard must be added to the sample extract and mixed throughly immediately before injection into the gas chromatograph.</p><p class="depth0">12.4 Inject 2 to 5 [micro]L of the sample extract or standard into the gas chromatograph using the solvent-flush techlique. \9\ Smaller (1.0 [micro]L) volumes may be injected if automatic devices are employed. Record the volume injected to the nearest 0.05 [micro]L, the total extract volume, and the resulting peak size in area or peak height units.</p><p class="depth0">12.5 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.</p><p class="depth0">12.6 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, dilute the extract and reanalyze.</p><p class="depth0">12.7 If the measurement of the peak response is prevented by the presence of interferences, further cleanup is required.</p><p class="depth0">13. Calculations</p><p class="depth0">13.1 Determine the concentration of individual compounds in the sample.</p><p class="depth0">13.1.1 If the external standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the amount of material injected from the peak response using the calibration curve or calibration factor determined in Section 7.2.2.

Method 625 may be used to screen samples for 2,3,7,8-TCDD. When the screening test is positive, the final qualitative confirmation and quantification must be made using Method 613.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 14.1) \1\ for 2,3,7,8-TCDD is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may be different from that listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 Because of the extreme toxicity of this compound, the analyst must prevent exposure to himself, of to others, by materials knows or believed to contain 2,3,7,8-TCDD. Section 4 of this method contains guidelines and protocols that serve as minimum safe-handling standards in a limited-access laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">1.5 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.</p><p class="depth0">1.6 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer and in the interpretation of mass spectra. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is spiked with an internal standard of labeled 2,3,7,8-TCDD and extracted with methylene chloride using a separatory funnel. The methylene chloride extract is exchanged to hexane during concentration to a volume of 1.0 mL or less. The extract is then analyzed by capillary column GC/MS to separate and measure 2,3,7,8-TCDD. \2 3\</p><p class="depth0">2.2 The method provides selected column chromatographic cleanup proceudres to aid in the elimination of interferences that may be encountered.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interferences</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated backgrounds at the masses (m/z) monitored. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned. \4\ Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 [deg]C for 15 to 30 min. Some thermally stable materials, such as PCBs, may not be eliminated by the treatment. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Thorough rinsing with such solvents usually eliminates PCB interference. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants. Store inverted or capped with aluminum foil.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.2 The use of high purity reagents and solvents helps to mininmize interference problems. Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants that are coextracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. 2,3,7,8-TCDD is often associated with other interfering chlorinated compounds which are at concentrations several magnitudes higher than that of 2,3,7,8-TCDD. The cleanup producers in Section 11 can be used to overcome many of these interferences, but unique samples may require additional cleanup approaches \1 5-7\ to eliminate false positives and achieve the MDL listed in Table 1.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 The primary column, SP-2330 or equivalent, resolves 2,3,7,8-TCDD from the other 21 TCDD insomers. Positive results using any other gas chromatographic column must be confirmed using the primary column.</p><p class="depth0">4. Safety</p><p class="depth0">4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to

the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified \8-10\ for the information of the analyst. Benzene and 2,3,7,8-TCDD have been identified as suspected human or mammalian carcinogens.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Each laboratory must develop a strict safety program for handling 2,3,7,8-TCDD. The following laboratory practices are recommended:</p><p class="depth0">4.2.1 Contamination of the laboratory will be minimized by conducting all manipulations in a hood.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.2 The effluents of sample splitters for the gas chromatograph and roughing pumps on the GC/MS should pass through either a column of activated charcoal or be bubbled through a trap containing oil or high-boiling alcohols.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.3 Liquid waste should be dissolved in methanol or ethanol and irradiated with ultraviolet light with a wavelength greater than 290 nm for several days. (Use F 40 BL lamps or equivalent). Analyze liquid wastes and dispose of the solutions when 2,3,7,8-TCDD can no longer be detected.</p><p class="depth0">4.3 Dow Chemical U.S.A. has issued the following precautimns (revised November 1978) for safe handling of 2,3,7,8-TCDD in the laboratory:</p><p class="depth0">4.3.1 The following statements on safe handling are as complete as possible on the basis of available toxicological information. The precautions for safe handling and use are necessarily general in nature since detailed, specific recommendations can be made only for the particular exposure and circumstances of each individual use. Inquiries about specific operations or uses may be addressed to the Dow Chemical Company. Assistance in evaluating the health hazards of particular plant conditions may be obtained from certain consulting laboratories and from State Departments of Health or of Labor, many of which have an industrial health service. 2,3,7,8-TCDD is extremely toxic to laboratory animals. However, it has been handled for years without injury in analytical and biological laboratories. Techniques used in handling radioactive and infectious materials are applicable to 2,3,7,8,-TCDD.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.1.1 Protective equipment--Throw-away plastic gloves, apron or lab coat, safety glasses, and a lab hood adequate for radioactive work.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.1.2 Training--Workers must be trained in the proper method of removing contaminated gloves and clothing without contacting the exterior surfaces.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.1.3 Personal hygiene--Thorough washing of hands and forearms after each manipulation and before breaks (coffee, lunch, and shift).</p><p class="depth0">4.3.1.4 Confinement--Isolated work area, posted with signs, segregated glassware and tools, plastic-backed absorbent paper on benchtops.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.1.5 Waste--Good technique includes minimizing contaminated waste. Plastic bag liners should be used in waste cans. Janitors must be trained in the safe handling of waste.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.1.6 Disposal of wastes--2,3,7,8-TCDD decomposes above 800 [deg]C. Low-level waste such as absorbent paper, tissues, animal remains, and plastic gloves may be burned in a good incinerator. Gross quantities (milligrams) should be packaged securely and disposed through commercial or governmental channels which are capable of handling high-level radioactive wastes or extremely toxic wastes. Liquids should be allowed to evaporate in a good hood and in a disposable container. Residues may then be handled as above.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.1.7 Decontamination--For personal decontamination, use any mild soap with plenty of scrubbing action. For decontamination of glassware, tools, and surfaces, Chlorothene NU Solvent (Trademark of the Dow Chemical Company) is the least toxic solvent shown to be effective. Satisfactory cleaning may be accomplished by rinsing with Chlorothene, then washing with any detergent and water. Dishwater may be disposed to the sewer. It is prudent to minimize solvent wastes because they may require special disposal through commercial sources which are expensive.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.1.8 Laundry--Clothing known to be contaminated should be disposed with the precautions described under Section 4.3.1.6. Lab coats or other clothing worn in 2,3,7,8-TCDD work areas may be laundered.</p><p class="depth0">Clothing should be collected in plastic bags. Persons who convey the bags and launder the clothing should be advised of the hazard and trained in proper handling. The clothing may be put into a washer without contact if the launderer knows the problem. The washer should be run through a cycle before being used again for other clothing.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.1.9 Wipe tests--A useful method of determining cleanliness of work surfaces and tools is to wipe the surface with a piece of filter paper. Extraction and analysis by gas chromatography can achieve a limit of sensitivity of 0.1 [micro]g per wipe. Less than 1 [micro]g of 2,3,7,8-TCDD per sample indicates acceptable cleanliness; anything higher warrants further cleaning. More than 10 [micro]g on a wipe sample constitutes an acute hazard and requires prompt cleaning before further use of the equipment or work space. A high (10 [micro]g)

2,3,7,8-TCDD level indicates that unacceptable work practices have been employed in the past.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.1.10 Inhalation--Any procedure that may produce airborne contamination must be done with good ventilation. Gross losses to a ventilation system must not be allowed. Handling of the dilute solutions normally used in analytical and animal work presents no inhalation hazards except in the case of an accident.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.1.11 Accidents--Remove contaminated clothing immediately, taking precautions not to contaminate skin or other articles. Wash exposed skin vigorously and repeatedly until medical attention is obtained.</p><p class="depth0">5. Apparatus and Materials</p><p class="depth0">5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete or composite sampling.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.1 Grab sample bottle--1-L or 1-qt, amber glass, fitted with a screw cap lined with Teflon. Foil may be substituted for Teflon if the sample is not corrosive. If amber bottles are not available, protect samples from light. The bottle and cap liner must be washed, rinsed with acetone or methylene chloride, and dried before use to minimize contamination.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.2 Automatic sampler (optional)--The sampler must incorporate glass sample containers for the collection of a minimum of 250 mL of sample. Sample containers must be kept refrigerated at 4 [deg]C and protected from light during compositing. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be used. Before use, however, the compressible tubing should be thoroughly rinsed with methanol, followed by repeated rinsings with distilled water to minimize the potential for contamination of the sample. An integrating flow meter is required to collect flow proportional composites.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.3 Clearly label all samples as ``POISON'' and ship according to U.S. Department of Transportation regulations.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Glassware (All specifications are suggested.

Heat to 400 [deg]C for 30 min or Soxhlet extract with methylene chloride.</p><p class="depth0">5.4 Water bath--Heated, with concentric ring cover, capable of temperature control (2 [deg]C). The bath should be used in a hood.</p><p class="depth0">5.5 GC/MS system:</p><p class="depth0">5.5.1 Gas chromatograph--An analytical system complete with a temperature programmable gas chromatograph and all required accessories including syringes, analytical columns, and gases. The injection port must be designed for capillary columns.

Any equivalent column must resolve 2, 3, 7, 8-TCDD from the other 21 TCDD isomers. \16\</p><p class="depth0">5.5.3 Mass spectrometer--Either a low resolution mass spectrometer (LRMS) or a high resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) may be used. The mass spectrometer must be equipped with a 70 V (nominal) ion source and be capable of aquiring m/z abundance data in real time selected ion monitoring (SIM) for groups of four or more masses.</p><p class="depth0">5.5.4 GC/MS interface--Any GC to MS interface can be used that achieves the requirements of Section 7.1.1. GC to MS interfaces constructed of all glass or glass-lined materials are recommended. Glass surfaces can be deactivated by silanizing with dichlorodimethylsilane. To achieve maximum sensitivity, the exit end of the capillary column should be placed in the ion source. A short piece of fused silica capillary can be used as the interface to overcome problems associated with straightening the exit end of glass capillary columns.</p><p class="depth0">5.5.5 The SIM data acquired during the chromatographic program is defined as the Selected Ion Current Profile (SICP). The SICP can be acquired under computer control or as a real time analog output. If computer control is used, there must be software available to plot the SICP and report peak height or area data for any m/z in the SICP between specified time or scan number limits.</p><p class="depth0">5.6 Balance--Analytical, capable of accurately weighing 0.0001 g.</p><p class="depth0">6.

Acetone should be used as the solvent for spiking solutions; ortho-xylene is recommended for calibration standards for split injectors; and tetradecane is recommended for splitless or on-colum injectors. Analyze stock internal standards to verify the absence of native 2,3,7,8-TCDD.</p><p class="depth0">6.9.1 Prepare stock standard solutions of 2,3,7,8-TCDD (mol wt 320) and either \37\C14 2,3,7,8-TCDD (mol wt 328) or \13\C112 2,3,7,8-TCDD (mol wt 332) in an isolated area by accurately weighing about 0.0100 g of pure material. Dissolve the material in pesticide quality solvent and dilute to volume in a 10-mL volumetric flask. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards can be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.</p><p class="depth0">6.9.2 Transfer the stock standard solutions into Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottles. Store in an isolated refrigerator protected from light. Stock standard solutions should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards or spiking solutions from them.</p><p class="depth0">6.9.3 Stock standard solutions must be replaced after six months, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicates a problem.</p><p class="depth0">6.10 Internal standard spiking solution (25 ng/mL)--Using stock standard solution, prepare a spiking solution in acetone of either \13\ Cl12 or \37\ Cl4 2,3,7,8-TCDD at a concentration of 25 ng/mL. (See Section 10.2)</p><p class="depth0">6.11 Quality control check sample concentrate--See Section 8.2.1.</p><p class="depth0">7. Calibration</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Establish gas chromatograhic operating conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1 and SIM conditions for the mass spectrometer as described in Section 12.2 The GC/MS system must be calibrated using the internal standard technique.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.1 Using stock standards, prepare calibration standards that will allow measurement of relative response factors of at least three concentration ratios of 2,3,7,8-TCDD to internal standard. Each calibration standard must be prepared to contain the internal standard at a concentration of 25 ng/mL. If any interferences are contributed by the internal standard at m/z 320 and 322, its concentration may be reduced in the calibration standards and in the internal standard spiking solution (Section 6.10). One of the calibration standards should contain 2,3,7,8-TCDD at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other 2,3,7,8-TCDD concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the GC/MS system.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 [micro]L, analyze each calibration standardaccording to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area response against the concentration of 2,3,7,8-TCDD and internal standard. Calculate response factors (RF) for 2,3,7,8-TCDD using Equation 1.

Alternatively, a new calibration curve must be prepared.</p><p class="depth0">7.2 Before using any cleanup procedure, the analyst must process a series of calibration standards through the procedure to validate elution patterns and the absence of interferences from the reagents.</p><p class="depth0">8. Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.5, 11.1, and 12.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2</p><p class="depth0">8.1.3 Before processing any samples, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system and glassware are under control. Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed, a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples with native 2,3,7,8-TCDD to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing 2,3,7,8-TCDD at a concentration of 0.100 [micro]g/mL in acetone. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Using a pipet, prepare QC check samples at a concentration of 0.100 [micro]g/L (100 ng/L) by adding 1.00 mL of QC check sample concentrate to each of four 1-L aliquots of reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3 Analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X) in [micro]g/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in [micro]g/L, for 2,3,7,8-TCDD using the four results.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.5 Compare s and (X) with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 2. If s and X meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If s exceeds the precision limit or X falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for 2,3,7,8-TCDD. Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test beginning with Section 8.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of 2,3,7,8-TCDD in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.2 If the concentration of 2,3,7,8-TCDD in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at 0.100 [micro]g/L or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determine background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the

spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any; or, if none (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or 0.100 [micro]g/L.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of 2,3,7,8-TCDD. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentration in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of 2,3,7,8-TCDD. Calculate percent recovery (P) as 100(A-B)%T, where T is the known true value of the spike.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for 2,3,7,8-TCDD with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1. \11\ If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than 0.100 [micro]g/L, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 2, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of 2,3,7,8-TCDD: (1) Calculate accuracy (X') using the equation in Table 3, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S') using the equation in Table 3, substituting X' for X; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X'/T)2.44(100 S'/T)%. \11\</p><p class="depth0">8.3.4 If the recovery of 2,3,7,8-TCDD falls outside the designated range for recovery, a check standard must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 If the recovery of 2,3,7,8-TCDD fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard must be prepared and analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the complexity of the sample matrix and the performance of the laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 mL of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of 2,3,7,8-TCDD. Calculate the percent recovery (Ps) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (Ps) with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. If the recovery of 2,3,7,8-TCDD falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for 2,3,7,8-TCDD in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P) and the spandard deviation of the percent recovery (sp). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P-2sp to P+2sp. If P=90% and sp=10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).</p><p class="depth0">8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.</p><p class="depth0">9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practices \12\ should be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 All samples must be iced or refrigerated at 4 [deg]C and protected from light from the time of collection until extraction. Fill the sample bottles and, if residual chlorine is present, add 80 mg of sodium thiosulfate per liter of sample and mix well. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine. \13\ Field test kits are available for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 Label all samples and containers ``POISON'' and ship according to applicable U.S. Department of Transportation regulations.</p><p class="depth0">9.4 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection and completely analyzed within 40 days of extraction. \2\</p><p class="depth0">10. Sample Extraction</p><p class="depth0">Caution: When using this method to analyze for 2,3,7,8-TCDD, all of the following operations must be performed in a limited-access laboratory with the analyst wearing full

protective covering for all exposed skin surfaces. See Section 4.2.</p><p class="depth0">10.1 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Pour the entire sample into a 2-L separatory funnel.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Add 1.00 mL of internal standard spiking solution to the sample in the separatory funnel. If the final extract will be concentrated to a fixed volume below 1.00 mL (Section 12.3), only that volume of spiking solution should be added to the sample so that the final extract will contain 25 ng/mL of internal standard at the time of analysis.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Add 60 mL of methylene chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake 30 s to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min. with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the vmlume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the methylene chloride extract in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Add a second 60-mL volume of methylene chloride to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the Erlenmeyer flask. Perform a third extraction in the same manner.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) concentrator by attaching a 10-mL concentrator tube to a 500-mL evaporative flask. Other concentration devices or techniques may be used in place of the K-D concentrator if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">10.6 Pour the combined extract into the K-D concentrator. Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask with 20 to 30 mL of methylele chloride to complete the quantitative transfer.</p><p class="depth0">10.7 Add one or two clean boiling chips to the evaporative flask and attach a three-ball Snyder column. Prewet the Snyder column by adding about 1 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 [deg]C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15 to 20 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 1 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.</p><p class="depth0">10.8 Momentarily remove the Snyder column, add 50 mL of hexane and a new boiling chip, and reattach the Snyder column. Raise the temperature of the water bath to 85 to 90 [deg]C. Concentrate the extract as in Section 10.7, except use hexane to prewet the column. Remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of hexane. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation. Set aside the K-D glassware for reuse in Section 10.14.</p><p class="depth0">10.9 Pour the hexane extract from the concentrator tube into a 125-mL separatory funnel.

Complete the quantitative transfer with two 10-mL hexane rinses of the Erlenmeyer flask.</p><p class="depth0">10.15 Replace the one or two clean boiling chips and concentrate the extract to 6 to 10 mL as in Section 10.8.</p><p class="depth0">10.16 Add a clean boiling chip to the concentrator tube and attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column. Prewet the column by adding about 1 mL of hexane to the top. Place the micro-K-D apparatus on the water bath so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 5 to 10 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches about 0.5 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min. Remove the micro-Snyder column and rinse its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 0.2 mL of hexane.</p><p class="depth0">Adjust the extract volume to 1.0 mL with hexane. Stopper the concentrator tube and store refrigerated and protected from light if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extract will be stored

longer than two days, it should be transferred to a Teflon-sealed screw-cap vial. If the sample extract requires no further cleanup, proceed with GC/MS analysis (Section 12). If the sample requires further cleanup, proceed to Section 11.</p><p class="depth0">10.17 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1000-mL graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL.</p><p class="depth0">11. Cleanup and Separation</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Cleanup procedures may not be necessary for a relatively clean sample matrix. If particular circumstances demand the use of a cleanup procedure, the analyst may use either procedure below or any other appropriate procedure. \1 5-7\ However, the analyst first must demonstrate that the requirements of Section 8.2 can be met using the method as revised to incorporate the cleanup procedure. Two cleanup column options are offered to the analyst in this section. The alumina column should be used first to overcome interferences. If background problems are still encountered, the silica gel column may be helpful.</p><p class="depth0">11.2 Alumina column cleanup for 2,3,7,8-TCDD:</p><p class="depth0">11.2.1 Fill a 300 mm long x 10 mm ID chromatographic column with activated alumina to the 150 mm level.

Adjust the elution rate to 1 mL/min. Discard the eluate and just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, quantitatively transfer the 1.0-mL sample extract onto the column using two 2-mL portions of hexane to complete the transfer.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.3 Just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, add 50 mL of 3% methylene chloride/95% hexane (V/V) and continue the elution of the column. Discard the eluate.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.4 Next, elute the column with 50 mL of 20% methylene chloride/80% hexane (V/V) into a 500-mL K-D flask equipped with a 10-mL concentrator tube. Concentrate the collected fraction to 1.0 mL as in Section 10.16 and analyze by GC/MS (Section 12).</p><p class="depth0">11.3 Silica gel column cleanup for 2,3,7,8-TCDD:</p><p class="depth0">11.3.1 Fill a 400 mm long x 11 mm ID chromatmgraphic column with silica gel to the 300 mm level.

GC/MS Analysis</p><p class="depth0">12.1 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. Other capillary columns or chromatographic conditions may be used if the requirements of Sections 5.5.2 and 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">12.2 Analyze standards and samples with the mass spectrometer operating in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode using a dwell time to give at least seven points per peak. For LRMS, use masses at m/z 320, 322, and 257 for 2,3,7,8-TCDD and either m/z 328 for \37\Cl4 2,3,7,8-TCDD or m/z 332 for \13\C12 2,3,7,8-TCDD. For HRMS, use masses at m/z 319.8965 and 321.8936 for 2,3,7,8-TCDD and either m/z 327.8847 for \37\Cl4 2,3,7,8-TCDD or m/z 331.9367 for \13\C12 2,3,7,8-TCDD.</p><p class="depth0">12.3 If lower detection limits are required, the extract may be carefully evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen with the concentrator tube in a water bath at about 40 [deg]C. Conduct this operation immediately before GC/MS analysis. Redissolve the extract in the desired final volume of ortho-xylene or tetradecane.</p><p class="depth0">12.4 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.</p><p class="depth0">12.5 Inject 2 to 5 [micro]L of the sample extract into the gas chromatograph. The volume of calibration standard injected must be measured, or be the same as all sample injection volumes.</p><p class="depth0">12.6 The presence of 2,3,7,8-TCDD is qualitatively confirmed if all of the following criteria are achieved:</p><p class="depth0">12.6.1 The gas chromatographic column must resolve 2,3,7,8-TCDD from the other 21 TCDD isomers.</p><p class="depth0">12.6.2 The masses for native 2,3,7,8-TCDD (LRMS-m/z 320, 322, and 257 and HRMS-m/z 320 and 322) and labeled 2,3,7,8-TCDD (m/z 328 or 332) must exhibit a simultaneous maximum at a retention time that matches that of native 2,3,7,8-TCDD in the calibration standard, with the performance specifications of the analytical system.</p><p class="depth0">12.6.3 The chlorine isotope ratio at m/z 320 and m/z 322 must agree to within10% of that in the calibration standard.</p><p class="depth0">12.6.4 The signal of all peaks must be greater than 2.5 times the noise level.</p><p class="depth0">12.7 For quantitation, measure the response of the m/z 320 peak for 2,3,7,8-TCDD

and the m/z 332 peak for \13\C12 2,3,7,8-TCDD or the m/z 328 peak for \37\Cl4 2,3,7,8-TCDD.</p><p class="depth0">12.8 Co-eluting impurities are suspected if all criteria are achieved except those in Section 12.6.3. In this case, another SIM analysis using masses at m/z 257, 259, 320 and either m/a 328 or m/z 322 can be performed. The masses at m/z 257 and m/z 259 are indicative of the loss of one chlorine and one carbonyl group from 2,3,7,8-TCDD. If masses m/z 257 and m/z 259 give a chlorine isotope ratio that agrees to within 10% of the same cluster in the calibration standards, then the presence of TCDD can be confirmed. Co-eluting DDD, DDE, and PCB residues can be confirmed, but will require another injection using the appropriate SIM masses or full repetitive mass scans. If the response for \37\Cl4 2,3,7,8-TCDD at m/z 328 is too large, PCB contamination is suspected and can be confirmed by examining the response at both m/z 326 and m/z 328. The \37\Cl4 2,3,7,8-TCDD internal standard gives negligible response at m/z 326. These pesticide residues can be removed using the alumina column cleanup procedure.</p><p class="depth0">12.9 If broad background interference restricts the sensitivity of the GC/MS analysis, the analyst should employ additional cleanup procedures and reanalyze by GC/MS.</p><p class="depth0">12.10 In those circumstances where these procedures do not yield a definitive conclusion, the use of high resolution mass spectrometry is suggested. \5\</p><p class="depth0">13.

Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 An inert gas is bubbled through a 5-mL water sample contained in a specially-designed purging chamber at ambient temperature. The purgeables are efficiently transferred from the aqueous phase to the vapor phase. The vapor is swept through a sorbent trap where the purgeables are trapped. After purging is completed, the trap is heated and backflushed with the inert gas to desorb the purgeables onto a gas chromatographic column. The gas chromatograph is temperature programmed to separate the purgeables which are then detected with a mass spectrometer. \2 3\</p><p class="depth0">3. Interferences</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Impurities in the purge gas, organic compounds outgassing from the plumbing ahead of the trap, and solvent vapors in the laboratory account for the majority of contamination problems. The analytical system must be demonstated to be free from contamination under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3. The use of non-Teflon plastic tubing, non-Teflon thread sealants, or flow controllers with rubber components in the purge and trap system should be avoided.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Samples can be contaminated by diffusion of volatile organics (particularly fluorocarbons and methylene chloride) through the septum seal into the sample during shipment and storage. A field reagent blank prepared from reagent water and carried through the sampling and handling protocol can serve as a check on such contamination.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Contamination by carry-over can occur whenever high level and low level samples are sequentially analyzed. To reduce carry-over, the purging device and sample syringe must be rinsed with reagent water between sample analyses. Whenever an unusually concentrated sample is encountered, it should be followed by an analysis of reagent water to check for cross contamination. For samples containing large amounts of water-soluble materials, suspended solids, high boiling compounds or high pureeable levels, it may be necessary to wash the purging device with a detergent solution, rinse it with distilled water, and then dry it in a 105 [deg]C oven between analyses. The trap and other parts of the system are also subject to contamination; therefore, frequent bakeout and purging of the entire system may be required.</p><p class="depth0">4. Safety</p><p class="depth0">4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this methmd. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified \4-6\ for the information of the analyst.</p><p class="depth0">4.2. The following parameters covered by this method have been tentatively classified as known or suspected, human or mammalian carcinogens: benzene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, and vinyl chloride. Primary standards of these toxic compounds should be prepared in a hood. A NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be worn when the analyst handles high concentrations of these toxic compounds.</p><p class="depth0">5. Apparatus and Materials</p><p class="depth0">5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete sampling.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.1 Vial--25-mL capacity or larger, equipped with a screw cap with a hole in the center (Pierce 13075 or equivalent). Detergent wash, rinse with tap and distilled water, and dry at 105 [deg]C before use.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.2 Septum--Teflon-faced silicane (Pierce 12722 or equivalent). Detergent wash, rinse with tap and distilled water, and dry at 105 [deg]C for 1 h before use.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Purge and trap system--The purge and trap system consists of three separate pieces of equipment: A purging device, trap, and desorber. Several complete systems are now commercially available.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.1 The purging device must be designed to accept 5-mL samples with a water column at least 3 cm deep. The gaseous head space between the water column and the trap must have a total volume of less than 15 mL. The purge gas must pass though the water column as finely divided bubbles with a diameter of less than 3 mm at the origin. The purge gas must be introduced no more than 5 mm from the base of the water column. The purging device illustrated in Figure 1 meets these design criteria.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.2 The trap must be at least 25 cm long and have an inside diameter of at least 0.105 in. The trap must be packed to contain the following minimum lengths of adsorbents: 1.0 cm of methyl silicone coated packing (Section 6.3.2), 15 cm of 2,6-dyphenylene oxide polymer (Section 6.3.1), and 8 cm of silica gel (Section 6.3.3). The minimum specifications for the trap are illustrated in Figure 2.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.3 The desorber should be capable of rapidly heating the trap to 180 [deg]C. The polymer section of the trap should not be heated higher than 180 [deg]C and the remaining sections should not exceed 200 [deg]C. The desorber illustrated in Figure 2 meets these design criteria.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.4 The purge and trap system may be assembled as a separate unit or be coupled to a gas chromatograph as illustrated in Figures 3 and 4.</p><p class="depth0">5.3 GC/MS system:</p><p class="depth0">5.3.1 Gas chromatograph--An analytical system complete with a temperature programmable gas chromatograph suitable for on-column injection and all required accessories including syringes, analytical columns, and gases.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.2 Column--6 ft long x 0.1 in ID stainless steel or glass, packed with 1% SP-1000 on Carbopack B (60/80 mesh) or equivalent. This column was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 14. Guidelines for the use of alternate column packings are provided in Section 11.1.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.3 Mass spectrometer--Capable of scanning from 20 to 260 amu every 7 s or less, utilizing 70 V (nominal) electron energy in the electron impact ionization mode, and producing a mass spectrum which meets all the criteria in Table 2 when 50 ng of 4-bromo-fluorobenzene (BFB) is injected through the GC inlet.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.4 GC/MS interface--Any GC to MS interface that gives acceptable calibration points at 50 ng or less per injection for each of the parameters of interest and achieves all acceptable performance criteria (Section 10) may be used. GC to MS interfaces constructed of all glass or glass-lined materials are recommended.

The computer must have software that allows searching any GC/MS data file for specific m/z (masses) and plotting such m/z abundances versus time or scan number. This type of plot is defined as an Extracted Ion Current Profile (EICP). Software must also be available that allows integrating the abundance in any EICP between specified time or scan number limits.</p><p class="depth0">5.4 Syringes--5-mL, glass hypodermic with Luerlok tip (two each), if applicable to the purging device.</p><p class="depth0">5.5 Micro syringes--25-[micro]L, 0.006 in.

Prepare stock standard solutions in methanol using assayed liquids or gases as appropriate. Because of the toxicity of some of the compounds, primary dilutions of these materials should be prepared in a hood. A NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be used when the analyst handles high concentrations of such materials.</p><p class="depth0">6.5.1 Place about 9.8 mL of methanol into a 10-mL ground glass stoppered volumetric flask. Allow the flask to stand, unstoppered, for about 10 min or until all alcohol wetted surfaces have dried. Weigh the flask to the nearest 0.1 mg.</p><p class="depth0">6.5.2 Add the assayed reference material:</p><p class="depth0">6.5.2.1 Liquids--Using a 100-[micro]L syringe, immediately add two or more drops of assayed reference material to the flask, then reweigh. Be sure that the drops fall directly into the alcohol without contacting the neck of the flask.</p><p class="depth0">6.5.2.2 Gases--To prepare standards for any of the four halocarbons that boil below 30 [deg]C (bromomethane, chloroethane, chloromethane, and vinyl chloride), fill a 5-mL valved gas-tight syringe with the reference standard to the 5.0-mL mark. Lower the needle to 5 mm above the methanol meniscus. Slowly introduce the reference standard above the surface of the liquid (the heavy gas will rapidly dissolve in the methanol).</p><p class="depth0">6.5.3 Reweigh, dilute to volume, stopper, then mix by inverting the flask several times. Calculate the concentration in [micro]g/[micro]L from the net gain in weight. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight may be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards may be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.</p><p class="depth0">6.5.4 Transfer the stock standard solution into a Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottle. Store, with minimal headspace, at -10 to -20 [deg]C and protect from light.</p><p class="depth0">6.5.5 Prepare fresh standards weekly for the four gases and 2-chloroethylvinyl ether. All other standards must be replaced after one month, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicates a problem.</p><p class="depth0">6.6 Secondary dilution standards--Using stock solutions, prepare secondary dilution standards in methanol that contain the compounds of interest, either singly or mixed together. The secondary dilution standards should be prepared at concentrations such that the aqueous calibration standards prepared in Section 7.3 will bracket the working range of the analytical system. Secondary dilution standards should be stored with minimal headspace and should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards from them.</p><p class="depth0">6.7 Surrogate standard spiking solution--Select a minimum of three surrogate compounds from Table 3. Prepare stock standard solutions for each surrogate standard in methanol as described in Section 6.5. Prepare a surrogate standard spiking solution from these stock standards at a concentration of 15 [micro]g/mL in water. Store the solutions at 4 [deg]C in Teflon-sealed glass containers with a minimum of headspace. The solutions should be checked frequently for stability. The addition of 10 [micro]L of this solution of 5 mL of sample or standard is equivalent to a concentration of 30 [micro]g/L of each surrogate standard.</p><p class="depth0">6.8 BFB Standard--Prepare a 25 [micro]g/mL solution of BFB in methanol.</p><p class="depth0">6.9 Quality control check sample concentrate--See Section 8.2.1.</p><p class="depth0">7.

The gas chromatograph must be operated using temperature and flow rate conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1.</p><p class="depth0">7.3 Internal standard calibration procedure--To use this approach, the analyst must select three or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Some recommended internal standards are listed in Table 3.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter by carefully adding 20.0 [micro]L of one or more secondary dilution standards to 50, 250, or 500 mL of reagent water. A 25-[micro]L syringe with a 0.006 in. ID needle should be used for this operation. One of the calibration standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the GC/MS system. These aqueous standards can be stored up to 24 h, if held in sealed vials with zero headspace as described in Section 9.2. If not so stored, they must be discarded after 1 h.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.2 Prepare a spiking solution containing each of the internal standards using the procedures described in Sections 6.5 and

6.6. It is recommended that the secondary dilution standard be prepared at a concentration of 15 [micro]g/mL of each internal standard compound. The addition of 10 [micro]L of this standard to 5.0 mL of sample or calibration standard would be equivalent to 30 [micro]g/L.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.3 Analyze each calibration standard according to Section 11, adding 10 [micro]L of internal standard spiking solution directly to the syringe (Section 11.4).

Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Section 11.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.3 Each day, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system are under control.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 5% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 5% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.6 The laboratory must spike all samples with surrogate standards to monitor continuing laboratory performance. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.7 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.6.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at a concentration of 10 [micro]g/mL in methanol. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample

concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Prepare a QC check sample to contain 20 [micro]g/L of each parameter by adding 200 [micro]L of QC check sample concentrate to 100 mL of reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3 Analyze four 5-mL aliquots of the well-mixed QC check sample according to the method beginning in Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X) in [micro]g/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in [micro]g/L, for each parameter of interest using the four results.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 5. If s and X for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The large number of parameters in Table 5 present a substantial probability that one or more will fail at least one of the acceptance criteria when all parameters are analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6 When one or more of the parameters tested fail at least one of the acceptance criteria, the analyst must proceed according to Section 8.2.6.1 or 8.2.6.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6.1 Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6.2 Beginning with Section 8.2.3, repeat the test only for those parameters that failed to meet criteria. Repeated failure, however, will confirm a general problem with the measurement system. If this occurs, locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all compounds of interest beginning with Section 8.2.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 5% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing 1 to 20 samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at 20 [micro]g/L or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Analyze one 5-mL sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second 5-mL sample aliquot with 10 [micro]L of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100(A-B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 5. These acceptance criteria wer calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1. \7\ If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than 20 [micro]g/L, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 5, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recoveryof a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X') using the equation in Table 6, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S') using the equation in Table 6, substituting X' for X; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X'/T) (2.44(100 S'/T)%. \7\</p><p class="depth0">8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The frequency for the required anlaysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory. If the entire list of parameters in Table 5 must be measured in the sample in Section 8.3, the probability that the analysis of a QC check standard will be required is high. In this case the QC check standard should be routinely analyzed with the spiked sample.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 10 [micro]L of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 5 mL of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to

contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (PS) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (PS) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 5. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 As a quality control check, the laboratory must spike all samples with the surrogate standard spiking solutions as described in Section 11.4, and calculate the percent recovery of each surrogate compound.</p><p class="depth0">8.6 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (sp). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P--2sp to P + 2sp. If P=90% and sp=10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).</p><p class="depth0">8.7 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.</p><p class="depth0">9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling</p><p class="depth0">9.1 All samples must be iced or refrigerated from the time of collection until analysis. If the sample contains residual chlorine, add sodium thiosulfate preservative (10 mg/40 mL is sufficient for up to 5 ppm Cl2) to the empty sample bottle just prior to shipping to the sampling site. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine. \8\ Field test kits are available for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers having a total volume of at least 25 mL. Fill the sample bottle just to overflowing in such a manner that no air bubbles pass through the sample as the bottle is being filled. Seal the bottle so that no air bubbles are entrapped in it. If preservative has been added, shake vigorously for 1 min. Maintain the hermetic seal on the sample bottle until time of analysis.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 Experimental evidence indicates that some aromatic compounds, notably benzene, toluene, and ethyl benzene are susceptible to rapid biological degradation under certain environmental conditions. \3\ Refrigeration alone may not be adequate to preserve these compounds in wastewaters for more than seven days. For this reason, a separate sample should be collected, acidified, and analyzed when these aromatics are to be determined. Collect about 500 mL of sample in a clean container. Adjust the pH of the sample to about 2 by adding 1+1 HCl while stirring vigorously, Check pH with narrow range (1.4 to 2.8) pH paper. Fill a sample container as described in Section 9.2.</p><p class="depth0">9.4 All samples must be analyzed within 14 days of collection. \3\</p><p class="depth0">10. Daily GC/MS Performance Tests</p><p class="depth0">10.1 At the beginning of each day that analyses are to be performed, the GC/MS system must be checked to see if acceptable performance criteria are achieved for BFB. \9\ The performance test must be passed before any samples, blanks, or standards are analyzed, unless the instrument has met the DFTPP test described in Method 625 earlier in the day. \10\</p><p class="depth0">10.2 These performance tests require the following instrumental parameters:</p><p class="depth0">Electron Energy: 70 V (nominal)</p><p class="depth0">Mass Range: 20 to 260 amu</p><p class="depth0">Scan Time: To give at least 5 scans per peak but not to exceed 7 s per scan.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 At the beginning of each day, inject 2 [micro]L of BFB solution directly on the column. Alternatively, add 2 [micro]L of BFB solution to 5.0 mL of reagent water or standard solution and analyze the solution according to section 11. Obtain a background-corrected mass spectrum of BFB and confirm that all the key m/z criteria in Table 2 are achieved. If all the criteria are not achieved, the analyst must retune the mass spectrometer and repeat the test until all criteria are achieved.</p><p class="depth0">11. Sample Purging and Gas Chromatography</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph.

Open the syringe valve located on the purging device sample introduction needle.</p><p class="depth0">11.4 Allow the sample to come to ambient temperature prior to introducing it into the syringe. Remove the plunger from a 5-mL syringe and attach a closed syringe valve. Open the sample bottle (or standard) and carefully pour the sample into the syringe barrel to just short of overflowing. Replace the syringe plunger and compress the sample. Open the syringe valve and vent any residual air while adjusting the sample volume to 5.0 mL. Since this process of taking an aliquot destroys the validity of the sample for future analysis, the analyst should fill a second syringe at this time to protect against possible loss of data. Add 10.0 [micro]L of the surrogate spiking solution (Section 6.7) and 10.0 [micro]L of the internal standard spiking solution (Section 7.3.2) through the valve bore, then close the valve. The surrogate and internal standards may be mixed and added as a single spiking solution.</p><p class="depth0">11.5 Attach the syringe-syringe valve assembly to the syringe valve on the purging device.

Introduce the trapped materials to the GC column by rapidly heating the trap to 180 [deg]C while backflushing the trap with an inert gas between 20 and 60 mL/min for 4 min. If rapid heating of the trap cannot be achieved, the GC cloumn must be used as a secondary trap by cooling it to 30 [deg]C (subambient temperature, if problems persist) instead of the initial program temperature of 45 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0">11.8 While the trap is being desorbed into the gas chromatograph, empty the purging chamber using the sample introduction syringe. Wash the chamber with two 5-mL flushes of reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">11.9 After desorbing the sample for 4 min, recondition the trap by returning the purge and trap system to the purge mode. Wait 15 s then close the syringe valve on the purging device to begin gas flow through the trap. The trap temperature should be maintained at 180 [deg]C. After approximately 7 min, turn off the trap heater and open the syringe valve to stop the gas flow through the trap. When the trap is cool, the next sample can be analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">11.10 If the response for any m/z exceeds the working range of the system, prepare a dilution of the sample with reagent water from the aliquot in the second syringe and reanalyze.</p><p class="depth0">12. Qualitative Identification</p><p class="depth0">12.1 Obtain EICPs for the primary m/z (Table 4) and at least two secondary masses for each parameter of interest.

Otherwise, structural isomers are identified as isomeric pairs.</p><p class="depth0">13. Calculations</p><p class="depth0">13.1 When a parameter has been identified, the quantitation of that parameter should be based on the integrated abundance from the EICP of the primary characteristic m/z given in Table 4.

Scope and Application</p><p class="depth0">1.1 This method covers the determination of a number of organic compounds that are partitioned into an organic solvent and are amenable to gas chromatography. The parameters listed in Tables 1 and 2 may be qualitatively and quantitatively determined using this method.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 The method may be extended to include the parameters listed in Table 3. Benzidine can be subject to oxidative losses during solvent concentration. Under the alkaline conditions of the extraction step, [alpha]-BHC, [gamma]-BHC, endosulfan I and II, and endrin are subject to decomposition. Hexachlorocyclopentadiene is subject to thermal decomposition in the inlet of the gas chromatograph, chemical reaction in acetone solution, and photochemical decomposition. N-nitrosodimethylamine is difficult to separate from the solvent under the chromatographic conditions described. N-nitrosodiphenylamine decomposes in the gas chromatographic inlet and cannot be separated from diphenylamine. The preferred method for each of these parameters is listed in Table 3.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 This is a gas chromatographic/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method \2 14\ applicable to the determination of the compounds listed in Tables 1, 2, and 3 in municipal and industrial discharges as provided under 40 CFR 136.1.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 16.1) \1\ for each parameter is listed in Tables 4 and 5. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.</p><p class="depth0">1.5 Any modification to this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5. Depending upon the nature of the modification and the extent of intended use, the applicant may be required to demonstrate that the modifications will produce equivalent results when applied to relevant wastewaters.</p><p class="depth0">1.6 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer and in the interpretation of mass spectra. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is serially extracted with methylene chloride at a pH greater than 11 and again at a pH less than 2 using a separatory funnel or a continuous extractor. \2\ The methylene chloride extract is dried, concentrated to a volume of 1 mL, and analyzed by GC/MS. Qualitative identification of the parameters in the extract is performed using the retention time and the relative abundance of three characteristic masses (m/z). Quantitative analysis is performed using internal standard techniques with a single characteristic m/z.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interferences</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated baselines in the total ion current profiles. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned. \3\ Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 [deg]C for 15 to 30 min. Some thermally stable materials, such as PCBs, may not be eliminated by this treatment. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Thmrough rinsing with such solvents usually eliminates PCB interference. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants. Store inverted or capped with aluminum foil.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.2 The use of high purity reagents and solvents helps to minimize interference problems. Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants that are co-extracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 The base-neutral extraction may cause significantly reduced recovery of phenol, 2-methylphenol, and 2,4-dimethylphenol. The analyst must recognize that results obtained under these conditions are minimum concentrations.</p><p class="depth0">3.4 The packed gas chromatographic columns recommended for the basic fraction may not exhibit sufficient resolution for certain isomeric pairs including the following: anthracene and phenanthrene; chrysene and benzo(a)anthracene; and benzo(b)fluoranthene and benzo(k)fluoranthene. The gas chromatographic retention time and mass spectra for these pairs of compounds are not sufficiently different to make an unambiguous identification. Alternative techniques should be used to identify and quantify these specific compounds, such as Method 610.</p><p class="depth0">3.5 In samples that contain an inordinate number of interferences, the use of chemical ionization (CI) mass spectrometry may make identification easier. Tables 6 and 7 give characteristic CI ions for most of the compounds covered by this method. The use of CI mass spectrometry to support electron ionization (EI) mass spectrometry is encouraged but not required.</p><p class="depth0">4. Safety</p><p class="depth0">4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method have not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified \4-6\ for the information of the analyst.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 The following parameters covered by this method have been tentatively classified as known or suspected, human or mammalian carcinogens: benzo(a)anthracene, benzidine, 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, benzo(a)pyrene, [alpha]-BHC, [beta]-BHC, [delta]-BHC, [gamma]-BHC, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, N-nitrosodimethylamine, 4,4'-DDT, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Primary standards of these toxic compounds should be prepared in a hood. A NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be worn when the analyst handles high concentrations of these toxic compounds.</p><p class="depth0">5.

Sample containers must be kept refrigerated at 4 [deg]C and protected from light during compositing. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be used. before use, however, the compressible tubing should be throughly rinsed with methanol, followed by repeated rinsings with distilled water to minimize the potential for contamination of the sample.

Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occuring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.6 and 13.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements.

Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed, a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 5% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control.

This procedure is described in Section 8.5.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at a concentration of 100 [micro]g/mL in acetone. Multiple solutions may be required. PCBs and multicomponent pesticides may be omitted from this test. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source.

accuracy. For laboratories analyzing 1 to 20 samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1. The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at 100 [micro]g/L or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determine background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any; or, if none (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or 100 [micro]g/L.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100(A-B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 6. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1. \7\ If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than 100 [micro]g/L, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 6, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X') using the equation in Table 7, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S') using the equation in Table 7, substituting X' for X; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X'/T)2.44(100 S'/T)% \7\</p><p class="depth0">8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory. If the entire list of single-component parameters in Table 6 must be measured in the sample in Section 8.3, the probability that the analysis of a QC check standard will be required is high. In this case the QC check standard should be routinely analyzed with the spike sample.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 mL of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter.

The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (sp). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent interval from P-2sp to P+2sp. If P=90% and sp=10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).</p><p class="depth0">8.6 As a quality control check, the laboratory must spike all samples with the surrogate standard spiking solution as described in Section 10.2, and calculate the percent recovery of each surrogate compound.</p><p class="depth0">8.7 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of

the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.</p><p class="depth0">9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practices \8\ should be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 All sampling must be iced or refrigerated at 4 [deg]C from the time of collection until extraction. Fill the sample bottles and, if residual chlorine is present, add 80 mg of sodium thiosulfate per liter of sample and mix well. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine. \9\ Field test kits are available for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection and completely analyzed within 40 days of extraction.</p><p class="depth0">10. Separatory Funnel Extraction</p><p class="depth0">10.1 Samples are usually extracted using separatory funnel techniques. If emulsions will prevent achieving acceptable solvent recovery with separatory funnel extractions, continuous extraction (Section 11) may be used. The separatory funnel extraction scheme described below assumes a sample volume of 1 L. When sample volumes of 2 L are to be extracted, use 250, 100, and 100-mL volumes of methylene chloride for the serial extraction of the base/neutrals and 200, 100, and 100-mL volumes of methylene chloride for the acids.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Pour the entire sample into a 2-L separatory funnel. Pipet 1.00 mL of the surrogate standard spiking solution into the separatory funnel and mix well. Check the pH of the sample with wide-range pH paper and adjust to pH11 with sodium hydroxide solution.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Add 60 mL of methylene chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake for 30 s to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min. with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the methylene chloride extract in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask. If the emulsion cannot be broken (recovery of less than 80% of the methylene chloride, corrected for the water solubility of methylene chloride), transfer the sample, solvent, and emulsion into the extraction chamber of a continuous extractor and proceed as described in Section 11.3.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Add a second 60-mL volume of methylene chloride to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the Erlenmeyer flask. Perform a third extraction in the same manner. Label the combined extract as the base/neutral fraction.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 Adjust the pH of the aqueous phase to less than 2 using sulfuric acid. Serially extract the acidified aqueous phase three times with 60-mL aliquots of methylene chloride. Collect and combine the extracts in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask and label the combined extracts as the acid fraction.</p><p class="depth0">10.6 For each fraction, assemble a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) concentrator by attaching a 10-mL concentrator tube to a 500-mL evaporative flask. Other concentration devices or techniques may be used in place of the K-D concentrator if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.</p><p class="depth0">10.7 For each fraction, pour the combined extract through a solvent-rinsed drying column containing about 10 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and collect the extract in the K-D concentrator. Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask and column with 20 to 30 mL of methylene chloride to complete the quantitative transfer.</p><p class="depth0">10.8 Add one or two clean boiling chips and attach a three-ball Snyder column to the evaporative flask for each fraction. Prewet each Snyder column by adding about 1 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 [deg]C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15 to 20 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 1 mL, remove the K-D apparatus from the water bath and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min. Remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of methylene chloride. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation.</p><p class="depth0">10.9 Add another one or two clean boiling chips to the concentrator tube for each fraction and attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column. Prewet the Snyder column by adding about 0.5 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 [deg]C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in hot water. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 5 to 10 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches about 0.5 mL, remove the K-D apparatus from the water bath and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min. Remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with approximately 0.2 mL of acetone or methylene chloride. Adjust the final volume to 1.0 mL with the solvent. Stopper the concentrator tube and store refrigerated if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extracts will be stored longer than two days, they should be transferred to Teflon-sealed screw-cap vials and labeled base/neutral or acid fraction as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">10.10 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1000-mL graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL.</p><p class="depth0">11. Continuous Extraction</p><p class="depth0">11.1 When experience with a sample from a given source indicates that a serious emulsion problem will result or an emulsion is encountered using a separatory funnel in Section 10.3, a continuous extractor should be used.</p><p class="depth0">11.2 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Check the pH of the sample with wide-range pH paper and adjust to pH 11 with sodium hydroxide solution. Transfer the sample to the continuous extractor and using a pipet, add 1.00 mL of surrogate standard spiking solution and mix well. Add 60 mL of methylene chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake for 30 s to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the extractor.</p><p class="depth0">11.3 Repeat the sample bottle rinse with an additional 50 to 100-mL portion of methylene chloride and add the rinse to the extractor.</p><p class="depth0">11.4 Add 200 to 500 mL of methylene chloride to the distilling flask, add sufficient reagent water to ensure proper operation, and extract for 24 h. Allow to cool, then detach the distilling flask. Dry, concentrate, and seal the extract as in Sections 10.6 through 10.9.</p><p class="depth0">11.5 Charge a clean distilling flask with 500 mL of methylene chloride and attach it to the continuous extractor. Carefully, while stirring, adjust the pH of the aqueous phase to less than 2 using sulfuric acid. Extract for 24 h.

Daily GC/MS Performance Tests</p><p class="depth0">12.1 At the beginning of each day that analyses are to be performed, the GC/MS system must be checked to see if acceptable performance criteria are achieved for DFTPP. \10\ Each day that benzidine is to be determined, the tailing factor criterion described in Section 12.4 must be achieved. Each day that the acids are to be determined, the tailing factor criterion in Section 12.5 must be achieved.</p><p class="depth0">12.2 These performance tests require the following instrumental parameters:

If all the criteria are not achieved, the analyst must retune the mass spectrometer and repeat the test until all criteria are achieved.

Isotope Dilution</p><p class="depth0">HRGC/HRMS</p><p class="depth0">1.0 Scope and Application</p><p class="depth0">1.1 This method is for determination of tetra- through octa-chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (CDDs) and dibenzofurans (CDFs) in water, soil, sediment, sludge, tissue, and other sample matrices by high resolution gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). The method is for use in EPA's data gathering and monitoring programs associated with the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. The method is based on a compilation of EPA, industry, commercial laboratory, and academic methods (References 1-6).</p><p class="depth0">1.2 The seventeen 2,3,7,8-substituted CDDs/CDFs listed in Table 1 may be determined by this method. Specifications are also provided for separate determination of 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzofuran (2,3,7,8-TCDF).</p><p class="depth0">1.3 The detection limits and quantitation levels in this method are usually dependent on the level of interferences rather than instrumental limitations. The minimum levels (MLs) in Table 2 are the levels at which the CDDs/CDFs can be determined with no interferences present. The Method Detection Limit (MDL) for 2,3,7,8-TCDD has been determined as 4.4 pg/L (parts-per-quadrillion) using this method.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 The GC/MS portions of this method are for use only by analysts experienced with HRGC/HRMS or under the close supervision of such qualified persons. Each laboratory that uses this method must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results using the procedure in Section 9.2.</p><p class="depth0">1.5 This method is ``performance-based''. The analyst is permitted to modify the method to overcome interferences or lower the cost of measurements, provided that all performance criteria in this method are met.

The requirements for establishing method equivalency are given in Section 9.1.2.</p><p class="depth0">1.6 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">Flow charts that summarize procedures for sample preparation, extraction, and analysis are given in Figure 1 for aqueous and solid samples, Figure 2 for multi-phase samples, and Figure 3 for tissue samples.</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Extraction.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.1 Aqueous samples (samples containing less than 1% solids)--Stable isotopically labeled analogs of 15 of the 2,3,7,8-substituted CDDs/CDFs are spiked into a 1 L sample, and the sample is extracted by one of three procedures:</p><p class="depth0">2.1.1.1 Samples containing no visible particles are extracted with methylene chloride in a separatory funnel or by the solid-phase extraction technique summarized in Section 2.1.1.3. The extract is concentrated for cleanup.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.1.2 Samples containing visible particles are vacuum filtered through a glass-fiber filter. The filter is extracted in a Soxhlet/Dean-Stark (SDS) extractor (Reference 7), and the filtrate is extracted with methylene chloride in a separatory funnel. The methylene chloride extract is concentrated and combined with the SDS extract prior to cleanup.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.1.3 The sample is vacuum filtered through a glass-fiber filter on top of a solid-phase extraction (SPE) disk. The filter and disk are extracted in an SDS extractor, and the extract is concentrated for cleanup.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.2 Solid, semi-solid, and multi-phase samples (but not tissue)--The labeled compounds are spiked into a sample containing 10 g (dry weight) of solids. Samples containing multiple phases are pressure filtered and any aqueous liquid is discarded. Coarse solids are ground or homogenized. Any non-aqueous liquid from multi-phase samples is combined with the solids and extracted in an SDS extractor. The extract is concentrated for cleanup.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.3 Fish and other tissue--The sample is extracted by one of two procedures:</p><p class="depth0">2.1.3.1 Soxhlet or SDS extraction--A 20 g aliquot of sample is homogenized, and a 10 g aliquot is spiked with the labeled compounds. The sample is mixed with sodium sulfate, allowed to dry for 12-24 hours, and extracted for 18-24 hours using methylene chloride:hexane (1:1) in a Soxhlet extractor. The extract is evaporated to dryness, and the lipid content is determined.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.3.2 HCl digestion--A 20 g aliquot is homogenized, and a 10 g aliquot is placed in a bottle and spiked with the labeled compounds. After equilibration, 200 mL of hydrochloric acid and 200 mL of methylene chloride:hexane (1:1) are added, and the bottle is agitated for 12-24 hours. The extract is evaporated to dryness, and the lipid content is determined.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 After extraction, \37\Cl4-labeled 2,3,7,8-TCDD is added to each extract to measure the efficiency of the cleanup process. Sample cleanups may include back-extraction with acid and/or base, and gel permeation, alumina, silica gel, Florisil and activated carbon chromatography. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can be used for further isolation of the 2,3,7,8-isomers or other specific isomers or congeners. Prior to the cleanup procedures cited above, tissue extracts are cleaned up using an anthropogenic isolation column, a batch silica gel adsorption, or sulfuric acid and base back-extraction, depending on the tissue extraction procedure used.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 After cleanup, the extract is concentrated to near dryness. Immediately prior to injection, internal standards are added to each extract, and an aliquot of the extract is injected into the gas chromatograph. The analytes are separated by the GC and detected by a high-resolution (=10,000) mass spectrometer. Two exact m/z's are monitored for each analyte.</p><p class="depth0">2.4 An individual CDD/CDF is identified by comparing the GC retention time and ion-abundance ratio of two exact m/z's with the corresponding retention time of an authentic standard and the theoretical or acquired ion-abundance ratio of the two exact m/z's. The non-2,3,7,8 substituted isomers and congeners are identified when retention times and ion-abundance ratios agree within predefined limits. Isomer specificity for 2,3,7,8-TCDD and 2,3,7,8-TCDF is achieved using GC columns that resolve these isomers from the other tetra-isomers.</p><p class="depth0">2.5 Quantitative analysis is performed using selected ion current profile (SICP) areas, in one of three ways:</p><p class="depth0">2.5.1 For the 15 2,3,7,8-substituted CDDs/CDFs with labeled analogs (see Table 1), the GC/MS system is calibrated, and the concentration of each compound is determined using the isotope dilution technique.</p><p class="depth0">2.5.2 For 1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDD, OCDF, and the labeled compounds, the GC/MS system is calibrated and the concentration of each compound is determined using the internal standard technique.</p><p class="depth0">2.5.3 For non-2,3,7,8-substituted isomers and for all isomers at a given level of chlorination (i.e., total TCDD), concentrations are determined using response factors from calibration of the CDDs/CDFs at the same level of chlorination.</p><p class="depth0">2.6 The quality of the analysis is assured through reproducible calibration and testing of the extraction, cleanup, and GC/MS systems.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Definitions are given in the glossary at the end of this method.</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Contamination and Interferences</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware may yield artifacts and/or elevated baselines causing misinterpretation of chromatograms (References 8-9). Specific selection of reagents and purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required. Where possible, reagents are cleaned by extraction or solvent rinse.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Proper cleaning of glassware is extremely important, because glassware may not only contaminate the samples but may also remove the analytes of interest by adsorption on the glass surface.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.1 Glassware should be rinsed with solvent and washed with a detergent solution as soon after use as is practical. Sonication of glassware containing a detergent solution for approximately 30 seconds may aid in cleaning. Glassware with removable parts, particularly separatory funnels with fluoropolymer stopcocks, must be disassembled prior to detergent washing.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.2 After detergent washing, glassware should be rinsed immediately, first with methanol, then with hot tap water. The tap water rinse is followed by another methanol rinse, then acetone, and then methylene chloride.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.3 Do not bake reusable glassware in an oven as a routine part of cleaning. Baking may be warranted after particularly dirty samples are encountered but should be minimized, as repeated baking of glassware may cause active sites on the glass surface that will irreversibly adsorb CDDs/CDFs.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.4 Immediately prior to use, the Soxhlet apparatus should be pre-extracted with toluene for approximately three hours (see Sections 12.3.1 through 12.3.3). Separatory funnels should be shaken with methylene chloride/toluene (80/20 mixture) for two minutes, drained, and then shaken with pure methylene chloride for two minutes.</p><p class="depth0">4.3 All materials used in the analysis shall be demonstrated to be free from interferences by running reference matrix method blanks initially and with each sample batch (samples started through the extraction process on a given 12-hour shift, to a maximum of 20 samples).</p><p class="depth0">4.3.1 The reference matrix must simulate, as closely as possible, the sample matrix under test. Ideally, the reference matrix should not contain the CDDs/CDFs in detectable amounts, but should contain potential interferents in the concentrations expected to be found in the samples to be analyzed. For example, a reference sample of human adipose tissue containing pentachloronaphthalene can be used to exercise the cleanup systems when samples containing pentachloronaphthalene are expected.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.2 When a reference matrix that simulates the sample matrix under test is not available, reagent water (Section 7.6.1) can be used to simulate water samples; playground sand (Section 7.6.2) or white quartz sand (Section 7.3.2) can be used to simulate soils; filter paper (Section 7.6.3) can be used to simulate papers and similar materials; and corn oil (Section 7.6.4) can be used to simulate tissues.</p><p class="depth0">4.4 Interferences coextracted from samples will vary considerably from source to source, depending on the diversity of the site being sampled. Interfering compounds may be present at concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than the CDDs/CDFs. The most frequently encountered interferences are chlorinated biphenyls, methoxy biphenyls, hydroxydiphenyl ethers, benzylphenyl ethers, polynuclear aromatics, and pesticides. Because very low levels of CDDs/CDFs are measured by this method, the elimination of interferences is essential. The cleanup steps given in Section 13 can be used to reduce or eliminate these interferences and thereby permit reliable determination of the CDDs/CDFs at the levels shown in Table 2.</p><p class="depth0">4.5 Each piece of reusable glassware should be numbered to associate that glassware with the processing of a particular sample. This will assist the laboratory in tracking possible sources of contamination for individual samples, identifying glassware associated with highly contaminated samples that may require extra cleaning, and determining when glassware should be discarded.</p><p class="depth0">4.6 Cleanup of tissue--The natural lipid content of tissue can interfere in the analysis of tissue samples for the CDDs/CDFs. The lipid contents of different species and portions of tissue can vary widely. Lipids are soluble to varying degrees in various organic solvents and may be present in sufficient quantity to overwhelm the column chromatographic cleanup procedures used for cleanup of sample extracts. Lipids must be removed by the lipid removal procedures in Section 13.7, followed by alumina (Section 13.4) or Florisil (Section 13.8), and carbon (Section 13.5) as minimum additional cleanup steps. If chlorodiphenyl ethers are detected, as indicated by the presence of peaks at the exact m/z's monitored for these interferents, alumina and/or Florisil cleanup must be employed to eliminate these interferences.</p><p class="depth0">5.0 Safety</p><p class="depth0">5.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each compound or reagent used in this method has not been precisely determined; however, each chemical compound should be

treated as a potential health hazard. Exposure to these compounds should be reduced to the lowest possible level.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.1 The 2,3,7,8-TCDD isomer has been found to be acnegenic, carcinogenic, and teratogenic in laboratory animal studies. It is soluble in water to approximately 200 ppt and in organic solvents to 0.14%. On the basis of the available toxicological and physical properties of 2,3,7,8-TCDD, all of the CDDs/CDFs should be handled only by highly trained personnel thoroughly familiar with handling and cautionary procedures and the associated risks.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.2 It is recommended that the laboratory purchase dilute standard solutions of the analytes in this method. However, if primary solutions are prepared, they shall be prepared in a hood, and a NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator shall be worn when high concentrations are handled.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material safety data sheets (MSDSs) should also be made available to all personnel involved in these analyses. It is also suggested that the laboratory perform personal hygiene monitoring of each analyst who uses this method and that the results of this monitoring be made available to the analyst. Additional information on laboratory safety can be found in References 10-13. The references and bibliography at the end of Reference 13 are particularly comprehensive in dealing with the general subject of laboratory safety.</p><p class="depth0">5.3 The CDDs/CDFs and samples suspected to contain these compounds are handled using essentially the same techniques employed in handling radioactive or infectious materials. Well-ventilated, controlled access laboratories are required. Assistance in evaluating the health hazards of particular laboratory conditions may be obtained from certain consulting laboratories and from State Departments of Health or Labor, many of which have an industrial health service. The CDDs/CDFs are extremely toxic to laboratory animals. Each laboratory must develop a strict safety program for handling these compounds. The practices in References 2 and 14 are highly recommended.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.1 Facility--When finely divided samples (dusts, soils, dry chemicals) are handled, all operations (including removal of samples from sample containers, weighing, transferring, and mixing) should be performed in a glove box demonstrated to be leak tight or in a fume hood demonstrated to have adequate air flow. Gross losses to the laboratory ventilation system must not be allowed. Handling of the dilute solutions normally used in analytical and animal work presents no inhalation hazards except in the case of an accident.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.2 Protective equipment--Disposable plastic gloves, apron or lab coat, safety glasses or mask, and a glove box or fume hood adequate for radioactive work should be used. During analytical operations that may give rise to aerosols or dusts, personnel should wear respirators equipped with activated carbon filters. Eye protection equipment (preferably full face shields) must be worn while working with exposed samples or pure analytical standards. Latex gloves are commonly used to reduce exposure of the hands. When handling samples suspected or known to contain high concentrations of the CDDs/CDFs, an additional set of gloves can also be worn beneath the latex gloves.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.3 Training--Workers must be trained in the proper method of removing contaminated gloves and clothing without contacting the exterior surfaces.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.4 Personal hygiene--Hands and forearms should be washed thoroughly after each manipulation and before breaks (coffee, lunch, and shift).</p><p class="depth0">5.3.5 Confinement--Isolated work areas posted with signs, segregated glassware and tools, and plastic absorbent paper on bench tops will aid in confining contamination.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.6 Effluent vapors--The effluents of sample splitters from the gas chromatograph (GC) and from roughing pumps on the mass spectrometer (MS) should pass through either a column of activated charcoal or be bubbled through a trap containing oil or high-boiling alcohols to condense CDD/CDF vapors.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.7 Waste Handling--Good technique includes minimizing contaminated waste. Plastic bag liners should be used in waste cans. Janitors and other personnel must be trained in the safe handling of waste.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.8 Decontamination</p><p class="depth0">5.3.8.1 Decontamination of personnel--Use any mild soap with plenty of scrubbing action.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.8.2 Glassware, tools, and surfaces--Chlorothene NU Solvent is the least toxic solvent shown to be effective. Satisfactory cleaning may be accomplished by rinsing with Chlorothene, then washing with any detergent and water. If glassware is first rinsed with solvent, then the dish water may be disposed of in the sewer. Given the cost of disposal, it is prudent to minimize solvent wastes.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.9 Laundry--Clothing known to be contaminated should be collected in plastic bags. Persons who convey the bags and launder the clothing should be advised of the hazard and trained in proper handling. The clothing may be put into a washer without contact if the launderer knows of the potential problem. The washer should be run through a cycle before being used again for other clothing.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.10 Wipe tests--A useful method of determining cleanliness of work surfaces and

tools is to wipe the surface with a piece of filter paper. Extraction and analysis by GC with an electron capture detector (ECD) can achieve a limit of detection of 0.1 [micro]g per wipe; analysis using this method can achieve an even lower detection limit. Less than 0.1 [micro]g per wipe indicates acceptable cleanliness; anything higher warrants further cleaning. More than 10 [micro]g on a wipe constitutes an acute hazard and requires prompt cleaning before further use of the equipment or work space, and indicates that unacceptable work practices have been employed.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.11 Table or wrist-action shaker--The use of a table or wrist-action shaker for extraction of tissues presents the possibility of breakage of the extraction bottle and spillage of acid and flammable organic solvent. A secondary containment system around the shaker is suggested to prevent the spread of acid and solvents in the event of such a breakage.

Because the instrument is operated in the high-resolution mode, mass drifts of a few ppm (e.g., 5 ppm in mass) can have serious adverse effects on instrument performance. Therefore, a mass-drift correction is mandatory and a lock-mass m/z from PFK is used for drift correction. The lock-mass m/z is dependent on the exact m/z's monitored within each descriptor, as shown in Table 8. The level of PFK metered into the HRMS during analyses should be adjusted so that the amplitude of the most intense selected lock-mass m/z signal (regardless of the descriptor number) does not exceed 10% of the full-scale deflection for a given set of detector parameters.

For each descriptor (Table 8), monitor and record the resolution and exact m/z's of three to five reference peaks covering the mass range of the descriptor. The resolution must be greater than or equal to 10,000, and the deviation between the exact m/z and the theoretical m/z (Table 8) for each exact m/z monitored must be less than 5 ppm.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Ion Abundance Ratios, Minimum Levels, Signal-to-Noise Ratios, and Absolute Retention Times--Choose an injection volume of either 1 [micro]L or 2 [micro]L, consistent with the capability of the HRGC/HRMS instrument.

Compare the computed ratio to the theoretical ratio given in Table 9.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.1.1 The exact m/z's to be monitored in each descriptor are shown in Table 8. Each group or descriptor shall be monitored in succession as a function of GC retention time to ensure that all CDDs/CDFs are detected. Additional m/z's may be monitored in each descriptor, and the m/z's may be divided among more than the five descriptors listed in Table 8, provided that the laboratory is able to monitor the m/z's of all the CDDs/CDFs that may elute from the GC in a given retention-time window. If only 2,3,7,8-TCDD and 2,3,7,8-TCDF are to be determined, the descriptors may be modified to include only the exact m/z's for the tetra-and penta-isomers, the diphenyl ethers, and the lock m/z's.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.1.2 The mass spectrometer shall be operated in a mass-drift correction mode, using perfluorokerosene (PFK) to provide lock m/z's. The lock-mass for each group of m/z's is shown in Table 8. Each lock mass shall be monitored and shall not vary by more than 20% throughout its respective retention time window. Variations of the lock mass by more than 20% indicate the presence of coeluting interferences that may significantly reduce the sensitivity of the mass spectrometer. Reinjection of another aliquot of the sample extract will not resolve the problem. Additional cleanup of the extract may be required to remove the interferences.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.2 All CDDs/CDFs and labeled compounds in the CS1 standard shall be within the QC limits in Table 9 for their respective ion abundance ratios; otherwise, the mass spectrometer shall be adjusted and this test repeated until the m/z ratios fall within the limits specified.

Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel, and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for two minutes with periodic venting. Allow the organic layer to separate from the aqueous phase for a minimum of 10 minutes. If an emulsion forms and is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation (see note below). Drain the methylene chloride extract through a solvent-rinsed glass funnel approximately one-half full of granular anhydrous sodium sulfate (Section 7.2.1) supported on clean glass-fiber paper into a solvent-rinsed concentration device (Section 12.6).</p><p class="depth0">Note: If an emulsion forms, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration through glass wool, use of phase separation paper, centrifugation, use of an ultrasonic bath with ice, addition of NaCl, or other physical methods. Alternatively, solid-phase or other extraction techniques may be used to prevent emulsion formation. Any alternative technique is acceptable so long as the requirements in Section 9 are met.</p><p class="depth0">Experience with aqueous samples high in dissolved organic materials (e.g., paper mill effluents) has shown that acidification of the

sample prior to extraction may reduce the formation of emulsions. Paper industry methods suggest that the addition of up to 400 mL of ethanol to a 1 L effluent sample may also reduce emulsion formation. However, studies by EPA suggest that the effect may be a result of sample dilution, and that the addition of reagent water may serve the same function. Mechanical techniques may still be necessary to complete the phase separation. If either acidification or addition of ethanol is utilized, the laboratory must perform the startup tests described in Section 9.2 using the same techniques.</p><p class="depth0">12.1.3 Extract the water sample two more times with 60 mL portions of methylene chloride.

For these tests, analysis of the CS3 calibration verification (VER) standard (Section 7.13 and Table 4) and the isomer specificity test standards (Section 7.15 and Table 5) shall be used to verify all performance criteria. Adjustment and/or recalibration (Section 10) shall be performed until all performance criteria are met. Only after all performance criteria are met may samples, blanks, IPRs, and OPRs be analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">15.2 MS Resolution--A static resolving power of at least 10,000 (10% valley definition) must be demonstrated at the appropriate m/z before any analysis is performed.

These concentrations are computed based on the calibration data in Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">15.3.5 For each compound, compare the concentration with the calibration verification limit in Table 6. If only 2,3,7,8-TCDD and 2,3,7,8-TCDF are to be determined, compare the concentration to the limit in Table 6a. If all compounds meet the acceptance criteria, calibration has been verified and analysis of standards and sample extracts may proceed. If, however, any compound fails its respective limit, the measurement system is not performing properly for

that compound. In this event, prepare a fresh calibration standard or correct the problem causing the failure and repeat the resolution (Section 15.2) and verification (Section 15.3) tests, or recalibrate (Section 10).</p><p class="depth0">15.4 Retention Times and GC Resolution.</p><p class="depth0">15.4.1 Retention times.</p><p class="depth0">15.4.1.1 Absolute--The absolute retention times of the \13\C12-1,2,3,4-TCDD and \13\C12-1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDD GCMS internal standards in the verification test (Section 15.3) shall be within 15 seconds of the retention times obtained during calibration (Sections 10.2.1 and 10.2.4).</p><p class="depth0">15.4.1.2 Relative--The relative retention times of CDDs/CDFs and labeled compounds in the verification test (Section 15.3) shall be within the limits given in Table 2.</p><p class="depth0">15.4.2 GC resolution.</p><p class="depth0">15.4.2.1 Inject the isomer specificity standards (Section 7.15) on their respective columns.</p><p class="depth0">15.4.2.2 The valley height between 2,3,7,8-TCDD and the other tetra-dioxin isomers at m/z 319.8965, and between 2,3,7,8-TCDF and the other tetra-furan isomers at m/z 303.9016 shall not exceed 25% on their respective columns (Figures 6 and 7).</p><p class="depth0">15.4.3 If the absolute retention time of any compound is not within the limits specified or if the 2,3,7,8-isomers are not resolved, the GC is not performing properly.

If only 2,3,7,8-TCDD and 2,3,7,8-TCDF are to be determined, compare the concentration to the limits in Table 6a. If all compounds meet the acceptance criteria, system performance is acceptable and analysis of blanks and samples may proceed. If, however, any individual concentration falls outside of the range given, the extraction/concentration processes are not being performed properly for that compound. In this event, correct the problem, re-prepare, extract, and clean up the sample batch and repeat the ongoing precision and recovery test (Section 15.5).</p><p class="depth0">15.5.4 Add results that pass the specifications in Section 15.5.3 to initial and previous ongoing data for each compound in each matrix.

The results of the analysis of the blank must meet the specifications in Section 9.5.2 before sample analyses may proceed.</p><p class="depth0">16.0 Qualitative Determination</p><p class="depth0">A CDD, CDF, or labeled compound is identified in a standard, blank, or sample when all of the criteria in Sections 16.1 through 16.4 are met.</p><p class="depth0">16.1 The signals for the two exact m/z's in Table 8 must be present and must maximize within the same two seconds.</p><p class="depth0">16.2 The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for the GC peak at each exact m/z must be greater than or equal to 2.5 for each CDD or CDF detected in a sample extract, and greater than or equal to 10 for all CDDs/CDFs in the calibration standard (Sections 10.2.3 and 15.3.3).</p><p class="depth0">16.3 The ratio of the integrated areas of the two exact m/z's specified in Table 8 must be within the limit in Table 9, or within 10% of the ratio in the midpoint (CS3) calibration or calibration verification (VER), whichever is most recent.</p><p class="depth0">16.4 The relative retention time of the peak for a 2,3,7,8-substituted CDD or CDF must be within the limit in Table 2. The retention time of peaks representing non-2,3,7,8-substituted CDDs/CDFs must be within the retention time windows established in Section 10.3.</p><p class="depth0">16.5 Confirmatory Analysis--Isomer specificity for 2,3,7,8-TCDF cannot be achieved on the DB-5 column. Therefore, any sample in which 2,3,7,8-TCDF is identified by analysis on a DB-5 column must have a confirmatory analysis performed on a DB-225, SP-2330, or equivalent GC column. The operating conditions in Section 10.1.1 may be adjusted to optimize the analysis on the second GC column, but the GC/MS must meet the mass resolution and calibration specifications in Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">16.6 If the criteria for identification in Sections 16.1 through 16.5 are not met, the CDD or CDF has not been identified and the results may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes. If interferences preclude identification, a new aliquot of sample

must be extracted, further cleaned up, and analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">17.0 Quantitative Determination</p><p class="depth0">17.1 Isotope Dilution Quantitation--By adding a known amount of a labeled compound to every sample prior to extraction, correction for recovery of the CDD/CDF can be made because the CDD/CDF and its labeled analog exhibit similar effects upon extraction, concentration, and gas chromatography. Relative response (RR) values are used in conjunction with the initial calibration data described in Section 10.5 to determine concentrations directly, so long as labeled compound spiking levels are constant, using the following equation:

where:
Cex = The concentration of the CDD/CDF in the extract, and</p><p class="depth0">the other terms are as defined in Section 10.5.2.</p><p class="depth0">17.1.1 Because of a potential interference, the labeled analog of OCDF is not added to the sample. Therefore, OCDF is quantitated against labeled OCDD. As a result, the concentration of OCDF is corrected for the recovery of the labeled OCDD. In instances where OCDD and OCDF behave differently during sample extraction, concentration, and cleanup procedures, this may decrease the accuracy of the OCDF results. However, given the low toxicity of this compound relative to the other dioxins and furans, the potential decrease in accuracy is not considered significant.</p><p class="depth0">17.1.2 Because \13\C12-1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDD is used as an instrument internal standard (i.e., not added before extraction of the sample), it cannot be used to quantitate the 1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDD by strict isotope dilution procedures. Therefore, 1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDD is quantitated using the averaged response of the labeled analogs of the other two 2,3,7,8-substituted HxCDD's: 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDD and 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD. As a result, the concentration of 1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDD is corrected for the average recovery of the other two HxCDD's.</p><p class="depth0">17.1.3 Any peaks representing non-2,3,7,8-substituted CDDs/CDFs are quantitated using an average of the response factors from all of the labeled 2,3,7,8-isomers at the same level of chlorination.</p><p class="depth0">17.2 Internal Standard Quantitation and Labeled Compound Recovery.</p><p class="depth0">17.2.1 Compute the concentrations of 1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDD, OCDF, the \13\C-labeled analogs and the \37\C-labeled cleanup standard in the extract using the response factors determined from the initial calibration data (Section 10.6) and the following equation:

The methmd is designed to meet the survey requirements of Effluent Guidelines Division (EGD) and the National Pollutants Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) under 40 CFR 136.1 and 136.5.

Laboratories unfamiliar with the analyses of environmental samples by GC/MS should run the performance tests in reference 1 before beginning.</p><p class="depth0">2. Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Stable isotopically labeled analogs of the compounds of interest are added to a 5 mL water sample. The sample is purged at 20-25 [deg]C with an inert gas in a specially designed chamber. The volatile organic compounds are transferred from the aqueous phase into the gaseous phase where they are passed into a sorbent column and trapped. After purging is completed, the trap is backflushed and heated rapidly to desorb the compounds into a gas chromatograph (GC). The compounds are separated by the GC and detected by a mass spectrometer (MS) (references 2 and 3). The labeled compounds serve to correct the variability of the analytical technique.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Identification of a compound (qualitative analysis) is performed by comparing the GC retention time and the background corrected characteristic spectral masses with those of authentic standards.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 Quantitative analysis is performed by GC/MS using extracted ion current profile (EICP) areas. Isotope dilution is used when labeled compounds are available; otherwise, an internal standard method is used.</p><p class="depth0">2.4 Quality is assured through reproducible calibration and testing of the purge and trap and GC/MS systems.</p><p class="depth0">3. Contamination and Interferences</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Impurities in the purge gas, organic compounds out-gassing from the plumbing upstream of the trap, and solvent vapors in the laboratory account for the majority of contamination problems. The analytical system is demonstrated to be free from interferences under conditions of the analysis by analyzing blanks initially and with each sample lot (samples analyzed on the same 8 hr shift), as described in Section 8.5.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Samples can be contaminated by diffusion of volatile organic compounds (particularly methylene chloride) through the bottle seal during shipment and storage. A field blank prepared from reagent water and carried through the sampling and handling protocol serves as a check on such contamination.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Contamination by carry-over can occur when high level and low level samples are analyzed sequentially. To reduce carry-over, the purging device and sample syringe are rinsed between samples with reagent water. When an unusually concentrated sample is encountered, it is followed by analysis of a reagent water blank to check for carry-over. For samples containing large amounts of water soluble materials, suspended solids, high boiling compounds, or high levels or purgeable compounds, the purge device is washed with soap solution, rinsed with tap and distilled water, and dried in an oven at 100-125 [deg]C. The trap and other parts of the system are also subject to contamination; therefore, frequent bakeout and purging of the entire system may be required.</p><p class="depth0">3.4 Interferences resulting from samples will vary considerably from source to source, depending on the diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled.</p><p class="depth0">4. Safety</p><p class="depth0">4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each compound or reagent used in this method has not been precisely determined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. Exposure to these compounds should be reduced to the lowest possible level. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in these analyses. Additional information on laboratory safety can be found in references 4-6.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 The following compounds covered by this method have been tentatively classified as known or suspected human or mammalian carcinogens: benzene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and vinyl chloride. Primary standards of these toxic compounds should be prepared in a hood, and a NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be worn when high concentrations are handled.</p><p class="depth0">5.

The BFB spectrum shall meet the mass-intensity criteria in Table 3. All portions of the GC column, transfer lines, and separator which connect the GC column to the ion source shall remain at or above the column temperature during analysis to preclude condensation of less volatile compounds.</p><p class="depth0">5.5 Data system--shall collect and record MS data, store mass intensity data in spectral libraries, process GC/MS data and generate reports, and shall calculate and record response factors.</p><p class="depth0">5.5.1 Data acquisition--mass spectra shall be collected continuously throughout the analysis and stored on a mass storage device.</p><p class="depth0">5.5.2 Mass spectral libraries--user created libraries containing mass spectra obtained from analysis of authentic standards shall be employed to reverse search GC/MS runs for the compounds of interest (Section 7.2).</p><p class="depth0">5.5.3 Data processing--the data system shall be used to search, locate, identify, and quantify the compounds of interest in each GC/MS analysis.

It may be generated by any of the following methods:</p><p class="depth0">6.1.1 Activated carbon--pass tap water through a carbon bed (Calgon Filtrasorb-300, or equivalent).</p><p class="depth0">6.1.2 Water purifier--pass tap water through a purifier (Millipore Super Q, or equivalent).</p><p class="depth0">6.1.3 Boil and purge--heat tap water to 90-100 [deg]C and bubble contaminant free inert gas through it for approx one hour.

If compound purity is 96 percent or greater, the weight may be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the standard.</p><p class="depth0">6.5 Preparation of stock solutions--prepare in methanol using liquid or gaseous standards per the steps below. Observe the safety precautions given in Section 4.</p><p class="depth0">6.5.1 Place approx 9.8 mL of methanol in a 10 mL ground glass stoppered volumetric flask. Allow the flask to stand unstoppered for approximately 10 minutes or until all methanol wetted surfaces have dried. In each case, weigh the flask, immediately add the compound, then immediately reweigh to prevent evaporation losses from affecting the measurement.</p><p class="depth0">6.5.1.1 Liquids--using a 100 [micro]L syringe, permit 2 drops of liquid to fall into the methanol without contacting the leck of the flask. Alternatively, inject a known volume of the compound into the methanol in the flask using a micro-syringe.</p><p class="depth0">6.5.1.2 Gases (chloromethane, bromomethane, chloroethane, vinyl chloride)--fill a valved 5 mL gas-tight syringe with the compound. Lower the needle to approximately 5 mm above the methanol meniscus. Slowly introduce the compound above the surface of the meniscus. The gas will dissolve rapidly in the methanol.</p><p class="depth0">6.5.2 Fill the flask to volume, stopper, then mix by inverting several times. Calculate the concentration in mg/mL ([micro]g/[micro]L) from the weight gain (or density if a known volume was injected).</p><p class="depth0">6.5.3 Transfer the stock solution to a Teflon sealed screw-cap-bottle. Store, with minimal headspace, in the dark at -10 to -20 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0">6.5.4 Prepare fresh standards weekly for the gases and 2-chloroethylvinyl ether. All other standards are replaced after one month, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicate a change in concentration. Quality control check standards that can be used to determine the accuracy of calibration standards are available from the US Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory, Cincinnati, Ohio.</p><p class="depth0">6.6 Labeled compound spiking solution--from stock standard solutions prepared as above, or from mixtures, prepare the spiking solution to contain a concentration such that a 5-10 [micro]L spike into each 5 mL sample, blank, or aqueous standard analyzed will result in a concentration of 20 [micro]g/L of each labeled compound. For the gases and for the water soluble compounds (acrolein, acrylonitrile, acetone, diethyl ether, and MEK), a concentration of 100 [micro]g/L may be used. Include the internal standards (Section 7.5) in this solution so that a concentration of 20 [micro]g/L in each sample, blank, or aqueous standard will be produced.</p><p class="depth0">6.7 Secondary standards--using stock solutions, prepare a secondary standard in methanol to contain each pollutant at a concentration of 500 [micro]g/mL For the gases and water soluble compounds (Section 6.6), a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL may be used.</p><p class="depth0">6.7.1 Aqueous calibration standards--using a 25 [micro]L syringe, add 20 [micro]L of the secondary standard (Section 6.7) to 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mL of reagent water to produce concentrations of 200, 100, 50, 20, and 10 [micro]g/L, respectively. If the higher concentration standard for the gases and water soluble compounds was chosen (Section 6.6), these compounds will be at concentrations of 1000, 500, 250, 100, and 50 [micro]g/L in the aqueous calibration standards.</p><p class="depth0">6.7.2 Aqueous performance standard--an aqueous standard containing all pollutants, internal standards, labeled compounds, and BFB is prepared daily, and analyzed each shift to demonstrate performance (Section 11). This standard shall contain either 20 or 100 [micro]g/L of the labeled and pollutant gases and water soluble compounds, 10 [micro]g/L BFB, and 20 [micro]g/L of all other pollutants, labeled compounds, and internal standards. It may be the nominal 20 [micro]g/L aqueous calibration standard (Section 6.7.1).</p><p class="depth0">6.7.3 A methanolic standard containing all pollutants and internal standards is prepared to demonstrate recovery of these compounds when syringe injection and purge and trap analyses are compared. This standard shall contain either 100 [micro]g/mL or 500 [micro]g/mL of the gases and water soluble compounds, and 100 [micro]g/mL of the remaining pollutants

and internal standards (consistent with the amounts in the aqueous performance standard in 6.7.2).</p><p class="depth0">6.7.4 Other standards which may be needed are those for test of BFB performance (Section 7.1) and for collection of mass spectra for storage in spectral libraries (Section 7.2).</p><p class="depth0">7. Calibration</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Assemble the gas chromatographic apparatus and establish operating conditions given in table 2. By injecting standards into the GC, demonstrate that the analytical system meets the detection limits in table 2 and the mass-intensity criteria in table 3 for 50 ng BFB.</p><p class="depth0">7.2 Mass spectral libraries--detection and identification of the compound of interest are dependent upon the spectra stored in user created libraries.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.1 Obtain a mass spectrum of each pollutant and labeled compound and each internal standard by analyzing an authentic standard either singly or as part of a mixture in which there is no interference between closely eluted components. That only a single compound is present is determined by examination of the spectrum. Fragments not attributable to the compound under study indicate the presence of an interfering compound. Adjust the analytical conditions and scan rate (for this test only) to produce an undistorted spectrum at the GC peak maximum. An undistorted spectrum will usually be obtained if five complete spectra are collected across the upper half of the GC peak. Software algorithms designed to ``enhance'' the spectrum may eliminate distortion, but may also eliminate authentic m/z's or introduce other distortion.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.3 The authentic reference spectrum is obtained under BFB tuning conditions (Section 7.1 and table 3) to normalize it to spectra from other instruments.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.4 The spectrum is edited by saving the 5 most intense mass spectral peaks and all other mass spectral peaks greater than 10 percent of the base peak. This spectrum is stored for reverse search and for compound confirmation.</p><p class="depth0">7.3 Assemble the purge and trap device. Pack the trap as shown in Figure 2 and condition overnight at 170-180 [deg]C by backflushing with an inert gas at a flow rate of 20-30 mL/min. Condition traps daily for a minimum of 10 minutes prior to use.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.1 Analyze the aqueous performance standard (Section 6.7.2) according to the purge and trap procedure in Section 10. Compute the area at the primary m/z (table 4) for each compound. Compare these areas to those obtained by injecting one [micro]L of the methanolic standard (Section 6.7.3) to determine compound recovery. The recovery shall be greater than 20 percent for the water soluble compounds, and 60-110 percent for all other compounds. This recovery is demonstrated initially for each purge and trap GC/MS system. The test is repeated only if the purge and trap or GC/MS systems are modified in any way that might result in a change in recovery.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.2 Demonstrate that 100 ng toluene (or toluene-d8) produces an area at m/z 91 (or 99) approx one-tenth that required to exceed the linear range of the system. The exact value must be determined by experience for each instrument. It is used to match the calibration range of the instrument to the analytical range and detection limits required.</p><p class="depth0">7.4 Calibration by isotope dilution--the isotope dilution approach is used for the purgeable organic compounds when appropriate labeled compounds are available and when interferences do not preclude the analysis. If labeled compounds are not available, or interferences are present, internal standard methods (Section 7.5 or 7.6) are used. A calibration curve encompassing the concentration range of interest is prepared for each compound determined. The relative response (RR) vs concentration ([micro]g/L) is plotted or computed using a linear regression. An example of a calibration curve for toluene using toluene-d8 is given in figure 5. Also shown are the 10 percent error limits (dotted lines). Relative response is determined according to the procedures described below. A minimum of five data points are required for calibration (Section 7.4.4).</p><p class="depth0">7.4.1 The relative response (RR) of pollutant to labeled compound is determined from isotope ratio values calculated from acquired data. Three isotope ratios are used in this process:</p><p class="depth0">RX=the isotope ratio measured in the pure pollutant (figure 6A).</p><p class="depth0">Ry=the isotope ratio of pure labeled compound (figure 6B).</p><p class="depth0">Rm=the isotope ratio measured in the analytical mixture of the pollutant and labeled compounds (figure 6C).</p><p class="depth0">The correct way to calculate RR is: RR=(Ry-Rm) (RX+1)/(Rm-RX)(Ry+1) If Rm is not between 2Ry and 0.5RX, the method does not apply and the sample is analyzed by internal or external standard methods (Section 7.5 or 7.6).</p><p class="depth0">7.4.2 In most cases, the retention times of the pollutant and labeled compound are the same and isotope ratios (R's) can be calculated from the EICP areas, where: R=(area at m1/z)/(area at m2/z) If either of the areas is zero, it is assigned a value of one in the calculations; that is, if: area of m1/z=50721, and area of m2/z=0, then R=50721/1=50720. The m/z's are always selected such that RXRy. When there is a difference in retention times (RT) between the pollutant and labeled compounds, special precautions are required to determine the isotope ratios.</p><p class="depth0">RX, Ry, and Rm are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">RX=[area m1/z (at RT1)]/1</p><p class="depth0">Ry=1/[area m2/z (at RT2)]</p><p class="depth0">Rm=[area m1/z (at RT1)]/[area m2/z (at RT2)]</p><p class="depth0">7.4.3 An example of the above calculations can be taken from the data plotted in figure 6 for toluene and toluene-d8. For these data, RX=168920/1=168900, Ry=1/60960=0.00001640, and Rm=96868/82508=1.174. The RR for the above data is then calculated using the equation given in Section 7.4.1. For the example, RR=1.174.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Not all labeled compounds elute before their pollutant analogs.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.4 To calibrate the analytical system by isotope dilution, analyze a 5 mL aliquot of each of the aqueous calibration standards (Section 6.7.1) spiked with an appropriate constant amount of the labeled compound spiking solution (Section 6.6), using the purge and trap procedure in section 10. Compute the RR at each concentration.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.5 Linearity--if the ratio of relative response to concentration for any compound is constant (less than 20 percent coefficient of variation) over the 5 point calibration range, an averaged relative response/concentration ratio may be used for that compound; otherwise, the complete calibration curve for that compound shall be used over the 5 point calibration range.</p><p class="depth0">7.5 Calibration by internal standard--used when criteria for isotope dilution (Section 7.4) cannot be met. The method is applied to pollutants having no labeled analog and to the labeled compounds. The internal standards used for volatiles analyses are bromochloromethane, 2-bromo-1-chloropropane, and 1,4-dichlorobutane. Concentrations of the labeled compounds and pollutants without labeled analogs are computed relative to the nearest eluted internal standard, as shown in table 2.</p><p class="depth0">7.5.1 Response factors--calibration requires the determination of response factors (RF) which are defined by the following equation:</p><p class="depth0">RF=(AsxCis)/(AisxCs), where As is the EICP area at the characteristic m/z for the compound in the daily standard. Ais is the EICP area at the characteristic m/z for the internal standard.</p><p class="depth0">Cis is the concentration (ug/L) of the internal standard</p><p class="depth0">Cs is the concentration of the pollutant in the daily standard.</p><p class="depth0">7.5.2 The response factor is determined at 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 ug/L for the pollutants (optionally at five times these concentrations for gases and water soluble pollutants--see Section 6.7), in a way analogous to that for calibration by isotope dilution (Section 7.4.4). The RF is plotted against concentration for each compound in the standard (Cs) to produce a calibration curve.</p><p class="depth0">7.5.3 Linearity--if the response factor (RF) for any compound is constant (less than 35 percent coefficient of variation) over the 5 point calibration range, an averaged response factor may be used for that compound; otherwise, the complete calibration curve for that compound shall be used over the 5 point range.</p><p class="depth0">7.6 Combined calibration--by adding the isotopically labeled compounds and internal standards (Section 6.6) to the aqueous calibration standards (Section 6.7.1), a single set of analyses can be used to produce calibration curves for the isotope dilution and internal standard methods. These curves are verified each shift (Section 11.5) by purging the aqueous performance standard (Section 6.7.2). Recalibration is required only if calibration and on-going performance (Section 11.5) criteria cannot be met.</p><p class="depth0">8. Quality Assurance/Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality assurance program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability, analysis of samples spiked with labeled compounds to evaluate and document data quality, and analysis of standards and blanks as tests of continued performance. Laboratory performance is compared to established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 The analyst shall make an initial demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 The analyst is permitted to modify this method to improve separations or lower the costs of measurements, provided all performance specifications are met. Each time a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2 to demonstrate method performance.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.3 Analyses of blanks are required to demonstrate freedom from contamination and that the compounds of interest and interfering compounds have not been carried over from a previous analysis (Section 3). The procedures and criteria for analysis of a blank are described in Sections 8.5 and 11.7.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.4 The laboratory shall spike all samples with labeled compounds to monitor method performance. This test is described in Section 8.3. When results of these spikes indicate atypical method performance for samples, the samples are diluted to bring method performance within acceptable limits (Section 14.2).</p><p class="depth0">8.1.5 The laboratory shall, on an on-going basis, demonstrate through the analysis of the aqueous performance standard (Section 6.7.2) that the analysis system is in control. This procedure is described in Sections 11.1 and 11.5.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.6 The laboratory shall maintain records to define the quality of data that is generated. Development of accuracy statements is described in Sections 8.4 and 11.5.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 Initial precision and accuracy--to establish the ability to generate acceptable precision and accuracy, the analyst shall perform the following operations:</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 Analyze two sets of four 5-mL aliquots (8 aliquots total) of the aqueous performance standard (Section 6.7.2) according to the method beginning in Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Using results of the first set of four analyses in Section 8.2.1, compute the average recovery (X) in [micro]g/L and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in [micro]g/L for each compound, by isotope dilution for polluitants with a labeled analog, and by internal standard for labeled compounds and pollutants with no labeled analog.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3 For each compound, compare s and X with the corresponding limits for initial precision and accuracy found in table 5. If s and X for all compounds meet the acceptance criteria, system performance is acceptable and analysis of blanks and samples may begin. If individual X falls outside the range for accuracy, system performance is unacceptable for that compound.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The large number of compounds in table 5 present a substantial probability that one or more will fail one of the acceptance criteria when all compoulds are analyzed. To determine if the analytical system is out of control, or if the failure can be attributed to probability, proceed as follows:</p><p class="depth0">8.2.4 Using the results of the second set of four analyses, compute s and X for only those compounds which failed the test of the first set of four analyses (Section 8.2.3). If these compounds now pass, system performance is acceptable for all compounds and analysis of blanks and samples may begin. If, however, any of the same compounds fail again, the analysis system is not performing properly for the compound(s) in question. In this event, correct the problem and repeat the entire test (Section 8.2.1).</p><p class="depth0">8.3 The laboratory shall spike all samples with labeled compounds to assess method performance on the sample matrix.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 Spike and analyze each sample according to the method beginning in Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Compute the percent recovery (P) of the labeled compounds using the internal standard method (Section 7.5).</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery for each compound with the corresponding labeled compound recovery limit in table 5. If the recovery of any compound falls outside its warning limit, method performance is unacceptable for that compound in that sample. Therefore, the sample matrix is complex and the sample is to be diluted and reanalyzed, per Section 14.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 As part of the QA program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples shall be assessed and records shall be maintained. After the analysis of five wastewater samples for which the labeled compounds pass the tests in Section 8.3.3, compute the average percent recovery (P) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (sp) for the labeled compounds only. Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P-2sp to P+2sp. For example, if P=90% and sp=10%, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each compound on a regular basis (e.g. after each 5-10 new accuracy measurements).</p><p class="depth0">8.5 Blanks--reagent water blanks are analyzed to demonstrate freedom from carry-over (Section 3) and contamination.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.1 The level at which the purge and trap system will carry greater than 5 [micro]g/L of a pollutant of interest (table 1) into a succeeding blank shall be determined by analyzing successively larger concentrations of these compounds. When a sample contains this concentration or more, a blank shall be analyzed immediately following this sample to demonstrate no carry-over at the 5 [micro]g/L level.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.2 With each sample lot (samples analyzed on the same 8 hr shift), a blank shall be analyzed immediately after analysis of the aqueous performance standard (Section 11.1) to demonstrate freedom from contamination. If any of the compounds of interest (table 1) or any potentially interfering compound is found in a blank at greater than 10 [micro]g/L (assuming a response factor of 1 relative to the nearest eluted internal standard for compounds not listed in table 1), analysis of samples is halted until the source of contamination is eliminated and a blank shows no evidence of contamination at this level.</p><p class="depth0">8.6 The specifications contained in this method can be met if the apparatus used is calibrated properly, then maintained in a calibrated state.</p><p class="depth0">The standards used for calibration (Section 7), calibration verification (Section 11.5) and for initial (Section 8.2) and on-going (Section 11.5) precision and accuracy should be identical, so that the most precise results will be obtained. The GC/MS instrument in particular will provide the most reproducible results if dedicated to the settings and conditions required for the analyses of volatiles by this method.</p><p class="depth0">8.7 Depending on specific program requirements, field replicates may be collected to determine the precision of the sampling technique, and spiked samples may be required to determine the accuracy of the analysis when internal or external standard methods are used.</p><p class="depth0">9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Grab samples are collected in glass containers having a total volume greater than 20 mL. Fill sample bottles so that no air bubbles pass through the sample as the bottle is filled. Seal each bottle so that no air bubbles are entrapped. Maintain the hermetic seal on the sample bottle until time of analysis.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 Samples are maintained at 0-4 [deg]C from the time of collection until analysis. If the sample contains residual chlorine, add sodium thiosulfate preservative (10 mg/40 mL) to the empty sample bottles just prior to shipment to the sample site. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine (Reference 8). If preservative has been added, shake bottle vigorously for one minute immediately after filling.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 Experimental evidence indicates that some aromatic compounds, notably benzene, toluene, and ethyl benzene are susceptible to rapid biological degradation under certain environmental conditions. Refrigeration alone may not be adequate to preserve these compounds in wastewaters for more than seven days. For this reason, a separate sample should be collected, acidified, and analyzed when these aromatics are to be determined. Collect about 500 mL of sample in a clean container.</p><p class="depth0">Adjust the pH of the sample to about 2 by adding HCl (1+1) while stirring. Check pH with narrow range (1.4 to 2.8) pH paper. Fill a sample container as described in Section 9.1. If residual chlorine is present, add sodium thiosulfate to a separate sample container and fill as in Section 9.1.</p><p class="depth0">9.4 All samples shall be analyzed within 14 days of collection.</p><p class="depth0">10. Purge, Trap, and GC/MS Analysis</p><p class="depth0">10.1 Remove standards and samples from cold storage and bring to 20-25 [deg].</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Adjust the purge gas flow rate to 40 4 mL/min. Attach the trap inlet to the purging device and set the valve to the purge mode (figure 3). Open the syringe valve located on the purging device sample introduction needle (figure 1).</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Remove the plunger from a 5-mL syringe and attach a closed syringe valve. Open the sample bottle and carefully pour the sample into the syringe barrel until it overflows. Replace the plunger and compress the sample. Open the syringe valve and vent any residual air while adjusting the sample volume to 5.0 mL. Because this process of taking an aliquot destroys the validity of the sample for future analysis, fill a second syringe at this time to protect against possible loss of data. Add an appropriate amount of the labeled compound spiking solution (Section 6.6) through the valve bore, then close the valve.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Attach the syringe valve assembly to the syringe valve on the purging device. Open both syringe valves and inject the sample into the purging chamber.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 Close both valves and purge the sample for 11.0 0.1 minutes at 20-25 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0">10.6 After the 11 minute purge time, attach the trap to the chromatograph and set the purge and trap apparatus to the desorb mode (figure 4). Desorb the trapped compounds into the GC column by heating the trap to 170-180 [deg]C while backflushing with carrier gas at 20-60 mL/min for four minutes. Start MS data acquisition upon start of the desorb cycle, and start the GC column temperature program 3 minutes later. Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are retention times and detection limits that were achieved under these conditions. Other columns may be used provided the requirements in Section 8 can be met. If the priority pollutant gases produce GC peaks so broad that the precision and recovery specifications (Section 8.2) cannot be met, the column may be cooled to ambient or sub-ambient temperatures to sharpen these peaks.</p><p class="depth0">10.7 While analysis of the desorbed compounds proceeds, empty the purging chamber using the sample introduction syringe. Wash the chamber with two 5-mL portions of reagent water. After the purging device has been emptied, allow the purge gas to vent through the chamber until the frit is dry, so that it is ready for the next sample.</p><p class="depth0">10.8 After desorbing the sample for four minutes, recondition the trap by returning to the purge mode. Wait 15 seconds, then close the syringe valve on the purging device to begin gas flow through the trap. Maintain the trap temperature at 170-180 [deg]C. After approximately seven minutes, turn off the trap heater and open the syringe valve to stop the gas flow through the trap. When cool, the trap is ready for the next sample.</p><p class="depth0">11. System Performance</p><p class="depth0">11.1 At the beginning of each 8 hr shift during which analyses are performed, system calibration and performance shall be verified for all pollutants and labeled compounds. For these tests, analysis of the aqueous performance standard (Section 6.7.2) shall be used to verify all performance criteria. Adjustment and/or recalibration (per Section 7) shall be performed until all performance criteria are met. Only after all performance criteria are met may blanks and samples be analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">11.2 BFB spectrum validity--the criteria in table 3 shall be met.</p><p class="depth0">11.3 Retention times--the absolute retention times of all compounds shall approximate those given in Table 2.</p><p class="depth0">11.4 GC resolution--the valley height between toluene and toluene-d8 (at m/z 91 and 99 plotted on the same graph) shall be less than 10 percent of the taller of the two peaks.</p><p class="depth0">11.5 Calibration verification and on-going precision and accuracy--compute the concentration of each polutant (Table 1) by isotope dilution (Section 7.4) for those compmunds which have labeled analogs. Compute the concentration of each pollutant (Table 1) which has no labeled analog by the internal standard method (Section 7.5). Compute the concentration of the labeled compounds by the internal standard method. These concentrations are computed based on the calibration data determined in Section 7.</p><p class="depth0">11.5.1 For each pollutant and labeled compound, compare the concentration with the corresponding limit for on-going accuracy in Table 5. If all compmunds meet the acceptance criteria, system performance is acceptable and analysis of blanks and samples may continue. If any individual value falls outside the range given, system performance is unacceptable for that compound.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The large number of compounds in Table 5 present a substantial probability that one or more will fail the acceptance criteria when all compounds are analyzed. To determine if the analytical system is out of control, or if the failure may be attributed to probability, proceed as follows:</p><p class="depth0">11.5.1.1 Analyze a second aliquot of the aqueous performance standard (Section 6.7.2).</p><p class="depth0">11.5.1.2 Compute the concentration for only those compounds which failed the first test (Section 11.5.1). If these compounds now pass, system performance is acceptable for all compounds and analyses of blanks and samples may proceed. If, however, any of the compounds fail again, the measurement system is not performing properly for these compounds. In this event, locate and correct the problem or recalibrate the system (Section 7), and repeat the entire test (Section 11.1) for all compounds.</p><p class="depth0">11.5.2 Add results which pass the specification in 11.5.1.2 to initial (Section 8.2) and previous on-going data. Update QC charts to form a graphic representation of laboratory performance (Figure 7). Develop a statement of accuracy for each pollutant and labeled compound by calculating the average percentage recovery (R) and the standard deviation of percent recovery (sr). Express the accuracy as a recovery interval from R-2sr to R+2sr. For example, if R=95% and sr=5%, the accuracy is 85-105 percent.</p><p class="depth0">12. Qualitative Determination--Accomplished by Comparison of Data from</p><p class="depth0">Analysis of a Sample or Blank with Data from Analysis of the Shift</p><p class="depth0">Standard (Section 11.1). Identification is Confirmed When Spectra and</p><p class="depth0">Retention Times Agree Per the Criteria Below</p><p class="depth0">12.1 Labeled compounds and pollutants having no labeled analog:</p><p class="depth0">12.1.1 The signals for all characteristic masses stored in the spectral library (Section 7.2.4) shall be present and shall maximize within the same two consecutive scans.</p><p class="depth0">12.1.2 Either (1) the background corrected EICP areas, or (2) the corrected relative intensities of the mass spectral peaks at the GC peak maximum shall agree within a factor of two (0.5 to 2 times) for all masses stored in the library.</p><p class="depth0">12.1.3 The retention time relative to the nearest eluted internal standard shall be within 7 scans or 20 seconds, whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth0">12.2 Pollutants having a labeled analog:</p><p class="depth0">12.2.1 The signals for all characteristic masses stored in the spectral library (Section 7.2.4) shall be present and shall maximize within the same two consecutive scans.</p><p class="depth0">12.2.2 Either (1) the background corrected EICP areas, or (2) the corrected relative intensities of the mass spectral peaks at the GC peak maximum shall agree within a factor of two for all masses stored in the spectral library.</p><p class="depth0">12.2.3 The retention time difference between the pollutant and its labeled analog shall agree within 2 scans or 6 seconds (whichever is greater) of this difference in the shift standard (Section 11.1).</p><p class="depth0">12.3 Masses present in the experimental mass spectrum that are not present in the reference mass spectrum shall be accounted for by contaminant or background ions. If the experimental mass spectrum is contaminated, an experienced spectrometrist (Section 1.4) is to determine the presence or absence of the compound.</p><p class="depth0">13. Quantitative Determination</p><p class="depth0">13.1 Isotope dilution--by adding a known amount of a labeled compound to every sample prior to purging, correction for recovery of the pollutant can be made because the pollutant and its labeled analog exhibit the same effects upon purging, desorption, and gas chromatography. Relative response (RR) values for sample mixtures are used in conjunction with calibration curves described in Section 7.4 to determine concentrations directly, so long as labeled compound spiking levels are constant. For the toluene example given in Figure 6 (Section 7.4.3), RR would be equal to 1.174. For this RR value, the toluene calibration curve given in Figure 5 indicates a concentration of 31.8 [micro]g/L.</p><p class="depth0">13.2 Internal standard--calculate the concentration using the response factor determined from calibration data (Section 7.5) and the following equation:</p><p class="depth0">Concentration =(As x Cis)/(Ais x RF) where the terms are as defined in Section 7.5.1.</p><p class="depth0">13.3 If the EICP area at the quantitation mass for any compound exceeds the calibration range of the system, the sample is diluted by successive factors of 10 and these dilutions are analyzed until the area is within the calibration range.</p><p class="depth0">13.4 Report results for all pollutants and labeled compounds (Table 1) found in all standards, blanks, and samples, in [micro]g/L to three significant figures. Results for samples which have been diluted are reported at the least dilute level at which the area at the quantitation mass is within the calibration range (Section 13.3) and the labeled compound recovery is within the normal range for the Method (Section 14.2).</p><p class="depth0">14. Analysis of Complex Samples</p><p class="depth0">14.1 Untreated effluents and other samples frequently contain high levels (1000 [micro]g/L) of the compounds of interest and of interfering compounds. Some samples will foam excessively when purged; others will overload the trap/or GC column.</p><p class="depth0">14.2 Dilute 0.5 mL of sample with 4.5 mL of reagent water and analyze this diluted sample when labeled compound recovery is outside the range given in Table 5. If the recovery remains outside of the range for this diluted sample, the aqueous performance standard shall be analyzed (Section 11) and calibration verified (Section 11.5). If the recovery for the labeled compmund in the aqueous performance standard is outside the range given in Table 5, the analytical system is out of control. In this case, the instrumelt shall be repaired, the performance specifications in Section 11 shall be met, and the analysis of the undiluted sample shall be repeated. If the recovery for the aqueous performance standard is within the range given in Table 5, the method does not work on the sample being analyzed and the result may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.</p><p class="depth0">14.3 Reverse search computer programs can misinterpret the spectrum of chromatographically unresolved pollutant and labeled compound pairs with overlapping spectra when a high level of the pollutant is present. Examine each chromatogram for peaks greater than the height of the internal standard peaks. These peaks can obscure the compounds of interest.</p><p class="depth0">15. Method Performance</p><p class="depth0">15.1 The specifications for this method were taken from the inter-laboratory validation of EPA Method 624 (reference 9). Method 1624 has been shown to yield slightly better performance on treated effluents than Method 624. Additional method performance data can be found in Reference 10.</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">1. ``Performance Tests for the Evaluation of Computerized Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry Equipment and Laboratories,'' USEPA, EMSL/Cincinnati, OH 45268, EPA-600/4-80-025 (April 1980).</p><p class="depth0">2.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]</p><p class="depth0">Method 1625 Revision B--Semivolatile Organic Compounds by Isotope</p><p class="depth0">Dilution GC/MS</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope and Application</p><p class="depth0">1.1 This method is designed to determine the semivolatile toxic organic pollutants associated with the 1976 Consent Decree and additional compounds amenable to extraction and analysis by capillary column gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS).</p><p class="depth0">1.2 The chemical compounds listed in Tables 1 and 2 may be determined in municipal and industrial discharges by this method. The method is designed to meet the survey

requirements of Effluent Guidelines Division (EGD) and the National Pollutants Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) under 40 CFR 136.1. Any modifications of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as major modifications subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 The detection limit of this method is usually dependent on the level of interferences rather than instrumental limitations. The limits listed in Tables 3 and 4 represent the minimum quantity that can be detected with no interferences present.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 The GC/MS portions of this method are for use only by analysts experienced with GC/MS or under the close supervision of such qualified persons. Laboratories unfamiliar with analyses of environmental samples by GC/MS should run the performance tests in reference 1 before beginning.</p><p class="depth0">2. Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Stable isotopically labeled analogs of the compounds of interest are added to a one liter wastewater sample. The sample is extracted at pH 12-13, then at pH <2 with methylene chloride using continuous extraction techniques. The extract is dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated to a volume of one mL. An internal standard is added to the extract, and the extract is injected into the gas chromatograph (GC). The compounds are separated by GC and detected by a mass spectrometer (MS). The labeled compounds serve to correct the variability of the analytical technique.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Identification of a compound (qualitative analysis) is performed by comparing the GC retention time and background corrected characteristic spectral masses with those of authentic standards.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 Quantitative analysis is performed by GC/MS using extracted ion current profile (EICP) areas. Isotope dilution is used when labeled compounds are available; otherwise, an internal standard method is used.</p><p class="depth0">2.4 Quality is assured through reproducible calibration and testing of the extraction and GC/MS systems.</p><p class="depth0">3. Contamination and Interferences</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware may yield artifacts and/or elevated baselines causing misinterpretation of chromatograms and spectra. All materials shall be demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of analysis by running method blanks initially and with each sample lot (samples started through the extraction process on a given 8 hr shift, to a maximum of 20). Specific selection of reagents and purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required. Glassware and, where possible, reagents are cleaned by solvent rinse and baking at 450 [deg]C for one hour minimum.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Interferences coextracted from samples will vary considerably from source to source, depending on the diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being samples.</p><p class="depth0">4. Safety</p><p class="depth0">4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each compound or reagent used in this method has not been precisely determined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. Exposure to these compounds should be reduced to the lowest possible level. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in these analyses. Additional information on laboratory safety can be found in references 2-4.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 The following compounds covered by this method have been tentatively classified as known or suspected human or mammalian carcinogens: benzidine benzo(a)anthracene, 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, benzo(a)pyrene, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, N-nitrosodimethylamine, and [beta]-naphtylamine. Primary standards of these compounds shall be prepared in a hood, and a NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be worn when high concentrations are handled.</p><p class="depth0">5. Apparatus and Materials</p><p class="depth0">5.1 Sampling equipment for discrete or composite sampling.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.1 Sample bottle, amber glass, 1.1 liters minimum. If amber bottles are not available, samples shall be protected from light. Bottles are detergent water washed, then solvent rinsed or baked at 450 [deg]C for one hour minimum before use.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.2 Bottle caps--threaded to fit sample bottles. Caps are lined with Teflon. Aluminum foil may be substituted if the sample is not corrosive. Liners are detergent water washed, then reagent water (Section 6.5) and solvent rinsed, and baked at approximately 200 [deg]C for one hour minimum before use.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.3 Compositing equipment--automatic or manual compositing system incorporating glass containers for collection of a minimum 1.1 liters. Sample containers are kept at 0 to 4 [deg]C during sampling. Glass or Teflon tubing only shall be used. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be used in the pump only. Before use, the tubing is thoroughly rinsed with methanol, followed by repeated rinsings with reagent water (Section 6.5) to minimize sample contamination. An integrating flow meter is used to collect proportional composite samples.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Continuous liquid-liquid extractor--Teflon or glass conncecting joints and stopcocks without lubrication (Hershberg-Wolf Extractor) one liter capacity, Ace Glass 6841-10, or equivalent.</p><p class="depth0">5.3 Drying column--15 to 20 mm i.d.

The spectrum shall meet the mass-intensity criteria in Table 5 (reference 5). The mass spectrometer shall be interfaced to the GC such that the end of the capillary column terminates within one centimeter of the ion source but does not intercept the electron or ion beams. All portions of the column which connect the GC to the ion source shall remain at or above the column temperature during analysis to preclude condensation of less volatile compounds.</p><p class="depth0">5.10 Data system--shall collect and record MS data, store mass-intensity data in spectral libraries, process GC/MS data, generate reports, and shall compute and record response factors.</p><p class="depth0">5.10.1 Data acquisition--mass spectra shall be collected continuously throughout the analysis and stored on a mass storage device.</p><p class="depth0">5.10.2 Mass spectral libraries--user created libraries containing mass spectra obtained from analysis of authentic standards shall be employed to reverse search GC/MS runs for the compounds of interest (Section 7.2).</p><p class="depth0">5.10.3 Data processing--the data system shall be used to search, locate, identify, and quantify the compounds of interest in each GC/MS analysis. Software routines shall be employed to compute retention times and peak areas. Displays of spectra, mass chromatograms, and library comparisons are required to verify results.</p><p class="depth0">5.10.4 Response factors and multipoint calibrations--the data system shall be used to record and maintain lists of response factors (response ratios for isotope dilution) and multipoint calibration curves (Section 7). Computations of relative standard deviation (coefficient of variation) are useful for testing calibration linearity. Statistics on initial (Section 8.2) and on-going (Section 12.7) performance shall be computed and maintained.</p><p class="depth0">6. Reagents and Standards</p><p class="depth0">6.1 Sodium hydroxide--reagent grade, 6N in reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">6.2 Sulfuric acid--reagent grade, 6N in reagent water.</p><p class="depth0">6.3 Sodium sulfate--reagent grade, granular anhydrous, rinsed with methylene chloride (20 mL/g) and conditioned at 450 [deg]C for one hour minimum.</p><p class="depth0">6.4 Methylene chloride--distilled in glass (Burdick and Jackson, or equivalent).</p><p class="depth0">6.5 Reagent water--water in which the compounds of interest and interfering compounds are not detected by this method.</p><p class="depth0">6.6 Standard solutions--purchased as solutions or mixtures with certification to their purity, concentration, and authenticity, or prepared from materials of known purity and composition. If compound purity is 96 percent or greater, the weight may be used without correction to compute the concentration of the standard. When not being used, standards are stored in the dark at -20 to -10 [deg]C in screw-capped vials with Teflon-lined lids. A mark is placed on the vial at the level of the solution so that solvent evaporation loss can be detected. The vials are brought to room temperature prior to use. Any precipitate is redissolved and solvent is added if solvent loss has occurred.</p><p class="depth0">6.7 Preparation of stock solutions--prepare in methylene chloride, benzene, p-dioxane, or a mixture of these solvents per the steps below. Observe the safety precautions in Section 4. The large number of labeled and unlabeled acid, base/neutral, and Appendix C compounds used for combined

calibration (Section 7) and calibration verification (12.5) require high concentratimns (approx 40 mg/mL) when individual stock solutions are prepared, so that dilutions of mixtures will permit calibration with all compounds in a single set of solutions. The working range for most compounds is 10-200 [micro]g/mL. Compounds with a reduced MS response may be prepared at higher concentrations.</p><p class="depth0">6.7.1 Dissolve an appropriate amount of assayed reference material in a suitable solvent. For example, weigh 400 mg naphthalene in a 10 mL ground glass stoppered volumetric flask and fill to the mark with benzene.

This will produce calibration solutions of nominal 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 [micro]g/mL of the pollutants and a constant nominal 100 [micro]g/mL of the labeled compounds. Spike each solution with 10 [micro]L of the internal standard solution (Section 6.10). These solutions permit the relative response (labeled to unlabeled) to be measured as a function of concentration (Section 7.4).</p><p class="depth0">6.14 Precision and recovery standard--used for determination of initial (Section 8.2) and on-going (Section 12.7) precision and recovery.

Calibration</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Assemble the GC/MS and establish the operating conditions in Table 3. Analyze standards per the procedure in Section 11 to demonstrate that the analytical system meets the detection limits in Tables 3 and 4, and the mass-intensity criteria in Table 5 for 50 ng DFTPP.</p><p class="depth0">7.2 Mass spectral libraries--detection and identification of compounds of interest are dependent upon spectra stored in user created libraries.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.1 Obtain a mass spectrum of each pollutant, labeled compound, and the internal standard by analyzing an authentic standard either singly or as part of a mixture in which there is no interference between closely eluted components. That only a single compound is present is determined by examination of the spectrum. Fragments not attributable to the compound under study indicate the presence of an interfering compound.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.2 Adjust the analytical conditions and scan rate (for this test only) to produce an undistorted spectrum at the GC peak maximum. An undistorted spectrum will usually be obtained if five complete spectra are collected across the upper half of the GC peak. Software algorithms designed to ``enhance'' the spectrum may eliminate distortion, but may also eliminate authentic masses or introduce other distortion.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.3 The authentic reference spectrum is obtained under DFTPP tuning conditions (Section 7.1 and Table 5) to normalize it to spectra from other instruments.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.4 The spectrum is edited by saving the 5 most intense mass spectral peaks and all other mass spectral peaks greater than 10 percent of the base peak. This edited spectrum is stored for reverse search and for compound confirmation.</p><p class="depth0">7.3 Analytical range--demonstrate that 20 ng anthracene or phenanthrene produces an area at m/z 178 approx one-tenth that required to exceed the linear range of the system. The exact value must be determined by experience for each instrument. It is used to match the calibration range of the instrument to the analytical range and detection limits required, and to diagnose instrument

sensitivity problems (Section 15.4). The 20 ug/mL calibration standard (Section 6.13) can be used to demonstrate this performance.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.1 Polar compound detection--demonstrate that unlabeled pentachlorophenol and benzidine are detectable at the 50 [micro]g/mL level (per all criteria in Section 13). The 50 [micro]g/mL calibration standard (Section 6.13) can be used to demonstrate this performance.</p><p class="depth0">7.4 Calibration with isotope dilution--isotope dilution is used when (1) labeled compounds are available, (2) interferences do not preclude its use, and (3) the quantitation mass extracted ion current profile (EICP) area for the compound is in the calibration range. If any of these conditions preclude isotope dilution, internal standard methods (Section 7.5 or 7.6) are used.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.1 A calibration curve encompassing the concentration range is prepared for each compound to be determined. The relative response (pollutant to labeled) vs concentration in standard solutions is plotted or computed using a linear regression. The example in Figure 1 shows a calibration curve for phenol using phenol-d5 as the isotopic diluent. Also shown are the 10 percent error limits (dotted lines). Relative Reponse (RR) is determined according to the procedures described below. A minimum of five data points are employed for calibration.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.2 The relative response of a pollutant to its labeled analog is determined from isotope ratio values computed from acquired data. Three isotope ratios are used in this process:</p><p class="depth0">RX = the isotope ratio measured for the pure pollutant.</p><p class="depth0">Ry = the isotope ratio measured for the labeled compound.</p><p class="depth0">Rm = the isotope ratio of an analytical mixture of pollutant and labeled compounds.</p><p class="depth0">The m/z's are selected such that RXRy. If Rm is not between 2Ry and 0.5RX, the method does not apply and the sample is analyzed by internal or external standard methods.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.3 Capillary columns usually separate the pollutant-labeled pair, with the labeled compound eluted first (Figure 2). For this case, RX = [area m1/z]/1, at the retention time of the pollutant (RT2). Ry = 1/[area m2/z, at the retention time of the labeled compound RT1). Rm = [area at m1/z (at RT2)]/[area at RT1)], as measured in the mixture of the pollutant and labeled compounds (Figure 2), and RR = Rm.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.4 Special precautions are taken when the pollutant-labeled pair is not separated, or when another labeled compound with interfering spectral masses overlaps the pollutant (a case which can occur with isomeric compounds). In this case, it is necessary to determine the respective contributions of the pollutant and labeled compounds to the respective EICP areas. If the peaks are separated well enough to permit the data system or operator to remove the contributions of the compounds to each other, the equations in Section 7.4.3 apply. This usually occurs when the height of the valley between the two GC peaks at the same m/z is less than 10 percent of the height of the shorter of the two peaks. If significant GC and spectral overlap occur, RR is computed using the following equation:</p><p class="depth0">RR = (Ry - Rm) (RX + 1)/(Rm - RX) (Ry + 1), where RX is measured as shown in Figure 3A, Ry is measured as shown in Figure 3B, and Rm is measured as shown in Figure 3C. For example, RX = 46100/4780 = 9.644, Ry = 2650/43600 = 0.0608, Rm = 49200/48300 = 1.019. amd RR = 1.114.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.5 To calibrate the analytical system by isotope dilution, analyze a 1.0 [micro]L aliquot of each of the calibration standards (Section 6.13) using the procedure in Section 11. Compute the RR at each concentration.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.6 Linearity--if the ratio of relative response to concentration for any compound is constant (less than 20 percent coefficient of variation) over the 5 point calibration range, and averaged relative response/concentration ratio may be used for that compound; otherwise, the complete calibration curve for that compound shall be used over the 5 point calibration range.</p><p class="depth0">7.5 Calibration by internal standard--used when criteria for istope dilution (Section 7.4) cannot be met. The internal standard to be used for both acid and base/neutral analyses is 2,2'-difluorobiphenyl. The internal standard method is also applied to determination of compounds having no labeled analog, and to measurement of labeled compounds for intra-laboratory statistics (Sections 8.4 and 12.7.4).</p><p class="depth0">7.5.1 Response factors--calibration requires the determination of response factors (RF) which are defined by the following equation:</p><p class="depth0">RF = (As x Cis)/(Ais x Cs), where</p><p class="depth0">As is the area of the characteristic mass for the compmund in the daily standard</p><p class="depth0">Ais is the area of the characteristic mass for the internal standard</p><p class="depth0">Cis is the concentration of the internal standard ([micro]g/mL)</p><p class="depth0">Cs is the concentration of the compound in the daily standard ([micro]g/mL)</p><p class="depth0">7.5.1.1 The response factor is determined for at least five concentrations appropriate to the response of each compound (Section 6.13); nominally, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 [micro]g/mL. The amount of internal standard added to each extract is the same (100 [micro]g/mL) so that Cis remains constant. The RF is plotted vs concentration for each compound in the standard (Cs) to produce a calibration curve.</p><p class="depth0">7.5.1.2 Linearity--if the response factor (RF) for any compound is constant (less than 35 percent coefficient of variation) over the 5

point calibration range, an averaged response factor may be used for that compound; otherwise, the complete calibration curve for that compound shall be used over the 5 point range.</p><p class="depth0">7.6 Combined calibration--by using calibration solutions (Section 6.13) containing the pollutants, labeled compounds, and the internal standard, a single set of analyses can be used to produce calibration curves for the isotope dilution and internal standard methods. These curves are verified each shift (Section 12.5) by analyzing the 100 [micro]g/mL calibration standard (Section 6.13). Recalibration is required only if calibration verification (Section 12.5) criteria cannot be met.</p><p class="depth0">8. Quality Assurance/Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality assurance program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability, analysis of samples spiked with labeled compounds to evaluate and document data quality, and analysis of standards and blanks as tests of continued performance. Laboratory performance is compared to established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 The analyst shall make an initial demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 The analyst is permitted to modify this method to improve separations or lower the costs of measurements, provided all performance specifications are met. Each time a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2 to demonstrate method performance.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.3 Analyses of blanks are required to demonstrate freedom from contamination. The procedures and criteria for analysis of a blank are described in Section 8.5.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.4 The laboratory shall spike all samples with labeled compounds to monitor method performance. This test is described in Section 8.3. When results of these spikes indicate atypical method performance for samples, the samples are diluted to bring method performance within acceptable limits (Section 15).</p><p class="depth0">8.1.5 The laboratory shall, on an on-going basis, demonstrate through calibration verification and the analysis of the precision and recovery standard (Section 6.14) that the analysis system is in control.

Development of accuracy statements is described in Section 8.4.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 Initial precision and accuracy--to establish the ability to generate acceptable precision and accuracy, the analyst shall perform the following operations:</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 Extract, concentrate, and analyze two sets of four one-liter aliquots (8 aliquots total) of the precision and recovery standard (Section 6.14) according to the procedure in Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Using results of the first set of four analyses, compute the average recovery (X) in [micro]g/mL and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in [thetas]g/[micro]L for each compound, by isotope dilution for pollutants with a labeled analog, and by internal standard for labeled compounds and pollutants with no labeled analog.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3 For each compound, compare s and X with the corresponding limits for initial precision and accuracy in Table 8. If s and X for all compounds meet the acceptance criteria, system performance is acceptable and analysis of blanks and samples may begin. If, however, any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X falls outside the range for accuracy, system performance is unacceptable for that compound.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The large number of compounds in Table 8 present a substantial probability that one or more will fail the acceptance criteria when all compounds are analyzed.

If these compounds now pass, system performance is acceptable for all compounds and analysis of blanks and samples may begin. If, however, any of the same compoulds fail again, the analysis system is not performing properly for these compounds. In this event, correct the problem and repeat the entire test (Section 8.2.1).</p><p class="depth0">8.3 The laboratory shall spike all samples with labeled compounds to assess method performance on the sample matrix.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 Analyze each sample according to the method in Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Compute the percent recovery (P) of the labeled compounds using the internal standard methmd (Section 7.5).</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Compare the labeled compound recovery for each compound with the corresponding limits in Table 8. If the recovery of any compounds falls outside its warning limit, method performance is unacceptable for that compound in that sample, Therefore, the sample is complex and is to be diluted and reanalyzed per Section 15.4.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 As part of the QA program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples shall be assessed and records shall

be maintained. After the analysis of five wastewater samples for which the labeled compounds pass the tests in Section 8.3, compute the average percent recovery (P) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (sp) for the labeled compounds only. Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P--2 sp to P+2sp. For example, if P=90% and sp=10%, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-100%. Update the accuracy assessment for each compound on a regular basis (e.g. after each 5-10 new accuracy measurements).</p><p class="depth0">8.5 Blanks--reagent water blanks are analyzed to demonstrate freedom from contamination.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.1 Extract and concentrate a blank with each sample lot (samples started through the extraction process on the same 8 hr shift, to a maximum of 20 samples). Analyze the blank immediately after analysis of the precision and recovery standard (Section 6.14) to demonstrate freedom from contamination.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.2 If any of the compounds of interest (Tables 1 and 2) or any potentially interfering compound is found in a blank at greater than 10 [micro]g/L (assuming a response factor of 1 relative to the internal standard for compounds not listed in Tables 1 and 2), analysis of samples is halted until the source of contamination is eliminated and a blank shows no evidence of contamination at this level.</p><p class="depth0">8.6 The specifications contained in this method can be met if the apparatus used is calibrated properly, then maintained in a calibrated state. The standards used for calibration (Section 7), calibration verification (Section 12.5), and for initial (Section 8.2) and on-going (Section 12.7) precision and recovery should be identical, so that the most precise results will be obtained. The GC/MS instrument in particular will provide the most reproducible results if dedicated to the settings and conditions required for the analysis of semi-volatiles by this method.</p><p class="depth0">8.7 Depending on specific program requirements, field replicates may be collected to determine the precision of the sampling technique, and spiked samples may be required to determine the accuracy of the analysis when internal or external standard methods are used.</p><p class="depth0">9.

If the experimental mass spectrum is contaminated, an experienced spectrometrist (Section 1.4) is to determine the presence or absence of the cmmpound.</p><p class="depth0">14. Quantitative Determination</p><p class="depth0">14.1 Isotope dilution--by adding a known amount of a labeled compound to every sample prior to extraction, correction for recovery of the pollutant can be made because the pollutant and its labeled analog exhibit the same effects upon extraction, concentration, and gas chromatography. Relative response (RR) values for mixtures are used in conjunction with calibration curves described in

Section 7.4 to determine concentrations directly, so long as labeled compound spiking levels are constant. For the phenml example given in Figure 1 (Section 7.4.1), RR would be equal to 1.114. For this RR value, the phenol calibration curve given in Figure 1 indicates a concentration of 27 [micro]g/mL in the sample extract (Cex).</p><p class="depth0">14.2 Internal standard--compute the concentration in the extract using the response factor determined from calibration data (Section 7.5) and the following equation: Cex([micro]g/mL)=(As x Cis/(Ais x RF) where Cex is the concentration of the compound in the extract, and the other terms are as defined in Section 7.5.1.</p><p class="depth0">14.3 The concentration of the pollutant in water is computed using the volumes of the original water sample (Section 10.1) and the final extract volume (Section 10.5), as follows: Concentration in water ([micro]g/L)=(Cex x Vex)/Vs where Vex is the extract volume in mL, and Vs is the sample volume in liters.</p><p class="depth0">14.4 If the EICP area at the quantitiation mass for any compound exceeds the calibration range of the system, the extract of the dilute aliquot (Section 10.1) is analyzed by isotope dilution; otherwise, the extract is diluted by a factor of 10, 9 [micro]L of internal standard solution (Section 6.10) are added to a 1.0 mL aliquot, and this diluted extract is analyzed by the internal standard method (Section 14.2). Quantify each compound at the highest concentration level within the calibration range.</p><p class="depth0">14.5 Report results for all pollutants and labeled compounds (Tables 1 and 2) found in all standards, blanks, and samples in [micro]g/L, to three significant figures. Results for samples which have been diluted are reported at the least dilute level at which the area at the quantitation mass is within the calibration range (Section 14.4) and the labeled compound recovery is within the normal range for the method (Section 15.4).</p><p class="depth0">15. Analysis of Complex Samples</p><p class="depth0">15.1 Untreated effluents and other samples frequently contain high levels (1000 [micro]g/L) of the compounds of interest, interfering compounds, and/or polymeric materials. Some samples will not concentrate to one mL (Section 10.5); others will overload the GC column and/or mass spectrometer.</p><p class="depth0">15.2 Analyze the dilute aliquot (Section 10.1) when the sample will not concentrate to 1.0 mL. If a dilute aliquot was not extracted, and the sample holding time (Section 9.3) has not been exceeded, dilute an aliquot of the sample with reagent water and re-extract (Section 10.1); otherwise, dilute the extract (Section 14.4) and analyze by the internal standard method (Section 14.2).</p><p class="depth0">15.3 Recovery of internal standard--the EICP area of the internal standard should be within a factor of two of the area in the shift standard (Section 12.1). If the absolute areas of the labeled compounds are within a factor of two of the respective areas in the shift standard, and the internal standard area is less than one-half of its respective area, then internal standard loss in the extract has occurred. In this case, use one of the labeled compounds (perferably a polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon) to compute the concentration of a pollutant with no labeled analog.</p><p class="depth0">15.4 Recovery of labeled compounds--in most samples, labeled compound recoveries will be similar to those from reagent water (Section 12.7). If the labeled compound recovery is outside the limits given in Table 8, the dilute extract (Section 10.1) is analyzed as in Section 14.4. If the recoveries of all labeled compounds and the internal staldard are low (per the criteria above), then a loss in instrument sensitivity is the most likely cause. In this case, the 100 [micro]g/mL calibration standard (Section 12.1) shall be analyzed and calibration verified (Section 12.5). If a loss in sensitivity has occurred, the instrument shall be repaired, the performance specifications in Section 12 shall be met, and the extract reanalyzed. If a loss in instrument sensitivity has not occurred, the method does not work on the sample being analyzed and the result may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.</p><p class="depth0">16.

Appendix B to Part 136--Definition and Procedure for the</p><p class="depth0">Determination of the Method Detection Limit--Revision 1.11</p><p class="depth0">Definition</p><p class="depth0">The method detection limit (MDL) is defined as the minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the analyte concentration is greater than zero and is determined from analysis of a sample in a given matrix containing the analyte.</p><p class="depth0">Scope and Application</p><p class="depth0">This procedure is designed for applicability to a wide variety of sample types ranging from reagent (blank) water containing analyte to wastewater containing analyte. The MDL for an analytical procedure may vary as a function of sample type. The procedure requires a complete, specific, and well defined analytical method. It is essential that all sample processing steps of the analytical method be included in the determination of the method detection limit.</p><p class="depth0">The MDL obtained by this procedure is used to judge the significance of a single measurement of a future sample.</p><p class="depth0">The MDL procedure was designed for applicability to a broad variety of physical and chemical methods. To accomplish this, the procedure was made device- or instrument-independent.</p><p class="depth0">Procedure</p><p class="depth0">1. Make an estimate of the detection limit using one of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The concentration value that corresponds to an instrument signal/noise in the range of 2.5 to 5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The concentration equivalent of three times the standard deviation of replicate instrumental measurements of the analyte in reagent water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> That region of the standard curve where there is a significant change in sensitivity, i.e., a break in the slope of the standard curve.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Instrumental limitations.</p><p class="depth0">It is recognized that the experience of the analyst is important to this process. However, the analyst must include the above considerations in the initial estimate of the detection limit.</p><p class="depth0">2. Prepare reagent (blank) water that is as free of analyte as possible. Reagent or interference free water is defined as a water sample in which analyte and interferent concentrations are not detected at the method detection limit of each analyte of interest. Interferences are defined as systematic errors in the measured analytical signal of an established procedure caused by the presence of interfering species (interferent). The interferent concentration is presupposed to be normally distributed in representative samples of a given matrix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If the MDL is to be determined in reagent (blank) water, prepare a laboratory standard (analyte in reagent water) at a concentration which is at least equal to or in the same concentration range as the estimated method detection limit. (Recommend between 1 and 5 times the estimated method detection limit.) Proceed to Step 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the MDL is to be determined in another sample matrix, analyze the sample. If the measured level of the analyte is in the recommended range of one to five times the estimated detection limit, proceed to Step 4.</p><p class="depth0">If the measured level of analyte is less than the estimated detection limit, add a known amount of analyte to bring the level of analyte between one and five times the estimated detection limit.</p><p class="depth0">If the measured level of analyte is greater than five times the estimated detection limit, there are two options.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Obtain another sample with a lower level of analyte in the same matrix if possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The sample may be used as is for determining the method detection limit if the analyte level does not exceed 10 times the MDL of the analyte in reagent water. The variance of the analytical method changes as the analyte concentration increases from the MDL, hence the MDL determined under these circumstances may not truly reflect method variance at lower analyte concentrations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Take a minimum of seven aliquots of the sample to be used to calculate the method detection limit and process each through the entire analytical method. Make all computations according to the defined method with final results in the method reporting units. If a blank measurement is required to calculate the measured level of analyte, obtain a separate blank measurement for each sample aliquot analyzed. The average blank measurement is subtracted from the respective sample measurements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> It may be economically and technically desirable to evaluate the estimated method detection limit before proceeding with 4a. This will: (1) Prevent repeating this entire procedure when the costs of analyses are high and (2) insure that the procedure is being conducted at the correct concentration. It is quite possible that an inflated MDL will be calculated from data obtained at many times the real MDL even though the level of analyte is less than five times the calculated method detection limit. To insure that the estimate of the method detection limit is a good estimate, it is necessary to determine that a lower concentration of analyte will not result in a significantly lower method detection limit. Take two aliquots of the sample to be used to calculate the method detection limit and process each through the entire method, including blank measurements as described above in 4a. Evaluate these data:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If these measurements indicate the sample is in desirable range for determination of the MDL, take five additional aliquots and proceed. Use all seven measurements for calculation of the MDL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If these measurements indicate the sample is not in correct range, reestimate the MDL, obtain new sample as in 3 and repeat either 4a or 4b.</p><p class="depth0">5. Calculate the variance (S\2\) and standard deviation (S) of the replicate measurements, as follows:

The F-ratio is calculated by substituting the larger S\2\ into the numerator S\2\A and the other into the denominator S\2\B. The computed F-ratio is then compared with the F-ratio found in the table which is 3.05 as follows: if S\2\A/S\2\B<3.05, then compute the pooled standard deviation by the following equation:

To reduce potential interferences, dissolved solids should be <0.2% (w/v) (Section 4.2).</p><p class="depth0">1.4 With the exception of silver, where this method is approved for the determination of certain metal and metalloid contaminants in drinking water, samples may be analyzed directly by pneumatic nebulization without acid digestion if the sample has been properly preserved with acid and has turbidity of <1 NTU at the time of analysis. This total recoverable determination procedure is referred to as ``direct analysis''. However, in the determination of some primary drinking water metal contaminants, preconcentration of the sample may be required prior to analysis in order to meet drinking water acceptance performance criteria (Sections 11.2.2 through 11.2.7).</p><p class="depth0">1.5 For the determination of total recoverable analytes in aqueous and solid samples a digestion/extraction is required prior to analysis when the elements are not in solution (e.g., soils, sludges, sediments and aqueous samples that may contain particulate and suspended solids). Aqueous samples containing suspended or particulate material 1% (w/v) should be extracted as a solid type sample.</p><p class="depth0">1.6 When determining boron and silica in aqueous samples, only plastic, PTFE or quartz labware should be used from time of sample collection to completion of analysis. For accurate determination of boron in solid samples only quartz or PTFE beakers should be used during acid extraction with immediate transfer of an extract aliquot to a plastic centrifuge tube following dilution of the extract to volume. When possible, borosilicate glass should be avoided to prevent contamination of these analytes.</p><p class="depth0">1.7 Silver is only slightly soluble in the presence of chloride unless there is a sufficient chloride concentration to form the soluble chloride complex. Therefore, low recoveries of silver may occur in samples, fortified sample matrices and even fortified blanks if determined as a dissolved analyte or by ``direct analysis'' where the sample has not been processed using the total recoverable mixed acid digestion. For this reason it is recommended that samples be digested prior to the determination of silver. The total recoverable sample digestion procedure given in this method is suitable for the determination of silver in aqueous samples containing concentrations up to 0.1 mg/L. For the analysis of wastewater samples containing higher concentrations of silver, succeeding smaller volume, well mixed aliquots

should be prepared until the analysis solution contains <0.1 mg/L silver. The extraction of solid samples containing concentrations of silver 50 mg/kg should be treated in a similar manner. Also, the extraction of tin from solid samples should be prepared again using aliquots <1 g when determined sample concentrations exceed 1%.</p><p class="depth0">1.8 The total recoverable sample digestion procedure given in this method will solubilize and hold in solution only minimal concentrations of barium in the presence of free sulfate. For the analysis of barium in samples having varying and unknown concentrations of sulfate, analysis should be completed as soon as possible after sample preparation.</p><p class="depth0">1.9 The total recoverable sample digestion procedure given in this method is not suitable for the determination of volatile organo-mercury compounds. However, if digestion is not required (turbidity <1 NTU), the combined concentrations of inorganic and organo-mercury in solution can be determined by ``direct analysis'' pneumatic nebulization provided the sample solution is adjusted to contain the same mixed acid (HNO3 + HCl) matrix as the total recoverable calibration standards and blank solutions.</p><p class="depth0">1.10 Detection limits and linear ranges for the elements will vary with the wavelength selected, the spectrometer, and the matrices. Table 1 provides estimated instrument detection limits for the listed wavelengths.\7\ However, actual method detection limits and linear working ranges will be dependent on the sample matrix, instrumentation, and selected operating conditions.</p><p class="depth0">1.11 Users of the method data should state the data-quality objectives prior to analysis. Users of the method must document and have on file the required initial demonstration performance data described in Section 9.2 prior to using the method for analysis.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 An aliquot of a well mixed, homogeneous aqueous or solid sample is accurately weighed or measured for sample processing. For total recoverable analysis of a solid or an aqueous sample containing undissolved material, analytes are first solubilized by gentle refluxing with nitric and hydrochloric acids. After cooling, the sample is made up to volume, is mixed and centrifuged or allowed to settle overnight prior to analysis. For the determination of dissolved analytes in a filtered aqueous sample aliquot, or for the ``direct analysis'' total recoverable determination of analytes in drinking water where sample turbidity is <1 NTU, the sample is made ready for analysis by the appropriate addition of nitric acid, and then diluted to a predetermined volume and mixed before analysis.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 The analysis described in this method involves multielemental determinations by ICP-AES using sequential or simultaneous instruments. The instruments measure characteristic atomic-line emission spectra by optical spectrometry. Samples are nebulized and the resulting aerosol is transported to the plasma torch. Element specific emission spectra are produced by a radio-frequency inductively coupled plasma. The spectra are dispersed by a grating spectrometer, and the intensities of the line spectra are monitored at specific wavelengths by a photosensitive device. Photocurrents from the photosensitive device are processed and controlled by a computer system. A background correction technique is required to compensate for variable background contribution to the determination of the analytes. Background must be measured adjacent to the analyte wavelength during analysis. Various interferences must be considered and addressed appropriately as discussed in Sections 4.0, 7.0, 9.0, 10.0, and 11.0.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Definitions</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Calibration Blank--A volume of reagent water acidified with the same acid matrix as in the calibration standards. The calibration blank is a zero standard and is used to calibrate the ICP instrument (Section 7.10.1).</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Calibration Standard (CAL)--A solution prepared from the dilution of stock standard solutions. The CAL solutions are used to calibrate the instrument response with respect to analyte concentration (Section 7.9).</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Dissolved Analyte--The concentration of analyte in an aqueous sample that will pass through a 0.45 [micro]m membrane filter assembly prior to sample acidification (Section 11.1).</p><p class="depth0">3.4 Field Reagent Blank (FRB)--An aliquot of reagent water or other blank matrix that is placed in a sample container in the laboratory and treated as a sample in all respects, including shipment to the sampling site, exposure to the sampling site conditions, storage, preservation, and all analytical procedures. The purpose of the FRB is to determine if method analytes or other interferences are present in the field environment (Section 8.5).</p><p class="depth0">3.5 Instrument Detection Limit (IDL)--The concentration equivalent to the analyte signal which is equal to three times the standard deviation of a series of 10 replicate measurements of the calibration blank signal at the same wavelength (Table 1.).</p><p class="depth0">3.6 Instrument Performance Check (IPC) Solution--A solution of method analytes, used to evaluate the performance of the instrument system with respect to a defined set of method criteria (Sections 7.11 and 9.3.4).</p><p class="depth0">3.7 Internal Standard--Pure analyte(s) added to a sample, extract, or standard solution in known amount(s) and used to measure the relative responses of other method analytes that are components of the same sample or solution. The internal standard must be an analyte that is not a sample component (Section 11.5).</p><p class="depth0">3.8 Laboratory Duplicates (LD1 and LD2)--Two aliquots of the same sample taken in the laboratory and analyzed separately with identical procedures. Analyses of LD1 and LD2 indicate precision associated with laboratory procedures, but not with sample collection, preservation, or storage procedures.</p><p class="depth0">3.9 Laboratory Fortified Blank (LFB)--An aliquot of LRB to which known quantities of the method analytes are added in the laboratory. The LFB is analyzed exactly like a sample, and its purpose is to determine whether the methodology is in control and whether the laboratory is capable of making accurate and precise measurements (Sections 7.10.3 and 9.3.2).</p><p class="depth0">3.10 Laboratory Fortified Sample Matrix (LFM)--An aliquot of an environmental sample to which known quantities of the method analytes are added in the laboratory. The LFM is analyzed exactly like a sample, and its purpose is to determine whether the sample matrix contributes bias to the analytical results. The background concentrations of the analytes in the sample matrix must be determined in a separate aliquot and the measured values in the LFM corrected for background concentrations (Section 9.4).</p><p class="depth0">3.11 Laboratory Reagent Blank (LRB)--An aliquot of reagent water or other blank matrices that are treated exactly as a sample including exposure to all glassware, equipment, solvents, reagents, and internal standards that are used with other samples. The LRB is used to determine if method analytes or other interferences are present in the laboratory environment, reagents, or apparatus (Sections 7.10.2 and 9.3.1).</p><p class="depth0">3.12 Linear Dynamic Range (LDR)--The concentration range over which the instrument response to an analyte is linear (Section 9.2.2).</p><p class="depth0">3.13 Method Detection Limit (MDL)--The minimum concentration of an analyte that can be identified, measured, and reported with 99% confidence that the analyte concentration is greater than zero (Section 9.2.4 and Table 4.).</p><p class="depth0">3.14 Plasma Solution--A solution that is used to determine the optimum height above the work coil for viewing the plasma (Sections 7.15 and 10.2.3).</p><p class="depth0">3.15 Quality Control Sample (QCS)--A solution of method analytes of known concentrations which is used to fortify an aliquot of LRB or sample matrix. The QCS is obtained from a source external to the laboratory and different from the source of calibration standards. It is used to check either laboratory or instrument performance (Sections 7.12 and 9.2.3).</p><p class="depth0">3.16 Solid Sample--For the purpose of this method, a sample taken from material classified as soil, sediment or sludge.</p><p class="depth0">3.17 Spectral Interference Check (SIC) Solution--A solution of selected method analytes of higher concentrations which is used to evaluate the procedural routine for correcting known interelement spectral interferences with respect to a defined set of method criteria (Sections 7.13, 7.14 and 9.3.5).</p><p class="depth0">3.18 Standard Addition--The addition of a known amount of analyte to the sample in order to determine the relative response of the detector to an analyte within the sample matrix. The relative response is then used to assess either an operative matrix effect or the sample analyte concentration (Sections 9.5.1 and 11.5).</p><p class="depth0">3.19 Stock Standard Solution--A concentrated solution containing one or more method analytes prepared in the laboratory using assayed reference materials or purchased from a reputable commercial source (Section 7.8).</p><p class="depth0">3.20 Total Recoverable Analyte--The concentration of analyte determined either by ``direct analysis'' of an unfiltered acid preserved drinking water sample with turbidity of <1 NTU (Section 11.2.1), or by analysis of the solution extract of a solid sample or an unfiltered aqueous sample following digestion by refluxing with hot dilute mineral acid(s) as specified in the method (Sections 11.2 and 11.3).</p><p class="depth0">3.21 Water Sample--For the purpose of this method, a sample taken from one of the following sources: drinking, surface, ground, storm runoff, industrial or domestic wastewater.</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Interferences</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Spectral interferences are caused by background emission from continuous or recombination phenomena, stray light from the line emission of high concentration elements, overlap of a spectral line from another element, or unresolved overlap of molecular band spectra.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.1 Background emission and stray light can usually be compensated for by subtracting the background emission determined by measurement(s) adjacent to the analyte wavelength peak. Spectral scans of samples or single element solutions in the analyte regions may indicate not only when alternate wavelengths are desirable because of severe spectral interference, but also will show whether the most appropriate estimate of the background emission is provided by an interpolation from measurements on both sides of the wavelength peak or by the measured emission on one side or the other. The location(s) selected for the measurement of background intensity will be determined by

the complexity of the spectrum adjacent to the wavelength peak. The location(s) used for routine measurement must be free of off-line spectral interference (interelement or molecular) or adequately corrected to reflect the same change in background intensity as occurs at the wavelength peak.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.2 Spectral overlaps may be avoided by using an alternate wavelength or can be compensated for by equations that correct for interelement contributions, which involves measuring the interfering elements. Some potential on-line spectral interferences observed for the recommended wavelengths are given in Table 2. When operative and uncorrected, these interferences will produce false-positive determinations and be reported as analyte concentrations. The interferences listed are only those that occur between method analytes. Only interferences of a direct overlap nature that were observed with a single instrument having a working resolution of 0.035 nm are listed. More extensive information on interferant effects at various wavelengths and resolutions is available in Boumans' Tables.\8\ Users may apply interelement correction factors determined on their instruments within tested concentration ranges to compensate (off-line or on-line) for the effects of interfering elements.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.3 When interelement corrections are applied, there is a need to verify their accuracy by analyzing spectral interference check solutions as described in Section 7.13. Interelement corrections will vary for the same emission line among instruments because of differences in resolution, as determined by the grating plus the entrance and exit slit widths, and by the order of dispersion. Interelement corrections will also vary depending upon the choice of background correction points. Selecting a background correction point where an interfering emission line may appear should be avoided when practical. Interelement corrections that constitute a major portion of an emission signal may not yield accurate data. Users should not forget that some samples may contain uncommon elements that could contribute spectral interferences.\7 8\</p><p class="depth0">4.1.4 The interference effects must be evaluated for each individual instrument whether configured as a sequential or simultaneous instrument. For each instrument, intensities will vary not only with optical resolution but also with operating conditions (such as power, viewing height and argon flow rate). When using the recommended wavelengths given in Table 1, the analyst is required to determine and document for each wavelength the effect from the known interferences given in Table 2, and to utilize a computer routine for their automatic correction on all analyses. To determine the appropriate location for off-line background correction, the user must scan the area on either side adjacent to the wavelength and record the apparent emission intensity from all other method analytes. This spectral information must be documented and kept on file. The location selected for background correction must be either free of off-line interelement spectral interference or a computer routine must be used for their automatic correction on all determinations. If a wavelength other than the recommended wavelength is used, the user must determine and document both the on-line and off-line spectral interference effect from all method analytes and provide for their automatic correction on all analyses. Tests to determine the spectral interference must be done using analyte concentrations that will adequately describe the interference. Normally, 100 mg/L single element solutions are sufficient, however, for analytes such as iron that may be found at high concentration a more appropriate test would be to use a concentration near the upper LDR limit. See Section 10.4 for required spectral interference test criteria.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.5 When interelement corrections are not used, either on-going SIC solutions (Section 7.14) must be analyzed to verify the absence of interelement spectral interference or a computer software routine must be employed for comparing the determinative data to limits files for notifying the analyst when an interfering element is detected in the sample at a concentration that will produce either an apparent false positive concentration, greater than the analyte IDL, or false negative analyte concentration, less than the 99% lower control limit of the calibration blank. When the interference accounts for 10% or more of the analyte concentration, either an alternate wavelength free of interference or another approved test procedure must be used to complete the analysis. For example, the copper peak at 213.853 nm could be mistaken for the zinc peak at 213.856 nm in solutions with high copper and low zinc concentrations. For this example, a spectral scan in the 213.8 nm region would not reveal the misidentification because a single peak near the zinc location would be observed. The possibility of this misidentification of copper for the zinc peak at 213.856 nm can be identified by measuring the copper at another emission line, e.g., 324.754 nm. Users should be aware that, depending upon the instrumental resolution, alternate wavelengths with adequate sensitivity and freedom from interference may not be available for all matrices. In these circumstances the analyte must be determined using another approved test procedure.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Physical interferences are effects associated with the sample nebulization and transport processes. Changes in viscosity and surface tension can cause significant inaccuracies, especially in samples containing

high dissolved solids or high acid concentrations. If physical interferences are present, they must be reduced by such means as a high-solids nebulizer, diluting the sample, using a peristaltic pump, or using an appropriate internal standard element. Another problem that can occur with high dissolved solids is salt buildup at the tip of the nebulizer, which affects aerosol flow rate and causes instrumental drift. This problem can be controlled by a high-solids nebulizer, wetting the argon prior to nebulization, using a tip washer, or diluting the sample. Also, it has been reported that better control of the argon flow rates, especially for the nebulizer, improves instrument stability and precision; this is accomplished with the use of mass flow controllers.</p><p class="depth0">4.3 Chemical interferences include molecular-compound formation, ionization effects, and solute-vaporization effects. Normally, these effects are not significant with the ICP-AES technique. If observed, they can be minimized by careful selection of operating conditions (such as incident power and observation height), by buffering of the sample, by matrix matching, and by standard-addition procedures. Chemical interferences are highly dependent on matrix type and the specific analyte element.</p><p class="depth0">4.4 Memory interferences result when analytes in a previous sample contribute to the signals measured in a new sample. Memory effects can result from sample deposition on the uptake tubing to the nebulizer, and from the buildup of sample material in the plasma torch and spray chamber. The site where these effects occur is dependent on the element and can be minimized by flushing the system with a rinse blank between samples (Section 7.10.4). The possibility of memory interferences should be recognized within an analytical run and suitable rinse times should be used to reduce them. The rinse times necessary for a particular element must be estimated prior to analysis. This may be achieved by aspirating a standard containing elements corresponding to either their LDR or a concentration ten times those usually encountered. The aspiration time should be the same as a normal sample analysis period, followed by analysis of the rinse blank at designated intervals. The length of time required to reduce analyte signals to within a factor of two of the method detection limit, should be noted. Until the required rinse time is established, this method requires a rinse period of at least 60 seconds between samples and standards. If a memory interference is suspected, the sample must be re-analyzed after a long rinse period.</p><p class="depth0">5.0 Safety</p><p class="depth0">5.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method have not been fully established.

Other solutions could achieve the same objective as well. (Multielement SIC solutions\3\ may be prepared and substituted for the single element solutions provided an analyte is not subject to interference from more than one interferant in the solution.)</p><p class="depth0">Note: If wavelengths other than those recommended in Table 1 are used, other solutions different from those above (a through q) may be required.</p><p class="depth0">7.13.2 For interferences from iron and aluminum, only those correction factors (positive or negative) when multiplied by 100 to calculate apparent analyte concentrations that exceed the determined analyte IDL or fall below the lower 3-sigma control limit of the calibration blank need be tested on a daily basis.</p><p class="depth0">7.13.3 For the other interfering elements, only those correction factors (positive or negative) when multiplied by 10 to calculate apparent analyte concentrations that exceed the determined analyte IDL or fall below the lower 3-sigma control limit of the calibration blank need be tested on a daily basis.</p><p class="depth0">7.13.4 If the correction routine is operating properly, the determined apparent analyte(s) concentration from analysis of each interference solution (a through q) should fall within a specific concentration range bracketing the calibration blank. This concentration range is calculated by multiplying the concentration of the interfering element by the value of the correction factor being tested and dividing by 10. If after subtraction of the calibration blank the apparent analyte concentration is outside (above or below) this range, a change in the correction factor of more than 10% should be suspected. The cause of the change should be determined and corrected and the correction factor should be updated.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The SIC solution should be analyzed more than once to confirm a change has occurred with adequate rinse time between solutions and before subsequent analysis of the calibration blank.</p><p class="depth0">7.13.5 If the correction factors tested on a daily basis are found to be within the 10% criteria for five consecutive days, the required verification frequency of those factors in compliance may be extended to a weekly basis. Also, if the nature of the samples analyzed is such (e.g., finished drinking water) that they do not contain concentrations of the interfering elements at the 10 mg/L level, daily verification is not required; however, all interelement spectral correction factors must be verified annually and updated, if necessary.</p><p class="depth0">7.13.6 If the instrument does not display negative concentration values, fortify the SIC solutions with the elements of interest at 1 mg/L and test for analyte recoveries that are below 95%. In the absence of measurable analyte, over-correction could go undetected because a negative value could be reported as zero.</p><p class="depth0">7.14 For instruments without interelement correction capability or when interelement corrections are not used, SIC solutions (containing similar concentrations of the major components in the samples, e.g., 10 mg/L) can serve to verify the absence of effects at the wavelengths selected. These data must be kept on file with the sample analysis data. If the SIC solution confirms an operative interference that is 10% of the analyte concentration, the analyte must be determined using a wavelength and background correction location free of the interference or by another approved test procedure. Users are advised that high salt concentrations can cause analyte signal suppressions and confuse interference tests.</p><p class="depth0">7.15 Plasma Solution--The plasma solution is used for determining the optimum viewing height of the plasma above the work coil prior to using the method (Section 10.2). The solution is prepared by adding a 5 mL aliquot from each of the stock standard solutions of arsenic, lead, selenium, and thallium to a mixture of 20 mL (1+1) nitric acid and 20 mL (1+1) hydrochloric acid and diluting to 500 mL with reagent water. Store in a FEP bottle.</p><p class="depth0">8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, and Storage</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Prior to the collection of an aqueous sample, consideration should be given to the type of data required, (i.e., dissolved or total recoverable), so that appropriate preservation and pretreatment steps can be taken. The pH of all aqueous samples must be tested immediately prior to aliquoting for processing or ``direct analysis'' to ensure the sample has been properly preserved. If properly acid preserved, the sample can be held up to six months before analysis.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 For the determination of the dissolved elements, the sample must be filtered through a 0.45 [micro]m pore diameter membrane filter at the time of collection or as soon

thereafter as practically possible. (Glass or plastic filtering apparatus are recommended to avoid possible contamination. Only plastic apparatus should be used when the determinations of boron and silica are critical.) Use a portion of the filtered sample to rinse the filter flask, discard this portion and collect the required volume of filtrate. Acidify the filtrate with (1+1) nitric acid immediately following filtration to pH <2.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 For the determination of total recoverable elements in aqueous samples, samples are not filtered, but acidified with (1+1) nitric acid to pH <2 (normally, 3 mL of (1+1) acid per liter of sample is sufficient for most ambient and drinking water samples). Preservation may be done at the time of collection, however, to avoid the hazards of strong acids in the field, transport restrictions, and possible contamination it is recommended that the samples be returned to the laboratory within two weeks of collection and acid preserved upon receipt in the laboratory. Following acidification, the sample should be mixed, held for 16 hours, and then verified to be pH <2 just prior withdrawing an aliquot for processing or ``direct analysis''. If for some reason such as high alkalinity the sample pH is verified to be 2, more acid must be added and the sample held for 16 hours until verified to be pH <2. See Section 8.1.</p><p class="depth0">Note: When the nature of the sample is either unknown or is known to be hazardous, acidification should be done in a fume hood. See Section 5.2.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 Solid samples require no preservation prior to analysis other than storage at 4 [deg]C. There is no established holding time limitation for solid samples.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 For aqueous samples, a field blank should be prepared and analyzed as required by the data user. Use the same container and acid as used in sample collection.</p><p class="depth0">9.0 Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Each laboratory using this method is required to operate a formal quality control (QC) program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability, and the periodic analysis of laboratory reagent blanks, fortified blanks and other laboratory solutions as a continuing check on performance. The laboratory is required to maintain performance records that define the quality of the data thus generated.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 Initial Demonstration of Performance (mandatory).</p><p class="depth0">9.2.1 The initial demonstration of performance is used to characterize instrument performance (determination of linear dynamic ranges and analysis of quality control samples) and laboratory performance (determination of method detection limits) prior to analyses conducted by this method.</p><p class="depth0">9.2.2 Linear dynamic range (LDR)--The upper limit of the LDR must be established for each wavelength utilized. It must be determined from a linear calibration prepared in the normal manner using the established analytical operating procedure for the instrument. The LDR should be determined by analyzing succeedingly higher standard concentrations of the analyte until the observed analyte concentration is no more than 10% below the stated concentration of the standard. Determined LDRs must be documented and kept on file. The LDR which may be used for the analysis of samples should be judged by the analyst from the resulting data. Determined sample analyte concentrations that are greater than 90% of the determined upper LDR limit must be diluted and reanalyzed. The LDRs should be verified annually or whenever, in the judgment of the analyst, a change in analytical performance caused by either a change in instrument hardware or operating conditions would dictate they be redetermined.</p><p class="depth0">9.2.3 Quality control sample (QCS)--When beginning the use of this method, on a quarterly basis, after the preparation of stock or calibration standard solutions or as required to meet data-quality needs, verify the calibration standards and acceptable instrument performance with the preparation and analyses of a QCS (Section 7.12). To verify the calibration standards the determined mean concentrations from three analyses of the QCS must be within 5% of the stated values. If the calibration standard cannot be verified, performance of the determinative step of the method is unacceptable. The source of the problem must be identified and corrected before either proceeding on with the initial determination of method detection limits or continuing with on-going analyses.</p><p class="depth0">9.2.4 Method detection limit (MDL)--MDLs must be established for all wavelengths utilized, using reagent water (blank) fortified at a concentration of two to three times the estimated instrument detection limit.\15\ To determine MDL values, take seven replicate aliquots of the fortified reagent water and process through the entire analytical method. Perform all calculations defined in the method and report the concentration values in the appropriate units. Calculate the MDL as follows:
MDL = (t) x (S)
where:
t = students' t value for a 99% confidence level and a standard</p><p class="depth0">deviation estimate with n-1 degrees of freedom [t = 3.14 for</p><p class="depth0">seven replicates]S = standard deviation of the replicate analyses</p><p class="depth0">Note: If additional confirmation is desired, reanalyze the seven replicate aliquots on two

more nonconsecutive days and again calculate the MDL values for each day. An average of the three MDL values for each analyte may provide for a more appropriate MDL estimate. If the relative standard deviation (RSD) from the analyses of the seven aliquots is <10%, the concentration used to determine the analyte MDL may have been inappropriately high for the determination. If so, this could result in the calculation of an unrealistically low MDL. Concurrently, determination of MDL in reagent water represents a best case situation and does not reflect possible matrix effects of real world samples. However, successful analyses of LFMs (Section 9.4) and the analyte addition test described in Section 9.5.1 can give confidence to the MDL value determined in reagent water. Typical single laboratory MDL values using this method are given in Table 4.</p><p class="depth0">The MDLs must be sufficient to detect analytes at the required levels according to compliance monitoring regulation (Section 1.2). MDLs should be determined annually, when a new operator begins work or whenever, in the judgment of the analyst, a change in analytical performance caused by either a change in instrument hardware or operating conditions would dictate they be redetermined.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 Assessing Laboratory Performance (mandatory)</p><p class="depth0">9.3.1 Laboratory reagent blank (LRB)--The laboratory must analyze at least one LRB (Section 7.10.2) with each batch of 20 or fewer samples of the same matrix. LRB data are used to assess contamination from the laboratory environment. LRB values that exceed the MDL indicate laboratory or reagent contamination should be suspected. When LRB values constitute 10% or more of the analyte level determined for a sample or is 2.2 times the analyte MDL whichever is greater, fresh aliquots of the samples must be prepared and analyzed again for the affected analytes after the source of contamination has been corrected and acceptable LRB values have been obtained.</p><p class="depth0">9.3.2 Laboratory fortified blank (LFB)--The laboratory must analyze at least one LFB (Section 7.10.3) with each batch of samples. Calculate accuracy as percent recovery using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
where:
R = percent recoveryLFB = laboratory fortified blankLRB = laboratory reagent blanks = concentration equivalent of analyte added to fortify the LBR</p><p class="depth0">solution</p><p class="depth0">If the recovery of any analyte falls outside the required control limits of 85-115%, that analyte is judged out of control, and the source of the problem should be identified and resolved before continuing analyses.</p><p class="depth0">9.3.3 The laboratory must use LFB analyses data to assess laboratory performance against the required control limits of 85-115% (Section 9.3.2). When sufficient internal performance data become available (usually a minimum of 20-30 analyses), optional control limits can be developed from the mean percent recovery (x) and the standard deviation (S) of the mean percent recovery. These data can be used to establish the upper and lower control limits as follows:
UPPER CONTROL LIMIT = x + 3SLOWER CONTROL LIMIT = x - 3S</p><p class="depth0">The optional control limits must be equal to or better than the required control limits of 85-115%. After each five to 10 new recovery measurements, new control limits can be calculated using only the most recent 20-30 data points. Also, the standard deviation (S) data should be used to establish an on-going precision statement for the level of concentrations included in the LFB. These data must be kept on file and be available for review.</p><p class="depth0">9.3.4 Instrument performance check (IPC) solution--For all determinations the laboratory must analyze the IPC solution (Section 7.11) and a calibration blank immediately following daily calibration, after every 10th sample (or more frequently, if required) and at the end of the sample run. Analysis of the calibration blank should always be s = fortified sample concentrationC = sample background concentrations = concentration equivalent of analyte added to fortify the sample</p><p class="depth0">9.4.4 If the recovery of any analyte falls outside the designated LFM recovery range, and the laboratory performance for that analyte is shown to be in control (Section 9.3), the recovery problem encountered with the fortified sample is judged to be matrix related, not system related. The data user should be informed that the result for that analyte in the unfortified sample is suspect due to either the heterogeneous nature of the sample or matrix effects and analysis by method of standard addition or the use of an internal standard(s) (Section 11.5) should be considered.</p><p class="depth0">9.4.5 Where reference materials are available, they should be analyzed to provide additional performance data. The analysis of reference samples is a valuable tool for demonstrating the ability to perform the method acceptably. Reference materials containing high concentrations of analytes can provide additional information on the performance of the spectral interference correction routine.</p><p class="depth0">9.5 Assess the possible need for the method of standard additions (MSA) or internal standard elements by the following tests. Directions for using MSA or internal standard(s) are given in Section 11.5.</p><p class="depth0">9.5.1 Analyte addition test: An analyte(s) standard added to a portion of a prepared

sample, or its dilution, should be recovered to within 85% to 115% of the known value. The analyte(s) addition should produce a minimum level of 20 times and a maximum of 100 times the method detection limit. If the analyte addition is <20% of the sample analyte concentration, the following dilution test should be used. If recovery of the analyte(s) is not within the specified limits, a matrix effect should be suspected, and the associated data flagged accordingly. The method of additions or the use of an appropriate internal standard element may provide more accurate data.</p><p class="depth0">9.5.2 Dilution test: If the analyte concentration is sufficiently high (minimally, a factor of 50 above the instrument detection limit in the original solution but <90% of the linear limit), an analysis of a 1 + 4 dilution should agree (after correction for the fivefold dilution) within 10% of the original determination. If not, a chemical or physical interference effect should be suspected and the associated data flagged accordingly. The method of standard additions or the use of an internal-standard element may provide more accurate data for samples failing this test.</p><p class="depth0">10.0 Calibration and Standardization</p><p class="depth0">10.1 Specific wavelengths are listed in Table 1. Other wavelengths may be substituted if they can provide the needed sensitivity and are corrected for spectral interference. However, because of the difference among various makes and models of spectrometers, specific instrument operating conditions cannot be given. The instrument and operating conditions utilized for determination must be capable of providing data of acceptable quality to the program and data user. The analyst should follow the instructions provided by the instrument manufacturer unless other conditions provide similar or better performance for a task. Operating conditions for aqueous solutions usually vary from 1100-1200 watts forward power, 15-16 mm viewing height, 15-19 L/min. argon coolant flow, 0.6-1 L/min. argon aerosol flow, 1-1.8 mL/min. sample pumping rate with a one minute preflush time and measurement time near 1 s per wavelength peak (for sequential instruments) and near 10 s per sample (for simultaneous instruments). Use of the Cu/Mn intensity ratio at 324.754 nm and 257.610 nm (by adjusting the argon aerosol flow) has been recommended as a way to achieve repeatable interference correction factors.\17\</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Prior to using this method optimize the plasma operating conditions. The following procedure is recommended for vertically configured plasmas. The purpose of plasma optimization is to provide a maximum signal-to-background ratio for the least sensitive element in the analytical array. The use of a mass flow controller to regulate the nebulizer gas flow rate greatly facilitates the procedure.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.1 Ignite the plasma and select an appropriate incident rf power with minimum reflected power. Allow the instrument to become thermally stable before beginning. This usually requires at least 30 to 60 minutes of operation. While aspirating the 1000 [micro]g/mL solution of yttrium (Section 7.8.32), follow the instrument manufacturer's instructions and adjust the aerosol carrier gas flow rate through the nebulizer so a definitive blue emission region of the plasma extends approximately from 5-20 mm above the top of the work coil.\18\ Record the nebulizer gas flow rate or pressure setting for future reference.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.2 After establishing the nebulizer gas flow rate, determine the solution uptake rate of the nebulizer in mL/min. by aspirating a known volume calibration blank for a period of at least three minutes. Divide the spent volume by the aspiration time (in minutes) and record the uptake rate. Set the peristaltic pump to deliver the uptake rate in a steady even flow.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.3 After horizontally aligning the plasma and/or optically profiling the spectrometer, use the selected instrument conditions from Sections 10.2.1 and 10.2.2, and aspirate the plasma solution (Section 7.15), containing 10 [micro]g/mL each of As, Pb, Se and Tl. Collect intensity data at the wavelength peak for each analyte at 1 mm intervals from 14-18 mm above the top of the work coil. (This region of the plasma is commonly referred to as the analytical zone.)\19\ Repeat the process using the calibration blank. Determine the net signal to blank intensity ratio for each analyte for each viewing height setting. Choose the height for viewing the plasma that provides the largest intensity ratio for the least sensitive element of the four analytes. If more than one position provides the same ratio, select the position that provides the highest net intensity counts for the least sensitive element or accept a compromise position of the intensity ratios of all four analytes.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.4 The instrument operating condition finally selected as being optimum should provide the lowest reliable instrument detection limits and method detection limits. Refer to Tables 1 and 4 for comparison of IDLs and MDLs, respectively.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.5 If either the instrument operating conditions, such as incident power and/or nebulizer gas flow rate are changed, or a new torch injector tube having a different orifice i.d. is installed, the plasma and plasma viewing height should be reoptimized.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.6 Before daily calibration and after the instrument warmup period, the nebulizer gas flow must be reset to the determined optimized flow. If a mass flow controller is being used, it should be reset to the recorded

optimized flow rate. In order to maintain valid spectral interelement correction routines the nebulizer gas flow rate should be the same from day-to-day (<2% change). The change in signal intensity with a change in nebulizer gas flow rate for both ``hard'' (Pb 220.353 nm) and ``soft'' (Cu 324.754) lines is illustrated in Figure 1.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Before using the procedure (Section 11.0) to analyze samples, there must be data available documenting initial demonstration of performance. The required data and procedure is described in Section 9.2. This data must be generated using the same instrument operating conditions and calibration routine (Section 11.4) to be used for sample analysis. These documented data must be kept on file and be available for review by the data user.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 After completing the initial demonstration of performance, but before analyzing samples, the laboratory must establish and initially verify an interelement spectral interference correction routine to be used during sample analysis. A general description concerning spectral interference and the analytical requirements for background correction and for correction of interelement spectral interference in particular are given in Section 4.1. To determine the appropriate location for background correction and to establish the interelement interference correction routine, repeated spectral scan about the analyte wavelength and repeated analyses of the single element solutions may be required. Criteria for determining an interelement spectral interference is an apparent positive or negative concentration on the analyte that is outside the 3-sigma control limits of the calibration blank for the analyte. (The upper-control limit is the analyte IDL.) Once established, the entire routine must be initially and periodically verified annually, or whenever there is a change in instrument operating conditions (Section 10.2.5). Only a portion of the correction routine must be verified more frequently or on a daily basis. Test criteria and required solutions are described in Section 7.13. Initial and periodic verification data of the routine should be kept on file. Special cases where on-going verification are required is described in Section 7.14.</p><p class="depth0">11.0 Procedure</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Aqueous Sample Preparation--Dissolved Analytes</p><p class="depth0">11.1.1 For the determination of dissolved analytes in ground and surface waters, pipet an aliquot (20 mL) of the filtered, acid preserved sample into a 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tube. Add an appropriate volume of (1 + 1) nitric acid to adjust the acid concentration of the aliquot to approximate a 1% (v/v) nitric acid solution (e.g., add 0.4 mL (1 + 1) HNO3 to a 20 mL aliquot of sample). Cap the tube and mix. The sample is now ready for analysis (Section 1.3). Allowance for sample dilution should be made in the calculations. (If mercury is to be determined, a separate aliquot must be additionally acidified to contain 1% (v/v) HCl to match the signal response of mercury in the calibration standard and reduce memory interference effects. Section 1.9).</p><p class="depth0">Note: If a precipitate is formed during acidification, transport, or storage, the sample aliquot must be treated using the procedure described in Sections 11.2.2 through 11.2.7 prior to analysis.</p><p class="depth0">11.2 Aqueous Sample Preparation--Total Recoverable Analytes</p><p class="depth0">11.2.1 For the ``direct analysis'' of total recoverable analytes in drinking water samples containing turbidity <1 NTU, treat an unfiltered acid preserved sample aliquot using the sample preparation procedure described in Section 11.1.1 while making allowance for sample dilution in the data calculation (Section 1.2). For the determination of total recoverable analytes in all other aqueous samples or for preconcentrating drinking water samples prior to analysis follow the procedure given in Sections 11.2.2 through 11.2.7.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.2 For the determination of total recoverable analytes in aqueous samples (other than drinking water with <1 NTU turbidity), transfer a 100 mL (1 mL) aliquot from a well mixed, acid preserved sample to a 250 mL Griffin beaker (Sections 1.2, 1.3, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9). (When necessary, smaller sample aliquot volumes may be used.)</p><p class="depth0">Note: If the sample contains undissolved solids 1%, a well mixed, acid preserved aliquot containing no more than 1 g particulate material should be cautiously evaporated to near 10 mL and extracted using the acid-mixture procedure described in Sections 11.3.3 through 11.3.6.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.3 Add 2 mL (1+1) nitric acid and 1.0 mL of (1+1) hydrochloric acid to the beaker containing the measured volume of sample. Place the beaker on the hot plate for solution evaporation. The hot plate should be located in a fume hood and previously adjusted to provide evaporation at a temperature of approximately but no higher than 85 [deg]C. (See the following note.) The beaker should be covered with an elevated watch glass or other necessary steps should be taken to prevent sample contamination from the fume hood environment.</p><p class="depth0">Note: For proper heating adjust the temperature control of the hot plate such that an uncovered Griffin beaker containing 50 mL of water placed in the center of the hot plate can be maintained at a temperature approximately but no higher than 85 [deg]C.

temperature of the water will rise to approximately 95 [deg]C.)</p><p class="depth0">11.2.4 Reduce the volume of the sample aliquot to about 20 mL by gentle heating at 85 [deg]C. DO NOT BOIL. This step takes about two hours for a 100 mL aliquot with the rate of evaporation rapidly increasing as the sample volume approaches 20 mL.

Dry the sample to a constant weight at 60 [deg]C and record the dry weight (DW) for calculation of percent solids (Section 12.6). (The sample is dried at 60 [deg]C to prevent the loss of mercury and other possible volatile metallic compounds, to facilitate sieving, and to ready the sample for grinding.)</p><p class="depth0">11.3.2 To achieve homogeneity, sieve the dried sample using a 5-mesh polypropylene sieve and grind in a mortar and pestle. (The sieve, mortar and pestle should be cleaned between samples.) From the dried, ground material weigh accurately a representative 1.0 0.01 g aliquot (W) of the sample and transfer to a 250 mL Phillips beaker for acid extraction (Sections 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9).</p><p class="depth0">11.3.3 To the beaker add 4 mL of (1+1) HNO3 and 10 mL of (1+4) HCl.

A peristaltic pump must be used to introduce all solutions to the nebulizer. To allow equilibrium to be reached in the plasma, aspirate all solutions for 30 seconds after reaching the plasma before beginning integration of the background corrected signal to accumulate data. When possible, use the average value of replicate integration periods of the signal to be correlated to the analyte concentration. Flush the system with the rinse blank (Section 7.10.4) for a minimum of 60 seconds (Section 4.4) between each standard. The calibration line should consist of a minimum of a calibration blank and a high standard. Replicates of the blank and highest standard provide an optimal distribution of calibration standards to minimize the confidence band for a straight-line calibration in a response region with uniform variance.\20\</p><p class="depth0">11.4.5 After completion of the initial requirements of this method (Sections 10.3 and 10.4), samples should be analyzed in the same operational manner used in the calibration routine with the rinse blank also being used between all sample solutions, LFBs, LFMs, and check solutions (Section 7.10.4).</p><p class="depth0">11.4.6 During the analysis of samples, the laboratory must comply with the required quality control described in Sections 9.3 and 9.4. Only for the determination of dissolved analytes or the ``direct analysis'' of drinking water with turbidity of <1 NTU is the sample digestion step of the LRB, LFB, and LFM not required.</p><p class="depth0">11.4.7 Determined sample analyte concentrations that are 90% or more of the upper limit of the analyte LDR must be diluted with reagent water that has been acidified in the same manner as calibration blank and reanalyzed (see Section 11.4.8). Also, for the interelement spectral interference correction routines to remain valid during sample analysis, the interferant concentration must not exceed its LDR. If the interferant LDR is exceeded, sample dilution with acidified reagent water and reanalysis is required. In these circumstances analyte detection limits are raised and determination by another approved test procedure that is either more sensitive and/or interference free is recommended.</p><p class="depth0">11.4.8 When it is necessary to assess an operative matrix interference (e.g., signal reduction due to high dissolved solids), the tests described in Section 9.5 are recommended.</p><p class="depth0">11.4.9 Report data as directed in Section 12.0.</p><p class="depth0">11.5 If the method of standard additions (MSA) is used, standards are added at one or more levels to portions of a prepared sample. This technique \21\ compensates for enhancement or depression of an analyte signal by a matrix. It will not correct for additive interferences such as contamination, interelement interferences, or baseline shifts. This technique is valid in the linear range when the interference effect is constant over the range, the added analyte responds the same as the endogenous analyte, and the signal is corrected for additive interferences. The simplest version of this technique is the single-addition method. This procedure calls for two identical aliquots of the sample solution to be taken. To the first aliquot, a small volume of standard is added; while to the second aliquot, a volume of acid blank is added equal to the standard addition. The sample concentration is calculated by the following:

where:
C = Concentration of the standard solution (mg/L)S1 = Signal for fortified aliquotS2 = Signal for unfortified aliquotV1 = Volume of the standard addition (L)V2 = Volume of the sample aliquot (L) used for MSA</p><p class="depth0">For more than one fortified portion of the prepared sample, linear regression analysis can be applied using a computer or calculator program to obtain the concentration of the sample solution. An alternative to using the method of standard additions is use of the internal standard technique by adding one or more elements (not in the samples and verified not to cause an uncorrected interelement spectral interference) at the same concentration (which is sufficient for optimum precision) to the prepared samples (blanks and standards) that are affected the same as the analytes by the sample matrix. Use the ratio of analyte signal to the internal standard signal for calibration and quantitation.</p><p class="depth0">12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations</p><p class="depth0">12.1 Sample data should be reported in units of mg/L for aqueous samples and mg/kg dry weight for solid samples.</p><p class="depth0">12.2 For dissolved aqueous analytes (Section 11.1) report the data generated directly from the instrument with allowance for sample dilution. Do not report analyte concentrations below the IDL.</p><p class="depth0">12.3 For total recoverable aqueous analytes (Section 11.2), multiply solution analyte concentrations by the dilution factor 0.5, when 100 mL aliquot is used to produce the 50 mL final solution, and report data as instructed in Section 12.4. If a different aliquot volume other than 100 mL is used for sample preparation, adjust the dilution factor accordingly. Also, account for any additional dilution of the prepared sample solution needed to complete the determination of analytes exceeding 90% or more of the LDR upper limit. Do not report data below the determined analyte MDL concentration or below an adjusted detection limit reflecting smaller sample aliquots used in processing or additional dilutions required to complete the analysis.</p><p class="depth0">12.4 For analytes with MDLs <0.01 mg/L, round the data values to the thousandth place and report analyte concentrations up to three significant figures. For analytes with MDLs <0.01 mg/L round the data values to the 100th place and report analyte concentrations up to three significant figures.

The MDLs were determined in reagent blank matrix (best case situation). PTFE beakers were used to avoid boron and silica contamination from glassware with the final dilution to 50 mL completed in polypropylene centrifuged tubes. The listed MDLs for solids are estimates and were calculated from the aqueous MDL determinations.</p><p class="depth0">13.2 Data obtained from single laboratory method testing are summarized in Table 6 for five types of water samples consisting of drinking water, surface water, ground water, and two wastewater effluents. The data presented cover all analytes except cerium and titanium. Samples were prepared using the procedure described in Section 11.2. For each matrix, five replicate aliquots were prepared, analyzed and the average of the five determinations used to define the sample background concentration of each analyte. In addition, two pairs of duplicates were fortified at different concentration levels. For each method analyte, the sample background concentration, mean percent recovery, standard

deviation of the percent recovery, and relative percent difference between the duplicate fortified samples are listed in Table 6. The variance of the five replicate sample background determinations is included in the calculated standard deviation of the percent recovery when the analyte concentration in the sample was greater than the MDL. The tap and well waters were processed in Teflon and quartz beakers and diluted in polypropylene centrifuged tubes. The nonuse of borosilicate glassware is reflected in the precision and recovery data for boron and silica in those two sample types.</p><p class="depth0">13.3 Data obtained from single laboratory method testing are summarized in Table 7 for three solid samples consisting of EPA 884 Hazardous Soil, SRM 1645 River Sediment, and EPA 286 Electroplating Sludge.

Numerous opportunities for pollution prevention exist in laboratory operation. The EPA has established a preferred hierarchy of environmental management techniques that places pollution prevention as the management option of first choice. Whenever feasible, laboratory personnel should use pollution prevention techniques to address their waste generation (e.g., Section 7.8). When wastes cannot be feasibly reduced at the source, the Agency recommends recycling as the next best option.</p><p class="depth0">14.2 For information about pollution prevention that may be applicable to laboratories and research institutions, consult ``Less is Better: Laboratory Chemical Management for Waste Reduction'', available from the American Chemical Society's Department of Government Relations and Science Policy, 1155 16th Street NW., Washington, DC 20036, (202) 872-4477.</p><p class="depth0">15.0 Waste Management</p><p class="depth0">15.1 The Environmental Protection Agency requires that laboratory waste management practices be conducted consistent with all applicable rules and regulations.
