Upon payment of such claims, the FDIC will be subrogated to the claims of depositors in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 1821(g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Review of final determination. The final determination of the amount guaranteed shall be considered a final agency action of the FDIC reviewable in accordance with Chapter 7 of title 5, by the United States district court for the federal judicial district where the principal place of business of the depository institution is located. Any request for review of the final determination shall be filed with the appropriate district court not later than sixty (60) days of the date on which the final determination is issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payments on Guaranteed Debt of participating entities in default--(1)In general. The FDIC's obligation to pay holders of FDIC-guaranteed debt issued by a participating entity shall arise upon the uncured failure of such entity to make a timely payment of principal or interest as required under the debt instrument (a ``payment default'').</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>In general. The FDIC's obligation to pay holders of FDIC-guaranteed debt issued by a participating entity shall arise upon the uncured failure of such entity to make a timely payment of principal or interest as required under the debt instrument (a ``payment default'').</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Method of payment. Upon the occurrence of a payment default, the FDIC shall satisfy its guarantee obligation by making scheduled payments of principal and interest pursuant to the terms of the debt instrument through maturity, or in the case of mandatory convertible debt, through the mandatory conversion date (without regard to default or penalty provisions). Any principal payment on mandatory convertible debt shall be limited to amounts paid by holders under the issuance. The FDIC may in its discretion, at any time after the expiration of the guarantee period, elect to make a final payment of all outstanding principal and interest due under a guaranteed debt instrument whose maturity extends beyond that date. In such case, the FDIC shall not be liable for any prepayment penalty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Demand for payment; proofs of claim--(i)Payment through authorized representative. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, a demand for payment on the guaranteed amount shall be made on behalf of all holders of debt subject to a payment default that is made by a duly authorized representative of such debtholders if the issuer shall have elected to provide for one in the Master Agreement submitted pursuantSec. 370.6(b). Such demand must be accompanied by a proof of claim, which shall include evidence, to the extent not previously provided in the Master Agreement, in form and content satisfactory to the FDIC, of : the representative's financial and organizational capacity to act as representative; the representative's exclusive authority to act on behalf each and every debtholder and its fiduciary responsibility to the debtholder when acting as such, as established by the terms of the debt instrument; the occurrence of a payment default; and the authority to make an assignment of each debtholder's right, title, and interest in the FDIC-guaranteed debt to the FDIC and to effect the transfer to the FDIC of each debtholder's claim in any insolvency proceeding. This assignment shall include the right of the FDIC to receive any and all distributions on the debt from the proceeds of the receivership or bankruptcy estate. If any holder of the FDIC-guaranteed debt has received any distribution from the receivership or bankruptcy estate prior to the FDIC's payment under the guarantee, the guaranteed amount paid by the FDIC shall be reduced by the amount the holder has received in the distribution from the receivership or bankruptcy estate. All such demands must be made within 60 days of the occurrence of the payment default upon which the demand is based. Upon receipt of a conforming proof of claim, if timely filed, the FDIC will make a payment of the amount guaranteed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>Payment through authorized representative. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, a demand for payment on the guaranteed amount shall be made on behalf of all holders of debt subject to a payment default that is made by a duly authorized representative of such debtholders if the issuer shall have elected to provide for one in the Master Agreement submitted pursuantSec. 370.6(b). Such demand must be accompanied by a proof of claim, which shall include evidence, to the extent not previously provided in the Master Agreement, in form and content satisfactory to the FDIC, of : the representative's financial and organizational capacity to act as representative; the representative's exclusive authority to act on behalf each and every debtholder and its fiduciary responsibility to the debtholder when acting as such, as established by the terms of the debt instrument; the occurrence of a payment default; and the authority to make an assignment of each debtholder's right, title, and interest in the FDIC-guaranteed debt to the FDIC and to effect the transfer to the FDIC of each debtholder's claim in any insolvency proceeding. This assignment shall include the right of the FDIC to receive any and all distributions on the debt from the proceeds of the receivership or bankruptcy estate. If any holder of the FDIC-guaranteed debt has received any distribution from the receivership or bankruptcy estate prior to the FDIC's payment under the guarantee, the guaranteed amount paid by the FDIC shall be reduced by the amount the holder has received in the distribution from the receivership or bankruptcy estate. All such demands must be made within 60 days of the occurrence of the payment default upon which the demand is based. Upon receipt of a conforming proof of claim, if timely filed, the FDIC will make a payment of the amount guaranteed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Individual debtholders: Individual debtholders who are not represented by an authorized representative provided for in a Master Agreement submitted pursuant to Sec. 370.6(b), or who elect not to be represented by such authorized representative, may make demand for payment of the guaranteed amount

upon the FDIC. The FDIC may reject a demand made by a person who the FDIC determines has not opted out of representation by an authorized representative.

If any holder of the FDIC-guaranteed debt has received any distribution from the receivership or bankruptcy estate prior to the FDIC's payment under the guarantee, the guaranteed amount paid by the FDIC shall be reduced by the amount the holder has received in the distribution from the receivership or bankruptcy estate. All such demands must be made within 60 days of the occurrence of the payment default upon which the demand is based. Upon receipt of a conforming proof of claim, if timely filed, the FDIC will make a payment of the amount guaranteed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any demand under this subsection shall be made in writing and directed to the Director, Division of Resolutions and Receiverships, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Washington, DC., and must include all supporting evidence as set forth in the previous subsections, and shall certify to the accuracy thereof</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Demand period. Failure of the holder of the FDIC-guaranteed debt or an authorized representative to make demand for payment within sixty (60) days of the occurrence of payment default will deprive the holder of the FDIC-guaranteed debt of all further rights and remedies with respect to the guarantee claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Subrogation. Upon payment under either method under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the FDIC will be subrogated to the rights of any debtholder against the issuer, including in respect of any insolvency proceeding, to the extent of the payments made under the guarantee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Release and satisfaction. Payment under paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall constitute, to the extent of payments made, satisfaction of all FDIC obligations under the debt guarantee program with respect to that debtholder or holders. Acceptance of any such payments shall constitute a release of any liability of the FDIC under the debt guarantee program with respect to those payments. Each participating entity agrees and acknowledges that it shall be indebted to the FDIC for any payments made under these provisions (including amounts paid to a participating entity in return for its assumption of a guaranteed debt issuance) and shall honor immediately a demand by the FDIC for reimbursement therefore. A participating entity's undertakings in this regard shall be evidenced and governed by the ``Master Agreement'' it shall execute and submit, in connection with its election pursuant to Sec. 370.6(b) to participate in the Debt Guarantee Program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Final determination; review of final determination. The FDIC's determination under this paragraph shall be a final administrative determination subject to judicial review. The holder of FDIC-guaranteed debt shall have the right to seek judicial review of the FDIC's final determination in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the United States District Court for the federal district where the issuer's principal place of business was located. Failure of the holder of the FDIC-guaranteed debt to seek such judicial review within sixty (60) days of the date of the rendering of the final determination will deprive the holder of the FDIC-guaranteed debt of all further rights and remedies with respect to the guarantee claim.
