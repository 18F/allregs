                            <p class="depth0">After September 30, 1979, road locomotives with corner stairway openings must be equipped with (a) uncoupling mechanisms that can be operated safely from the bottom stairway opening step as well as ground level, and (b) the vertical handholds and horizontal end handholds prescribed in Sec. 231.30(e) and (g). No part of the uncoupling mechanism may extend into the stairway opening or end platform area when the mechanism is in its normal position or when it is operated. Each carrier shall so equip forty percent (40 percent) of its road locomotives by October 1, 1977, seventy percent (70 percent) by October 1, 1978, and all its road locomotives by October 1, 1979.
