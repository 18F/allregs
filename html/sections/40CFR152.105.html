                            <p class="depth0">The Agency will not begin or continue the review of an application that is incomplete. If the Agency determines that an application is incomplete or that further information is needed in order to complete the Agency's review, the Agency will notify the applicant of the deficiencies and allow the applicant 75 days to make corrections or additions to complete the application. If the applicant believes that the deficiencies cannot be corrected within 75 days, he must notify the Agency within those 75 days of the date on which he expects to complete the

application. If, after 75 days, the applicant has not responded, or if the applicant subsequently fails to complete the application within the time scheduled for completion, the Agency will terminate any action on such application, and will treat the application as if it had been withdrawn by the applicant. Any subsequent submission relating to the same product must be submitted as a new application.</p>
