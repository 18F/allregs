Submission of a case without hearing does not relieve a party from the necessity of proving the facts supporting that party's allegation or defenses. Affidavits, depositions, admissions, answers to interrogatories, and stipulations may be employed to supplement other documentary evidence in the Board record. The Board may permit such submission to be supplemented by oral argument (transcribed if requested) and by briefs in accordance with Rule 26.</p>
