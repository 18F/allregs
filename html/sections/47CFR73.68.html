                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each AM station permittee authorized to construct a new directional antenna system which will be subject to a proof of performance based on field strength measurements, as described in Sec.  73.151(a) or (b), must install the sampling system in accordance with the following specifications:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Devices used to extract or sample the current and the transmission line connecting the sampling elements to the antenna monitor must provide accurate and stable signals to the monitor (e.g., rigidly mounted and non-rotatable loops and all system components protected from physical and environmental disturbances).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sampling lines for directional antennas may be of different lengths provided the phase difference of signals at the monitor are less than 0.5 degrees between the shortest and longest cable lengths due to temperature variations to which the system is exposed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other configurations of sampling systems may be used upon demonstration of stable operation to the FCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An AM station permittee authorized to construct a directional antenna system which will be subject to a proof of performance based on moment method modeling, as described in Sec.  73.151(c), shall install a sampling system conforming to the requirements set forth in that section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A station having an antenna sampling system constructed according to the specifications given in paragraph (a) of this section may obtain approval of that system by submitting an informal letter request to the FCC in Washington, DC, Attention: Audio Division, Media Bureau. The request for approval, signed by the licensee or authorized representative, must contain sufficient information to show that the sampling system is in compliance with all requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2">Note to paragraph (c): A public notice dated December 9, 1985 giving additional information on approval of antenna sampling systems is available through the Internet at http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/decdoc/letter/1985-12-09-sample.html.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the event that the antenna monitor sampling system is temporarily out of service for repair or replacement, the station may be operated, pending completion of repairs or replacement, for a period not exceeding 120 days without further authority from the FCC if all other operating parameters and the field monitoring point values are within the limits specified on the station authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the antenna sampling system is modified or components of the sampling system are replaced, the following procedure shall be followed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Special Temporary Authority (see Sec.  73.1635) shall be requested and obtained from the Commission's Audio Division, Media Bureau in Washington to operate with parameters at variance with licensed values pending issuance of a modified license specifying parameters subsequent to modification or replacement of components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Immediately prior to modification or replacement of components of the sampling system, and after a verification that all monitoring point values and operating parameters are within the limits or tolerances specified in the rules, the following indications must be recorded for each radiation pattern: Final plate current and plate voltage, common point current, antenna monitor phase and current indications, and the field strength at each monitoring point. Subsequent to these modifications or changes the procedure must be repeated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If monitoring point field strengths or antenna monitor parameters exceed

allowable limits following the replacement or modification of that portion of the sampling system above the base of the towers, a partial proof of performance shall be executed in accordance with Sec.  73.154 . The partial proof of performance shall be accompanied by common point impedance measurements made in accordance with Sec.  73.54.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Request for modification of license shall be submitted to the FCC in Washington, DC, within 30 days of the date of sampling system modification or replacement. Such request shall specify the transmitter plate voltage and plate current, common point current, base currents and their ratios, antenna monitor phase and current indications, and all other data obtained pursuant to this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If an existing sampling system is found to be patently of marginal construction, or where the performance of a directional antenna is found to be unsatisfactory, and this deficiency reasonably may be attributed, in whole or in part, to inadequacies in the antenna monitoring system, the FCC may require the reconstruction of the sampling system in accordance with requirements specified above.
