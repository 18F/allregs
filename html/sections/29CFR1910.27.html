                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Design requirements-(1) Design considerations. All ladders, appurtenances, and fastenings shall be designed to meet the following load requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The minimum design live load shall be a single concentrated load of 200 pounds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The number and position of additional concentrated live-load units of 200 pounds each as determined from anticipated usage of the ladder shall be considered in the design.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The live loads imposed by persons occupying the ladder shall be considered to be concentrated at such points as will cause the maximum stress in the structural member being considered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The weight of the ladder and attached appurtenances together with the live load shall be considered in the design of rails and fastenings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Design stresses. Design stresses for wood components of ladders shall not exceed those specified in Sec. 1910.25. All wood parts of fixed ladders shall meet the requirements of Sec. 1910.25(b).
For fixed ladders consisting of wood side rails and wood rungs or cleats, used at a pitch in the range 75 degrees to 90 degrees, and intended for use by no more than one person per section, single ladders as described in Sec. 1910.25(c)(3)(ii) are acceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Specific features-(1) Rungs and cleats. (i) All rungs shall have a minimum diameter of three-fourths inch for metal ladders, except as covered in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section and a minimum diameter of 1\1/8\ inches for wood ladders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The distance between rungs, cleats, and steps shall not exceed 12 inches and shall be uniform throughout the length of the ladder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The minimum clear length of rungs or cleats shall be 16 inches.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Rungs, cleats, and steps shall be free of splinters, sharp edges, burrs, or projections which may be a hazard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The rungs of an individual-rung ladder shall be so designed that the foot cannot slide off the end. A suggested design is shown in figure D-1.
