                            <p class="depth0">Funds appropriated by Congress for the education of Indians may be  used for making educational loans and grants to aid students of one- fourth or more degree of Indian blood attending accredited institutions  of higher education or other accredited schools offering vocational and  technical training who reside within the exterior boundaries of Indian  reservations under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs or  on trust or restricted lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of  Indian Affairs. Such educational loans and grants may be made also to  students of one-fourth or more degree of Indian blood who reside near  the reservation when a denial of such loans or grants would have a  direct effect upon Bureau programs within the reservation. After  students meeting these eligibility requirements are taken care of,  Indian students who do not meet the residency requirements   but are otherwise eligible may be considered.
