                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The accrediting entity must decide which adverse action to take  based on the seriousness and type of violation and on the extent to  which the accredited agency or approved person has corrected or failed  to correct deficiencies of which it has been previously informed. The  accrediting entity must notify an accredited agency or approved person  in writing of its decision to take an adverse action against the agency  or person. The accrediting entity's written notice must identify the  deficiencies prompting imposition of the adverse action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Before taking adverse action, the accrediting entity may, in its  discretion, advise an accredited agency or approved person in writing of  any deficiencies in its performance that may warrant an adverse action  and provide it with an opportunity to demonstrate that an adverse action  would be unwarranted before the adverse action is imposed. If the  accrediting entity takes the adverse action without such prior notice,  it must provide a similar opportunity to demonstrate that the adverse  action was unwarranted after the adverse action is imposed, and may  withdraw the adverse action based on the information provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The provisions in Sec. Sec. 96.25 and 96.26 govern requests for  and use of information.</p>
