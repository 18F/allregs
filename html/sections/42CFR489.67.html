                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each participating HHA that does not meet the criteria for waiver under Sec. 489.62 must submit to CMS in a form as CMS may specify, a surety bond for a term beginning January 1, 1998. If an annual bond is submitted for the initial term, it must be effective through the end of the HHA's current fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Type of bond. The type of bond required to be submitted by an HHA under this subpart may be either--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An annual bond (that is, a bond that specifies an effective annual period corresponding to the HHA's fiscal year); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A continuous bond (that is, a bond that remains in full force and effect from term to term unless it is terminated or canceled as provided for in the bond or as otherwise provided by law) that is updated by the Surety, via the issuance of a rider, for a particular fiscal year for which the bond amount has changed or will change.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA. (1) An HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA must submit a surety bond with its enrollment application (Form CMS-855, OMB number 0938-0685). The term of the initial surety bond must be effective from the effective date of provider agreement as specified in Sec. 489.13 of this part. However, if the effective date of the provider agreement is less than 30 days before the end of the HHA's current fiscal year, the HHA may obtain a bond effective through the end of the next fiscal year, provided the amount of the bond is the greater of $75,000 or 20 percent of the amount determined from the computation specified in Sec. 489.65(c) as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA must submit a surety bond with its enrollment application (Form CMS-855, OMB number 0938-0685).

An HHA that undergoes a change of ownership must submit the surety bond to CMS not later than the effective date of the change of ownership and the bond must be effective from the effective date of the change of ownership through the remainder of the HHA's fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Government-operated HHA that loses its waiver. A government-operated HHA that, as of January 1, 1998, meets the criteria for waiver under Sec. 489.62 but thereafter is determined by CMS to not meet such criteria, must submit a surety bond to CMS within 60 days after it receives notice from CMS that it no longer meets the criteria for waiver.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Change of Surety. An HHA that obtains a replacement surety bond from a different Surety to cover the remaining term of a previously obtained bond must submit the new surety bond to

CMS within 30 days of obtaining the bond from the new Surety.
