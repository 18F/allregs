An FDIC-supervised institution shall not make, increase, extend, or renew any designated loan unless the building or mobile home and any personal property securing the loan is covered by flood insurance for the term of the loan. The amount of insurance must be at least equal to the lesser of the outstanding principal balance of the designated loan or the maximum limit of coverage available for the particular type of property under the Act. Flood insurance coverage under the Act is limited to the building or mobile home and any personal property that secures a loan and not the land itself.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Table funded loans. An FDIC-supervised institution that acquires a loan from a mortgage broker or other entity through table funding shall be considered to be making a loan for the purpose of this part.</p>
