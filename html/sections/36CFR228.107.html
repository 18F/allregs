The authorized Forest officer shall make a decision on the approval of a surface use plan of operations as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the authorized Forest officer will not be able to make a decision on the proposed plan within 3 working days after the conclusion of the 30-day notice period provided for by 30 U.S.C. 226(f), the authorized Forest officer shall advise the appropriate Bureau of Land Management office and the operator as soon as such delay becomes apparent, either in writing or orally with subsequent written confirmation, that additional time will be needed to process the plan. The authorized Forest officer shall explain the reason why additional time is needed and project the date by which a decision on the plan will likely be made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the review of a surface use plan of operations has been completed, the authorized Forest officer shall promptly notify the operator and the appropriate Bureau of Land Management office, in writing, that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The plan is approved as submitted:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The plan is approved subject to specified conditions; or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The plan is disapproved for the reasons stated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of decision.

The authorized Forest officer shall immediately forward a decision on a surface

use plan of operations to the appropriate Bureau of Land Management office and the operator.
