During the idle mode, hold speed  within [ten percent of the manufacturer's specified idle engine speed.  For Phase 2 Class I, I-B, and II engines equipped with an engine speed  governor, during Mode 1 or Mode 6 hold both the specified speed and load  within [five percent of point, during Modes 2-3, or Modes 7-8 hold the  specified load with [five percent of point, during Modes 4-5 or Modes 9- 10, hold the specified load within the larger range provided by [0.27 Nm  ([0.2 lb-ft), or [ten (10) percent of point, and during the idle mode  hold the specified speed within [ten percent of the manufacturer's  specified idle engine speed (see Table 1 in Appendix A of this subpart  for a description of test Modes). The use of alternative test procedures  is allowed if approved in advance by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the operating conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this  section for Class I, I-B, and II engines using Mode Points 2, 3, 4, and  5 cannot be maintained, the Administrator may authorize deviations from  the specified load conditions. Such deviations may not exceed 10 percent  of the maximum torque at the test speed. The minimum deviations, above  and below the specified load, necessary for stable operation shall be  determined by the manufacturer and approved by the Administrator prior  to the test run.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Do not include power generated during the idle mode, Mode 11, in  the calculation of emission results.
