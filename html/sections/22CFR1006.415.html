You are  not required to continue the transactions,   however, and you may consider termination. You should make a decision  about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any,  only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no- cost time extensions) with any excluded person, or under which an  excluded person is a principal, unless you obtain an exception under  Sec. 1006.120.</p>
