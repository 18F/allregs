                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Canvass of landholding agencies. On a quarterly basis, HUD will canvass landholding agencies to collect information about property described as unutilized, underutilized, excess, or surplus, in surveys conducted by the agencies under section 202 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (40 U.S.C. 483), Executive Order 12512, and 41 CFR part 101-47.800. Each canvass will collect information on properties not previously reported and about property reported previously the status or classification of which has changed or for which any of the information reported on the property checklist has changed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> HUD will request descriptive information on properties sufficient to make a reasonable determination, under the criteria described below, of the suitability of a property for use as a facility to assist the homeless.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> HUD will direct landholding agencies to respond to requests for information within 25 days of receipt of such requests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agency annual report. By December 31 of each year, each landholding agency must notify HUD regarding the current availability status and classification of each property controlled by the agency that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Was included in a list of suitable properties published that year by HUD, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Remains available for application for use to assist the homeless, or has become available for application during that year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> GSA inventory. HUD will collect information, in the same manner as described in paragraph (a) of this section, from GSA regarding property that is in GSA's current inventory of excess or surplus property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Change in status. If the information provided on the property checklist changes subsequent to HUD's determination of suitability, and the property remains unutilized, underutilized, excess or surplus, the landholding agency shall submit a revised property checklist in response to the next quarterly canvass. HUD will make a new determination of suitability and, if it differs from the previous determination, republish the property information in the Federal Register. For example, property determined unsuitable for national security concerns may no longer be subject to security restrictions, or property determined suitable may subsequently be found to be contaminated.</p><p class="depth2">Effective Date Note: At 56 FR 23794, 23795, May 24, 1991, part 581 was added, effective on May 24, 1991, except for Sec.  581.3 which will not become effective until approved by the District Court for the District of Columbia, pending further proceedings.</p>
