                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Recommended measures. Based on the annual review and requests for research quota as described in paragraph (h) of this section, the Bluefish Monitoring Committee shall recommend to the Coastal Migratory Committee of the MAFMC and the ASMFC the following measures to ensure that the ACL specified by the process outlined in Sec. 648.160(a) will not be exceeded:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A fishery-level ACT;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Research quota set from a range of 0 to 3 percent of TALs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Commercial minimum fish size;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Minimum mesh size;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Recreational possession limit set from a range of 0 to 20 bluefish;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Recreational minimum fish size;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Recreational season;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Restrictions on gear other than otter trawls and gill nets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Changes, as appropriate, to the SBRM, including the CV-based performance standard, the means by which discard data are collected/obtained, fishery stratification, the process for prioritizing observer sea-day allocations, reports, and/or industry-funded observers or observer set aside programs; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Modification of existing AM measures and ACT control rules utilized by the Bluefish Monitoring Committee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> TAL--(1) Recreational harvest limit. If research quota is specified as described in paragraph (g) of this section, the recreational harvest limit will be based on the TAL remaining after the deduction of the research quota.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Commercial quota. If 17 percent of the TAL is less than 10.5 million lb (4.8 million kg) and the recreational fishery is not projected to land its harvest

limit for the upcoming year, the commercial fishery may be allocated up to 10.5 million lb (4.8 million kg) as its quota, provided that the combination of the projected recreational landings and the commercial quota does not exceed the TAL. If research quota is specified as described in paragraph (g) of this section, the commercial quota will be based on the TAL remaining after the deduction of the research quota.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Annual fishing measures. The MAFMC's Coastal Migratory Committee shall review the recommendations of the Bluefish Monitoring Committee. Based on these recommendations and any public comment, the Coastal Migratory Committee shall recommend to the MAFMC measures necessary to ensure that the ACL will not be exceeded. The MAFMC shall review these recommendations and, based on the recommendations and any public comment, recommend to the Regional Administrator by September 1 measures necessary to ensure that the applicable ACL will not be exceeded. The MAFMC's recommendations must include supporting documentation, as appropriate, concerning the environmental, economic, and social impacts of the recommendations. The Regional Administrator shall review these recommendations and any recommendations of the ASMFC. After such review, NMFS will publish a proposed rule in the Federal Register as soon as practicable, to implement an ACL, ACTs, research quota, a coastwide commercial quota, individual state commercial quotas, a recreational harvest limit, and additional management measures for the commercial and recreational fisheries to ensure that the ACL will not be exceeded. After considering public comment, NMFS will publish a final rule in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Distribution of annual commercial quota. (1) The annual commercial quota will be distributed to the states, based upon the following percentages; state each followed by its allocation in parentheses: ME (0.6685); NH (0.4145); MA (6.7167); RI (6.8081); CT (1.2663); NY (10.3851); NJ (14.8162) DE (1.8782); MD (3.0018); VA (11.8795); NC (32.0608); SC (0.0352); GA (0.0095); and FL (10.0597). Note: The sum of all state allocations does not add to 100 because of rounding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Quota transfers and combinations. Any state implementing a state commercial quota for bluefish may request approval from the Regional Administrator to transfer part or all of its annual quota to one or more states. Two or more states implementing a state commercial quota for bluefish may request approval from the Regional Administrator to combine their quotas, or part of their quotas, into an overall regional quota. Requests for transfer or combination of commercial quotas for bluefish must be made by individual or joint letter(s) signed by the principal state official with marine fishery management responsibility and expertise, or his/her previously named designee, for each state involved. The letter(s) must certify that all pertinent state requirements have been met and identify the states involved and the amount of quota to be transferred or combined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Within 10 working days following the receipt of the letter(s) from the states involved, the Regional Administrator shall notify the appropriate state officials of the disposition of the request. In evaluating requests to transfer a quota or combine quotas, the Regional Administrator shall consider whether:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transfer or combination would preclude the overall annual quota from being fully harvested;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The transfer addresses an unforeseen variation or contingency in the fishery; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The transfer is consistent with the objectives of the Bluefish FMP and Magnuson-Stevens Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The transfer of quota or the combination of quotas will be valid only for the calendar year for which the request was made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A state may not submit a request to transfer quota or combine quotas if a request to which it is party is pending before the Regional Administrator. A state may submit a new request when it receives notification that the Regional Administrator has disapproved the previous request or when notification of the approval of the

transfer or combination has been published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Based upon any changes in the landings data available from the states for the base years 1981-89, the ASMFC and the MAFMC may recommend to the Regional Administrator that the states' shares specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section be revised. The MAFMC's and the ASMFC's recommendation must include supporting documentation, as appropriate, concerning the environmental and economic impacts of the recommendation. The Regional Administrator shall review the recommendation of the ASMFC and the MAFMC. After such review, NMFS will publish a proposed rule in the Federal Register to implement a revision in the state shares. After considering public comment, NMFS will publish a final rule in the Federal Register to implement the changes in allocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Research quota. See Sec. 648.21(g).
