Figure 8 is as follows:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17AU01.009</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Where it is not possible to accomplish the objective of paragraphs (i), (j), and (k) of this section, interior metallic pipes may be used to the maximum practicable extent to gain access to the electric service ground as shown in Figure 9. Note that the water pipe in Figure 9 is electrically continuous between electric and telecommunications bonds to the cold water pipe and it is used only as a portion of a bonding conductor and, therefore, does not have to be ``acceptable'' as a ground electrode but may be floating (isolated from ground by a plastic pipe section). ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, NEC , requires that metal piping be used as a bonding conductor in this manner only when

the connectors to the pipe are within 1.5 m (5 ft) of where the pipe enters the premises. This is not the preferred installation. The RUS preferred installation has the telecommunications primary station protector grounded directly to an accessible location near the power grounding system. See paragraph (l) of this section. Figure 9 is as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17AU01.010</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Where the telecommunications premises system at a customer's access location is grounded to a separate electrode (of any type) this telecommunications grounding electrode must be bonded to the electric grounding system with a No. 6 AWG or larger copper insulated grounding conductor. Bonding of separate electrodes is a requirement of the ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, NEC .</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> The NID, BET, or fused primary station protector pair size shall be selected for the number of lines anticipated within five years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> When lightning damage is considered probable or customer access locations are remote from the borrower's headquarters, use of maximum duty gas tube primary station protectors incorporated in NIDs, BETs, or fused primary station protectors should be considered. (See RUS TE&CM; 823, Electrical Protection by Use of Gas Tube Arresters).

Thus for a 22 AWG drop, a fuse link of No. 24 AWG or finer copper wire shall be provided. If the cable circuit is No. 24 gauge or finer, the cable conductors serve as the fuse link for the 22 AWG aerial service wire and no separate fuse link is necessary. (Note: The fuse link or the facilities serving as the fuse link must be located between the telecommunications facilities that are exposed to possible power cross and the customer drop where there is no exposure to possible power cross.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> RUS's buried plant practices require buried main line plant to be protected against power contacts to aerial plant extensions and aerial inserts by No. 24 AWG fuse links at every buried-aerial junction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> In aerial cable plant, fuse links are usually provided by No. 24 AWG leads on filled terminal blocks regardless of the gauge of the cable conductors. This practice is acceptable if the ampacity of the aerial service wire is sufficiently higher than the fuse link's ampacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> The grounding and bonding of each NID, BET, or fused primary station protector shall be selected by consulting paragraphs (i) through (n) of this section. The ``first choice'' assembly unit shall be selected whenever the prevailing conditions make its use practicable.

RUS accepted and RUS technically accepted pipe type ground clamps and grounding connectors shall be used for bonding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(bb)</em> Where NID, BET, or fused station protector assembly units require grounding conductor connections to pipe systems, the following apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The connection shall be made to a cold water pipe of an operating water system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The connection point shall be preferably inside the building;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Allow a minimum of 6 in. (152 mm) between the last fastener and the point where the grounding conductor first touches the water pipe;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Leave 2 in. (50.8 mm) of slack in the grounding conductor to avoid breaking the conductor at the terminating point. Tape the grounding conductor to the pipe where possible to avoid movement. In no case, shall the grounding conductor be coiled or wrapped around the pipe;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The pipe shall be cleaned with fine sand paper to make a good electrical connection. Care should be taken to avoid damaging the pipe while cleaning it;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Attach the pipe grounding conductor connector to the cleaned area of pipe and tighten. Care shall be exercised to avoid deforming, crushing, or otherwise damaging the pipe. A simple continuity check with an ohmmeter between the connector and the pipe will indicate whether or not a good electrical contact has been made. Set the ohmmeter to ``Rx1'' scale to ensure that a low resistance contact is made;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A warning tag shall be attached to the ground clamp with the following or equivalent statement: ``Call the telecommunications company if this connector or grounding conductor is loose or must be removed;'' and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> When the water pipe is used, the ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, NEC , requires that metal piping be used as a bonding conductor in this manner only when the connections to the pipe are within 5 ft (1.5 m) of where the pipe enters the premises.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(cc)</em> Bonding conductors shall consist of either copper or tinned copper insulated wires of appropriate sizes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Bonding conductors shall be run and attached in the same manner as grounding conductors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Attaching and terminating devices for bonding conductors shall be adequate for the size of wire involved.

This requirement is included for cases where the telecommunications company is not allowed, for some reason, to observe the RUS preferred grounding method of attaching the primary protector grounding conductor directly to an accessible point on the

building electric service grounding system. RUS believes that if the primary protector location can be sited within 6 ft (2 m) of the electric service ground rod then the electric service ground rod could be used as the preferred telecommunications grounding electrode and a separate telecommunications ground rod is unnecessary);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A hole, 15 in. (350 mm) deep and 6 in. (150 mm) in diameter, shall be dug at the location where the ground rod is to be driven;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where ``slip-on'' type ground rod clamps are used instead of ``clamp-around'' type clamps, the ground rod clamps shall be placed onto the rod prior to driving the rod into the ground (Note there should be one clamp for the NID, BET, or fused station protector grounding conductor and one clamp for the conductor required to bond the telecommunications ground rod to the electric grounding system). However, the clamp shall not be tightened until the rod is completely driven. The end of the rod shall be placed in the bottom of the hole and the rod shall be aligned vertically adjacent to one wall of the hole prior to driving. The rod shall be driven until its tip is 12 in. (300 mm) below final grade. The grounding conductor shall then be attached, the clamp shall be tightened, and hole backfilled. Clamps employed in this manner shall be suitable for direct burial and shall be RUS accepted or RUS technically accepted; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where rods are manually driven, a large number of blows from a light hammer (4 lbs (1.8 kg)) shall be used instead of heavy sledgehammer type blows. This should keep the rod from bending.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(ee)</em> Terminations on fuseless primary station protectors incorporated in NIDs and on fused primary station protectors shall be as shown in Figures 10, 11, 12, and 13 of paragraph (ee)(1) of this section, Figure 14 of paragraph (ee)(4) of this section, and Figure 15 of paragraph (ee)(6) of this section. The inner jackets of buried service wires and outer jackets of cables used as service drops shall be extended into the NID or the fused primary station protector. A 10 in. (250 mm) length of each spare wire shall be left in NIDs or fused primary station protectors. The spare wires shall be coiled up neatly and stored in the NID or fused primary station protector housing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The shields of buried service wires may be connected to the ground binding post using RUS accepted or RUS technically accepted buried service shield bond connectors as shown in Figure 10 for NIDs and Figure 11 for fused primary station protectors. RUS accepted or RUS technically accepted buried service wire harness wires designed for customer access location installations may also be used for terminating buried service wire shields to the ground binding post of the NID as shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for fused primary station protectors.

The installation of the shield bond connector and bonding harness wire shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The shield and other conductors at the fuseless primary station protector incorporated in the NID shall be

terminated as shown on Figure 14 in paragraph (ee)(4) of this section. The pronged or cupped washer shall be placed above the shield. The grounding conductor shall be placed around the post on top of the pronged or cupped washer. A flat washer shall be placed above the grounding conductor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The station wire signaling ground conductor, if required, shall be placed above the first flat washer and beneath the second flat washer as indicated in Figure 14 as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17AU01.016</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The shield and other conductors at the fused primary station protector shall be terminated as shown on Figure 15 in paragraph (ee)(6) of this section.
