                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Negotiation of forward pricing rate agreements (FPRA's) may be  requested by the contracting officer or the contractor or initiated by  the administrative contracting officer (ACO). In determining whether or  not to establish such an agreement, the ACO should consider whether the  benefits to be derived from the agreement are commensurate with the  effort of establishing and monitoring it. Normally, FPRA's should be  negotiated only with contractors having a significant volume of  Government contract proposals. The cognizant contract administration  agency shall determine whether an FPRA will be established.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ACO shall obtain the contractor's forward pricing rate  proposal and require that it include cost or pricing data that are  accurate, complete, and current as of the date of submission (but see  15.407-3(c)). The ACO shall invite the cognizant contract auditor and  contracting offices having a significant interest to participate in  developing a Government objective and in the negotiations. Upon  completing negotiations, the ACO shall prepare a price negotiation  memorandum (PNM) (see 15.406-3) and forward copies of the PNM and FPRA  to the cognizant auditor and to all contracting offices that are known  to be affected by the FPRA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The FPRA shall provide specific terms and conditions covering  expiration, application, and data requirements for systematic monitoring  to ensure the validity of the rates. The agreement shall provide for  cancellation at the option of either party and shall require the  contractor to submit to the ACO and to the cognizant contract auditor  any significant change in cost or pricing data used to support the FPRA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When an FPRA is invalid, the contractor should submit and  negotiate a new proposal to reflect the changed conditions. If an FPRA  has not been established or has been invalidated, the ACO will issue a  forward pricing rate recommendation (FPRR) to buying activities with  documentation to assist negotiators. In the absence of an FPRA or FPRR,  the ACO shall include support for rates utilized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The ACO may negotiate continuous updates to the FPRA. The FPRA  will provide specific terms and conditions covering notification,  application, and data requirements for systematic monitoring to ensure  the validity of the rates.
