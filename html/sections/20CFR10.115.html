                                Sec. 10.115  What evidence is needed to establish a claim?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Forms CA-1, CA-2, CA-5 and CA-5b describe the basic evidence  required. OWCP may send a request for additional evidence to the  claimant and to his or her representative, if any; however the burden of  proof still remains with the claimant. Evidence should be submitted in  writing. The evidence submitted must be reliable, probative and  substantial. Each claim for compensation must meet five requirements  before OWCP can accept it. These requirements, which the employee must  establish to meet his or her burden of proof, are as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The claim was filed within the time limits specified by the  FECA;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The injured person was, at the time of injury, an employee of  the United States as defined in 5 U.S.C. 8101(1) and Sec. 10.5(h) of  this part;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The fact that an injury, disease or death occurred;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The injury, disease or death occurred while the employee was in  the performance of duty; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The medical condition for which compensation or medical benefits  is claimed is causally related to the claimed injury, disease or death.  Neither the fact that the condition manifests itself during a period of  Federal employment, nor the belief of the claimant that factors of  employment caused or aggravated the condition, is sufficient in itself  to establish causal relationship.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In all claims, the claimant is responsible for submitting, or  arranging for submittal of, a medical report from the attending  physician. For wage loss benefits, the claimant must also submit medical  evidence showing that the condition claimed is disabling. The rules for  submitting medical reports are found in Sec. Sec. 10.330 through  10.333.</p>
