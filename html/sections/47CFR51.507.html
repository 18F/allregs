Costs of shared facilities may be apportioned either through usage-sensitive charges or capacity-based flat-rated charges, if the state commission finds that such rates reasonably reflect the costs imposed by the various users.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Recurring costs shall be recovered through recurring charges, unless an incumbent LEC proves to a state commission that such recurring costs are de minimis. Recurring costs shall be considered de minimis when the costs of administering the recurring charge would be excessive in relation to the amount of the recurring costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> State commissions may, where reasonable, require incumbent LECs to recover nonrecurring costs through recurring charges over a reasonable period of time. Nonrecurring charges shall be allocated efficiently among requesting telecommunications carriers, and shall not permit an incumbent LEC to recover more than the total forward-looking economic cost of providing the applicable element.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> State commissions shall establish different rates for elements in at least three defined geographic areas within the state to reflect geographic cost differences.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To establish geographically-deaveraged rates, state commissions may use existing density-related zone pricing plans described in Sec. 69.123 of this chapter, or other such cost-related zone plans established pursuant to state law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In states not using such existing plans, state commissions must create a

minimum of three cost-related rate zones.
