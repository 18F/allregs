Any such system deemed to have optimized corrosion control under this paragraph, and which has treatment in place, shall continue to operate and maintain optimal corrosion control treatment and meet any requirements that the State determines appropriate to ensure optimal corrosion control treatment is maintained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A small or medium-size water system is deemed to have optimized corrosion control if the system meets the lead and copper action levels during each of two consecutive six-month monitoring periods conducted in accordance with Sec.  141.86.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any water system may be deemed by the State to have optimized corrosion control treatment if the system demonstrates to the satisfaction of the State that it has conducted activities equivalent to the corrosion control steps applicable to such system under this section. If the State makes this determination, it shall provide the system with written notice explaining the basis for its decision and shall specify the water quality control parameters representing optimal corrosion control in accordance with Sec.  141.82(f). Water systems deemed to have optimized corrosion control under this paragraph shall operate in compliance with the State-designated optimal water quality control parameters in accordance with Sec.  141.82(g) and continue to conduct lead and copper tap and water quality parameter sampling in accordance with Sec.  141.86(d)(3) and Sec.  141.87(d), respectively. A system shall provide the State with the following information in order to support a determination under this paragraph:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The results of all test samples collected for each of the water quality parameters in Sec.  141.82(c)(3).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A report explaining the test methods used by the water system to evaluate the corrosion control treatments listed in Sec.  141.82(c)(1), the results of all tests conducted, and the basis for the system's selection of optimal corrosion control treatment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A report explaining how corrosion control has been installed and how it is being maintained to insure minimal lead and copper concentrations at consumers' taps; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The results of tap water samples collected in accordance with Sec.  141.86 at least once every six months for one

year after corrosion control has been installed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any water system is deemed to have optimized corrosion control if it submits results of tap water monitoring conducted in accordance with Sec.  141.86 and source water monitoring conducted in accordance with Sec.  141.88 that demonstrates for two consecutive 6-month monitoring periods that the difference between the 90th percentile tap water lead level computed under Sec.  141.80(c)(3), and the highest source water lead concentration is less than the Practical Quantitation Level for lead specified in Sec.  141.89(a)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Those systems whose highest source water lead level is below the Method Detection Limit may also be deemed to have optimized corrosion control under this paragraph if the 90th percentile tap water lead level is less than or equal to the Practical Quantitation Level for lead for two consecutive 6-month monitoring periods.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any water system deemed to have optimized corrosion control in accordance with this paragraph shall continue monitoring for lead and copper at the tap no less frequently than once every three calendar years using the reduced number of sites specified in Sec.  141.86(c) and collecting the samples at times and locations specified in Sec.  141.86(d)(4)(iv). Any such system that has not conducted a round of monitoring pursuant to Sec.  141.86(d) since September 30, 1997, shall complete a round of monitoring pursuant to this paragraph no later than September 30, 2000.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any water system deemed to have optimized corrosion control pursuant to this paragraph shall notify the State in writing pursuant to Sec.  141.90(a)(3) of any upcoming long-term change in treatment or addition of a new source as described in that section. The State must review and approve the addition of a new source or long-term change in water treatment before it is implemented by the water system. The State may require any such system to conduct additional monitoring or to take other action the State deems appropriate to ensure that such systems maintain minimal levels of corrosion in the distribution system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> As of July 12, 2001, a system is not deemed to have optimized corrosion control under this paragraph, and shall implement corrosion control treatment pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section unless it meets the copper action level.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any system triggered into corrosion control because it is no longer deemed to have optimized corrosion control under this paragraph shall implement corrosion control treatment in accordance with the deadlines in paragraph (e) of this section. Any such large system shall adhere to the schedule specified in that paragraph for medium-size systems, with the time periods for completing each step being triggered by the date the system is no longer deemed to have optimized corrosion control under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any small or medium-size water system that is required to complete the corrosion control steps due to its exceedance of the lead or copper action level may cease completing the treatment steps whenever the system meets both action levels during each of two consecutive monitoring periods conducted pursuant to Sec.  141.86 and submits the results to the State. If any such water system thereafter exceeds the lead or copper action level during any monitoring period, the system (or the State, as the case may be) shall recommence completion of the applicable treatment steps, beginning with the first treatment step which was not previously completed in its entirety. The State may require a system to repeat treatment steps previously completed by the system where the State determines that this is necessary to implement properly the treatment requirements of this section. The State shall notify the system in writing of such a determination and explain the basis for its decision. The requirement for any small- or medium-size system to implement corrosion control treatment steps in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section (including systems deemed to have optimized corrosion control under paragraph (b)(1) of this section) is triggered whenever any small- or medium-size system exceeds the lead or copper action level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Treatment steps and deadlines for large systems. Except as provided in paragraph (b) (2) and (3) of this section,

large systems shall complete the following corrosion control treatment steps (described in the referenced portions of Sec.
