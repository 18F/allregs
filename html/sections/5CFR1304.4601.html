OMB acts on the premise that it has the primary responsibility for the enforcement of restrictions on post-employment activities and that criminal enforcement by the Department of Justice should be undertaken only in cases involving aggravated circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> These regulations do not incorporate possible additional restrictions contained in a professional code of conduct to which an employee may also be subject.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any person who holds a Government position after June 30, 1979, is subject to the restrictions under this section; except that the new provisions applicable to Senior employees designated by the Director of the Office of Government Ethics are effective February 28, 1980.</p>
