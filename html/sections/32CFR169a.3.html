                            <p class="depth0">Commercial activity review. The process of evaluating CAs for the purpose of determining whether or not a cost comparison will be conducted.</p><p class="depth0">Commercial source. A business or other non-Federal activity located in the United States, its territories and possessions, the District of Columbia, or

the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico that provides a commercial product or service.</p><p class="depth0">Conversion to contract. The changeover of a CA from performance by DoD personnel to performance under contract by a commercial source.</p><p class="depth0">Conversion to in-house. The changeover of a CA from performance under contract by a commercial source to performance by DoD personnel.</p><p class="depth0">Cost comparison. The process of developing an estimate of the cost of performance of a CA by DoD employees and comparing it, in accordance with the requirements in this part, to the cost to the Government for contract performance of the CA.</p><p class="depth0">Directly affected parties. DoD employees and their representative organizations and bidders or offerers on the solicitation.</p><p class="depth0">Displaced DoD employee. Any DoD employee affected by conversion to contract operation (including such actions as job elimination, grade reduction, or reduction in rank). It includes both employees in the function converted to contract and to employees outside the function who are affected adversely by conversion through reassignment or the exercise of bumping or retreat rights.</p><p class="depth0">DoD Commercial Activity (CA). An activity that provides a product or service obtainable (or obtained) from a commercial source. A DoD CA is not a Governmental function. A DoD CA may be an organization or part of another organization. It must be a type of work that is separable from other functions or activities so that it is suitable for performance by contract. A representative list of the functions performed by such activities is provided in Enclosure 1. A DoD CA falls into one of two categories:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In-house CA. A DoD CA operated by a DoD Component with DoD personnel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contract CA. A DoD CA managed by a DoD Component operated with contractor personnel.</p><p class="depth0">DoD Employee. Refers to only civilian personnel of the Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth0">DoD governmental function. A function that is related so intimately to the public interest as to mandate performance by DoD personnel. These functions require either the exercise of discretion in applying Government authority or the use of value judgement in making the decision for the Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth0">Services or products in support of Governmental functions such as those listed in enclosure 3 of DoD Instruction 4100.33 are normally subject to this part and its implementing instructions. Governmental functions normally fall into two categories:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The act of governing; that is, the discretionary exercise of Governmental authority. Examples include criminal investigations, prosecutions, and other judicial functions; management of Governmental programs requiring value judgments, as in direction of the national defense; management and direction of the Armed Services; activities performed exclusively by military personnel who are subject to deployment in a combat, combat support, or combat service support role; conduct of foreign relations; selection of program priorities; direction of Federal employees; regulation of the use of space, oceans, navigable rivers, and other natural resources; direction of intelligence and counterintelligence operations; and regulation of industry and commerce, including food and drugs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Monetary transactions and entitlements, such as tax collection and revenue disbursements; control of the money supply treasury accounts; and the administration of public trusts.</p><p class="depth2">DoD personnel. Refers to both military and civilian personnel of the Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth2">Expansion. The modernization, replacement, upgrading, or enlargement of a DoD CA involving a cost increase exceeding either 30 percent of the total capital investment or 30 percent of the annual personnel and material costs. A consolidation of two or more CAs is not an expansion unless the proposed total capital investment or annual personnel and material costs of the consolidation exceeds the total of the individual CAs by 30 percent or more.</p><p class="depth2">New requirement. A recently established need for a commercial product or service. A new requirement does not include interim in-house operation of essential services pending reacquisition of the services prompted by such action as the termination of an existing contract operation.</p><p class="depth2">Preferential procurement programs. Mandatory source programs such as Federal Prison Industries (FPI) and the workshops administered by the Committee for Purchase from the Blind and Other Severely Handicapped under the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act. Also included are small, minority and disadvantaged businesses, and labor surplus area set-asides and awards made under 15 U.S.C. section 637.
