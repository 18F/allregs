                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Gear and fishing restrictions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Owners and operators of  vessels registered for use of longline gear may not use longline gear to  fish for or target HMS within the U.S. EEZ.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Owners and operators of vessels registered for use of longline  gear may not make shallow sets with longline gear to fish for or target  swordfish (Xiphias gladius) west of 150[deg] W. long. and north of the  equator (0[deg] N. lat.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A person aboard a vessel registered for use of longline gear  fishing for HMS west of 150[deg] W. long. and north of the equator  (0[deg] N. lat.) may not possess or deploy any float line that is  shorter than or equal to 20 m (65.6 ft or 10.9 fm). As used in this  paragraph, float line means a line used to suspend the main longline  beneath a float.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> From April 1 through May 31, owners and operators of vessels  registered for use of longline gear may not use longline gear in waters  bounded on the south by 0[deg] lat., on the north by 15[deg] N. lat., on  the east by 145[deg] W. long., and on the west by 180[deg] long.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> From April 1 through May 31, owners and operators of vessels  registered for use of longline gear may not receive from another vessel  HMS that   were harvested by longline gear in waters bounded on the south by 0[deg]  lat., on the north by 15[deg] N. lat., on the east by 145[deg] W. long.,  and on the west by 180[deg] long.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> From April 1 through May 31, owners and operators of vessels  registered for use of longline gear may not land or transship HMS that  were harvested by longline gear in waters bounded on the south by 0[deg]  lat., on the north by 15[deg] N. lat., on the east by 145[deg] W. long.,  and on the west by 180[deg] long.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> No light stick may be possessed on board a vessel registered for  use of longline gear during fishing trips that include any fishing west  of 150[deg] W. long. and north of the equator (0[deg] N. lat.). A light  stick as used in this paragraph is any type of light emitting device,  including any flourescent glow bead, chemical, or electrically powered  light that is affixed underwater to the longline gear.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> When a conventional monofilament longline is deployed in waters  west of 150[deg] W. long. and north of the equator (0[deg] N. lat.) by a  vessel registered for use of longline gear, no fewer than 15 branch  lines may be set between any two floats. Vessel operators using basket- style longline gear must set a minimum of 10 branch lines between any 2  floats when fishing in waters north of the equator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Longline gear deployed west of 150[deg] W. long. and north of  the equator (0[deg] N. lat.) by a vessel registered for use of longline  gear must be deployed such that the deepest point of the main longline  between any two floats, i.e., the deepest point in each sag of the main  line, is at a depth greater than 100 m (328.1 ft or 54.6 fm) below the  sea surface.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> If no observer is on board the vessel, owners and operators of  longline vessels registered for use of longline gear may land or possess  no more than 10 swordfish from a fishing trip when using any J-type  fishing hooks, and no more than 25 swordfish from a fishing trip when  using only circle hook-type fishing hooks. If a NMFS-approved observer  is on board the vessel for the duration of the fishing trip, there is no  limit on the amount of swordfish retained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Owners and operators of longline vessels registered for use of  longline gear are subject to the provisions at 50 CFR part 223  prohibiting shallow sets to target swordfish in waters beyond the U.S.  EEZ and east of 150[deg] W. long.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sea turtle take mitigation measures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Owners and operators of  vessels registered for use of longline gear must carry aboard their  vessels line clippers meeting the minimum design standards specified in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, dip nets meeting minimum standards  specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and wire or bolt cutters  capable of cutting through the vessel's hooks. These items must be used  to disengage any hooked or entangled sea turtles with the least harm  possible to the sea turtles and as close to the hook as possible in  accordance with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(4) through  (b)(7) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Line clippers are intended to cut fishing line as close as  possible to hooked or entangled sea turtles. NMFS has established  minimum design standards for line clippers. The Arceneaux line clipper  (ALC) is a model line clipper that meets these minimum design standards  and may be fabricated from readily available and low-cost materials (see  figure 1 to Sec. 660.32). The minimum design standards are as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The cutting blade must be curved, recessed, contained in a  holder, or otherwise afforded some protection to minimize direct contact  of the cutting surface with sea turtles or users of the cutting blade.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The blade must be capable of cutting 2.0-2.1 mm monofilament  line and nylon or polypropylene multistrand material commonly known as  braided mainline or tarred mainline.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The line clipper must have an extended reach handle or pole of  at least 6 ft (1.82 m).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The cutting blade must be securely fastened to the extended  reach handle or pole to ensure effective deployment and use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dip nets are intended to facilitate safe handling of sea turtles  and access to sea turtles for purposes of cutting lines in a manner that  minimizes injury and trauma to sea turtles. The minimum design standards  for dip nets   that meet the requirements of this section are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The dip net must have an extended reach handle of at least 6 ft  (1.82 m) of wood or other rigid material able to support a minimum of  100 lbs (34.1 kg) without breaking or significant bending or distortion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The dip net must have a net hoop of at least 31 inches (78.74  cm) inside diameter and a bag depth of at least 38 inches (96.52 cm).  The bag mesh openings may be no more than 3 inches x 3 inches (7.62 cm x  7.62 cm).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All incidentally taken sea turtles brought aboard for dehooking  and/or disentanglement must be handled in a manner to minimize injury  and promote post-hooking survival.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When practicable, comatose sea turtles must be brought on board  immediately, with a minimum of injury, and handled in accordance with  the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(5) and (b)(6) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a sea turtle is too large or hooked in such a manner as to  preclude safe boarding without causing further damage/injury to the  turtle, line clippers described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section must  be used to clip the line and remove as much line as possible prior to  releasing the turtle.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a sea turtle is observed to be hooked or entangled by  longline gear during hauling operations, the vessel operator must  immediately cease hauling operations until the turtle has been removed  from the longline gear or brought on board the vessel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Hooks must be removed from sea turtles as quickly and carefully  as possible. If a hook cannot be removed from a turtle, the line must be  cut as close to the hook as possible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the sea turtle brought aboard appears dead or comatose, the  sea turtle must be placed on its belly (on the bottom shell or plastron)  so that the turtle is right side up and its hindquarters elevated at  least 6 inches (15.24 cm) for a period of no less than 4 hours and no  more than 24 hours. The amount of the elevation depends on the size of  the turtle; greater elevations are needed for larger turtles. A reflex  test, performed by gently touching the eye and pinching the tail of a  sea turtle, must be administered by a vessel operator, at least every 3  hours, to determine if the sea turtle is responsive. Sea turtles being  resuscitated must be shaded and kept damp or moist but under no  circumstance may be placed into a container holding water. A water- soaked towel placed over the eyes, carapace, and flippers is the most  effective method to keep a turtle moist. Those that revive and become  active must be returned to the sea in the manner described in paragraph  (b)(6) of this section. Sea turtles that fail to revive within the 24- hour period must also be returned to the sea in the manner described in  paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Live turtles must be returned to the sea after handling in  accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) of this  section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By putting the vessel engine in neutral gear so that the  propeller is disengaged and the vessel is stopped, and releasing the  turtle away from deployed gear; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Observing that the turtle is safely away from the vessel before  engaging the propeller and continuing operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> In addition to the requirements in paragraphs (b) and (c) of  this section, a vessel operator shall perform sea turtle handling and  resuscitation techniques consistent with 50 CFR 223.206(d)(1), as  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Longline Seabird mitigation measures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Seabird mitigation  techniques. Owners and operators of vessels registered for use of  longline gear must ensure that the following actions are taken when  fishing north of 23[deg] N. lat.:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Employ a line setting machine or line shooter to set the main  longline when making deep sets west of 150[deg] W. long. using  monofilament main longline;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Attach a weight of at least 45 g to each branch line within 1 m  of the hook when making deep sets using monofilament main longline;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When using basket-style longline gear, ensure that the main  longline is deployed slack to maximize its sink rate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use completely thawed bait that has been dyed blue to an  intensity level specified by a color quality control card issued by  NMFS;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Maintain a minimum of two cans (each sold as 0.45 kg or 1 lb  size) containing blue dye on board the vessel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Discharge fish, fish parts (offal), or spent bait while setting  or hauling longline gear, on the opposite side of the vessel from where  the longline gear is being set or hauled;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Retain sufficient quantities of fish, fish parts, or spent bait,  between the setting of longline gear for the purpose of strategically  discharging it in accordance with paragraph (a)(6) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Remove all hooks from fish, fish parts, or spent bait prior to  its discharge in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Remove the bill and liver of any swordfish that is caught, sever  its head from the trunk and cut it in half vertically, and periodically  discharge the butchered heads and livers in accordance with paragraph  (a)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If a short-tailed albatross is hooked or entangled by a vessel  registered for use of longline gear, owners and operators must ensure  that the following actions are taken:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Stop the vessel to reduce the tension on the line and bring the  bird on board the vessel using a dip net;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Cover the bird with a towel to protect its feathers from oils  or damage while being handled;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Remove any entangled lines from the bird;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Determine if the bird is alive or dead.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If dead, freeze the bird immediately with an identification tag  attached directly to the specimen listing the species, location and date  of mortality, and band number if the bird has a leg band. Attach a  duplicate identification tag to the bag or container holding the bird.  Any leg bands present must remain on the bird. Contact NMFS, the Coast  Guard, or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the numbers listed on  the Short-tailed Albatross Handling Placard distributed at the NMFS  protected species workshop, inform them that you have a dead short- tailed albatross on board, and submit the bird to NMFS within 72 hours  following completion of the fishing trip.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If alive, handle the bird in accordance with paragraphs (c)(9)  through (c)(14) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Place the bird in a safe enclosed place;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Immediately contact NMFS, the Coast Guard, or the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service at the numbers listed on the Short-tailed Albatross  Handling Placard distributed at the NMFS protected species workshop and  request veterinary guidance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Follow the veterinary guidance regarding the handling and  release of the bird.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Complete the short-tailed albatross recovery data form issued  by NMFS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> If the bird is externally hooked and no veterinary guidance is  received within 24-48 hours, handle the bird in accordance with  paragraphs (c)(17)(iv) and (v) of this section, and release the bird  only if it meets the following criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Able to hold its head erect and respond to noise and motion  stimuli;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Able to breathe without noise;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Capable of flapping and retracting both wings to normal folded  position on its back;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Able to stand on both feet with toes pointed forward; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Feathers are dry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> If released under paragraph (c)(13) of this section or under  the guidance of a veterinarian, all released birds must be placed on the  sea surface.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> If the hook has been ingested or is inaccessible, keep the bird  in a safe, enclosed place and submit it to NMFS immediately upon the  vessel's return to port.
