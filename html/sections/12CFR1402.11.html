Because of the anticipated infrequency of requests for material required to be indexed, it is determined that the publication of the index in the Federal

Register is unnecessary and impracticable. However, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation will provide a copy of such index to a member of the public upon request therefor at a cost not in excess of the direct cost of duplication.</p>
