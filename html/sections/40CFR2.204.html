                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Situations requiring action. This section prescribes procedures  to be used by EPA offices in making initial determinations of whether  business information is entitled to confidential treatment for reasons  of business confidentiality. Action shall be taken under this section  whenever an EPA office:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Learns that it is responsible for responding to a request under  5 U.S.C. 552 for the release of business information; in such a case,  the office shall issue an initial determination within the period  specified in Sec. 2.112;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Desires to determine whether business information in its  possession is entitled to confidential treatment, even though no request  for release of the information has been received; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determines that it is likely that EPA eventually will be  requested to disclose the information at some future date and thus will  have to determine whether the information is entitled to confidential  treatment. In such a case this section's procedures should be initiated  at the earliest practicable time, in order to increase the time  available for preparation and submission of comments and for issuance of  determinations, and to make easier the task of meeting response  deadlines if a request for release of the information is later received  under 5 U.S.C. 552.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Previous confidentiality determination. The EPA office shall  first ascertain whether there has been a previous determination, issued  by a Federal court or by an EPA legal office acting under this subpart,  holding that the information in question is entitled to confidential  treatment for reasons of business confidentiality.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If such a determination holds that the information is entitled  to confidential treatment, the EPA Office shall furnish any person whose  request for the information is pending under 5 U.S.C. 552 an initial  determination (see Sec. 2.111 and Sec. 2.113) that the information has  previously been determined to be entitled to confidential treatment, and  that the request is therefore denied. The office shall furnish such  person the appropriate case citation or EPA determination. If the EPA  office believes that a previous determination which was issued by an EPA  legal office may be improper or no longer valid, the office shall so  inform the EPA legal office, which shall consider taking action under  Sec. 2.205(h).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With respect to all information not known to be covered by such  a previous determination, the EPA office shall take action under  paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determining existence of business confidentiality claims. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Whenever action under this paragraph is required by paragraph (b)(2) of  this section, the EPA office shall examine the information and the  office's records to determine which businesses, if any, are affected  businesses (see Sec. 2.201(d)), and to determine which businesses if  any, have asserted business confidentiality claims which remain  applicable to the information. If any business is found to have asserted  an applicable claim, the office shall take action under paragraph (d) of  this section with respect to each such claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the examination conducted under paragraph (c)(1) of this  section discloses the existence of any business which, although it has  not asserted a claim, might be expected to assert a claim if it knew EPA  proposed to disclose the information, the EPA office shall contact a  responsible official of each such business to learn whether the business  asserts a claim covering the information. However, no such inquiry need  be made to any business--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Which failed to assert a claim covering the information when  responding to an EPA request or demand, or supplying information on an  EPA form, which contained the substance of the statements prescribed by  Sec. 2.203(a);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Which otherwise failed to assert a claim covering the  information after being informed by EPA that such failure could result  in disclosure of the information to the public; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Which has otherwise waived or withdrawn a claim covering the  information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a request for release of the information under 5 U.S.C. 552  is pending at the time inquiry is made under this paragraph (c)(2), the  inquiry shall be made by telephone or equally prompt means, and the  responsible official contacted shall be informed that any claim the  business wishes to assert must be brought to the EPA office's attention  no later than the close of business on the third working day after such  inquiry.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A record shall be kept of the results of any inquiry under  this paragraph (c)(2). If any business makes a claim covering the  information, the EPA office shall take further action under paragraph  (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If, after the examination under paragraph (c)(1) of this  section, and after any inquiry made under paragraph (c)(2) of this  section, the EPA office knows of no claim covering the information and  the time for response to any inquiry has passed, the information shall  be treated for purposes of this subpart as not entitled to confidential  treatment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Preliminary determination. Whenever action under this paragraph  is required by paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section on any business's  claim, the EPA Office shall make a determination with respect to each  such claim. Each determination shall be made after consideration of the  provisions of Sec. 2.203, the applicable substantive criteria in  Sec. 2.208 or elsewhere in this subpart, and any previously-issued  determinations under this subpart which are applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If, in connection with any business's claim, the office  determines that the information may be entitled to confidential  treatment, the office shall--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Furnish the notice of opportunity to submit comments prescribed  by paragraph (e) of this section to each business which is known to have  asserted an applicable claim and which has not previously been furnished  such notice with regard to the information in question;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Furnish, to any person whose request for release of the  information is pending under 5 U.S.C. 552, a determination (in  accordance with Sec. 2.113) that the information may be entitled to  confidential treatment under this subpart and 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), that  further inquiry by EPA pursuant to this subpart is required before a  final determination on the request can be issued, that the person's  request is therefore initially denied, and that after further inquiry a  final determination will be issued by an EPA legal office; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Refer the matter to the appropriate EPA legal office,  furnishing the information required by paragraph (f)   of this section after the time has elapsed for receipt of comments from  the affected business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and Sec. 2.205(f) shall be  forwarded promptly to the appropriate EPA legal office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice to affected businesses; opportunity to comment. (1)  Whenever required by paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section, the EPA office  shall promptly furnish each business a written notice stating that EPA  is determining under this subpart whether the information is entitled to  confidential treatment, and affording the business an opportunity to  comment. The notice shall be furnished by certified mail (return receipt  requested), by personal delivery, or by other means which allows  verification of the fact and date of receipt. The notice shall state the  address of the office to which the business's comments shall be  addressed (the EPA office furnishing the notice, unless the General  Counsel has directed otherwise), the time allowed for comments, and the  method for requesting a time extension under Sec. 2.205(b)(2). The  notice shall further state that EPA will construe a business's failure  to furnish timely comments as a waiver of the business's claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If action under this section is occasioned by a request for the  information under 5 U.S.C. 552, the period for comments shall be 15  working days after the date of the business's receipt of the written  notice. In other cases, the EPA office shall establish a reasonable  period for comments (not less than 15 working days after the business's  receipt of the written notice). The time period for comments shall be  considered met if the business's comments are postmarked or hand  delivered to the office designated in the notice by the date specified.  In all cases, the notice shall call the business's attention to the  provisions of Sec. 2.205(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At or about the time the written notice is furnished, the EPA  office shall orally inform a responsible representative of the business  (by telephone or otherwise) that the business should expect to receive  the written notice, and shall request the business to contact the EPA  office if the written notice has not been received within a few days, so  that EPA may furnish a duplicate notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The written notice required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section  shall invite the business's comments on the following points (subject to  paragraph (e)(5) of this section):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The portions of the information which are alleged to be entitled  to confidential treatment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The period of time for which confidential treatment is desired  by the business (e.g., until a certain date, until the occurrence of a  specified event, or permanently);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The purpose for which the information was furnished to EPA and  the approximate date of submission, if known;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether a business confidentiality claim accompanied the  information when it was received by EPA;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Measures taken by the business to guard against undesired  disclosure of the information to others;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The extent to which the information has been disclosed to  others, and the precautions taken in connection therewith;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Pertinent confidentiality determinations, if any, by EPA or  other Federal agencies, and a copy of any such determination, or  reference to it, if available;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Whether the business asserts that disclosure of the  information would be likely to result in substantial harmful effects on  the business' competitive position, and if so, what those harmful  effects would be, why they should be viewed as substantial, and an  explanation of the causal relationship between disclosure and such  harmful effects; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Whether the business asserts that the information is  voluntarily submitted information as defined in Sec. 2.201(i), and if  so, whether and why   disclosure of the information would tend to lessen the availability to  EPA of similar information in the future.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> To the extent that the EPA office already possesses the relevant  facts, the notice need not solicit responses to the matters addressed in  paragraphs (e)(4) (i) through (ix) of this section, although the notice  shall request confirmation of EPA's understanding of such facts where  appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The notice shall refer to Sec. 2.205(c) and shall include the  statement prescribed by Sec. 2.203(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Materials to be furnished to EPA legal office. When a matter is  referred to an EPA legal office under paragraph (d)(1) of this section,  the EPA office taking action under this section shall forward promptly  to the EPA legal office the following items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A copy of the information in question, or (where the quantity or  form of the information makes forwarding a copy of the information  impractical) representative samples, a description of the information,  or both;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the circumstances and date of EPA's acquisition  of the information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The name, address, and telephone number of the EPA employee(s)  most familiar with the information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The name, address and telephone number of each business which  asserts an applicable business confidentiality claim;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A copy of each applicable claim (or the record of the assertion  of the claim), and a description of when and how each claim was  asserted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Comments concerning each business's compliance or noncompliance  with applicable requirements of Sec. 2.203;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A copy of any request for release of the information pending  under 5 U.S.C. 552;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A copy of the business's comments on whether the information is  entitled to confidential treatment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The office's comments concerning the appropriate substantive  criteria under this subpart, and information the office possesses  concerning the information's entitlement to confidential treatment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Copies of other correspondence or memoranda which pertain to  the matter.
