                            <p class="depth0">Yes. A disabled service member is entitled, to the same extent as  any other individual, to the escalator position he or she would have  attained but for uniformed service. If the employee has a disability  incurred in, or aggravated during, the period of service in the  uniformed services, the employer must make reasonable efforts to  accommodate that disability and to help the employee become qualified to  perform the duties of his or her reemployment position. If the employee  is not qualified   for reemployment in the escalator position because of a disability after  reasonable efforts by the employer to accommodate the disability and to  help the employee to become qualified, the employee must be reemployed  in a position according to the following priority. The employer must  make reasonable efforts to accommodate the employee's disability and to  help him or her to become qualified to perform the duties of one of  these positions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A position that is equivalent in seniority, status, and pay to  the escalator position; or,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A position that is the nearest approximation to the equivalent  position, consistent with the circumstances of the employee's case, in  terms of seniority, status, and pay. A position that is the nearest  approximation to the equivalent position may be a higher or lower  position, depending on the circumstances.</p>
