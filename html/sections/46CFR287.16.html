Earnings and receipts deposited in a construction reserve fund established in accordance with the provisions of section 511 of the Act and the regulations in this part will be deemed to have been accumulated for the reasonable needs of the business within the meaning of part 1 (section 531 and following), subchapter G, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, so long as the requirements of section 511 of the Act and the regulations in this part are satisfied relative to the use of the fund in the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such vessels. For incurrence of tax liability due to noncompliance with the requirements of section 511 of the Act and the regulations in this part with respect to deposits in the construction reserve fund, see the provisions of Sec. 287.23.</p>
