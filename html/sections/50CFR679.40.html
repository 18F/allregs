The sum of all sablefish QS for an IFQ regulatory area will be the sablefish QS pool for that area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> CDQ program. Each initial QS calculation will be modified to accommodate the CDQ program prescribed at subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Assignment of QS to vessel categories--(i) LOA. Each qualified person's QS will be assigned to a vessel category based on the LOA of vessel(s) from which that person made fixed gear legal landings of groundfish or halibut in the most recent year of participation and the product type landed. As used in this paragraph (a)(5), ``the most recent year of participation'' means the most recent of 4 calendar years in which any groundfish or halibut were harvested using fixed gear, as follows: 1988, 1989, or 1990; or calendar year 1991 prior to September 26, 1991.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> LOA.

An application period of no less than 180 days will be specified by notification in the Federal Register and other information sources that the Regional Administrator deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Complete application. Complete applications received by the Regional Administrator will be acknowledged. An incomplete application will be returned to the applicant with specific kinds of information identified that are necessary to make it complete.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Insufficient documentation. Halibut and sablefish catch history, vessel ownership or lease data, and other information supplied by an applicant will be compared with data compiled by the Regional Administrator. If additional data presented in an application are not consistent with the data compiled by the Regional Administrator, the applicant will be notified of insufficient documentation. The applicant will have 90 days to submit corroborating documents (as specified in paragraph (a) of this section) in support of his/her application or to resubmit a revised application. All applicants will be limited

to one opportunity to provide corroborating documentation or a revised application in response to notification of insufficient documentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Verified data. Uncontested data in applications will be approved by the Regional Administrator. Based on these data, the Regional Administrator will calculate each applicant's initial halibut and sablefish QS, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, for each IFQ regulatory area, respectively, and will add each applicant's halibut and sablefish QS for an IFQ regulatory area to the respective QS pool for that area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Unverified data. Catch history, vessel ownership, or lease data that cannot be verified by the Regional Administrator, following the procedure described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, will not qualify for QS. An initial determination denying QS on the grounds that claimed catch history, vessel ownership or lease data were not verified may be appealed following the procedure described in Sec. 679.43. Quota share reflecting catch history, vessel ownership, or lease data that are contested between two or more applicants, at least one of which is likely to qualify for QS when the dispute is resolved, will be assigned to a reserve that will be considered part of the QS pool for the appropriate IFQ regulatory area. Any QS and IFQ that results from agency action resolving the dispute will be assigned to the prevailing applicant(s) pursuant to paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(5), (b), and (c) of this section. If the assigned IFQ for the 1995 fishing season becomes moot by passage of time needed to resolve the dispute, the assignment of QS and IFQ for subsequent fishing seasons will be unaffected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> NMFS revokes inactive QS if the person holding inactive QS does not:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Respond in writing to NMFS, within 60 days after NMFS issues a Notice of Determination of Quota Share Inactivity (Inactive QS Notice) sent to the address of record as defined at Sec. 679.43(e) of this part, requesting that the inactive QS not be revoked. Responses must be received by NMFS no later than the date contained on the Inactive QS Notice</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of paragraph (a)(10) of this section, ``respond in writing'' means write a statement directing NMFS to change the status of QS to ``active'' and sign and date the statement or complete the form attached to the Inactive QS Notice and send by U.S. Mail, courier, hand delivery, or facsimile to the NMFS, Alaska Region as provided on the Inactive QS Notice and printed on the front side of the form. The written response must be received by NMFS no later than the date contained on the Inactive QS Notice or if sent by mail, postmarked by that date. If delivered by hand or courier, the receiving date is the date the notice is stamped received by NMFS.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of paragraph (a)(10) of this section, the term ``inactive QS'' means halibut QS or sablefish QS, held by a person who received an initial allocation of halibut QS or sablefish QS and has not taken any of the following actions:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Transferred any halibut QS or sablefish QS pursuant to Sec. 679.41;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Transferred any halibut IFQ or sablefish IFQ pursuant to Sec. 679.41;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Landed any halibut authorized by IFQ halibut permit(s) issued to that person; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Landed any sablefish authorized by IFQ sablefish permit(s) issued to that person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Annual allocation of IFQ. The Regional Administrator shall assign halibut or sablefish IFQs to each person holding unrestricted QS for halibut or sablefish, respectively, up to the limits prescribed in Sec. 679.42 (e) and (f). Each assigned IFQ will be specific to an IFQ regulatory area and vessel category, and will represent the maximum amount of halibut or sablefish that may be harvested from the specified IFQ regulatory area and by the person to whom it is assigned during the specified fishing year, unless the IFQ assignment is changed by the Regional Administrator within the fishing year because of an approved transfer or because all or part of the IFQ is sanctioned for violating rules of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Calculation of annual IFQ allocation--(1) General. (i) The annual allocation of halibut IFQ to any person (person p) in any IFQ regulatory area (area a) will be equal to the product of the annual commercial catch limit as defined in Sec. 300.61 of this title, after adjustment for purposes of the Western

Alaska CDQ Program, and that person's QS divided by the QS pool for that area. Overage adjustments will be subtracted from a person's IFQ pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section; underage adjustments will be added to a person's IFQ pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. Expressed algebraically, the annual halibut IFQ allocation formula is as follows:
IFQpa = [(fixed gear TACa- CDQ reservea) x (QSpa/QS poola)] - overage adjustment of IFQpa + underage adjustment of IFQpa.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General.

For purposes of calculating IFQs for any fishing year, the amount of a person's QS and the amount of the QS pool for any IFQ regulatory area will be the amounts on record with the Alaska Region, NMFS, as of 1200 hours, A.l.t., on January 31 of that year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> IFQ permit. The Regional Administrator shall issue to each QS holder, pursuant to Sec. 679.4, an IFQ permit specifying the maximum amount of halibut and sablefish that may be harvested with fixed gear in a specified IFQ regulatory area and vessel category. Such IFQ permits will be sent to each QS holder at the address on record for that person prior to the start of the IFQ fishing season or to any IFQ holder(s) following transfers or penalties (15 CFR part 904).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Ten-percent adjustment policy. A person's annual IFQ account will be adjusted in the year following a determination that the person harvested or landed IFQ species in an amount is greater than the amount available in the person's annual IFQ account and if the amount greater than the amount available does not exceed 10 percent of the amount available in the person's annual IFQ account at the time of landing. The adjustment would be a deduction of the amount of IFQ species harvested or landed that was determined to exceed the amount available in the person's annual IFQ account and will apply to any person to whom the affected IFQ is allocated in the year following the determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Underages. Underages of up to 10 percent of a person's total annual IFQ account for a current fishing year will be added to that person's annual IFQ account in the year following determination of the underage. This underage adjustment to the annual IFQ allocation will be specific to IFQ species, IFQ regulatory area, and vessel category for which an IFQ is calculated, and will apply to any person to whom the affected IFQ is allocated in the year following determination of an underage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Harvesting privilege. Quota shares allocated or permits issued pursuant to this part do not represent either an absolute right to the resource or any interest that is subject to the ``takings'' provision of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
