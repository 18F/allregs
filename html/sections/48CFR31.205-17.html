                                31.205-17  Idle facilities and idle capacity costs.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. As used in this subsection--</p><p class="depth2">Costs of idle facilities or idle capacity means costs such as  maintenance, repair, housing, rent, and other related costs; e.g.,  property taxes, insurance, and depreciation.</p><p class="depth2">Facilities means plant or any portion thereof (including land  integral to the operation), equipment, individually or collectively, or  any other tangible capital asset, wherever located, and whether owned or  leased by the contractor.</p><p class="depth2">Idle capacity means the unused capacity of partially used  facilities. It is the difference between that which a facility could  achieve under 100 percent operating time on a one-shift basis, less  operating interruptions resulting from time lost for repairs, setups,  unsatisfactory materials, and other normal delays, and the extent to  which the facility was actually used to meet demands during the  accounting period. A multiple-shift basis may be used in the calculation  instead of a one-shift basis if it can be shown that this amount of  usage could normally be expected for the type of facility involved.</p><p class="depth2">Idle facilities means completely unused facilities that are excess  to the contractor's current needs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The costs of idle facilities are unallowable unless the  facilities--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Are necessary to meet fluctuations in workload; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Were necessary when acquired and are now idle because of changes  in requirements, production economies, reorganization, termination, or  other causes which could not have been reasonably foreseen. (Costs of  idle facilities are allowable for a reasonable period, ordinarily not to  exceed 1 year, depending upon the initiative taken to use, lease, or  dispose of the idle facilities (but see 31.205-42)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Costs of idle capacity are costs of doing business and are a  factor in the normal fluctuations of usage or overhead rates from period  to period. Such costs are allowable provided the capacity is necessary  or was originally reasonable and is not subject to reduction or  elimination by subletting, renting, or sale, in accordance with sound  business, economics, or security practices. Widespread idle capacity  throughout an entire plant or among a group of assets having  substantially the same function may be idle facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any costs to be paid directly by the Government for idle  facilities or   idle capacity reserved for defense mobilization production shall be the  subject of a separate agreement.
