The REC letter must do one of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reference a product safety plan (PSP) approved by FRA under  subpart H of this part and include a document fulfilling the  requirements under Secs. 236.1011 and 236.1013 not already included in  the PSP;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Attest that the PTC system has been approved by FRA and in  operation for at least 5 years and has already received an assessment of  Verification and Validation from an independent third party under part  236 or a waiver supporting such operation; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Attest that the PTC system is recognized under an Order issued  prior to March 16, 2010.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an REC letter conforms to paragraph (a)(1) of this section,  the Associate Administrator, at his or her sole discretion, may also  issue a new Type Approval for the PTC system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In order to receive a Type Approval or PTC System Certification  under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the PTC system must be shown  to reliably execute the functionalities required by Secs. 236.1005 and  236.1007 and otherwise conform to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Previous approval or recognition of a train control system,  together with an established service history, may, at the request of the  PTC railroad, and consistent with available safety data, be credited  toward satisfaction of the safety case requirements set forth in this  part for the PTCSP with respect to all functionalities and  implementations contemplated by the approval or recognition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> To the extent that the PTC system proposed for implementation  under this subpart is different in significant detail from the system  previously approved or recognized, the changes shall be fully analyzed  in the PTCDP or PTCSP as would be the case absent prior approval or  recognition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> As used in this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Approved refers to approval of a Product Safety Plan under  subpart H of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Recognized refers to official action permitting a system to be  implemented for control of train operations under an FRA order or  waiver, after review of safety case documentation for the  implementation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Upon receipt of an REC, FRA will consider all safety case  information to the extent feasible and appropriate, given the specific  facts before the agency.
