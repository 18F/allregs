                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. If the conditions specified in paragraph (b) exist, the  plan administrator shall determine each participant's estimated title IV  benefit. The estimated title IV benefit payable with respect to each  participant who is not a substantial owner is computed under paragraph  (c) of this section. The estimated title IV benefit payable with respect  to each participant who is a substantial owner is computed under  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> or (c) or who is a substantial owner or the beneficiary  of a substantial owner. If the specified conditions do not exist, title  IV benefits may be estimated by the plan administrator in accordance  with procedures authorized by the PBGC, but no such estimate is  required. The conditions are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An actuarial valuation of the plan has been performed for a plan  year beginning not more than eighteen months before the proposed  termination date. If the interest rate used to value plan liabilities in  this valuation exceeded the applicable valuation interest rates and  factors under appendix B to part 4044 of this chapter in effect on the  proposed termination date, the value of benefits in pay status and the  value of vested benefits not in pay status on the valuation date must be  converted to the PBGC's valuation rates and factors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The plan has been in effect for at least five full years before  the proposed termination date, and the most recent actuarial valuation  demonstrates that the value of plan assets, reduced by employee  contributions remaining in the plan and interest credited thereon under  the terms of the plan, exceeds the present value, adjusted as required  under paragraph (b)(1), of all plan benefits in pay status on the  valuation date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination. In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy  termination, ``bankruptcy filing date'' is substituted for ``proposed  termination date'' in the first sentence of paragraph (b)(2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em>In general.--Estimated title IV benefit payable with respect  to a participant who is not a substantial owner. For benefits payable  with respect to a participant who is not a substantial owner, the  estimated title IV benefit is the estimated priority category 3 benefit  computed under this paragraph. Priority category 3 benefits are payable  with respect to participants who were, or could have been, in pay status  three full years prior to the proposed termination date. The estimated  priority category 3 benefit is computed by multiplying the benefit  payable with respect to the participant under Sec. 4022.62 (b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> and  (b)(2) by a fraction, not to exceed one--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The numerator of which is the benefit that would be payable  with respect to the participant at normal retirement age under the  provisions of the plan in effect on the date five full years before the  proposed termination date, based on the participant's age, service, and  compensation as of the earlier of the participant's benefit commencement  date or the proposed termination date, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The denominator of which is the benefit that would be payable  with respect to the participant at normal retirement age under the  provisions of the plan in effect on the proposed termination date, based  on the participant's age, service, and compensation as of the earlier of  the participant's   benefit commencement date or the proposed termination date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.

For benefits payable with respect to a participant who is a  substantial owner, the estimated title IV benefit is the higher of the  benefit computed under paragraph (c) of this section or the benefit  computed under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The plan administrator shall first calculate the estimated  guaranteed benefit payable with respect to the substantial owner as if  he or she were not a substantial owner, using the method set forth in  Sec. 4022.62(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The benefit computed under paragraph (d)(1) shall be multiplied  by the priority category 4 funding ratio. The category 4 funding ratio  is the ratio of x to y, not to exceed one, where--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In a plan with priority category 3 benefits, x equals plan  assets minus employee contributions remaining in the plan on the  valuation date, with interest credited thereon under the terms of the  plan, and the present value of benefits in pay status, and y equals the  present value of all vested benefits not in pay status minus such  employee contributions and interest; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In a plan with no priority category 3 benefits, x equals plan  assets minus employee contributions remaining in the plan on the  valuation date, with interest credited thereon under the terms of the  plan, and y equals the present value of all vested benefits minus such  employee contributions and interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. This section is illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Facts. A participant who is not a substantial owner was  eligible to retire 3\1/2\ years before the proposed termination date.  The participant retired 2 years before the proposed termination date  with 20 years of service. Her final 5 years' average salary was $45,000,  and she was entitled to an unreduced early retirement benefit of $1,500  per month payable as a single life annuity. This retirement benefit does  not exceed the limitation in Sec. 4022.61 (b) or (c).</p><p class="depth0">On the participant's benefit commencement date, the plan provided  for a normal retirement benefit of 2 percent of the final 5 years'  salary times the number of years of service. Five years before the  proposed termination date, the percentage was 1\1/2\ percent. The  amendments improving benefits were put into effect 3\1/2\ years prior to  the proposed termination date. There were no other amendments during the  5-year period.</p><p class="depth0">The participant's estimated guaranteed benefit computed under  Sec. 4022.62(c) is $1,500 per month times 0.90 (the factor from column  (b) of Table I in Sec. 4022.62(c)(2)), or $1,350 per month. It is  assumed that the plan meets the conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of  this section, and the plan administrator is therefore required to  estimate the title IV benefit.</p><p class="depth0">Estimated title IV benefit. For a participant who is not a  substantial owner, the amount of the estimated title IV benefit is the  estimated priority category 3 benefit computed under paragraph (c) of  this section. This amount is computed by multiplying the participant's  benefit under the plan as of the later of the proposed termination date  or the benefit commencement date by the ratio of (i) the normal  retirement benefit under the provisions of the plan in effect 5 years  before the proposed termination date and (ii) the normal retirement  benefit under the plan provisions in effect on the proposed termination  date.</p><p class="depth0">Thus, the numerator of the ratio is the benefit that would be  payable to the participant under the normal retirement provisions of the  plan 5 years before the proposed termination date, based on her age,  service, and compensation on her benefit commencement date. The  denominator of the ratio is the benefit that would be payable to the  participant under the normal retirement provisions of the plan in effect  on the proposed termination date, based on her age, service, and  compensation as of the earlier of her benefit commencement date or the  proposed termination date. Since the only different factor in the  numerator and denominator is the salary percentage, the amount of the  estimated title IV benefit is $1,125 (0.015/0.020 x $1,500) per month.  This amount is less than the estimated guaranteed benefit of $1,350 per  month. Therefore, in accordance with Sec. 4022.61(d), the benefit  payable to the participant is $1,350 per month.</p><p class="depth0">PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination. In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy  termination, the methodology would be the same, but ``bankruptcy filing  date'' would be substituted for ``proposed termination date'' each place  that ``proposed termination date'' appears in the example, and the  numbers would change accordingly.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Facts. A participant who is a substantial owner retires  at the plan's normal retirement age, having completed 5 years of active  participation in the plan, on October 31, 1992, which is the proposed  termination date. Under provisions of the plan in effect 5 years prior  to the proposed termination date, the participant is entitled to a  single life annuity of $500 per month. Under the most recent plan  amendments, which were put into effect 1\1/2\ years prior to the  proposed termination date, the participant is entitled to a single life  annuity of $1,000 per month. The participant's estimated guaranteed  benefit computed under Sec. 4022.62(d)(2) is $166.67 per month.</p><p class="depth0">It is assumed that all of the conditions in paragraph (b) of this  section have been met. Plan assets equal $2 million. The present value  of all benefits in pay status is $1.5 million based on applicable PBGC  interest rates. There are no employee contributions and the present  value of all vested benefits that are not in pay status is $0.75 million  based on applicable PBGC interest rates.</p><p class="depth0">Estimated title IV benefit. Paragraph (d) of this section provides  that the amount of the estimated title IV benefit payable with respect  to a participant who is a substantial owner is the higher of the  estimated priority category 3 benefit computed under paragraph (c) of  this section or the estimated priority category 4 benefit computed under  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Under paragraph (c), the participant's estimated priority category 3  benefit is $500 ($1,000 x $500/$1,000) per month.</p><p class="depth0">Under paragraph (d), the participant's estimated priority category 4  benefit is the estimated guaranteed benefit computed under  Sec. 4022.62(c) (i.e., as if the participant were not a substantial  owner) multiplied by the priority category 4 funding ratio. Since the  plan has priority category 3 benefits, the ratio is determined under  paragraph (d)(2)(i). The numerator of the ratio is plan assets minus the  present value of benefits in pay status. The denominator of the ratio is  the present value of all vested benefits that are not in pay status. The  participant's estimated guaranteed benefit under Sec. 4022.62(c) is  $1,000 per month times 0.90 (the factor from column (b) of Table I in  Sec. 4022.62(c)(2)), or $900 per month. Multiplying $900 by the category  4 funding ratio of \2/3\ (($2 million--$1.5 million)/$0.75 million)  produces an estimated category 4 benefit of $600 per month.</p><p class="depth0">Because the estimated category 4 benefit so computed is greater than  the estimated category 3 benefit so computed, the estimated category 4  benefit is the estimated title IV benefit. Because the estimated  category 4 benefit so computed is greater than the estimated guaranteed  benefit of $166.67 per month, in accordance with Sec. 4022.61(d), the  benefit payable to the participant is the estimated category 4 benefit  of $600 per month.
