                            <p class="depth0">The provisions of 26 U.S.C. 6402(d) and 31 U.S.C. 3720A authorize the Secretary of the Treasury, acting through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), to offset a delinquent debt owed to the United States Government from the tax refund due a taxpayer when other collection efforts have failed to recover the amount due. The purpose of these statutes is to improve the ability of the Government to collect money owed it while granting the debtor notice and certain other protections. This subpart authorizes the collection of debts owed to the United States Government by persons, organizations, and entities by means of offsetting any tax refunds due to the debtor by the IRS. It allows referral to the IRS for collection of debts that are past due and legally enforceable but not reduced to judgment and debts that have been reduced to judgment.</p>
