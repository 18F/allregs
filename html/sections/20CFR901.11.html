If March 1 is a Saturday,  Sunday, or holiday, the due date shall be the next day that is not a  Saturday, Sunday, or holiday.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The effective date of renewal of enrollment for an individual  who files a complete renewal application within the time period  described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is the April 1 immediately  following the date of application. The effective date of renewal of  enrollment for an individual who files a complete renewal application  after the due date described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is the  later of the April 1 immediately following the due date of application  and the date of the notice of renewal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Forms required for renewal may be obtained from the Executive  Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A reasonable non-refundable fee may be charged for each  application for renewal of enrollment filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> and satisfied the recordkeeping  requirements of paragraph (j) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Transition rule for renewal of enrollment effective April 1,  2011. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A minimum of 36 hours of continuing professional education  credit must be completed between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010.

Thereafter, for such individuals, for  each subsequent enrollment cycle at least 12 hours of the 36 hours must  consist of core subject matter. In each instance, the remainder may  consist of non-core subject matter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> When core subject matter hours are required (including when an  individual seeks to return to active status from inactive status), an  individual must complete a minimum of two hours of continuing  professional education credit relating to ethical standards, regardless  of the total number of core hours required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Qualifying continuing professional education--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. To  qualify for continuing professional education credit an enrolled actuary  must complete his/her hours of continuing professional education credit  under a qualifying program, within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2) of  this section, consisting of core and/or non-core subject matter. In  addition, a portion of the continuing professional education credit may  be earned under the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section. In any  event, no less than \1/3\ of the total hours of continuing professional  education credit required for an enrollment cycle   must be obtained by participation in a formal program or programs,  within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Core subject matter is program content and knowledge that is  integral and necessary to the satisfactory performance of pension  actuarial services and actuarial certifications under ERISA and the  Internal Revenue Code. Such core subject matter includes the  characteristics of actuarial cost methods under ERISA, actuarial  assumptions, minimum funding standards, titles I, II, and IV of ERISA,  requirements with respect to the valuation of plan assets, requirements  for qualification of pension plans, maximum deductible contributions,  tax treatment of distributions from qualified pension plans, excise  taxes related to the funding of qualified pension plans and standards of  performance (including ethical standards) for actuarial services. Core  subject matter includes all materials included on the syllabi of any of  the pension actuarial examinations offered by the Joint Board during the  current enrollment cycle and the enrollment cycle immediately preceding  the current enrollment cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Non-core subject matter is program content designed to enhance  the knowledge of an enrolled actuary in matters related to the  performance of pension actuarial services. Examples include economics,  computer programming, pension accounting, investment and finance, risk  theory, communication skills, and business and general tax law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Joint Board may publish other topics or approve other  topics which may be included in a qualifying program as core or non-core  subject matter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The same course of study cannot be used more than once within a  given 36-month period to satisfy the continuing professional education  requirements of these regulations. A program or session bearing the same  or a similar title to a previous one may be used to satisfy the  requirements of these regulations if the major content of the program or  session differs substantively from the previous one.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Qualifying program--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A qualifying program is a  course of learning that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is conducted by a qualifying sponsor, within the meaning of  paragraph (f)(3) of this section, who identifies the program as a  qualifying program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Is developed by individual(s) qualified in the subject matter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Covers current subject matter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Includes written outlines or textbooks;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Is taught by instructors, discussion leaders, and speakers  qualified with respect to the course content;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Includes means for evaluation by the Joint Board of technical  content and presentation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Provides a certificate of completion, within the meaning of  paragraph (f)(3)(iv) of this section, to each person who successfully  completed the program; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Provides a certificate of instruction, within the meaning of  paragraph (f)(3)(v) of this section, to each person who served an  instructor, discussion leader, or speaker.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Formal programs--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Participants. Formal programs are programs  that meet all of the requirements of this paragraph (f)(2)(ii) and  paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. Whether a program qualifies as a  formal program is determined on a participant-by-participant basis. A  qualifying program qualifies as a formal program with respect to a  participant if the participant simultaneously participates in the  program in the same physical location with at least two other  participants engaged in substantive pension service, and the  participants have the opportunity to interact with another individual  qualified with respect to the course content who serves as an  instructor, whether or not the instructor is in the same physical  location. Groups of three or more participants who are in the same  physical location may participate in a formal program in person or via  the Internet, videoconferencing, or teleconferencing. If the qualifying  program is pre-recorded, to qualify as a formal program, there must be a  qualified individual who serves as the instructor and is   available to answer questions immediately following the pre-recorded  program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Instructor. A qualifying program is a formal program with  respect to the instructor only if the program is a formal program under  paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section with respect to at least three  participants and the instructor is in the physical presence of at least  three other individuals engaged in substantive pension service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Qualifying sponsors--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Qualifying sponsors are  organizations recognized by the Executive Director whose programs offer  opportunities for continuing professional education in subject matter  within the scope of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Recognition by the Executive Director. An organization  requesting qualifying sponsor status shall file a sponsor agreement  request with the Executive Director and furnish information in support  of such request as deemed necessary for approval by the Executive  Director. Such information shall include sufficient information to  establish that all programs designated as qualifying programs offered by  the qualifying sponsor will satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f)(2)  of this section. Recognition as a qualifying sponsor by the Executive  Director shall be effective when approved, unless the Executive Director  provides that it shall be effective on a different date, and shall  terminate at the end of the sponsor enrollment cycle. The Executive  Director may publish the names of such sponsors on a periodic basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Sponsor enrollment cycle--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Transition sponsor enrollment  cycle. The transition sponsor enrollment cycle is the period beginning  on January 1, 2008 and ending December 31, 2011.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Subsequent sponsor enrollment cycles. After the transition  sponsor enrollment cycle, the sponsor enrollment cycle means the three- year period from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2014, and every three- year period thereafter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Certificates of completion. Upon verification of successful  completion of a qualifying program, the program's qualifying sponsor  shall furnish each individual who successfully completed the qualifying  program with a certificate listing the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name of the participant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The name of the qualifying sponsor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The title, location, and speaker(s) of each session attended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The dates of the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The total credit hours earned, the total core and non-core  credit hours earned, and how many of those hours relate to ethics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Whether or not the program is a formal program with respect to  the participant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Certificates of instruction. The program's qualifying sponsor  shall furnish to each instructor, discussion leader, or speaker, a  certificate listing the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name of the instructor, discussion leader, or speaker.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The name of the qualifying sponsor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The title and location of the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The dates of the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The total credit hours earned and the total core and non-core  credit hours earned for the program, and how many of those hours relate  to ethics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Whether or not the program is a formal program with respect to  the instructor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Alternative means for completion of credit hours--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. In addition to credit hours completed under paragraph (f) of  this section, an enrolled actuary may be awarded continuing professional  education credit under the provisions of this paragraph (g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Serving as an instructor, discussion leader or speaker. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Four  credit hours (that is, 200 minutes) of continuing professional education  credit will be awarded for each 50 minutes completed as an instructor,  discussion leader, or speaker at a qualifying program which meets the  continuing professional education requirements of paragraph (f) of this  section. If the qualifying program is a formal program with respect to  the instructor, only the time spent during the actual program is counted  toward satisfaction of the formal program requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The credit for instruction and preparation may not exceed 50  percent of the continuing professional education requirement for an  enrollment cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Presentation of the same material as an instructor, discussion  leader, or speaker more than one time in any 36-month period will not  qualify for continuing professional education credit. A program will not  be considered to consist of the same material if a substantial portion  of the content has been revised to reflect changes in the law or  practices relative to the performance of pension actuarial service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Credit as an instructor, discussion leader, or speaker will not  be awarded to panelists, moderators, or others who are not required to  prepare substantive subject matter for their portion of the program.  However, such individuals may be awarded credit for attendance, provided  the other provisions of this section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The nature of the subject matter will determine if credit will  be of a core or non-core nature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Credit for publications. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Continuing professional education  credit will be awarded for the creation of peer-reviewed materials for  publication or distribution with respect to matters directly related to  the continuing professional education requirements of this section.  Credit will be awarded to the author, co-author, or a person listed as a  major contributor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> One hour of credit will be allowed for each hour of preparation  time of the material. It will be the responsibility of the person  claiming the credit to maintain records to verify preparation time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Publication or distribution may utilize any available  technology for the dissemination of written, visual or auditory  materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The materials must be available on reasonable terms for  acquisition and use by all enrolled actuaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The credit for the creation of materials may not exceed 25  percent of the continuing professional education requirement of any  enrollment cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The nature of the subject matter will determine if credit will  be of a core or non-core nature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Publication of the same material more than one time will not  qualify for continuing professional education credit. A publication will  not be considered to consist of the same material if a substantial  portion has been revised to reflect changes in the law or practices  relative to the performance of pension actuarial service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Service on Joint Board advisory committee(s). Continuing  professional education credit may be awarded by the Joint Board for  service on (any of) its advisory committee(s), to the extent that the  Joint Board considers warranted by the service rendered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Preparation of Joint Board examinations. Continuing professional  education credit may be awarded by the Joint Board for participation in  drafting questions for use on Joint Board examinations or in pretesting  its examinations, to the extent the Joint Board determines suitable.  Such credit may not exceed 50 percent of the continuing professional  education requirement for the applicable enrollment cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examinations sponsored by professional organizations or  societies. Individuals may earn continuing professional education credit  for achieving a passing grade on proctored examinations sponsored by a  professional organization or society recognized by the Joint Board. Such  credit is limited to the number of hours scheduled for each examination  and may be applied only as non-core credit provided the content of the  examination is core or non-core. No credit may be earned for hours  attributable to any content that is neither core nor non-core.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Joint Board pension examination. Individuals may establish  eligibility for renewal of enrollment for any enrollment cycle by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>, administered under  this part during the applicable enrollment cycle; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Completing a minimum of 12 hours of qualifying continuing  professional education by attending formal program(s) during the same  applicable enrollment cycle. This option of satisfying the continuing  professional education requirements is not available to those who  receive initial enrollment during the enrollment cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Measurement of continuing education course work. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All  continuing education programs will be measured in terms of credit hours.  The shortest   recognized program will be one credit hour.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A credit hour is 50 minutes of continuous participation in a  program. Each session in a program must be at least one full credit  hour, i.e., 50 minutes. For example, a single-session program lasting  100 minutes will count as two credit hours, and a program comprised of  three 75 minute sessions (225 minutes) constitutes four credit hours.  However, at the end of an enrollment cycle, an individual may total the  number of minutes of sessions of at least one credit hour in duration  attended during the cycle and divide by fifty. For example, attending  three 75 minute segments at two separate programs will accord an  individual nine credit hours (450 minutes divided by 50) toward  fulfilling the minimum number of continuing professional education  hours. It will not be permissible to merge non-core hours with core  hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Recordkeeping requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Qualifying sponsors. A  qualifying sponsor must maintain records to verify that each program it  sponsors is a qualifying program within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)  of this section, including the certificates of completion, certificates  of instruction, and outlines and course material. In the case of  programs of more than one session, records must be maintained to verify  each session of the program that is completed by each participant.  Records required to be maintained under this paragraph must be retained  by the qualifying sponsor for a period of six years following the end of  the sponsor enrollment cycle in which the program is held.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Enrolled actuaries--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Qualifying program credits as a  participant. To receive continuing professional education credit for  completion of hours of continuing professional education under paragraph  (f) of this section, an enrolled actuary must retain all certificates of  completion evidencing completion of such hours for the three-year period  following the end of the enrollment cycle in which the credits are  earned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Qualifying program credits as an instructor, discussion leader,  or speaker. To receive continuing professional education credit for  completion of hours earned under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, an  enrolled actuary must retain all certificates of instruction evidencing  completion of such hours for the three-year period following the end of  the enrollment cycle in which the credits are earned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Credit for publications. To receive continuing professional  education credit for a publication under paragraph (g)(3) of this  section, the following information must be maintained by the enrolled  actuary for the three-year period following the end of the enrollment  cycle in which the credits are earned:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name of the publisher.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The title and author of the publication.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A copy of the publication.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The date of the publication.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The total credit hours earned, and the total core and non-core  credit hours earned, and how many of those hours relate to ethics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Other credits. To receive continuing professional education  credit for hours earned under paragraphs (g)(4) through (g)(7) of this  section, an enrolled actuary must retain sufficient documentation to  establish completion of such hours for the three-year period following  the end of the enrollment cycle in which the credits are earned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Waivers. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Waiver from the continuing professional education  requirements for a given period may be granted by the Executive Director  only under extraordinary circumstances, and upon submission of  sufficient evidence that every effort was made throughout the enrollment  cycle to participate in one or more qualifying programs that would have  satisfied the continuing professional education requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A request for waiver must be accompanied by appropriate  documentation. The individual will be required to furnish any additional  documentation or explanation deemed necessary by the Executive Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The individual will be notified by the Executive Director of the  disposition of the request for waiver. If the waiver is not approved,  and the individual does not otherwise satisfy the   continuing professional education requirements within the allotted time,  the individual will be placed on the roster of inactive enrolled  individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Individuals seeking to rely on a waiver of the continuing  professional education requirements must receive the waiver from the  Executive Director before filing an application for renewal of  enrollment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Failure to comply. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Compliance by an individual with the  requirements of this part shall be determined by the Executive Director.  An individual who applies for renewal of enrollment but who fails to  meet the requirements of eligibility for renewal will be notified by the  Executive Director at his/her last known address by first class mail.  The notice will state the basis for the non-compliance and will provide  the individual an opportunity to furnish in writing, within 60 days of  the date of the notice, information relating to the matter. Such  information will be considered by the Executive Director in making a  final determination as to eligibility for renewal of enrollment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Executive Director may require any individual, by first  class mail sent to his/her mailing address of record with the Joint  Board, to provide copies of any records required to be maintained under  this section. The Executive Director may disallow any continuing  professional education hours claimed if the individual concerned fails  to comply with such requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An individual whose application for renewal is not approved may  seek review of the matter by the Joint Board. A request for review and  the reasons in support of the request must be filed with the Joint Board  within 30 days of the date of the notice of failure to comply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Inactive status--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Automatic placement on the inactive roster.  To remain on the roster of active enrolled actuaries, an enrolled  actuary must submit a timely application for renewal showing  satisfaction of the requirements for reenrollment, including completion  of the required continuing professional education hours, within the  appropriate time frame. The Executive Director will move an enrolled  actuary who does not submit such an application for reenrollment from  the roster of enrolled actuaries to the roster of inactive enrolled  actuaries as of April 1 following the March 1 due date for the  application. However, if an enrolled actuary completes the required  number of continuing professional education hours after the close of the  enrollment cycle, submits an application for reenrollment, and is  informed by the Executive Director before April 1st that the enrollment  has been renewed, then the Executive Director will not move such  individual to the roster of inactive enrolled actuaries at that time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Placement on the inactive roster after notice and right to  respond. The Executive Director will move an enrolled actuary who does  not submit a timely application of renewal that shows timely completion  of the required continuing professional education to the inactive roster  only after giving the enrolled actuary 60 days to respond as described  in paragraph (l)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Length on time on inactive roster. An individual may remain on  the roster of inactive enrolled actuaries for a period up to three  enrollment cycles from the date renewal would have been effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Consequence of being on the inactive roster. An individual in  inactive status will be ineligible to perform pension actuarial services  as an enrolled actuary under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. During  such time in inactive status or at any other time an individual is  ineligible to perform pension actuarial services as an enrolled actuary,  the individual shall not in any manner, directly or indirectly, indicate  he or she is so enrolled, or use the term ``enrolled actuary,'' the  designation ``E.A.,'' or other form of reference to eligibility to  perform pension actuarial services as an enrolled actuary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Returning to active status. An individual placed in inactive  status may return to active status by filing an application for renewal  of enrollment (with the appropriate fee) and providing evidence of the  completion of all required continuing professional education hours and  of satisfaction of any applicable requirements for qualifying experience  under paragraph (l)(7) of   this section. If an application for return to active status is approved,  the individual will be eligible to perform services as an enrolled  actuary effective with the date the notice of approval is mailed to that  individual by the Executive Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Time for return to active enrollment. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An individual placed  in inactive status must file an application for return to active  enrollment, and satisfy the requirements for return to active enrollment  as set forth in this section, within three enrollment cycles of being  placed in inactive status. Otherwise, the name of such individual will  be removed from the inactive enrollment roster and his/her enrollment  will terminate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of paragraph (l)(5)(i) of this section, an  individual who is in inactive or retired status as of April 1, 2010,  will be deemed to have been placed in inactive status on April 1, 2010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> may  not be used to satisfy the requirements of the enrollment cycle in which  the individual has been placed back on the active roster.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Continuing professional education requirements for return to  active enrollment from inactive status. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> During the first inactive  enrollment cycle; 36 hours of qualifying continuing professional  education as set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, without  regard to paragraph (e)(2)(ii) or (e)(2)(iii) of this section, must be  completed. Any hours of continuing professional education credit earned  during the immediately prior enrollment cycle may be applied in  satisfying this requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> or (e)(2)(iii) of this section, plus eighteen  months of certified responsible pension actuarial experience, must be  completed since the start of the first inactive enrollment cycle. Any  hours of continuing professional education credit earned during the  first inactive enrollment cycle may be applied in satisfying this  requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this section plus eighteen  months of certified responsible pension actuarial experience, must be  completed since the start of the second inactive enrollment cycle. Any  hours of continuing professional education credit earned during the  second inactive enrollment cycle may be applied in satisfying this  requirement. No hours earned during the first inactive enrollment cycle  may be applied in satisfying this requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> An individual in inactive status remains subject to the  jurisdiction of the Joint Board and/or the Department of the Treasury  with respect to disciplinary matters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> An individual who has certified in good faith that he/she has  satisfied the continuing professional education requirements of this  section will not be considered to be in non-compliance with such  requirements on the basis of a program he/she has attended later being  found inadequate or not in compliance with the requirements for  continuing professional education. Such individual will be granted  renewal, but the Executive Director may require such individual to  remedy the resulting shortfall by earning replacement credit during the  cycle in which renewal was granted or within a reasonable time period as  determined by the Executive Director. For example, if six of the credit  hours claimed were disallowed,   the individual may be required to present 42 credit hours instead of the  minimum 36 credit hours to qualify for renewal related to the next  cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Renewal while under suspension or disbarment. An individual who  is ineligible to perform actuarial services and/or to practice before  the Internal Revenue Service by virtue of disciplinary action is  required to meet the requirements for renewal of enrollment during the  period of such ineligibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Verification. The Executive Director or his/her designee may  request and review the continuing professional education records of an  enrolled actuary, including programs attended, in a manner deemed  appropriate to determine compliance with the requirements and standards  for the renewal of enrollment as provided in this section. The Executive  Director may also request and review the records of any qualifying  sponsor in a manner deemed appropriate to determine compliance with the  requirements of paragraphs (f)(3) and (j)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  the rules of paragraph (l)(7) of this section and the effective date of  an enrolled actuary's renewal:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Individual E, who was initially enrolled before January  1, 2008, completes 12 hours of core continuing professional education  credit and 24 hours of non-core continuing professional education credit  between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013. E files a complete  application for reenrollment on February 28, 2014. E's reenrollment is  effective as of April 1, 2014.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Individual F, who was initially enrolled before January  1, 2008, also completes 12 hours of core continuing professional  education credit and 24 hours of non-core continuing professional  education credit between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013.  However, F does not file an application for reenrollment until March 20,  2014. The Joint Board notifies F that it has granted F's application on  June 25, 2014. Accordingly, effective April 1, 2014, F is placed on the  roster of inactive enrolled actuaries. F returns to active status as of  June 25, 2014. F is ineligible to perform pension actuarial services as  an enrolled actuary under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code from April  1 through June 24, 2014.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Individual G, who was initially enrolled before January  1, 2008, completes only 8 hours of core continuing professional  education credit and 24 hours of non-core continuing professional  education credit between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013. G  completes another 6 hours of core continuing professional education on  January 15, 2014, and files an application for return to active status  on January 20, 2014. G's application shows the timely completion of 32  hours of continuing professional education plus the additional 4 hours  of continuing professional education earned after the end of the  enrollment cycle. The Joint Board notifies G that it has granted the  application on April 20, 2014. Accordingly, effective April 1, 2014, G  is placed on the roster of inactive enrolled actuaries. G returns to  active status as of April 20, 2014. G is ineligible to perform pension  actuarial services as an enrolled actuary under ERISA and the Internal  Revenue Code from April 1 through April 19, 2014. Of the 6 hours of  continuing professional education earned by G on January 15, 2014, only  2 hours may be applied to the enrollment cycle that ends December 31,  2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Individual H, who was initially enrolled before  January 1, 2008, completes 5 hours of core continuing professional  education credit and 10 hours of non-core continuing professional  education credit between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013.  Accordingly, effective April 1, 2014, H is placed on the roster of  inactive enrolled actuaries and is ineligible to perform pension  actuarial services as an enrolled actuary under ERISA and the Internal  Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> H completes 7 hours of core continuing professional education  credit and 14 hours of noncore continuing professional education credit  between January 1, 2014, and May 24, 2016. Because H has completed 12  hours of core continuing professional education and 24 hours of non-core  continuing professional education during the last active enrollment  period and the initial period when on inactive status, H has satisfied  the requirements for reenrollment during the first inactive cycle.  Accordingly, H may file an application for return to active enrollment  on May 24, 2016. If this application is approved, H will be eligible to  perform pension actuarial services as an enrolled actuary under ERISA  and the Internal Revenue Code, effective with the date of such approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because H used the 21 hours of continuing professional  education credit earned after January 1, 2014, for return from inactive  status, H may not apply any of these 21 hours of core and non-core  continuing professional education credits towards the requirements for  renewed enrollment effective April 1, 2017. Accordingly, H must complete  an additional 36 hours of continuing professional education (12 core and  24 non-core) prior to December 31, 2016, to be eligible for renewed  enrollment effective April 1, 2017.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 4 except H  completes 2 hours of core continuing professional education credit and   8 hours of non-core continuing professional education credit between  January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016. Thus, because H did not fulfill  the requirements for return to active status during his first inactive  cycle, H must satisfy the requirements of paragraph (l)(7)(ii) of this  section in order to return to active status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Accordingly, in order to be eligible to file an application for  return to active status on or before December 31, 2019, H must complete  an additional 38 hours of continuing professional education credit (of  which at least 14 hours must consist of core subject matter) between  January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019, and have 18 months of certified  responsible pension actuarial experience during the period beginning on  January 1, 2014.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Note that the 5 hours of core continuing professional  education credit and the 10 hours of non-core continuing professional  education credit that H completes between January 1, 2011, and December  31, 2013, are not counted toward H's return to active status and are  also not taken into account toward the additional hours of continuing  professional education credit that H must complete between January 1,  2017, and December 31, 2019, in order to apply for renewal of enrollment  effective April 1, 2020.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 4 except H  completes 2 hours of core continuing professional education credit and 8  hours of non-core continuing professional education credit between  January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016, and 12 hours of core continuing  professional education credit and 24 hours of non-core continuing  professional education credit between January 1, 2017, and December 31,  2019. Thus, because H did not fulfill the requirements for return to  active status during his first or second inactive cycles, H must satisfy  the requirements of paragraph (l)(7)(iii) of this section in order to  return to active status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Accordingly, in order to be eligible to file an application for  return to active status on or before December 31, 2022, H must complete  an additional 24 hours of continuing professional education credit (of  which, at least 8 hours must consist of core subject matter) between  January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022, and have at least 18 months of  certified responsible pension actuarial experience during the period  beginning on January 1, 2017.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Note that the total of 15 hours of continuing professional  education credit that H completes between January 1, 2011, and December  31, 2013, as well as the 10 hours of continuing professional education  credit between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016, are not counted  toward H's return to active status and are not taken into account toward  the additional hours of continuing professional education credit that H  must complete between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2022, in order  to be eligible to file an application for renewal of enrollment active  status effective April 1, 2023.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Individual J, who was initially enrolled July 1,  2012, completes 1 hour of core continuing professional education credit  and 2 hours of non-core continuing professional education credit between  January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013. Accordingly, effective April 1,  2014, J is placed on the roster of inactive enrolled actuaries and is  ineligible to perform pension actuarial services as an enrolled actuary  under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> J completes 5 hours of core continuing professional education  credit and 4 hours of non-core continuing professional education credit  between January 1, 2014, and October 6, 2014. Because J did not complete  the required 12 hours of continuing professional education (of which at  least 6 hours must consist of core subject matter) during J's initial  enrollment cycle, J is not eligible to file an application for a return  to active enrollment on October 6, 2014, notwithstanding the fact that  had J completed such hours between January 1, 2012, and December 31,  2013, J would have satisfied the requirements for renewed enrollment  effective April 1, 2014.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Accordingly, J must complete an additional 24 hours of  continuing professional education (of which at least 12 hours must  consist of core subject matter) during his/her first inactive enrollment  cycle before applying for renewal of enrollment.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. The facts are the same as in Example 7 except that J  completes 17 hours of core continuing professional education credit and  16 hours of non-core continuing professional education credit between  January 1, 2014, and February 12, 2015. Accordingly, because as of  February 12, 2015, J satisfied the continuing professional education  requirements as set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section without  regard to paragraph (e)(2)(ii) thereof, J may file an application for  return to active enrollment status on February 12, 2015.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> With the exception of paragraphs (e)(1) and (f)(3)(iii) of this  section, this section applies to the enrollment cycle beginning January  1, 2011, and all subsequent enrollment cycles.
