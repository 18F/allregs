                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Permissible changes--HUD-1. The following changes and insertions  are permitted when the HUD-1 settlement statement is reproduced:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The person reproducing the HUD-1 may insert its business name  and logo in section A and may rearrange, but not delete, the other  information that appears in section A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The name, address, and other information regarding the lender  and settlement agent may be printed in sections F and H, respectively.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reproduction of the HUD-1 must conform to the terminology,  sequence, and numbering of line items as presented in lines 100-1400.  However, blank lines or items listed in lines 100-1400 that are not used  locally or in connection with mortgages by the lender may be deleted,  except for the following: Lines 100, 120, 200, 220, 300, 301, 302, 303,  400, 420, 500, 520, 600, 601, 602, 603, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200,  1300, and 1400. The form may be shortened correspondingly. The number of  a deleted item shall not be used for a substitute or new item, but the  number of a blank   space on the HUD-1 may be used for a substitute or new item.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Charges not listed on the HUD-1, but that are customary locally  or pursuant to the lender's practice, may be inserted in blank spaces.  Where existing blank spaces on the HUD-1 are insufficient, additional  lines and spaces may be added and numbered in sequence with spaces on  the HUD-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The following variations in layout and format are within the  discretion of persons reproducing the HUD-1 and do not require prior HUD  approval: size of pages; tint or color of pages; size and style of type  or print; vertical spacing between lines or provision for additional  horizontal space on lines (for example, to provide sufficient space for  recording time periods used in prorations); printing of the HUD-1  contents on separate pages, on the front and back of a single page, or  on one continuous page; use of multicopy tear-out sets; printing on  rolls for computer purposes; reorganization of sections B through I,  when necessary to accommodate computer printing; and manner of placement  of the HUD number, but not the OMB approval number, neither of which may  be deleted. The expiration date associated with the OMB number listed on  the form may be deleted. Any changes in the HUD number or OMB approval  number may be announced by notice in the Federal Register, rather than  by amendment of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The borrower's information and the seller's information may be  provided on separate pages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Signature lines may be added.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The HUD-1 may be translated into languages other than English.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> An additional page may be attached to the HUD-1 for the purpose  of including customary recitals and information used locally in real  estate settlements; for example, breakdown of payoff figures, a  breakdown of the borrower's total monthly mortgage payments, check  disbursements, a statement indicating receipt of funds, applicable  special stipulations between buyer and seller, and the date funds are  transferred. If space permits, such information may be added at the end  of the HUD-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> As required by HUD/FHA in FHA-insured loans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> As allowed by Sec. 1024.17, relating to an initial escrow  account statement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Permissible changes--HUD-1A. The changes and insertions on the  HUD-1 permitted under paragraph (a) of this section are also permitted  when the HUD-1A settlement statement is reproduced, except the changes  described in paragraphs (a)(3) and (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Written approval. Any other deviation in the HUD-1 or HUD-1A  forms is permissible only upon receipt of written approval of the  Bureau; provided, however, that notwithstanding contrary instructions in  this section or appendix A, reproducing the HUD-1 or HUD-1A forms with  the Bureau's OMB approval number displayed in place of HUD's OMB  approval number does not require the written approval of the Bureau. A  request to the Bureau for approval shall be submitted in writing to the  address indicated in Sec. 1024.3 and shall state the reasons why the  applicant believes such deviation is needed. The prescribed form(s) must  be used until approval is received.</p>
