                            <p class="depth0">You are eligible for SSI benefits if you meet all the basic requirements listed in Sec. 416.202. However, the first month for which you may receive SSI benefits is the month after the month in which you meet these eligibility requirements. (See Sec. 416.501.) You must give us any information we request and show us necessary documents or other evidence to prove that you meet these requirements. We determine your eligibility for each month on the basis of your countable income in that month. You continue to be eligible unless you lose your eligibility because you no longer meet the basic requirements or because of one of the reasons given in Secs. 416.207 through 416.216.
