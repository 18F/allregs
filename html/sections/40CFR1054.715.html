                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Banking is the retention of emission credits by the manufacturer  generating the emission credits for use in future model years for  averaging or trading. You may use banked emission credits only within  the averaging set in   which they were generated, except as described in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You may designate any emission credits you plan to bank in the  reports you submit under Sec.  1054.730. During the model year and  before the due date for the final report, you may designate your  reserved emission credits for averaging or trading.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reserved credits become actual emission credits when you submit  your final report. However, we may revoke these emission credits if we  are unable to verify them after reviewing your reports or auditing your  records.</p>
