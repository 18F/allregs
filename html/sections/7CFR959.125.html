Whenever the committee finds that the handler or consignee is failing to comply with requirements and regulations applicable to handling of onions in special outlets and requiring such certificates, a Certificate or Certificates of Privilege issued such handler may be rescinded and subsequent certificates denied.

Such disqualification shall apply to, and not exceed, a reasonable period of time as determined by the committee, but in no event shall it extend beyond the date of the succeeding fiscal period. Any handler who has a Certificate rescinded or denied may appeal to the committee in writing for reconsideration of his disqualification.</p>
