The lender or borrower may request an informal review with the decision maker and the use of available alternative dispute resolution or mediation programs as a means of resolution of the adverse decision. Any adverse decision, whether appealable or non-appealable may also be reviewed by the next level RHS supervisor. Adverse decisions affecting project tenants or applicants for tenancy will be handled in accordance with 7 CFR part 1944, subpart L or successor regulations.</p>
