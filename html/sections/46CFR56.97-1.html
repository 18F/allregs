                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. The requirements in this subpart apply to pressure tests  of piping in lieu of 137 of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see  46 CFR 56.01-2). Those paragraphs reproduced are so noted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Leak tightness. It is mandatory that the design, fabrication and  erection of piping constructed under the regulations in this subchapter  demonstrate leak tightness. Except where otherwise permitted in this  subpart, this requirement must be met by a hydrostatic leak test prior  to initial operations. Where a hydrostatic test is not practicable, a  pneumatic test (Sec. 56.97-35) or initial service leak test (Sec.  56.97-38) may be substituted if approved by the Commandant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At no time during the hydrostatic test may any part of the  piping system be subjected to a stress greater than 90 percent of its  yield strength (0.2 percent offset) at test temperature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pneumatic tests may be used in lieu of the required hydrostatic  test (except as permitted in paragraph (b)(3) of this section), only  when--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Piping subassemblies or systems are so designed or supported  that they cannot be safely filled with water; \1\ or ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">\1\ These tests may be made with the item being tested partially  filled with water, if desired. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Piping subassemblies or systems are to be used in services  where traces of the testing medium cannot be tolerated and, whenever  possible, the piping subassemblies or system have been previously  hydrostatically tested to the pressure required in Sec. 56.97-30(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A pneumatic test at a pressure not to exceed 25 psig may be  applied before a hydrostatic or a pneumatic test as a means of locating  major leaks. The preliminary pneumatic test must be carried out in  accordance with the requirements of Sec. 56.97-35.</p><p class="depth3">Note: Compressed gas is hazardous when used as a testing medium. It  is, therefore, recommended that special precautions for protection of  personnel be taken whenever gas under pressure is used as the test  medium.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The hydrostatic test of the piping system, when conducted in  accordance with the requirements of this part, is acceptable as the test  for piping subassemblies and may also be used in lieu of any such test  required by the material specification for material used in the piping  subassembly or system provided the minimum test pressure required for  the piping system is met, except where the installation would prevent  performing any nondestructive examination required by the material  specification to be performed subsequent to the hydrostatic or pneumatic  test.
