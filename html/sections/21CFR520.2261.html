In turkeys for control of coccidiosis (Eimeria meleagrimitis, Eimeria adenoeides). Medicate as follows: Infectious coryza in chickens, medicate for 2 consecutive days; acute fowl cholera and pullorum disease, in chickens, medicate for 6 consecutive days; coccidiosis, in chickens and turkeys, medicate as in paragraph (c) of this section, then reduce amount of medication to one-half for 4 additional days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitations.

Do not medicate chickens or turkeys producing eggs for human consumption. Treatment of all diseases should be instituted early. Treatment should continue 24 to 48 hours beyond the remission of disease symptoms, but not to exceed a total of 5 consecutive days in cattle or swine. Medicated cattle, swine, chickens, and turkeys must actually consume enough medicated water which provides the recommended dosages. Do not use in female dairy cattle 20 months of age or older. Use of sulfamethazine in this class of cattle may cause milk residues. A withdrawal period has not been established in preruminating calves. Do not use in calves to be processed for veal.
