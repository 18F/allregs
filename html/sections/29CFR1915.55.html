                            <p class="depth0">The provisions of this section shall apply to ship repairing,  shipbuilding and shipbreaking.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Transporting, moving and storing compressed gas cylinders. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Valve protection caps shall be in place and secure. Oil shall not be  used to lubricate protection caps.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When cylinders are hoisted, they shall be secured on a cradle,  slingboard or pallet. They shall not be hoisted by means of magnets or  choker slings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cylinders shall be moved by tilting and rolling them on their  bottom edges. They shall not be intentionally dropped, struck, or  permitted to strike each other violently.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When cylinders are transported by vehicle, they shall be secured  in position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Valve protection caps shall not be used for lifting cylinders  from one vertical position to another. Bars shall not be used under  valves or valve protection caps to pry cylinders loose when frozen.  Warm, not boiling, water shall be used to thaw cylinders loose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Unless cylinders are firmly secured on a special carrier  intended for this purpose, regulators shall be removed and valve  protection caps put in place before cylinders are moved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A suitable cylinder truck, chain, or other steadying device  shall be used to keep cylinders from being knocked over while in use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> When work is finished, when cylinders are empty or when  cylinders are moved at any time, the cylinder valves shall be closed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Acetylene cylinders shall be secured in an upright position at  all times except, if necessary, for short periods of time while  cylinders are actually being hoisted or carried.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Placing cylinders. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cylinders shall be kept far enough away  from the actual welding or cutting operation so that sparks, hot slag or  flame will not reach them. When this is impractical, fire resistant  shields shall be provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cylinders shall be placed where they cannot become part of an  electrical circuit. Electrodes shall not be struck against a cylinder to  strike an arc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fuel gas cylinders shall be placed with valve end up whenever  they are in use. They shall not be placed in a location where they would  be subject to open flame, hot metal, or other sources of artificial  heat.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cylinders containing oxygen or acetylene or other fuel gas shall  not be taken into confined spaces.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Treatment of cylinders. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cylinders, whether full or empty,  shall not be used as rollers or supports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No person other than the gas supplier shall attempt to mix gases  in a cylinder. No one except the owner of the cylinder or person  authorized by him shall refill a cylinder. No one shall use a cylinder's  contents for purposes other than those intended by the supplier. Only  cylinders bearing Interstate Commerce Commission identification and  inspection markings shall be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No damaged or defective cylinder shall be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use of fuel gas. The employer shall thoroughly instruct  employees in the safe use of fuel gas, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before connecting a regulator to a cylinder valve, the valve  shall be opened slightly and closed immediately. (This action is  generally termed ``cracking'' and is intended to clear the valve of dust  or dirt that might otherwise enter the regulator.) The person cracking  the valve shall stand to one side of the outlet, not in front of it. The  valve of a fuel gas cylinder shall not be cracked where the gas would  reach welding work, sparks, flame or other possible sources of ignition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cylinder valve shall always be opened slowly to prevent  damage to the regulator. To permit quick closing, valves on fuel gas  cylinders shall not be opened more than 1\1/2\ turns. When a special  wrench is required, it shall be left in position on the stem of the  valve while the cylinder is in use so that the fuel gas flow can be shut  off quickly in case of an emergency. In the case of manifolded or  coupled cylinders, at least one such wrench shall always be available  for immediate use. Nothing shall be placed on top of a fuel gas  cylinder, when in use, which may damage   the safety device or interfere with the quick closing of the valve.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fuel gas shall not be used from cylinders through torches or  other devices which are equipped with shut-off valves without reducing  the pressure through a suitable regulator attached to the cylinder valve  or manifold.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Before a regulator is removed from a cylinder valve, the  cylinder valve shall always be closed and the gas released from the  regulator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If, when the valve on a fuel gas cylinder is opened, there is  found to be a leak around the valve stem, the valve shall be closed and  the gland nut tightened. If this action does not stop the leak, the use  of the cylinder shall be discontinued, and it shall be properly tagged  and removed from the vessel. In the event that fuel gas should leak from  the cylinder valve rather than from the valve stem and the gas cannot be  shut off, the cylinder shall be properly tagged and removed from the  vessel. If a regulator attached to a cylinder valve will effectively  stop a leak through the valve seat, the cylinder need not be removed  from the vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If a leak should develop at a fuse plug or other safety device,  the cylinder shall be removed from the vessel</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Fuel gas and oxygen manifolds. (1) Fuel gas and oxygen manifolds  shall bear the name of the substance they contain in letters at least  one </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> inch high which shall be either painted on the manifold or on a  sign permanently attached to it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fuel gas and oxygen manifolds shall be placed in safe and  accessible locations in the open air. They shall not be located within  enclosed spaces.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Manifold hose connections, including both ends of the supply  hose that lead to the manifold, shall be such that the hose cannot be  interchanged between fuel gas and oxygen manifolds and supply header  connections. Adapters shall not be used to permit the interchange of  hose. Hose connections shall be kept free of grease and oil.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When not in use, manifold and header hose connections shall be  capped.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Nothing shall be placed on top of a manifold, when in use, which  will damage the manifold or interfere with the quick closing of the  valves.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Hose. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fuel gas hose and oxygen hose shall be easily  distinguishable from each other. The contrast may be made by different  colors or by surface characteristics readily distinguishable by the  sense of touch. Oxygen and fuel gas hoses shall not be interchangeable.  A single hose having more than one gas passage, a wall failure of which  would permit the flow of one gas into the other gas passage, shall not  be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When parallel sections of oxygen and fuel gas hose are taped  together not more than 4 inches out of 8 inches shall be covered by  tape.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All hose carrying acetylene, oxygen, natural or manufactured  fuel gas, or any gas or substance which may ignite or enter into  combustion or be in any way harmful to employees, shall be inspected at  the beginning of each shift. Defective hose shall be removed from  service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Hose which has been subjected to flashback or which shows  evidence of severe wear or damage shall be tested to twice the normal  pressure to which it is subject, but in no case less than two hundered  (200) psi. Defective hose or hose in doubtful condition shall not be  used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Hose couplings shall be of the type that cannot be unlocked or  disconnected by means of a straight pull without rotary motion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Boxes used for the stowage of gas hose shall be ventilated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Torches. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Clogged torch tip openings shall be cleaned with  suitable cleaning wires, drills or other devices designed for such  purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Torches shall be inspected at the beginning of each shift for  leaking shutoff valves, hose couplings, and tip connections. Defective  torches shall not be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Torches shall be lighted by friction lighters or other approved  devices, and not by matches or from hot work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Pressure regulators. Oxygen and fuel gas pressure regulators  including their related gauges shall be in proper working order while in  use.</p>
