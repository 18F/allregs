                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Overview. This section prescribes the conditions under which tax  does not apply to the removal or entry of kerosene for use for a  feedstock purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section:</p><p class="depth2">Feedstock purpose means the use of kerosene for nonfuel purposes in  the manufacture or production of any substance other than gasoline,  diesel fuel, or special fuels referred to in section 4041. Thus, for  example, kerosene is used for a feedstock purpose when it is used as an  ingredient in the production of paint and is not used for a feedstock  purpose when it is used to power machinery at a factory where paint is  produced.</p><p class="depth2">Feedstock user means a person that uses kerosene for a feedstock  purpose.</p><p class="depth2">Registered feedstock user means a feedstock user that is--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Registered under section 4101 as a feedstock user; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With respect to removals and entries before October 1, 2000, a  taxable fuel registrant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exemption for removals and entries. Tax is not imposed on the  removal or entry of kerosene if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The person otherwise liable for tax is a taxable fuel  registrant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a removal from a terminal, the terminal is an  approved terminal; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The person otherwise liable for tax uses the kerosene for a  feedstock purpose; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The kerosene is sold for use by the buyer for a feedstock  purpose and, at the time of the sale, the person otherwise liable for  tax has an unexpired certificate (described in paragraph (e) of this  section) from the buyer and has no reason to believe any information in  the certificate is false.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Later sale--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Paragraph (c) of this section does  not apply with respect to kerosene that is sold as described in  paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section if the buyer in that sale (the  certifying buyer) sells the kerosene.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Imposition of tax; liability for tax. Notwithstanding Sec. Sec.  48.4081-2 and 48.4081-3, in any case in which paragraph (d)(1) of this  section applies, tax with respect to that kerosene is imposed at the  time of the sale by the certifying buyer and the certifying buyer is  liable for the tax.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rate of tax. For the rate of tax, see section 4081.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Certificate--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The certificate described in this  paragraph (e) is a statement by a buyer that is signed under penalties  of perjury by a person with authority to bind the buyer, is in  substantially the same form as the model certificate provided in  paragraph (e)(2) of this section, and contains all information necessary  to complete the model certificate. A new certificate or notice that the  current certificate is invalid must be given if any information in the  current certificate changes. The certificate may be included as part of  any business records normally used to document a sale. The certificate  expires on the earliest of the following dates:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date one year after the effective date of the certificate  (which may be no earlier than the date it is signed).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date the buyer provides the seller a new certificate or  notice that the current certificate is invalid.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The date the seller is notified by the Internal Revenue  Service or the buyer that the buyer's registration has been revoked or  suspended.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Model certificate.</p><p class="depth3">CERTIFICATE OF REGISTERED FEEDSTOCK USER  (To support tax-free removals and entries of kerosene under section 4082</p><p class="depth3">of the Internal Revenue Code.)  --------------------------------------(Buyer) certifies the following Name of Buyer</p><p class="depth3">under penalties of perjury:</p><p class="depth3">Buyer is a registered feedstock user with registration number ------ --.
