                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction--(1) In general. Section 162(e)(1) denies a  deduction for certain amounts paid or incurred in connection with  activities described in section 162(e)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> (A) and (D) (lobbying  activities). To determine the nondeductible amount, a taxpayer must  allocate costs to lobbying activities. This section describes costs that  must be allocated to lobbying activities and prescribes rules permitting  a taxpayer to use a reasonable method to allocate those costs. This  section does not apply to taxpayers subject to section 162(e)(5)(A). In  addition, this section does not apply for purposes of sections 4911 and  4945 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Recordkeeping. For recordkeeping requirements, see section 6001  and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reasonable method of allocating costs--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A  taxpayer must use a reasonable method to allocate the costs described in  paragraph (c) of this section to lobbying activities. A method is not  reasonable unless it is applied consistently and is consistent with the  special rules in paragraph (g) of this section. Except as provided in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, reasonable methods of allocating costs  to lobbying activities include (but are not limited to)--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The ratio method described in paragraph (d) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The gross-up method described in paragraph (e) of this section;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A method that applies the principles of section 263A and the  regulations thereunder (see paragraph (f) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Taxpayers not permitted to use certain methods. A taxpayer  (other than one subject to section 6033(e)) that does not pay or incur  reasonable labor costs for persons engaged in lobbying activities may  not use the gross-up method. For example, a partnership or sole  proprietorship in which the lobbying activities are performed by the  owners who do not receive a salary or guaranteed payment for services  does not pay or incur reasonable labor costs for persons engaged in  those activities and may not use the gross-up method.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Costs allocable to lobbying activities--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Costs  properly allocable to lobbying activities include labor costs and  general and administrative costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Labor costs. For each taxable year, labor costs include costs  attributable to full-time, part-time, and contract employees. Labor  costs include all elements of compensation, such as basic compensation,  overtime pay, vacation pay, holiday pay, sick leave pay, payroll taxes,  pension costs, employee benefits, and payments to a supplemental  unemployment benefit plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> General and administrative costs. For each taxable year, general  and administrative costs include depreciation, rent, utilities,  insurance, maintenance costs, security costs, and other administrative  department costs (for example, payroll, personnel, and accounting).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Ratio method--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Under the ratio method described  in this paragraph (d), a taxpayer allocates to lobbying activities the  sum of its third-party costs (as defined in paragraph (d)(5) of this  section) allocable to lobbying activities and the costs determined by  using the following formula:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR21JY95.001</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lobbying labor hours. Lobbying labor hours are the hours that a  taxpayer's personnel spend on lobbying activities during the taxable  year. A taxpayer may use any reasonable method to determine the number  of labor hours spent on lobbying activities and may use the de minimis  rule of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. A taxpayer may treat as zero  the lobbying labor hours of personnel engaged in secretarial, clerical,  support, and other administrative activities (as opposed to activities  involving significant judgment with respect to lobbying activities).  Thus, for example, the hours spent on lobbying activities by para- professionals and analysts may not be treated as zero.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Total labor hours. Total labor hours means the total number of  hours that a taxpayer's personnel spend on a taxpayer's trade or  business during the taxable year. A taxpayer may make reasonable  assumptions concerning total hours spent by personnel on the taxpayer's  trade or business. For example, it may be reasonable, based on all the  facts and circumstances, to assume that all full-time personnel spend  1,800 hours per year on a taxpayer's trade or business. If, under  paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a taxpayer treats as zero the lobbying  labor hours of personnel engaged in secretarial, clerical, support, and  other administrative activities, the taxpayer must also treat as zero  the total labor hours of all personnel engaged in those activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Total costs of operations. A taxpayer's total costs of  operations means the total costs of the taxpayer's trade or business for  a taxable year, excluding third-party costs (as defined in paragraph  (d)(5) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)(A)</em> or dues or other similar amounts that are not deductible in  whole or in part under section 162(e)(3)) and amounts paid or incurred  for travel (including meals and lodging while away from home) and  entertainment relating in whole or in part to lobbying activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Example. The provisions of this paragraph (d) are illustrated by  the following example.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In 1996, three full-time employees, A, B, and C, of  Taxpayer W engage in both lobbying activities and nonlobbying  activities. A spends 300 hours, B spends 1,700 hours, and C spends 1,000  hours on lobbying activities, for a total of 3,000 hours spent on  lobbying activities for W. W reasonably assumes that each of its three  employees spends 2,000 hours a year on W's business.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> W's total costs of operations are $300,000. W has no third- party costs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Under the ratio method, X allocates $150,000 to its lobbying  activities for 1996, as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR21JY95.002</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, the taxpayer allocates to lobbying  activities the sum of its third-party costs (as defined in paragraph  (d)(5) of this section) allocable to lobbying activities and 175 percent  of its basic lobbying labor costs (as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of  this section) of all personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, the taxpayer allocates to  lobbying activities the sum of its third-party costs (as   defined in paragraph (d)(5) of this section) allocable to lobbying  activities and 225 percent of its basic lobbying labor costs (as defined  in paragraph (e)(3)), excluding the costs of personnel who engage in  secretarial, clerical, support, and other administrative activities (as  opposed to activities involving significant judgment with respect to  lobbying activities).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Basic lobbying labor costs. For purposes of this paragraph (e),  basic lobbying labor costs are the basic costs of lobbying labor hours  (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) determined for the  appropriate personnel. For purposes of this paragraph (e), basic costs  of lobbying labor hours are wages or other similar costs of labor,  including, for example, guaranteed payments for services. Basic costs do  not include pension, profit-sharing, employee benefits, and supplemental  unemployment benefit plan costs, or other similar costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Example. The provisions of this paragraph (e) are illustrated by  the following example.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In 1996, three employees, A, B, and C, of Taxpayer X  engage in both lobbying activities and nonlobbying activities. A spends  300 hours, B spends 1,700 hours, and C spends 1,000 hours on lobbying  activities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> X has no third-party costs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of the gross-up method, X determines that its  basic labor costs are $20 per hour for A, $30 per hour for B, and $25  per hour for C. Thus, its basic lobbying labor costs are  ($20x300)+($30x1,700)+($25x1,000), or ($6,000+$51,000+$25,000), for  total basic lobbying labor costs for 1996 of $82,000.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Under the gross-up method, X allocates $143,500 to its lobbying  activities for 1996, as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR21JY95.003</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Section 263A cost allocation methods--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A taxpayer  may allocate its costs to lobbying activities under the principles set  forth in section 263A and the regulations thereunder, except to the  extent inconsistent with paragraph (g) of this section. For this  purpose, lobbying activities are considered a service department or  function. Therefore, a taxpayer may allocate costs to lobbying  activities by applying the methods provided in Sec. Sec. 1.263A-1  through 1.263A-3. See Sec. 1.263A-1(e)(4), which describes service  costs generally; Sec. 1.263A-1(f), which sets forth cost allocation  methods available under section 263A; and Sec. 1.263A-1(g)(4), which  provides methods of allocating service costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Example. The provisions of this paragraph (f) are illustrated by  the following example.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Three full-time employees, A, B, and C, work in the  Washington office of Taxpayer Y, a manufacturing concern. They each  engage in lobbying activities and nonlobbying activities. In 1996, A  spends 75 hours, B spends 1,750 hours, and C spends 2,000 hours on  lobbying activities. A's hours are not spent on direct contact lobbying  as defined in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. All three work 2,000  hours during 1996. The Washington office also employs one secretary, D,  who works exclusively for A, B, and C.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In addition, three departments in the corporate headquarters in  Chicago benefit the Washington office: Public affairs, human resources,  and insurance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Y is subject to section 263A and uses the step-allocation  method to allocate its service costs. Prior to the amendments to section  162(e), the Washington office was treated as an overall management  function for purposes of section 263A. As such, its costs were fully  deductible and no further allocations were made under Y's step  allocation. Following the amendments to section 162(e), Y adopts its  263A step-allocation methodology to allocate costs to lobbying  activities. Y adds a lobbying department to its step-allocation program,  which results in an allocation of costs to the lobbying department from  both the Washington office and the Chicago office.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Y develops a labor ratio to allocate its Washington office  costs between the newly defined lobbying department and the overall  management department. To determine the hours allocable to lobbying  activities, Y uses   the de minimis rule of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Under this  rule, A's hours spent on lobbying activities are treated as zero because  less than 5 percent of A's time is spent on lobbying (75/2,000 = 3.75%).  In addition, because D works exclusively for personnel engaged in  lobbying activities, D's hours are not used to develop the allocation  ratio. Y assumes that D's allocation of time follows the average time of  all the personnel engaged in lobbying activities. Thus, Y's labor ratio  is determined as follows:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Departments</p><p class="depth4">-----------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Employee                                                  Overall</p><p class="depth4">Lobbying hours    management      Total hours</p><p class="depth4">hours ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A...............................................................               0           2,000           2,000 B...............................................................           1,750             250           2,000 C...............................................................           2,000               0           2,000</p><p class="depth4">-----------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Totals....................................................           3,750           2,250           6,000 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR21JY95.004</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> In 1996, the Washington office has the following costs:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Account                               Amount ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Professional Salaries and Benefits...........................   $660,000 Clerical Salaries and Benefits...............................     50,000 Rent Expense.................................................    100,000 Depreciation on Furniture and Equip..........................     40,000 Utilities....................................................     15,000 Outside Payroll Service......................................      5,000 Miscellaneous................................................     10,000 Third-Party Lobbying (Law Firm)..............................     90,000</p><p class="depth4">----------</p><p class="depth4">Total Washington Costs.................................   $970,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> In addition, $233,800 of costs from the public affairs  department, $30,000 of costs from the insurance department, and $5,000  of costs from the human resources department are allocable to the  Washington office from departments in Chicago.

The following rules apply to any reasonable  method of allocating costs to lobbying activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> De minimis rule for labor hours. Subject to the exception  provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, a taxpayer may treat time  spent by an individual on lobbying activities as zero if less than five  percent of the person's time is spent on lobbying activities. Reasonable  methods must be used to determine if less than five percent of a  person's time is spent on lobbying activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Direct contact lobbying labor hours. Notwithstanding paragraph  (g)(1) of this section, a taxpayer must treat all hours spent by a  person on direct contact lobbying (as well as the hours that person  spends in connection with direct contact lobbying, including time spent  traveling that is allocable to the direct contact lobbying) as labor  hours allocable to lobbying activities. An activity is direct contact  lobbying if it is a meeting, telephone conversation, letter, or other  similar means of communication with a legislator (other than a local  legislator) or covered executive branch official (as defined in section  162(e)(6)) and otherwise qualifies as a lobbying activity. A person who  engages in research, preparation, and other background activities  related to   direct contact lobbying but who does not make direct contact with a  legislator or covered executive branch official is not engaged in direct  contact lobbying.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Taxpayer defined. For purposes of this section, a taxpayer  includes a tax-exempt organization subject to section 6033(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Effective date. This section is effective for amounts paid or  incurred on or after July 21, 1995. Taxpayers must adopt a reasonable  interpretation of sections 162(e)(1)(A) and (D) for amounts paid or  incurred before this date.  [T.D. 8602, 60 FR 37573, July 21, 1995]</p>
