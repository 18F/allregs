                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Inconclusive elections. An inconclusive election is one where challenged ballots are not sufficient to affect the outcome of the election and one of the following occurs:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The ballot provides for at least three (3) choices, one of which is ``no

union'' or ``neither,'' and the votes are equally divided; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The ballot provides for at least three (3) choices, the choice receiving the highest number of votes does not receive a majority, and at least two other choices receive the next highest and same number of votes; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a runoff ballot provides for a choice between two labor organizations and results in the votes being equally divided; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the Regional Director determines that there have been significant procedural irregularities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligibility to vote in a rerun election. The Region uses the latest payroll period to determine eligibility to vote in a rerun election.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ballot. If the Regional Director determines that the election is inconclusive, the election will be rerun with all the choices that appeared on the original ballot.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Number of reruns. There will be only one rerun of an inconclusive election. If the rerun results in another inconclusive election, the tally of ballots will show a majority of valid ballots has not been cast for any choice, and the Regional Director will issue a certification of results. If necessary, a runoff may be held when an original election is rerun.</p>
