The electronic media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAPQS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: WebFIRE Administrator, MD C404-02, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703. The same file with the CBI omitted must be submitted to the EPA by direct computer-to-computer electronic transfer via EPA-provided software.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For any performance test conducted using test methods that are not compatible with the EPA-provided software, the owner or operator shall submit the results of the performance test to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in Sec.  60.4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Operating permit application. An owner or operator who submits an operating permit application instead of a Precompliance Report shall submit the information specified in paragraph (d) of this section, Precompliance Report, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Alternative monitoring parameters. The owner or operator who has been directed by any section of this subpart or any section of another subpart referenced by this subpart that expressly referenced this paragraph (j) to set unique monitoring parameters, or who requests approval to monitor a different parameter than those specified in Sec.  63.1415(b), shall submit the information specified in paragraphs (j)(1) through (3) of this section in the Precompliance Report, as required by paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The required information shall include a description of the parameter(s) to be monitored to ensure the recovery device, control device, or control technology is operated in conformance with its design and achieves the specified emission limit or percent reduction and an explanation of the criteria used to select the parameter(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The required information shall include a description of the methods and procedures that will be used to demonstrate that the parameter indicates proper operation, the schedule for this demonstration, and a statement that

the owner or operator will establish a level for the monitored parameter as part of the Notification of Compliance Status report required in paragraph (e) of this section, unless this information has already been included in the operating permit application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The required information shall include a description of the proposed monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting system to include the frequency and content of monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting. Further, the rationale for the proposed monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting system shall be included if either condition in paragraph (j)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section is met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If monitoring and recordkeeping is not continuous; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If reports of daily average values will not be included in Periodic Reports when the monitored parameter value is above the maximum level or below the minimum level as established in the operating permit or the Notification of Compliance Status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Alternative continuous monitoring. An owner or operator choosing not to implement the monitoring provisions specified in Sec.  63.1415 for storage vessels, continuous process vents, batch process vents, or aggregate batch vent streams may instead request approval to use alternative continuous monitoring provisions according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (k)(1) through (4) of this section. Requests shall be submitted in the Precompliance Report as specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section if not already included in the operating permit application and shall contain the information specified in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The provisions in Sec.  63.8(f)(5)(i) shall govern the review and approval of requests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An owner or operator of an affected source that does not have an automated monitoring and recording system capable of measuring parameter values at least once every 15 minutes and that does not generate continuous records may request approval to use a nonautomated system with less frequent monitoring in accordance with paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The requested system shall include manual reading and recording of the value of the relevant operating parameter no less frequently than once per hour. Daily average (or batch cycle daily average) values shall be calculated from these hourly values and recorded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The request shall contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A description of the planned monitoring and recordkeeping system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Documentation that the affected source does not have an automated monitoring and recording system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Justification for requesting an alternative monitoring and recordkeeping system; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Demonstration to the Administrator's satisfaction that the proposed monitoring frequency is sufficient to represent control or recovery device operating conditions, considering typical variability of the specific process and control or recovery device operating parameter being monitored.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An owner or operator may request approval to use an automated data compression recording system that does not record monitored operating parameter values at a set frequency (for example, once every 15 minutes) but records all values that meet set criteria for variation from previously recorded values, in accordance with paragraphs (k)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The requested system shall be designed to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Measure the operating parameter value at least once every 15 minutes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Except for the monitoring of batch process vents, calculate hourly average values each hour during periods of operation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Record the date and time when monitors are turned off or on;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Recognize unchanging data that may indicate the monitor is not functioning properly, alert the operator, and record the incident;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Calculate daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average values of the monitored operating parameter based on all measured data; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> If the daily average is not a deviation, as defined in Sec.  63.1413(i), from the

operating parameter, the data for that operating day may be converted to hourly average values, and the four or more individual records for each hour in the operating day may be discarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The request shall contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A description of the monitoring system and data compression recording system, including the criteria used to determine which monitored values are recorded and retained;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The method for calculating daily averages and batch cycle daily averages; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A demonstration that the system meets all criteria in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An owner or operator may request approval to use other alternative monitoring systems according to the procedures specified in Sec.  63.8(f)(4).[65 FR 3290, Jan. 20, 2000, as amended at 79 FR 60933, Oct. 8, 2014]
