                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Marine inspectors shall be assigned to make factory  inspections of hydraulic releases, as described in paragraph (d) of this  section for sampling and testing. In addition, the Commander of the  Coast Guard District may detail a marine inspector at any time to visit  any place where approved hydraulic releases are manufactured or  reconditioned to observe production methods and to conduct any  inspections or tests which may be deemed advisable. The marine inspector  shall be admitted to any place in the factory or place where work is  done on hydraulic releases or their components. In addition, the marine  inspector may take samples of assembled hydraulic releases or parts or  materials used in their construction for further examination,  inspection, or tests. The manufacturer shall provide a suitable place  and the apparatus necessary for the performance of the tests which are  conducted at the place of manufacture by the marine inspector.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification of tests. The sampling, inspections, and tests  conducted upon hydraulic releases shall fall within one of the following  general classifications, as described hereafter:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Preapproval tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Factory inspections and tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Spot check tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Periodic servicing tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> shall be conducted by a marine  inspector at the factory. The ``Physical and operational tests'' of that  table shall be conducted at a laboratory accepted by the Commandant.</p><p class="depth2">Table 160.062-4(c)--Preapproval Tests \1\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Number of specimens           Name of tests                    Reference ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">4  Visual and dimensional          Para. 4.2.1, 4.2.2, and 4.3</p><p class="depth2">examination.                    of MIL-R-15041C.</p><p class="depth2">4  Physical and operational tests  Para. 4.2.1, 4.2.3, and 4.4</p><p class="depth2">of MIL-R-15041C. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \1\ These tests are called ``Lot acceptance tests,'' in Military</p><p class="depth2">Specification MIL-R-15041C.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Visual and dimensional examination. The marine inspector shall  examine the 4 hydraulic release samples of the preapproval sample for  their visual and dimensional characteristics. If all 4 of the devices  are in agreement with the manufacturer's plans previously reviewed by  the Commandant, the 4 devices will be accepted and are to be assembled  for further testing under the ``Physical and operational tests'' of  paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Physical and operational tests. Each hydraulic release selected  under Table 160.062-4(c) for the ``Physical and operational tests''  shall undergo each of the tests described in this paragraph without  renewal of parts or repairs between the tests. The tests shall be  conducted in the following sequence:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Submergence test. A hydraulic release shall be tested by  applying buoyant loads of its designed capacity to its spring-tensioned  gripe as required under Sec. 160.062-3(b) while the device is submerged  in water or in a water-filled pressure testing tank. A hydraulic release  shall show by its submergence test that it meets the buoyant capacity  and release depth requirements of Sec. 160.062-3 (b) and (c) by  automatically tripping and releasing its load.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Temperature test. After its submergence test, a hydraulic  release sample shall be placed in a cold box at minus 30 degrees F. for  4 hours. Upon completion of this conditioning, the sample device shall  be opened for inspection and shall show no significant change in the  position of the hydraulic or manual control as a result of the low  temperature exposure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Corrosion resisting test. After the completion of its  temperature test, a hydraulic release sample shall be exposed to a 20  percent salt spray test for 160 continuous hours in accordance with  Federal Test Method Standard No. 151. At the conclusion of this test,  the sample device shall be entirely serviceable and shall show a minimal  amount of corrosion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Second temperature test. After its corrosion resisting test, a  hydraulic release sample shall undergo a repeat of the temperature test,  subdivision (ii) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Second submergence test. The final test of a hydraulic release  sample shall be a repeat of the submergence test, paragraph (c)(2)(i) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Factory inspections and tests. For purposes of sampling, a lot  shall consist of not more than 500 hydraulic releases of the same model.  Manufacturers of approved hydraulic releases shall maintain quality  control of the materials used, manufacturing methods, workmanship, and  the finished product as to produce hydraulic releases in conformity with  the approvals previously issued by the Commandant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and MIL-STD-105,  and checking for compliance with specific details as described therein.</p><p class="depth3">Table 160.062-4(d)(1)--Sampling for Visual and Dimensional Examination</p><p class="depth3">\1\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Rejection</p><p class="depth3">Number of release devices in       Number of release      number</p><p class="depth3">inspection lot              devices in sample   (defectives) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 15 and under.........................

The submergence test of paragraph  (c)(2)(i) shall be performed on each of the remaining hydraulic releases  in a production lot after the selection of the lot samples required by  paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Such individual submergence tests may  be performed at the factory in a pressure tank apparatus which simulates  the hydrostatic pressure and the various tension loads on the hydraulic  release. Those hydraulic releases which do not pass this submergence  test shall be removed from the production lot as unacceptable, but may  be reworked and included in a subsequent lot. After the completion of  these individual submergence tests and after receipt of the laboratory's  test report showing that the tests on the lot samples were  satisfactorily met, the Commander of the Coast Guard District in which  the factory is located shall have the manufacturer notified that this  production lot of hydraulic releases meets the requirements of this  specification subpart. After being marked as required by Sec. 160.062- 5, the manufacturer may sell such hydraulic releases as approved  equipment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Hydraulic releases which have been rejected may not, unless  subsequently accepted, be sold or offered for sale under representation  as being in compliance with this specification or as being approved for  use on vessels subject to inspection under this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Records and test reports. The manufacturer shall maintain  records and copies of test reports for each production lot of hydraulic  releases manufactured for a period of five (5) years from the date  notified that a production lot meets the requirements in this subpart.  These records and test reports, upon request, shall be made available to  the marine inspector. The manufacturer will be provided with a copy of  the laboratory's test report concerning each production lot of hydraulic  releases submitted for testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Spot checks. As one of the conditions in granting an approval  for a hydraulic release under this subpart, the Coast Guard reserves the  right to spot check at any time and at any place the product, parts, and  complete assemblies of hydraulic releases covered by the approval. The  spot check shall be by a marine inspector who shall be admitted to the  place or places where work may be performed before, during, or after the  manufacture of hydraulic releases or at any place where hydraulic  releases may be assembled, reworked, repaired, or reconditioned by the  manufacturer of any repair facility accepted by the Commandant in  accordance with the procedure contained in Sec. 160.062-7. A spot check  includes having a marine inspector compare materials, parts, and  workmanship and/or complete hydraulic releases with the manufacturer's  approved plans, records and test reports to ascertain compliance with  these requirements. The marine inspector may select samples of materials  or parts used in the construction of hydraulic releases and complete  hydraulic releases and may order or have performed any or all of the  tests described in this section conducted on such devices or parts  thereof. This work and any tests required shall be borne by the  manufacturer without cost to the Coast Guard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Periodic Servicing and Testing. A hydraulic release is inspected  as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inspection for devices not installed after manufacture. A  hydraulic release, that is not installed after manufacture and is stored  for period of 24 months or less, is not required to be inspected or  tested before installation but must be stamped by a marine inspector on  the inspection tag required in Sec. 160.062-5(b)(2) with--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The word ``Installed'';</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The installation date; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Marine Inspection Office identification letters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inspection for devices that have been installed. A hydraulic  release that is installed for a period of 12 months or more must pass  the test contained in paragraph (f)(3) of this section and be marked as  required in paragraph (f)(5) of this section. If, after passing the  test, the device is stored for a period of 24 months or less, it must be  stamped as required in paragraph (f)(1) of this paragraph by the marine  inspector before reinstallation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Devices stored longer than 24 months. A hydraulic release that  is stored for a period of more than 24 months must be inspected and  tested by an employee of a repair or test facility, accepted in  accordance with the requirement contained in Sec. 160.062-7 or Sec.  160.062-8, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The device must be manually operated to determine if it  releases.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the device releases, it must pass the submergence test  contained in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, at a depth between 5  feet and 15 feet and be marked as required in paragraph (f)(5) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the device fails to release or fails to pass the  submergence test required in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, the  device must be disassembled, repaired, and tested in accordance with the  requirements contained in paragraph (f)(4) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Disassembly and repair tests. If a hydraulic release fails the  test contained in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section, it must be  disassembled and repaired by the manufacturer or a repair facility  accepted in accord with the requirements contained in Sec. 160.062-7  and be tested as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A production lot must be formed consisting of 12 or more but not  exceeding 100 devices.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the presence of a marine inspector, the device must pass the  submergence test contained in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section at a  depth between 5 feet and 15 feet.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any device that fails must be--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Repaired;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Placed in a subsequent lot; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Submitted to the submergence test contained in paragraph  (c)(2)(i) of this section at a depth between 5 feet and 15 feet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Marking of devices. If a hydraulic release passes the  submergence test required in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section at a  depth between 5 feet and 15 feet the marine inspector stamps the  inspection tag with--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The test date;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Marine Inspection Office identification letters; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The letters ``USCG''.
