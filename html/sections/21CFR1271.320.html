You must establish and maintain procedures for the  review, evaluation, and documentation of complaints as defined in Sec.  1271.3(aa), relating to core current good tissue practice (CGTP)  requirements, and the investigation of complaints as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Complaint file. You must maintain a record of complaints that  you receive in a file designated for complaints. The complaint file must  contain sufficient information about each complaint for proper review  and evaluation of the complaint (including the distinct identification  code of the HCT/P that is the subject of the complaint) and for  determining whether the complaint is an isolated event or represents a  trend. You must make the complaint file available for review and copying  upon request from FDA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review and evaluation of complaints. You must review and  evaluate each complaint relating to core CGTP requirements to determine  if the complaint is related to an HCT/P deviation or to an adverse  reaction, and to determine if a report under Sec. 1271.350 or another  applicable regulation is required.   As soon as practical, you must review, evaluate, and investigate each  complaint that represents an event required to be reported to FDA, as  described in Sec. 1271.350. You must review and evaluate a complaint  relating to core CGTP requirements that does not represent an event  required to be reported to determine whether an investigation is  necessary; an investigation may include referring a copy of the  complaint to another establishment that performed manufacturing steps  pertinent to the complaint. When no investigation is made, you must  maintain a record that includes the reason no investigation was made,  and the name of the individual(s) responsible for the decision not to  investigate.</p>
