The weighted average thermal transmittance  (U-value) of opaque wall elements shall be less than the values in Table  402.4.1.1. For mass walls (HC =5), criteria are presented for  low and high window/wall ratios and the criteria shall be determined by  interpolating between these values for the window/wall ratio of the  building.</p><p class="depth2">402.4.1.2 Fenestration. The design of the fenestration shall meet  the criteria of Table 402.4.1.2. When the fenestration columns labeled  ``Perimeter Daylighting'' are used, automatic daylighting controls shall  be installed in the perimeter daylighted zones of the building. These  daylighting controls shall be capable of reducing electric lighting  power to at least 50% of full power. Only those shading or lighting  controls for perimeter daylighting that are shown on the plans shall be  considered. The column labeled ``VLT = SC'' shall be used  only when the shading coefficient of the glass is less than its visible  light transmittance.</p><p class="depth2">Appendix A</p><p class="depth2">The example Alternate Component Package tables illustrate the  requirements of subsections 434.301.1, 434.402.3.1, 434.402.3.2,  434.402.4.1.1 and 434.402.4.1.2.
