Sec. 3103.4-2  Stripper well royalty reductions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Certification. The applicable royalty rate shall be used by the operator/payor when submitting the required royalty reports/payments to ONRR. By submitting royalty reports/payments using the royalty rate reduction benefits of this program, the operator certifies that the production rate for the qualifying and subsequent 12-month period was not subject to manipulation for the purpose of obtaining the benefit of a royalty rate reduction, and the royalty rate was calculated in accordance with the instructions and procedures in these regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Record retention. For seven years after production on which the operator claims a royalty rate reduction for stripper well properties, the operator must retain and make available to BLM for inspection all documents on which the calculation of the applicable royalty rate under this section relies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Agency action. If a royalty rate is improperly calculated, the MMS will calculate the correct rate and inform the operator/payors. Any additional

royalties due are payable immediately upon notification. Late payment or underpayment charges will be assessed in accordance with 30 CFR 218.102. The BLM may terminate a royalty rate reduction if it is determined that the production rate was manipulated by the operator for the purpose of receiving a royalty rate reduction. Terminations of royalty rate reductions will be effective on the effective date of the royalty rate reduction resulting from the manipulated production rate (i.e., the termination will be retroactive to the effective date of the improper reduction). The operator/payor shall pay the difference in royalty resulting from the retroactive application of the unmanipulated rate. Late payment or underpayment charges will be assessed in accordance with 30 CFR 218.102.

Sec. 3103.4-3  Heavy oil royalty reductions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Certification. The operator/payor must use the applicable royalty rate when submitting the required royalty reports/payments to the Minerals Management Service (MMS). In submitting royalty reports/payments using a royalty rate reduction the operator/payor must certify that the API oil gravity for the initial and subsequent 12-month periods was not subject to manipulation or adulteration and the royalty rate was determined in accordance with the requirements and procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Agency action. If an operator/payor incorrectly calculates the royalty rate, the BLM will determine the correct rate and notify the operator/payor in writing. Any additional royalties due are payable to MMS immediately upon receipt of this notice. Late payment or underpayment charges will be assessed in accordance with 30 CFR 218.102. The BLM will terminate a royalty rate reduction for a property if BLM determines that the API oil gravity was manipulated or adulterated by the operator/payor. Terminations of royalty rate reductions for individual properties will be effective on the effective date of the royalty rate reduction resulting from a manipulated or adulterated API oil gravity so that the termination will be retroactive to the effective date of the improper reduction. The operator/payor must pay the difference in royalty resulting from the retroactive application of the non-manipulated rate. The late payment or underpayment charges will assessed in accordance with 30 CFR 218.102.

Sec. 3103.4-4  Suspension of operations and/or production.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A suspension of all operations and production may be directed or consented to by the authorized officer only in the interest of conservation of natural resources. A suspension of operations only or a suspension of production only may be directed or consented to by the authorized officer in cases where the lessee is prevented from operating on the lease or producing from the lease, despite the exercise of due care and diligence, by reason of force majeure, that is, by matters beyond the reasonable control of the lessee. Applications for any suspension shall be filed in the proper BLM office. Complete information showing the necessity of such relief shall be furnished.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The term of any lease shall be extended by adding thereto the period of the suspension, and no lease shall be deemed to expire during any suspension.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A suspension shall take effect as of the time specified in the direction or assent of the authorized officer, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 3165.1 of this title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Rental and minimum royalty payments shall be suspended during any period of suspension of all operations and production directed or assented to by the authorized officer beginning with the first day of the lease month in which the suspension of all operations and production becomes effective, or if the suspension of all operations and production becomes effective on any date other than the first day of a lease month, beginning with the first day of the lease month following such effective date. Rental and minimum royalty

payments shall resume on the first day of the lease month in which the suspension of all operations and production is terminated. Where rentals are creditable against royalties and have been paid in advance, proper credit shall be allowed on the next rental or royalty due under the terms of the lease. Rental and minimum royalty payments shall not be suspended during any period of suspension of operations only or suspension of production only.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Where all operations and production are suspended on a lease on which there is a well capable of producing in paying quantities and the authorized officer approves resumption of operations and production, such resumption shall be regarded as terminating the suspension, including the suspension of rental and minimum royalty payments, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The relief authorized under this section also may be obtained for any Federal lease included within an approved unit or cooperative plan of development and operation. Unit or cooperative plan obligations shall not be suspended by relief obtained under this section but shall be suspended only in accordance with the terms and conditions of the specific unit or cooperative plan.
