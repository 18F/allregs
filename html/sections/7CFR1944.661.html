                                Sec. 1944.661  Individual homeowners--eligibility for HPG assistance.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The individual homeowners assisted must have income that meets the  very low- or low-income definitions, be the owner of an individual  dwelling at least 1 year prior to the time of assistance,   and be the intended occupant of the dwelling subsequent to the time of  assistance. The dwelling must be located in a rural area and be in need  of housing preservation assistance. Each homeowner is required to submit  evidence of income and ownership for retention in the grantee's files.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Income. Determination of income will be made in accordance with  7 CFR 3550.54(c). All members of the household, as defined in  Sec. 1944.656 of this subpart, must be included when determining income.  Grantees must use certifications, may require additional information  from the homeowner, and should seek advice from their attorney.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ownership. Evidence of ownership may be a photostatic copy of  the instrument evidencing ownership. Methods for assuring the intention  of the homeowner to continue to occupy the unit after assistance will be  established by the grantee. Any of the following will satisfy or fulfill  this requirement of ownership:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Full marketable title.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An undivided or divided interest in the property to be repaired,  rehabilitated, or replaced when not all of the owners are occupying the  property. HPG assistance may be made in such cases when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The occupant has been living in the house for at least 1 year  prior to the date of requesting assistance;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The grantee has no reason to believe the occupant's position of  owner/occupant will be jeopardized as a result of the improvements to be  made with HPG funds; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a loan, and to the extent possible, the co- owner(s) should also sign the security instrument.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A leasehold interest in the property to be repaired,  rehabilitated, or replaced. When the potential HPG recipient's  ``ownership'' interest in the property is based on a leasehold interest,  the lease must be in writing and a copy must be included in the  grantee's file. The unexpired portion of the lease must not be less than  5 years and must permit the recipient to make modifications to the  structure without increasing the recipient's lease cost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A life estate, with the right of present possession, control,  and beneficial use of the property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Land assignments may be accepted as evidence of ownership only  for American Indians living on a reservation, when historically the  permits have been used by the tribe and have had the comparable effect  of a life estate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other evidence of ownership. The following items may be accepted  as evidence of ownership if a recorded deed cannot be provided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any legal instrument, whether or not recorded, which is commonly  considered evidence of ownership.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evidence that the person(s) receiving assistance from the HPG  grantee is listed as the owner of the property by the local taxing  authority and is responsible for any real estate taxes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Affidavits by others in the community that the person(s)  receiving assistance from the HPG grantee has occupied the property as  the apparent owner for a period of not less than 10 years, and is  generally believed to be the owner.
