If the written  notice is provided to purchasers in a way, such as by casting or  stamping the notice into the stove, that makes it impractical to furnish  a sample of the actual notice to the Commission, the manufacturer will  provide an actual-size copy of the notice and a description of the  forming process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rationale. Manufacturers shall provide to the Commission a  statement of how the distances to combustibles required to be stated by  Sec. 1406.4(a)(1) were determined. In addition, the maufacturer will  state the type of appliance, its fuel, size, and weight, and the  material of which it is constructed, unless this information is included  in the directions submitted under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The information required to be submitted under  paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section shall be submitted for each  distinct design or model of appliance manufactured. An appliance will be  considered to be a distinct design or model if it differs from other  appliances of the same manufacturer by functional differences such as  performance, weight,   size, or capacity. Differences in cosmetic or other nonfunctional  features do not require the submission of additional information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The written notice, directions, and rationale shall be provided  to the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance, Consumer Product  Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207, by December 6, 1983. If there  is a subsequent change in the component materials or design features of  a model for which this information was previously submitted that could  cause the model to require different clearances from combustibles or a  different type of chimney, or if a new product is introduced into United  States commerce, the required information shall be submitted within 30  days after the change or introduction.
