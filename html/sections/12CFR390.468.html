The State savings association  must first deduct from assets and, thus, capital the amount by which any  investments in such a subsidiary(ies) exceed the amount of such  investments held by the State savings association as of April 12, 1989.  Next, the State savings association must deduct from assets and, thus,  tangible capital the lesser of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The State savings association's investments in and extensions of  credit to the subsidiary as of April 12, 1989; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The State savings association's investments in and extensions  of credit to the subsidiary on the date as of which the State savings  association's capital is being determined.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a State savings association holds a subsidiary (either  directly or through a subsidiary) that is itself a domestic depository  institution the FDIC may, in its sole discretion upon determining that  the amount of tangible capital that would be required would be higher if  the assets and liabilities of such subsidiary were consolidated with  those of the parent State savings association than the amount that would  be required if the parent State savings association's investment were  deducted pursuant to paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section,  consolidate the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary with those of  the parent State savings association in calculating the capital adequacy  of the parent State savings association, regardless of whether the  subsidiary would otherwise be an includable subsidiary as defined in  Sec. 390.461.</p>
