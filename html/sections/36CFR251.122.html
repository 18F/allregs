                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A historical operator has the right to continue to provide  visitor services under appropriate terms and conditions contained in a  special use authorization, as long as such services are determined by  the authorized officer to be consistent with the purposes for which the  CSU was established or expanded. A historical operator may not operate  without such an authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any person who qualifies as a historical operator under this  subpart and who wishes to exercise the rights granted to historical  operators under section 1307(a) of ANILCA (16 U.S.C. 1397(a)) must  notify the authorized officer responsible for the CSU.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A historical operator may apply for a special use authorization  to provide visitor services similar to but in lieu of those provided by  that historical operator before January 1, 1979. The authorized officer  shall grant the application if those visitor services are determined by  the authorized officer to be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Consistent with the purposes for which the applicable CSU was  established or expanded;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Similar in kind and scope to the visitor services provided by  the historical operator before January 1, 1979; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consistent with the legal rights of any other person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Upon the authorized officer's determination that the person  qualifies as a historical operator, under either paragraph (a) or  paragraph (c) of this section, the authorized officer shall amend the  current special use authorization or issue a new special use  authorization to identify that portion of the authorized services that  is deemed to be historical operations. The special use authorization  shall identify the location, type, and frequency or volume of visitor  services to be provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When a historical operator's special use authorization expires,  the authorized officer shall offer to reissue the special use  authorization for the same or similar visitor services, as long as the  visitor services remain consistent with the purposes for which the CSU  was established or expanded, the historical operator was lawfully and  adequately providing visitor services under the previous special use  authorization, and the historical operator continues to possess the  capability to provide the visitor services adequately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the operator accepts the offer to reissue, the authorized  officer shall issue a new special use authorization that clearly  identifies the historical operations as required by paragraph (d) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the authorized officer determines that it is necessary to  reduce the visitor services to be provided by a historical operator, the  authorized officer shall modify the historical operator's special use  authorization to reflect the reduced services as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If more than one historical operator provides services in the  area where visitor service capacity is to be reduced, the authorized  officer shall apportion the reduction among the historical operators,  taking into account historical operating levels and such other factors  as are relevant to achieve a proportionate reduction among the  operators.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the reductions in visitor service capacity make it necessary  to reduce operators in an area, the authorized officer shall select,  through a competitive process that is limited to historical operators  only, the operator or operators to receive a special use authorization  from among the historical operators. Historical operators participating  in this competitive process may not claim a preference as a preferred  operator under Sec. 251.124.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any of the following shall result in the loss of historical  operator status:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Revocation of a special use authorization for historical types  and levels of visitor services for failure to comply with the terms and  conditions of the special use authorization;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A historical operator's refusal of an offer to reissue a special  use authorization made pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A change in the controlling interest of a historical operator  through sale, assignment, devise, transfer, or   otherwise, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An operator's failure to provide the authorized services for a  period of more than 24 consecutive months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A change in the controlling interest of a historical operator  that results only in the acquisition of the controlling interest by an  individual or individuals, who were personally engaged in the visitor  service activities of the historical operator before January 1, 1979,  shall not be deemed a change in the historical operator's controlling  interest for the purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Nothing in this section shall prohibit the authorized officer  from authorizing persons other than historical operators to provide  visitor services in the same area, as long as historical operators  receive authorization to provide visitor services that are the same as  or similar to those they provided on or before January 1, 1979.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> If an authorized officer grants to a historical operator an  increase in the scope or level of visitor services from what was  provided on or before January 1, 1979, beyond what was authorized under  paragraph (d) of this section, for either the same or similar visitor  services, the historical operator has no right of preference for the  increased amount of authorized services. If additional operations are  authorized, the special use authorization shall explicitly state that  they are not subject to the historical operator preference.</p>
