                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility. Parties seeking approval for partitioning and  disaggregation shall request authorization for partial assignment of a  license pursuant to Sec. 1.948 of this chapter. The Commission will  consider applications that propose combinations of partitioning and  disaggregation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Phase I non-nationwide licensees may apply to partition their  licensed geographic service area or disaggregate their licensed spectrum  after constructing their systems and placing their in operation or  commencing service in accordance with the provisions in Sec. 90.725(f)  of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Phase I nationwide licensees may apply to partition their  licensed geographic service area or disaggregate their licensed spectrum  after constructing at least 40 percent of the geographic areas  designated in their applications in accordance with the provisions in  Sec. 90.725(a) of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Phase II licensees may apply to partition their licensed  geographic service area or disaggregate their licensed spectrum at any  time following the grant of their licenses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Phase I and Phase II licensees authorized to operate on Channels  161 through 170 or Channels 181 through 185 are not eligible to  partition their geographic service area or disaggregate their licensed  spectrum.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Partitioning. In the case of partitioning, applicants and  licensees must file FCC Form 603 pursuant to Sec. 1.948 and list the  partitioned service area on a schedule to the application. The  geographic coordinates must be specified in degrees, minutes, and  seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude and must be  based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83). In the case where an  FCC-recognized service area or county lines are utilized, applicants  need only list the specific area(s) through use of FCC designations or  county names that constitute the partitioned area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> License term. The license term for a partitioned license area  and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original  licensee's license term.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Construction requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requirements for partitioning.  Parties seeking authority to partition must meet one of the following  construction requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The partitionee may certify that it will satisfy the applicable  construction requirements set forth in Sec. Sec. 90.767 or 90.769 of  this part, as applicable, for the partitioned license area; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The original licensee may certify that it has or will meet its  five-year construction requirement and will meet the ten-year  construction requirement, as set forth in Sec. Sec. 90.767 or 90.769 of  this part, as applicable, for the entire license area. In that case, the  partitionee must only satisfy the requirements for ``substantial  service,'' as set forth in Sec. 90.743(a)(1) of this part, for the  partitioned license area by the end of the original ten-year license  term of the licensee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Failure by any partitionee to meet its respective construction  requirements will result in the automatic cancellation of the  partitioned license without further Commission action (see Sec. 1.946).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requirements for disaggregation. Parties seeking authority to  disaggregate spectrum must certify in FCC Form 601 which of the parties  will be responsible for meeting the five-year and ten-year construction  requirements for the particular market as set forth in Sec. 90.767 or  Sec. 90.769, as applicable. Parties may agree to share responsibility  for meeting the construction requirements. If one party accepts  responsibility for meeting the construction requirements and later fails  to do so, then its license will cancel automatically without further  Commission action. If both parties accept responsibility for meeting the  construction requirements and later fail to do so, then   both their licenses will cancel automatically without further Commission  action.
