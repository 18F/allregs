                                Sec. 1.1312-1  Double inclusion of an item of gross income.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Paragraph (1) of section 1312 applies if the determination  requires the inclusion in a taxpayer's gross income of an item which was  erroneously included in the gross income of the same taxpayer for  another taxable year or of a related taxpayer for the same or another  taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The application of paragraph (a) of this section may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. A taxpayer who keeps his books on the cash method  erroneously included in income on his return for 1947 an item of accrued  rent. In 1952, after the period of limitation on refunds for 1947 had  expired, the Commissioner discovered that the taxpayer received this  rent in 1948 and asserted a deficiency for the year 1948 which is  sustained by the Tax Court of the United States in 1955. An adjustment  in favor of the taxpayer is authorized with respect to the year 1947. If  the taxpayer had returned the rent for both 1947 and 1948 and by a  determination was denied a refund claim for 1948 on account of the rent  item, a similar adjustment is authorized.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. A husband assigned to his wife salary to be earned by him  in the year 1952. The wife included such salary in her separate return  for that year and the husband omitted it. The Commissioner asserted a  deficiency against the wife for 1952 with respect to a different item;  she contested that deficiency, and the Tax Court entered an order in her  case which became final in 1955. The wife would therefore be barred by  section 6512(a) from claiming a refund for 1952. Thereafter, the  Commissioner asserted a deficiency against the husband on account of the  omission of such salary from his return for 1952. In 1955 the husband  and the Commissioner enter into a closing agreement for the year 1952 in  which the salary is taxed to the husband. An adjustment is authorized  with respect to the wife's tax for 1952.  [T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12033, Nov. 26, 1960]</p>
