On December 31, 2012, A's basis in the stock of FC for chapter 1  purposes is $500,000, which includes an increase to basis under section  961(a) of $40,000. The amount of FC's earnings and profits that are  described in section 959(c)(2) is $40,000, the amount of FC's earnings  and profits that are described in section 959(c)(3) is $20,000, and FC  does not have any earnings and profits that are described in section  959(c)(1). No election is made under paragraph (g) of this section.  During 2013, A does not include any amounts in income under section  951(a) with respect to FC, A does not receive any distributions from FC,  and there is no change in the amount of FC's earnings and profits. In  2014, A includes $10,000 in gross income for chapter 1 purposes under  section 951(a)(1)(A) with respect to FC. As a result, A's basis in the  stock of FC for chapter 1 purposes increases by $10,000 to $510,000  pursuant to section 961(a). During 2015, FC distributes $30,000 to A,  which is not treated as a dividend for purposes of chapter 1 under  section 959(d). As a result, A's basis in the stock of FC for chapter 1  purposes is decreased by $30,000 to $480,000 pursuant to section 961(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Results for section 1411 purposes. In 2014, A does not include  the $10,000 section 951(a) income inclusion in A's net investment income  under section 1411(c)(1)(A)(i) and Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1)(i). Pursuant to  paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, A decreases A's modified adjusted  gross income for section 1411 purposes by $10,000 in 2014, and pursuant  to paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, A's adjusted basis is not  increased by $10,000 and remains at $500,000. In 2015, pursuant to  paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, A includes $10,000 of the  distribution of previously taxed earnings and profits as a dividend for  purposes of determining A's net investment income because $10,000 of the  $30,000 distribution is attributable to amounts that A included in gross  income for chapter 1 purposes under section 951(a) in a tax year that  began after December 31, 2012. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this  section, A increases A's modified adjusted gross income for section 1411  purposes by $10,000 in 2015. Under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section,  A's adjusted basis is not decreased by the $10,000 that is treated as a  dividend for section 1411 purposes, and thus, A's adjusted basis in FC  for section 1411 purposes is decreased under section 961 only by $20,000  to $480,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 1. In addition, during  2016, A includes $15,000 in gross income for chapter 1 purposes under  section 951(a)(1)(A) with respect to FC. As a result, A's basis in the  stock of FC for chapter 1 purposes increases by $15,000 to $495,000  pursuant to section 961(a). During 2017, A sells all of A's shares of FC  for $550,000 and, prior to the application of section 1248, recognizes  $55,000 ($550,000 minus $495,000) of long-term capital gain for chapter  1 purposes. For purposes of calculating the amount included in income as  a dividend pursuant to section 1248(a) for chapter 1 purposes, the  earnings and profits of FC attributable to A's shares in FC which were  accumulated after December 31,1962 and during the period which A held  the stock while FC was a controlled foreign corporation is $55,000,  $35,000 of which is excluded pursuant to section 1248(d)(1). Therefore,  after the application of section 1248, for chapter 1 purposes, upon the  sale of the FC stock, A recognizes $35,000 of long-term capital gain and  a $20,000 dividend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Results for section 1411 purposes. (A) In 2016, A does not  include the $15,000 section 951(a)(1)(A) income inclusion in A's net  investment income under section 1411(c)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)(i)</em> and Sec. 1.1411- 1(a)(1)(i). Pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, A  decreases A's modified adjusted gross income for section 1411 purposes  by $15,000, and, pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, A's  adjusted basis remains at $480,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> During 2017, prior to the application of section 1248, A  recognizes $70,000 ($550,000 minus $480,000) of gain for section 1411  purposes. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, for section 1411  purposes, section 1248(a) applies to the gain on the sale of FC  calculated for section 1411 purposes ($70,000) and section 1248(d)(1)  does not apply, except with respect to the $20,000 of earnings and  profits of FC that are attributable to amounts previously included in  income for chapter 1 purposes under section 951 for a taxable year  beginning before December 31, 2012. Accordingly, for purposes of  calculating the amount of income includible as a dividend under section  1248(a), A has $55,000 of earnings and profits, $20,000 of which is  excluded pursuant to section 1248(d)(1). Therefore, after the  application of section 1248, for section 1411 purposes A has $35,000 of  long-term capital gain and a $35,000 dividend. For purposes of  calculating net investment income in 2017, A includes $35,000 as a  dividend under section 1411(c)(1)(A)(i) and Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1)(i) and  $35,000 as a gain under section 1411(c)(1)(A)(iii) and Sec. 1.1411- 4(a)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section for 2014  (and thus for all subsequent years).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Results for section 1411 purposes. A does not have any  adjustments to A's modified   adjusted gross income for section 1411 purposes for 2014, 2015, 2016 or  2017 because the election under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section was  timely made. Pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section, for purposes  of calculating A's net investment income in 2014, the $10,000 that A  included in income for chapter 1 purposes under section 951(a) is net  investment income for purposes of section 1411(c)(1)(A)(i) and  Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1)(i). A has no amount of net investment income with  respect to FC in 2015. Pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section, for  purposes of calculating A's net investment income in 2016, the $15,000  that A included in income for chapter 1 purposes under section 951(a) is  net investment income for purposes of section 1411(c)(1)(A)(i) and  Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1)(i). For purposes of calculating A's net investment  income in 2017, the amount of gain on the disposition of the FC shares  is the same as the amount calculated for chapter 1 purposes. Applying  section 1248, A includes $35,000 as a gain under section  1411(c)(1)(A)(iii) and Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1)(iii), and $20,000 as a  dividend under section 1411(c)(1)(A)(i) and Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> C,  a United States citizen, owns a 50% interest in PRS, a domestic  partnership. D, a United States citizen, and E, a United States citizen,  each own a 25% interest in PRS. All allocations of partnership income  and losses are pro rata based on ownership interests. PRS owns an  interest in QEF, a foreign corporation that is a passive foreign  investment company (within the meaning of section 1297(a)). PRS, a  United States person, made an election under section 1295 with respect  to QEF applicable to the first year of its holding period in QEF. As of  December 31, 2012, for chapter 1 purposes, C's basis in his partnership  interest is $100,000, D's basis in his partnership interest is $50,000,  E's basis in his partnership interest is $50,000, and PRS's adjusted  basis in its QEF stock is $80,000, which includes an increase in basis  under section 1293(d) of $40,000. As of December 31, 2012, the amount of  QEF's earnings that have been included in income by PRS under section  1293(a), but have not been distributed by QEF, is $40,000. PRS also has  cash of $60,000 and domestic C corporation stock with an adjusted basis  of $60,000. During 2013, PRS does not include any amounts in income  under section 1293(a) with respect to QEF, PRS does not receive any  distributions from QEF, and there are no adjustments to the basis of C,  D, or E in their interests in PRS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> During 2014, PRS has income of $40,000 under section 1293(a)  with respect to QEF and has no other partnership income.

Under Sec. 1.1293-1(c)(1) and section 702, C's, D's, and E's  distributive shares of the section 1293(a) income inclusion are $20,000,  $10,000, and $10,000, respectively.

Because PRS did not make an election  under paragraph (g) of this section, C, D and E do not have net  investment income with respect to the income inclusion, and pursuant to  paragraph (d)(2) of this section, they do not increase their adjusted  bases in their interests in PRS (each remains at $50,000). Pursuant to  paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, C reduces his modified adjusted  gross income by $20,000, and D and E each reduce their modified adjusted  gross income by $10,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Results for 2015. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For chapter 1 purposes, the distribution  of $60,000 from QEF to PRS is not a dividend under section 1293(c), and  PRS decreases its basis in QEF by $60,000 under section 1293(d)(2) to  $60,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, $40,000 of the  distribution is a dividend for section 1411 purposes because PRS  included $40,000 in gross income for chapter 1 purposes under section  1293(a) in a tax year that began after December 31, 2012. For section  1411 purposes, pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, section  1293(d) will not apply to reduce PRS's basis in QEF to the extent of the  $40,000 of the distribution that is treated as a dividend under  paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. Thus, PRS's basis in QEF is  decreased only by $20,000 for purposes of section 1411 and is $60,000.  The $40,000 distribution of previously taxed earnings and profits that  is treated as a dividend for section 1411 purposes is allocated $20,000  to C, $10,000 to D, and $10,000 to E.
