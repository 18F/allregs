                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The FOIA and this rule apply to all OGE records. However, if another law sets forth procedures for the disclosure of specific types of records, such as section 105 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 5 U.S.C. appendix, OGE will process a request for those records in accordance with the procedures that apply to those specific records. See 5 CFR 2634.603 and subpart G of this part. If there is any record which is not required to be released under those provisions, OGE will consider the request under the FOIA and this rule, provided that the special Ethics Act access procedures cited must be complied with as to any record within the scope thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The relationship between the FOIA and the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, applies to records that are about individuals, but only if the records are in a system of records as defined in the Privacy Act. Requests from individuals for records about themselves which are contained in an OGE system of records will be processed under the provisions of the Privacy Act as well as the FOIA. OGE will not deny access by a first party to a record under the FOIA or the Privacy Act unless the record is not available to that individual under both the Privacy Act and the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Records available through routine distribution procedures. When the record requested includes material published and offered for sale (e.g., by the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office) or which is available to the public through an established distribution system (such as that of the National Technical Information Service of the Department of Commerce), OGE will explain how the record may be obtained through those channels. If the requester, after having been advised of such alternative access, asks for regular FOIA processing instead, OGE will provide the record in accordance with its usual FOIA procedures under this part.</p>
