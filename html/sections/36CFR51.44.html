                            <p class="depth0">To be a satisfactory concessioner for the purposes of a right of  preference, the Director must determine that the concessioner operated  satisfactorily on an overall basis during the term of its applicable  concession contract, including extensions of the contract. The Director  will base this determination in consideration of annual evaluations made  by the Director of the concessioner's performance under the terms of the  applicable concession contract and other relevant facts and  circumstances. The Director must determine that a concessioner did not  operate satisfactorily on an overall basis during the term of a  concession contract if the annual evaluations of the concessioner made  subsequent to May 17, 2000 are less than satisfactory for any two or  more years of operation under the concession contract.</p>
