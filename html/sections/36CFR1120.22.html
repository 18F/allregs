No individual determination under Sec. 1120.32 is necessary in these cases, since preparation of the materials for routine public distribution itself constitutes that a determination that the records are available to the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This subpart applies only to records that exist at the time the request for information is made. (See Sec. 1120.3, Existing records.)</p>
