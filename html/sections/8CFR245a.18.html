                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ineligible aliens. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An alien who has been convicted of a  felony or of three or misdemeanors committed in   the United States is ineligible for adjustment to LPR status under this  Subpart B; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An alien who has assisted in the persecution of any person or  persons on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a  particular social group, or political opinion is ineligible for  adjustment of status under this Subpart B.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grounds of inadmissibility not to be applied. Section 212(a)(5)  of the Act (labor certification requirements) and section 212(a)(7)(A)  of the Act (immigrants not in possession of valid visa and/or travel  documents) shall not apply to applicants for adjustment to LPR status  under this Subpart B.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> of this section without regard to section 241(a)(5) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Special rule for waiver of inadmissibility grounds for LIFE  Legalization applicants under sections 212(a)(9)(A) and 212(a)(9)(C) of  the Act. An applicant for adjustment of status under LIFE Legalization  who is inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(A) or 212(a)(9)(C) of the  Act, may apply for a waiver of these grounds of inadmissibility while  present in the United States, without regard to the normal requirement  that a Form I-212, Application for Permission to Reapply for Admission  into the United States After Deportation or Removal, be filed prior to  embarking or re-embarking for travel to the United States, and without  regard to the length of time since the alien's removal or deportation  from the United States. Such an alien shall file Form I-690, Application  for Waiver of Grounds of Excludability Under Sections 245A or 210 of the  Immigration and Nationality Act, with the district director having  jurisdiction over the applicant's case if the application for adjustment  of status is pending at a local office, or with the Director of the  Missouri Service Center. Approval of a waiver of inadmissibility under  section 212(a)(9)(A) or section 212(a)(9)(C) of the Act does not cure a  break in continuous residence resulting from a departure from the United  States at any time during the period from January 1, 1982, and May 4,  1988, if the alien was subject to a final exclusion or deportation order  at the time of the departure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Grounds of inadmissibility that may not be waived.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Act, the following  provisions of section 212(a) of the Act may not be waived by the  Attorney General under paragraph (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(I)</em> (crimes involving moral turpitude);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) (controlled substance, except for  so much of such paragraph as relates to a single offense of simple  possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Section 212(a)(2)(B) (multiple criminal convictions);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Section 212(a)(2)(C) (controlled substance traffickers);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Section 212(a)(3) (security and related grounds); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Section 212(a)(4) (public charge) except for an alien who is or  was an aged, blind, or disabled individual (as defined in section  1614(a)(1) of the Social Security Act). If a LIFE Legalization applicant  is determined to be inadmissible under section 212(a)(4) of the Act, he  or she may still be admissible under the Special Rule described under  paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In determining whether an alien is ``likely to become a  public charge'', financial responsibility of the alien is to be  established by examining the totality of the alien's circumstance at the  time of his or her application for adjustment. The existence or absence  of a particular factor should never be the sole criteria for determining  if an alien is likely to become a public charge. The determination of  financial responsibility should be a prospective evaluation based on the  alien's age, health, family status, assets, resources, education and  skills.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(vi)</em> of this  section. The alien's employment history need not be continuous in that  it is uninterrupted. In applying the Special Rule, the Service will take  into account an alien's employment history in the United States to  include, but not be limited to, employment prior to and immediately  following the enactment of IRCA on November 6, 1986. However, the  Service will take into account that an alien may not have consistent  employment history due to the fact that an eligible alien was in an  unlawful status and was not authorized to work. Past acceptance of  public cash assistance within a history of consistent employment will  enter into this decision. The weight given in considering applicability  of the public charge provisions will depend on many factors, but the  length of time an applicant has received public cash assistance will  constitute a significant factor. It is not necessary to file a waiver in  order to apply the Special Rule for determination of public charge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In order to establish that an alien is not inadmissible under  paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section, an alien may file as much evidence  available to him or her establishing that the alien is not likely to  become a public charge. An alien may have filed on his or her behalf a  Form I-134, Affidavit of Support. The failure to submit Form I-134 shall  not constitute an adverse factor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Public cash assistance and criminal history verification.  Declarations by an alien that he or she has not been the recipient of  public cash assistance and/or has not had a criminal record are subject  to a verification by the Service. The alien must agree to fully  cooperate in the verification process. Failure to assist the Service in  verifying information necessary for proper adjudication may result in  denial of the application.
