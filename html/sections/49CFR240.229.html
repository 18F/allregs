As used in this section qualified person means either a  designated supervisor of locomotive engineers or a certified train  service engineer determined by the controlling railroad to have the  necessary knowledge concerning the controlling railroad's operating  rules and to have the necessary operating skills including familiarity  with its physical characteristics concerning the joint operations  territory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A railroad that is responsible for controlling the conduct of  joint operations with another railroad may permit a certified locomotive  engineer to operate a locomotive in any class of train or engine service  without determining that the person has been certified as a qualified  locomotive engineer for the purposes of joint operations when a minimal  joint operation is involved. For the purposes of this section a minimal  joint operation exists when a locomotive or train belonging to one  railroad is being operated on the same track on which operations are  conducted by the railroad controlling operations, under the following  conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The maximum authorized speed for operations on the track does  not exceed 20 miles per hour;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The track is other than a main track;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Operations are conducted under operating rules that require  every locomotive and train to proceed at a speed that permits stopping  within one half the range of vision of the locomotive engineer; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The maximum distance for joint operations on the track does not  exceed one mile.
