                                Sec. 1.527-3  Exempt function income.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of section 527, exempt function  income consists solely of amounts received as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Contributions of money or other property,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Membership dues, fees, or assessments from a member of a  political organization, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Proceeds from a political fund raising or entertainment event,  or proceeds from the sale of political campaign materials, which are not  received in the ordinary course of any trade or business,  but only to the extent such income is segregated for use only for exempt  functions of the political organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Income will be considered segregated for use only for an exempt  function only if it is received into and disbursed from a segregated  fund as defined in Sec. 1.527-2(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em> apply in  determining whether the transfer of money or other property constitutes  a contribution. Generally, money or other property, whether solicited  personally, by mail, or through advertising, qualifies as a  contribution. In addition, to the extent a political organization  receives Federal, State, or local funds under the $1 checkoff provision  (sections 9001-9013), or any other provision for financing of campaigns,  such amounts are to be treated as contributions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Dues, fees, and assessments. Amounts received as membership fees  and assessments from members of a political organization may constitute  exempt function income to the political organization. Membership fees  and assessments received in consideration for services, goods, or other  items of value do not constitute exempt function income. However, filing  fees paid by an individual directly or indirectly to a political party  in order that the individual may run as a candidate in a primary  election of the party (or run in a general election as a candidate of  that party) are to be treated as exempt   function income. For example, some States provide that a certain  percentage of the first year's salary of the office sought must be paid  to the State as a filing (or qualifying) fee and party assessment. The  State then transfers part of this fee to the candidate's party. In such  a case, the entire amount transferred to the party is to be treated as  exempt function income. Furthermore, amounts paid by an individual  directly to the party as a qualification fee are treated similarly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fund raising events--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Amounts received from fund  raising and entertainment events are eligible for treatment as exempt  function income if the events are political in nature and are not  carried on in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Whether an  event is political in nature depends on all facts and circumstances. One  factor that indicates an event is a political event is the extent to  which the event is related to a political activity aside from the need  of the organization for income or funds. For example, an event that is  intended to rally and encourage support for an individual for public  office would be a political fund raising event. Examples of political  events can include dinners, breakfasts, receptions, picnics, dances, and  athletic exhibitions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ordinary course of any trade or business. Whether an activity is  in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends on the facts and  circumstances of each case. Generally, proceeds from casual, sporadic  fund raising or entertainment events are not in the ordinary course of a  trade or business. Factors to be taken into account in determining  whether an activity is a trade or business include the frequency of the  activity, the manner in which the activity is conducted, and the span of  time over which the activity is carried on.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Sale of campaign materials. Amounts received from the sale of  campaign materials are eligible for treatment as exempt function income  if the sale is not carried on in the ordinary course of a trade or  business (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section), and is  related to a political activity of the organization aside from the need  of such organization for income or funds. Proceeds from the sale of  political memorabilia, bumper stickers, campaign buttons, hats, shirts,  political posters, stationery, jewelry, or cookbooks are related to such  a political acitivity where such items can be identified as relating to  distributing political literature or organizing voters to vote for a  candidate for public office.
