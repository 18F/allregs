                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Price. The sale price of the chapel structure in the case of sale for use as a shrine, or memorial, or denominational house of worship, will be at its fair value in the light of the conditions imposed relating to its future use, and the estimated cost of removal from the site. Appraisals made to establish the price of specific chapels will be predicated on:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fair value of the material in place, less the cost of dismantling, removal of the material to the outside limits of the installation, and the cost of restoring the site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The restrictions imposed on the future use of the chapel with due regard to the difference between the fair value price obtainable in the open market and that which might be obtainable in the limited market to which sale is restricted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In addition to the criteria set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section cognizance will be taken of the prevailing prices of chapels being sold by other disposal agencies within the general area in which chapels are being disposed of by the Corps of Engineers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Provisions of sale. (1) Disposal of chapels which are not excess or surplus will be conditioned on the removal of the chapels from the premises. In the disposal of chapels located on excess or surplus leased land, no commitments will be made to purchasers for the continued use of utilities and services (sewer, water, electric, fire protection, guarding). Arrangements may be made between the lessor of the premises and the purchaser to leave the chapels in place, provided the lessor releases the Government from any and all obligations to restore the premises occupied by the chapel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disposal of chapels which are not excess or surplus will be conditioned on the removal of the chapels from the premises. In the disposal of chapels located on excess or surplus leased land, no commitments will be made to purchasers for the continued use of utilities and services (sewer, water, electric, fire protection, guarding). Arrangements may be made between the lessor of the premises and the purchaser to leave the chapels in place, provided the lessor releases the Government from any and all obligations to restore the premises occupied by the chapel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Care will be exercised that, prior to the disposal of the chapel, equipment such as organs, hymn books, and other ecclesiastical furnishings have been removed or shipped in accordance with applicable regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All copies of the contract evidencing the sale of chapels will be accompanied by copies of the instructions, if any, received from the Chief of Chaplains authorizing the disposal. If no such instructions have been received, the DE will attach a statement that in the absence of instructions, all known interested parties have been contacted and that the disposal has been made after due consideration of applications, the uses to be made of the chapel building and the need therefor.</p>
