                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. For hull type rotorcraft, the structure must be  designed to withstand the water loading set forth in paragraphs (b),  (c), and (d) of this section considering the most severe wave heights  and profiles for which approval is desired. The loads for the landing  conditions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section must be developed  and distributed along and among the hull and auxiliary floats, if used,  in a rational and conservative manner, assuming a rotor lift not  exceeding two-thirds of the rotorcraft weight to act throughout the  landing impact.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Vertical landing conditions. The rotorcraft must initially  contact the most critical wave surface at zero forward speed in likely  pitch and roll attitudes which result in critical design   loadings. The vertical descent velocity may not be less than 6.5 feet  per second relative to the mean water surface.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Forward speed landing conditions. The rotorcraft must contact  the most critical wave at forward velocities from zero up to 30 knots in  likely pitch, roll, and yaw attitudes and with a vertical descent  velocity of not less than 6.5 feet per second relative to the mean water  surface. A maximum forward velocity of less than 30 knots may be used in  design if it can be demonstrated that the forward velocity selected  would not be exceeded in a normal one-engine-out landing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Auxiliary float immersion condition. In addition to the loads  from the landing conditions, the auxiliary float, and its support and  attaching structure in the hull, must be designed for the load developed  by a fully immersed float unless it can be shown that full immersion of  the float is unlikely, in which case the highest likely float buoyancy  load must be applied that considers loading of the float immersed to  create restoring moments compensating for upsetting moments caused by  side wind, asymmetrical rotorcraft loading, water wave action, and  rotorcraft inertia.
