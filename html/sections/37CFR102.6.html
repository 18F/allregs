                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The FOIA Officer ordinarily shall respond to  requests according to their order of receipt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial response and appeal. Subject to paragraph (c)(1) of this  section, an initial response shall be made within 20 working days (i.e.,  excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) of the receipt  of a request for a record under this part by the proper FOIA Officer  identified in accordance with Sec.  102.5(a), and an appeal shall be  decided within 20 working days of its receipt by the Office of the  General Counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unusual circumstances. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In unusual circumstances as specified  in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the FOIA Officer may extend the  time limits in paragraph (b) of this section by notifying the requester  in writing as soon as practicable of the unusual circumstances and of  the date by which processing of the request is expected to be completed.  Extensions of time for the initial determination and extensions on  appeal may not exceed a total of ten working days, unless the requester  agrees to a longer extension, or the FOIA Officer provides the requester  with an opportunity either to limit the scope of the request so that it  may be processed within the applicable time limit, or to arrange an  alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As used in this section, unusual circumstances means, but only  to the extent reasonably necessary to properly process the particular  request:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The need to search for and collect the requested records from  field facilities or other establishments separate from the office  processing the request;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a  voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are the subject  of a single request; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all  practicable speed, with another Federal agency having a substantial  interest in the determination of the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unusual circumstances do not include a delay that results from a  predictable workload of requests, unless USPTO demonstrates reasonable  progress in reducing its backlog of pending requests. Refusal to  reasonably modify the scope of a request or arrange an alternate time  frame may affect a requester's ability to obtain judicial review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the FOIA Officer reasonably believes that multiple requests  submitted by a requester, or by a group of requesters acting in concert,  constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual  circumstances, and the requests involve clearly related matters, the  FOIA Officer may aggregate them. Multiple requests involving unrelated  matters will not be aggregated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Multitrack processing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The FOIA Officer may use two or more  processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex  requests based on the number of pages involved, or some other measure of  the amount of work and/or time needed to process the request, and  whether the request qualifies for expedited processing as described in  paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The FOIA Officer may provide requesters in a slower track with  an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to qualify  for faster processing. The FOIA Officer may contact the requester by  telephone or by letter, whichever is most efficient in each case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Expedited processing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests and appeals shall be taken  out of order and given expedited treatment whenever it is determined  they involve:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could  reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or  physical safety of an individual;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The loss of substantial due process rights;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which  there exist questions about the Government's integrity that affect  public confidence; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged  Federal Government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in  disseminating information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of  the initial request for records or at any later time. For a prompt  determination, a request for expedited processing should be sent to the  FOIA Officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a  statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's  knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting  expedited processing. For example, a requester within the category  described in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section, if not a full-time  member of the news media, must establish that he or she is a person  whose main professional activity or occupation is information  dissemination, though it need not be his or her sole occupation.   A requester within the category described in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of  this section must also establish a particular urgency to inform the  public about the Government activity involved in the request, beyond the  public's right to know about Government activity generally. The  formality of certification may be waived as a matter of administrative  discretion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within ten calendar days of receipt of a request for expedited  processing, the FOIA Officer will decide whether to grant it and shall  notify the requester of the decision. If a request for expedited  treatment is granted, the request shall be given priority and processed  as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied,  any appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously.</p>
