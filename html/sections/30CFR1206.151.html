For purposes of this subpart:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Ownership or common ownership of more than 50 percent of the voting securities, or instruments of ownership, or other forms of ownership, of another person constitutes control. Ownership of less than 10 percent constitutes a presumption of noncontrol that ONRR may rebut.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> If there is ownership or common ownership of 10 through 50 percent of the voting securities or instruments of ownership, or other forms of ownership, of another person, ONRR will consider the following factors in determining whether there is control under the circumstances of a particular case:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The extent to which there are common officers or directors;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to the voting securities, or instruments of ownership, or other forms of ownership: The percentage of ownership or common ownership, the relative percentage of ownership or common ownership compared to the percentage(s) of ownership by other persons, whether a person is the greatest single owner, or whether there is an opposing voting bloc of greater ownership;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> Operation of a lease, plant, pipeline, or other facility;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> The extent of participation by other owners in operations and day-to-day management of a lease, plant, pipeline, or other facility; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(v)</em> Other evidence of power to exercise control over or common control with another person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Regardless of any percentage of ownership or common ownership, relatives, either by blood or marriage, are affiliates.</p><p class="depth2">Allowance means a deduction in determining value for royalty purposes. Processing allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, actual costs of processing gas determined under this subpart. Transportation allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, actual costs of moving unprocessed gas, residue gas, or gas plant products to a point of sale or delivery off the lease, unit area, or communitized area, or away from a processing plant. The transportation allowance does not include gathering costs.</p><p class="depth2">Area means a geographic region at least as large as the defined limits of an oil and/or gas field, in which oil and/or gas lease products have similar quality, economic, and legal characteristics.</p><p class="depth2">Arm's-length contract means a contract or agreement between independent persons who are not affiliates and who have opposing economic interests regarding that contract. To be considered arm's length for any production month, a contract must satisfy this definition for that month, as well as when the contract was executed.</p><p class="depth2">Audit means a review, conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting and auditing standards, of royalty payment compliance activities of lessees or other interest holders who pay royalties, rents, or bonuses on Federal leases.</p><p class="depth2">BLM means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the Interior.</p><p class="depth2">BOEM means the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management of the Department of the Interior.</p><p class="depth2">BSEE means the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement of the Department of the Interior.</p><p class="depth2">Compression means the process of raising the pressure of gas.</p><p class="depth2">Condensate means liquid hydrocarbons (normally exceeding 40 degrees of API gravity) recovered at the surface without resorting to processing. Condensate is the mixture of liquid hydrocarbons that results from condensation of petroleum hydrocarbons existing initially in a gaseous phase in an underground reservoir.</p><p class="depth2">Contract means any oral or written agreement, including amendments or revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by law that with due consideration creates an obligation.</p><p class="depth2">Field means a geographic region situated over one or more subsurface oil and gas reservoirs encompassing at least the outermost boundaries of all oil and gas accumulations known to be within those reservoirs vertically projected to the land surface. Onshore fields are usually given names and their official boundaries are often designated by oil and gas regulatory agencies in the respective States in which the fields are located. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) fields are named and their boundaries are designated by BOEM.</p><p class="depth2">Gas means any fluid, either combustible or noncombustible, hydrocarbon or nonhydrocarbon, which is extracted from a reservoir and which has neither independent shape nor volume, but tends to expand indefinitely. It is a substance that exists in a gaseous or rarefied state under standard temperature and pressure conditions.</p><p class="depth2">Gas plant products means separate marketable elements, compounds, or mixtures, whether in liquid, gaseous, or solid form, resulting from processing gas, excluding residue gas.</p><p class="depth2">Gathering means the movement of lease production to a central accumulation and/or treatment point on the lease, unit or communitized area, or to a central accumulation or treatment point off the lease, unit or communitized area as approved by BLM or BSEE OCS operations personnel for onshore and OCS leases, respectively.</p><p class="depth2">Gross proceeds (for royalty payment purposes) means the total monies and other consideration accruing to an oil and gas lessee for the disposition of the gas, residue gas, and gas plant products

Field processes which normally take place on or

near the lease, such as natural pressure reduction, mechanical separation, heating, cooling, dehydration, and compression, are not considered processing. The changing of pressures and/or temperatures in a reservoir is not considered processing.</p><p class="depth2">Residue gas means that hydrocarbon gas consisting principally of methane resulting from processing gas.</p><p class="depth2">Sales type code means the contract type or general disposition (e.g., arm's-length or non-arm's-length) of production from the lease.
