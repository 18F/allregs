For the purpose of this subpart, the conveyance   of material using a container (as defined for this subpart) or a self- propelled vehicle (e.g., a front-end loader) is not a transfer system.  Examples of a transfer system include but are not limited to a pipeline,  an individual drain system, a gravity-operated conveyor (such as a  chute), and a mechanically-powered conveyor (such as a belt or screw  conveyor).</p><p class="depth0">Treatment process means a process in which remediation material is  physically, chemically, thermally, or biologically treated to destroy,  degrade, or remove hazardous air pollutants contained in the material. A  treatment process can be composed of a single unit (e.g., a steam  stripper) or a series of units (e.g., a wastewater treatment system). A  treatment process can be used to treat one or more remediation material  streams at the same time.</p><p class="depth0">Volatile organic hazardous air pollutant (VOHAP) concentration means  the fraction by weight of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart that  are contained in the remediation material as measured using Method 305,  40 CFR part 63, appendix A and expressed in terms of parts per million  (ppm). As an alternative to using Method 305, 40 CFR part 63, appendix  A, you may determine the HAP concentration of the remediation material  using any one of the other test methods specified in Sec.  63.694(b)(2)(ii). When a test method specified in Sec. 63.694(b)(2)(ii)  other than Method 305 in 40 CFR part 63, appendix A is used to determine  the speciated HAP concentration of the contaminated material, the  individual compound concentration may be adjusted by the corresponding  fm305 listed in Table 1 of this subpart to determine a VOHAP  concentration.</p><p class="depth0">Work practice standard means any design, equipment, work practice,  or operational standard, or combination thereof, that is promulgated  pursuant to section 112(h) of the CAA.
