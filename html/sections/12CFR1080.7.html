Such hearings shall be  under oath or affirmation and stenographically reported, and a  transcript thereof shall be made a part of the record of the  investigation. The Bureau investigator conducting the investigational  hearing also may direct that the testimony be recorded by audio,  audiovisual, or other means, in which case the recording shall be made a  part of the record of the investigation as well.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In investigational hearings, the Bureau investigators shall  exclude from the hearing room all persons except the person being  examined, his or her counsel, the officer before whom   the testimony is to be taken, any investigator or representative of an  agency with which the Bureau is engaged in a joint investigation, and  any individual transcribing or recording such testimony. At the  discretion of the Bureau investigator, and with the consent of the  person being examined, persons other than those listed in this paragraph  may be present in the hearing room. The Bureau investigator shall  certify or direct the individual transcribing the testimony to certify  on the transcript that the witness was duly sworn and that the  transcript is a true record of the testimony given by the witness. A  copy of the transcript shall be forwarded promptly by the Bureau  investigator to the custodian designated in section 1080.13.</p>
