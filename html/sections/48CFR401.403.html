Except for cost principles, HCA's may  approve individual deviations from the AGAR, after coordinating with the  General Counsel and the SPE. No deviations from the FAR or AGAR may be  authorized at the contracting office level. A copy of each deviation and  its supporting documentation shall be provided to the SPE. Deviations  from the FAR shall not be made unless such action is authorized by the  SPE after consultation with the Office of the General Counsel and any  other appropriate office, on the basis of a written justification  stating clearly the special circumstances involved.</p>
