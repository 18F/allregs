To obtain such approval, State  homes will complete a Department of Veterans Affairs application form  for each veteran for the type of care to be provided and submit it to  the Department of Veterans Affairs office of jurisdiction for  determination of eligibility. Payments shall be made only from the date  the Department of Veterans Affairs office of jurisdiction receives such  application; however, if such request is received by the Department of  Veterans Affairs office of jurisdiction within 10 days after the  beginning of the care of such veteran for which he or she is determined  to be eligible, payment shall be made on account of such veteran from  the date care began.
