                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Wastes which are otherwise prohibited from land disposal under  this part may be treated in a surface impoundment or series of  impoundments provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Treatment of such wastes occurs in the impoundments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sampling and testing. For wastes with treatment standards in  subpart D of this part and/or prohibition levels in subpart C of this  part or RCRA section 3004(d), the residues from treatment are analyzed,  as specified in Sec.  268.7 or Sec.  268.32, to determine if they meet  the applicable treatment standards or where no treatment standards have  been established for the waste, the applicable prohibition levels. The  sampling method, specified in the waste analysis plan under Sec.  264.13  or Sec.  265.13, must be designed such that representative samples of  the sludge and the supernatant are tested separately rather than mixed  to form homogeneous samples.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Removal. The following treatment residues (including any liquid  waste) must be removed at least annually; residues which do not meet the  treatment standards promulgated under subpart D of this part; residues  which do not meet the prohibition levels established under subpart C of  this part or imposed by statute (where no treatment standards have been  established); residues which are from the treatment of wastes prohibited  from land disposal under subpart C of this part (where no treatment  standards have been established and no prohibition levels apply); or  residues from managing listed wastes which are not delisted under Sec.   260.22 of this chapter. If the volume of liquid flowing through the  impoundment or series of impoundments annually is greater than the  volume of the impoundment or impoundments, this flow-through constitutes  removal of the supernatant for the purpose of this requirement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Subsequent management. Treatment residues may not be placed in  any other surface impoundment for subsequent management.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Recordkeeping. Sampling and testing and recordkeeping  provisions of Sec. Sec.  264.13 and 265.13 of this chapter apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The impoundment meets the design requirements of Sec.   264.221(c) or Sec.  265.221(a) of this chapter, regardless that the unit  may not be new, expanded, or a replacement, and be in compliance with  applicable ground water monitoring requirements of subpart F of part 264  or part 265 of this chapter unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Exempted pursuant to Sec.  264.221 (d) or (e) of this chapter,  or to Sec.  265.221 (c) or (d) of this chapter; or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Upon application by the owner or operator, the Administrator,  after notice and an opportunity to comment, has granted a waiver of the  requirements on the basis that the surface impoundment:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Has at least one liner, for which there is no evidence that such  liner is leaking;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Is located more than one-quarter mile from an underground source  of drinking water; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Is in compliance with generally applicable ground water  monitoring requirements for facilities with permits; or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Upon application by the owner or operator, the Administrator,  after notice and an opportunity to comment, has granted a modification  to the requirements on the basis of a demonstration that the surface  impoundment is located, designed, and operated so as to assure that  there will be no migration of any hazardous constituent into ground  water or surface water at any future time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The owner or operator submits to the Regional Administrator a  written certification that the requirements of Sec.  268.4(a)(3) have  been met. The following certification is required:</p><p class="depth3">I certify under penalty of law that the requirements of 40 CFR  268.4(a)(3) have been met for all surface impoundments being used to  treat restricted wastes. I believe that the submitted information is  true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant  penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of  fine and imprisonment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evaporation of hazardous constituents as the principal means of  treatment is not considered to be treatment for purposes of an exemption  under this section.
