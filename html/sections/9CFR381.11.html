                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any person who slaughters, processes, or otherwise handles poultry or poultry products which have been or are to be processed as required by recognized religious dietary laws may apply for exemption from specific provisions of the Act or regulations which are in conflict with such religious dietary laws. Any person desiring such an exemption shall apply in writing to the Meat and Poultry Inspection Program, Food Safety and Inspection Service,

Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, setting forth the specific provisions of the Act and the regulations from which exemption is sought and setting forth the provisions of the religious dietary laws in support of the requested exemption. In addition, the applicant for such an exemption shall submit a statement from the clerical official having jurisdiction over the enforcement of the religious dietary laws with respect to the poultry or poultry products involved, which identifies the requirements of such laws pertaining to the slaughter of the poultry and the processing or other handling of the poultry products involved, and certifies that such requirements are in conflict with specific provisions of the Act and regulations from which the exemption is sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Administrator, upon a determination that an exemption should be granted, will grant such exemption to the extent necessary to avoid conflict with the religious requirements while still effectuating the purposes of the Act. He may impose such conditions as to sanitary standards, practices, and procedures in granting such exemption as he deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of the Act. Any person who processes poultry or poultry products under exemption from certain requirements as provided in this section shall be subject to all of the other applicable provisions of the Act and the regulations. Processing plants shall meet the sanitary requirements set forth in this part and unless exempted from inspection under the provisions of this subpart, shall be required to qualify for inspection and operate as official establishments. Slaughtered poultry which is prepared under an exemption authorizing the sale of noneviscerated poultry in commerce shall be individually identified with a label approved by the Administrator which identifies the clerical official under whose supervision the poultry was slaughtered.</p>
