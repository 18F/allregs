                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This part describes the obligations of all federally-insured  credit unions to maintain a records preservation program to identify,  store and reconstruct vital records in the event that the credit union's  records are destroyed and provides recommendations for restoring vital  member services. All credit unions must have a written program that  includes plans for safeguarding records and reconstructing vital  records. To complement these plans, it is recommended a credit union  develop a method for restoring vital member services in the event of a  catastrophic act as defined in Sec. 748.1(b) of this chapter.  Additionally, the regulation establishes flexibility in the format  credit unions may use for maintaining writings, records or information  required by other NCUA regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Appendix A to this part provides guidance concerning the  appropriate length of time credit unions should retain various types of  operational records. Appendix B to this part also provides guidance for  developing a program for responding to a catastrophic act to ensure  duplicate vital records can be used for restoration of vital member  services.
