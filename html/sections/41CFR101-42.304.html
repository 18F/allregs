                            <p class="depth0">Special donation requirements for specific hazardous materials are provided in Sec. 101-42.1102. Many hazardous materials require special storage and handling. It is the responsibility of the Federal holding agency or State agency to properly store hazardous materials, ensure the use of appropriate safeguards, and provide instructions for personal protection to donation screeners who are inspecting surplus hazardous materials. It is the responsibility of the State agency and/or donee to comply with DOT regulations (49 CFR part 171 et seq.) when transporting hazardous materials. Any costs incident to repacking or recontainerization will be borne by the State agency and/or donee. State agencies and/or donees will comply with EPA's Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (40 CFR part 261 et seq.) including its application to transporters, storers, users, and permitting of hazardous wastes. Such requirements may be administered by various States instead of the EPA.
