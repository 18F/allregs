In addition, the  determination will set forth the nature, the duration, and which  contract or contracts are covered by the proposed agreement. All  determinations required by this subpart will be reviewed and approved at  a level above the contracting officer prior to negotiation of the  proposed agreement. The approved determination will be placed in the  contract file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All advance agreements shall be in writing and shall set forth  the nature, duration, and contract or contracts covered by the  agreements.
