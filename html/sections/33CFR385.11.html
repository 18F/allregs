                            <p class="depth0">Generally, the Corps of Engineers and non-Federal sponsors shall  develop and implement projects in accordance with the process that is  shown in figure 1 in Appendix A of this part. Typical steps in this  process involve:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Project Management Plan. The Project Management Plan describes  the activities, tasks, and responsibilities that will be used to produce  and deliver the products necessary to implement the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Project Implementation Report. The Project Implementation Report  provides information on plan formulation and evaluation, engineering and  design, estimated benefits and costs, and environmental effects to  bridge the gap between the conceptual design included in the Plan and  the detailed design necessary to proceed to construction. The Project  Implementation Reports will also set forth additional information and  analyses necessary for the Secretary of the Army or Congress to approve  the project for implementation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Plans and specifications. During this phase, final design of the  project is completed and plans and specifications are prepared. Plans  and specifications contain the information necessary to bid and  construct the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Real estate acquisition. The lands, easements, and rights-of  way, and relocations necessary for the project are acquired prior to  construction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Construction. This phase is the actual construction of a  project's components and includes an interim operation and monitoring  period to ensure that the project operates as designed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Operation. After construction of the project has been completed,  it is operated in accordance with the System Operating Manual and the  Project Operating Manual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Monitoring and assessment. After the project has been  constructed, monitoring is conducted as necessary to assess the  effectiveness of the project and to provide information that will be  used for the adaptive management program.</p>
