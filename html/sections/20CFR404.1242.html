                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Back pay defined. Back pay is pay received in one period of time  which would have been paid in a prior period of time except for a  wrongful or improper action taken by an employer. It includes pay made  under Federal or State laws intended to create an employment  relationship (including situations where there is unlawful refusal to  hire) or to protect an employee's right to wages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Back pay under a statute. Back pay under a statute is a payment  by an employer following an award, determination or agreement approved  or sanctioned by a court or administrative agency responsible for  enforcing a Federal or State statute protecting an employee's right to  employment or wages. Examples of these statutes are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> National Labor Relations Act or a State labor relations act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Federal or State laws providing reemployment rights to veterans;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> State minimum wage laws; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Payments based on legislation comparable to and having a similar effect  as those listed in this paragraph may also qualify as having been made  under a statute. Back pay under a statute, excluding penalties, is wages  if paid for covered employment. It is allocated to the periods of time  in which it should have been paid if the employer had not violated the  statute. For backpay awards affecting periods prior to 1987, a State  must fill a wage report and pay the contributions due for all periods  involved in the back pay award under the rules applicable to those  periods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Back pay not under a statute. Where the employer and the  employee agree on the amount payable without any award, determination or  agreement approved or sanctioned by a court or administrative agency,  the payment is not made under a statute. This back pay cannot be  allocated to prior periods of time but must be reported by the employer  for the period in which it is paid.
