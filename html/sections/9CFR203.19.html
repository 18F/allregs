                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In its administration of the Packers and Stockyards Act, the  Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (Packers and  Stockyards Programs) has sought to prevent conflicts of interest and to  maintain open and fair competition in the livestock and meat packing  industries. The ownership or operation of livestock dealers or buying  agencies by packers, under some circumstances, may result in violations  of the Packers and Stockyards Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Traditionally, livestock dealers and buying agencies purchase  livestock for resale or to fill orders for farmers, ranchers, producers,  other livestock firms and packers. When a livestock dealer or buying  agency is owned or operated by a packer, and when such packer is also  buying livestock for its own operational requirements, there is a  potential conflict of interest. Furthermore, the purchase and sale of  livestock by meat packers may result in control of markets and prices  which could adversely affect both livestock producers, competing  packers, and consumers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Arrangements between packers and dealers or buying agencies  which do not normally create a conflict of interest or result in a  restraint of competition include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Operations utilizing different species or classes of livestock;  (2) operations where the business activities are widely separated  geographically; and (3) operations where tie-in purchases or sales are  not involved. Packers contemplating engaging in the business of a  livestock dealer or a buying agency are encouraged to consult with the  Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (Packers and  Stockyards Programs) prior to the commencement of such activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the event a packer/dealer or a packer/buying agency  arrangement appears to give rise to a violation of the Act, an  investigation will be made on a   case-by-case basis and, where warranted, appropriate action will be  taken.  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  0580-0015)  (7 U.S.C. 228, 228b, 222, 15 U.S.C. 46)  [49 FR 32845, Aug. 17, 1984; 54 FR 26349, June 23, 1989, as amended at  68 FR 75388, Dec. 31, 2003]</p>
