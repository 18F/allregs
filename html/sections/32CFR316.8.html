This part reserves to the Director, DISA, as head of an agency, the right to create exemptions pursuant to the exemption provisions of the act. All systems of records maintained by DISA shall be exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a (d) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(3)(k)(1) to the extent that the system contains any information properly classified under Executive Order 11652, ``Classification and Declassification of National Security Information and Material,'' dated March 8, 1972 (37 FR 10053, May 19, 1972) and which is required by the executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. This exemption, which may be applicable to parts of all systems of records, is necessary because certain record systems not otherwise specifically designated for exemptions may contain isolated information which has been properly classified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> System identifier and name: K890.23, DISA Inspector General Investigative Tracker (DIGit).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exemptions: Any portion of this record system which falls within the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), (k)(2)and (k)(5) may be exempt from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a: (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), (k)(2), and (k)(5).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reasons: To ensure the integrity of the privacy and civil liberties process. The execution requires that information be provided in a free and open manner without fear of retribution or

harassment in order to facilitate a just, thorough, and timely resolution of the complaint or inquiry. Disclosures from this system can enable individuals to conceal their wrongdoing or mislead the course of the investigation by concealing, destroying, or fabricating evidence or documents. In addition, disclosures can subject sources and witnesses to harassment or intimidation which may cause individuals not to seek redress for wrongs through privacy and civil liberties channels for fear of retribution or harassment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]
