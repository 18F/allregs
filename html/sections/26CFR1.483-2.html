                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Adequate stated interest. For purposes of  section 483, a contract has unstated interest if the contract does not  provide for adequate stated interest. A contract does not provide for  adequate stated interest if the sum of the deferred payments exceeds--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The sum of the present values of the deferred payments and the  present values of any stated interest payments due under the contract;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a cash method debt instrument (within the  meaning of section 1274A(c)(2)) received in exchange for property in a  potentially abusive situation (as defined in Sec. 1.1274-3), the fair  market value of the property reduced by the fair market value of any  consideration other than the debt instrument, and reduced by the sum of  all principal payments that are not deferred payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amount of unstated interest. For purposes of section 483,  unstated interest means an amount equal to the excess of the sum of the  deferred payments over the amount described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or  (a)(1)(ii) of this section, whichever is applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Operational rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of paragraph (a)  of this section, rules similar to those in Sec. 1.1274-2 apply to  determine whether a contract has adequate stated interest and the amount  of unstated interest, if any, on the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Present value. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section,  the present value of any deferred payment or interest payment is  determined by discounting the payment from the date it becomes due to  the date of the sale or exchange at the test rate of interest applicable  to the contract in accordance with Sec. 1.483-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Contract that does not have adequate stated interest. On  January 1, 1995, A sells B nonpublicly traded property under a contract  that calls for a $100,000 payment of principal on January 1, 2005, and  10 annual interest payments of $9,000 on January 1 of each year,  beginning on January 1, 1996. Assume that the test rate of interest is  9.2 percent, compounded annually. The contract does not provide for  adequate stated interest because it does not provide for interest equal  to 9.2 percent, compounded annually. The present value of the deferred  payments is $98,727.69. As a result, the contract has unstated interest  of $1,272.31 ($100,000 - $98,727.69).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Contract that does not have adequate stated interest; no  interest for initial short period. On May 1, 1996, A sells B nonpublicly  traded property under a contract that calls for B to make a principal  payment of $200,000 on December 31, 1998, and semiannual interest  payments of $9,000, payable on June 30 and December 31 of each year,  beginning on December 31, 1996. Assume that the test rate of interest is  9 percent, compounded semiannually. Even though the contract calls for a  stated rate of interest no lower than the test rate of interest, the  contract does not provide for adequate stated interest because the  stated rate of interest does not apply for the short period from May 1,  1996, through June 30, 1996.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. In a  potentially abusive situation, a contract for the sale of nonpublicly  traded personal property calls for the issuance of a cash method debt  instrument (as defined in section 1274A(c)(2)) with a stated principal  amount of $700,000, payable in 5 years. No other consideration is given.  The debt instrument calls for annual payments of interest over its  entire term at a rate of 9.2 percent, compounded annually (the test rate  of interest applicable to the debt instrument). Thus, the present value  of the deferred payment and the interest payments is $700,000. Assume  that the fair market value of the property is $500,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amount of unstated interest. A cash method debt instrument  received in exchange for property in a potentially abusive situation  provides for adequate stated interest only if the sum of the deferred  payments under the instrument does not exceed the fair market value of  the property. Because the deferred payment ($700,000) exceeds the fair  market value of the property ($500,000), the debt instrument does not  provide for adequate stated interest. Therefore, the debt instrument has  unstated interest of $200,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A contract for the sale of nonpublicly traded property calls  for the issuance of a debt instrument in the principal amount of $75,000   due in 10 years. The debt instrument calls for interest payable  semiannually at a rate of 3 percentage points above the yield on 6-month  Treasury bills at the mid-point of the semiannual period immediately  preceding each interest payment date. Assume that the interest rate is a  qualified floating rate and that the debt instrument is a variable rate  debt instrument within the meaning of Sec. 1.1275-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Adequate stated interest. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this  section, rules similar to those in Sec. 1.1274-2(f) apply to determine  whether the debt instrument has adequate stated interest. Assume that  the test rate of interest applicable to the debt instrument is 9  percent, compounded semiannually. Assume also that the yield on 6-month  Treasury bills on the date of the sale is 8.89 percent, which is greater  than the yield on 6-month Treasury bills on the first date on which  there is a binding written contract that substantially sets forth the  terms under which the sale is consummated. Under Sec. 1.1274-2(f), the  debt instrument is tested for adequate stated interest as if it provided  for a stated rate of interest of 11.89 percent (3 percent plus 8.89  percent), compounded semiannually, payable over its entire term. Because  the test rate of interest is 9 percent, compounded semiannually, and the  debt instrument is treated as providing for stated interest of 11.89  percent, compounded semiannually, the debt instrument provides for  adequate stated interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. This section applies to sales and exchanges that  occur on or after April 4, 1994. Taxpayers, however, may rely on this  section for sales and exchanges that occur after December 21, 1992, and  before April 4, 1994.  [T.D. 8517, 59 FR 4806, Feb. 2, 1994]</p>
