                            <p class="depth0">Any national bank or any bank or trust company incorporated under  the laws of any State, Territory, possession, or the District of  Columbia, hereinafter referred to as any bank, is authorized to loan to  any veteran upon his promissory note secured by his Adjusted Service  Certificate any amount not in excess of the loan value of the  certificate at the date the loan is made. Each certificate contains on  its face a table for determining the loan value of the certificate, but  it is provided by amendment to the World War Adjusted Compensation Act  dated February 27, 1931, that the loan value of any certificate shall at  no time be less than 50 percent of the face value. Upon the making of  such loan, the lending bank shall promptly notify the Department of  Veterans Affairs of the name of the veteran, the A-number shown  immediately after the name, the number of the certificate, the amount,  the rate of interest, and date of loan: However, this requirement may be  waived by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.</p>
