                            <p class="depth0">Any person who knowingly and willfully requests or obtains any  record concerning an individual from the Department under false  pretenses is guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not more than $5,000 in  accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3).</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix to Part 10--Exemptions</p><p class="depth0">Part I. General Exemptions</p><p class="depth0">Those portions of the following systems of records that consist of  (a) Information compiled for the purpose of identifying individual  criminal offenders and alleged offenders and consisting only of  identifying data and notations of arrests, the nature and disposition of  criminal charges, sentencing, confinement, release, and parole and  probation status; (b) information compiled for the purpose of a criminal  investigation, including reports of informants and investigators, and  associated with an identifiable individual; or (c) reports identifiable  to an individual compiled at any stage of the process of enforcement of  the criminal laws from arrest or indictment through release from  supervision, are exempt from all parts of 5 U.S.C. 552a except  subsections (b) (Conditions of disclosure); (c) (1) and (2) (Accounting  of certain disclosures); (e)(4) (A) through (F) (Publication of  existence and character of system); (e)(6) (Ensure records are accurate,  relevant, timely, and complete before disclosure to person other than an  agency and other than pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request),  (7) (Restrict recordkeeping on First Amendment rights), (9) (Rules of  conduct), (10) (Safeguards), and (11) (Routine use publication); and (i)  (Criminal penalties):</p><p class="depth0">A. The Investigative Records System maintained by the Assistant  Inspector General for Investigations, Office of the Inspector General,  Office of the Secretary (DOT/OST 100).</p><p class="depth0">B. Police Warrant Files and Central Files maintained by the Federal  Aviation Administration (DOT/FAA 807).</p><p class="depth0">C. The Investigative Records System maintained by the Federal  Aviation Administration regarding criminal investigations conducted by  offices of Investigations and Security at headquarters and FAA Regional  and Center Security Divisions (DOT/FAA 815).</p><p class="depth0">D. General Investigations Record System, maintained by the Office of  Investigations and Security, Office of the Secretary (DOT/OST 016).</p><p class="depth0">These exemptions are justified for the following reasons:</p><p class="depth0">1. From subsection (c)(3), because making available to a record  subject the accounting of disclosures from records concerning him/her  would reveal investigative interest by not only DOT but also the  recipient agency, thereby permitting the record subject to take  appropriate measures to impede the investigation, as by destroying  evidence, intimidating potential witnesses, fleeing the area to avoid  the thrust of the investigation, etc.</p><p class="depth0">2. From subsections (d), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (f), and (g), because  granting an individual access to investigative records, and granting  him/her rights to amend/contest that information, interfere with the  overall law enforcement process by revealing a pending sensitive  investigation, possibly identify a confidential source, disclose  information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of another  individual's personal privacy, reveal a sensitive investigative  technique, or constitute a potential danger to the health or safety of  law enforcement personnel.</p><p class="depth0">3. From subsection (e)(1), because it is often impossible to  determine relevancy or necessity of information in the early stages of  an investigation. The value of such information is a question of  judgement and timing: what appears relevant and necessary when collected  may ultimately be evaluated and viewed as irrelevant and unnecessary to  an investigation. In addition, DOT may obtain information concerning the  violation of laws other than those within the scope of its jurisdiction.  In the interest of effective law enforcement, DOT should retain this  information because it may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful  activity and provide leads for other law enforcement agencies. Further,  in obtaining evidence during an investigation, information may be  provided to DOT that relates to matters incidental to the main purpose  of the investigation but that may be pertinent to the investigative  jurisdiction of another agency. Such information cannot readily be  identified.</p><p class="depth0">4. From subsection (e)(2), because in a law enforcement  investigation it is usually counterproductive to collect information to  the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject of the  information. It is not always feasible to rely upon the subject of an  investigation as a source for information that may implicate him/her in  illegal activities. In addition, collecting information directly from  the subject could seriously compromise an investigation by prematurely  revealing its nature and scope, or could provide the subject with an  opportunity to conceal criminal activities, or intimidate potential  sources, in order to avoid apprehension.</p><p class="depth0">5. From subsection (e)(3), because providing such notice to the  subject of an investigation, or to other individual sources, could  seriously compromise the investigation by prematurely revealing its  nature and scope, or could inhibit cooperation, permit the subject to  evade apprehension, or cause interference with undercover activities.</p><p class="depth0">Part II. Specific Exemptions</p><p class="depth0">A. The following systems of records are exempt from subsection  (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures), (d) (Access to Records),  (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules) of  5 U.S.C. 552a, to the extent that they contain investigatory material  compiled for law enforcement purposes, in accordance 5 U.S.C.  552a(k)(2):</p><p class="depth0">1.
