                                Sec. 25.2512-6  Valuation of certain life insurance and annuity
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Valuation of certain life insurance and annuity contracts. The value of a life insurance contract or of a contract for the payment of an annuity issued by a company regularly engaged in the selling of contracts of that character is established through the sale of the particular contract by the company, or through the sale by the company of comparable contracts. As valuation of an insurance policy through sale of comparable contracts is not readily ascertainable when the gift is of a contract which has been in force for some time and on which further premium payments are to be made, the value may be approximated by adding to the interpolated terminal reserve at the date of the gift the proportionate part of the gross premium last paid before the date of the gift which covers the period extending beyond that date. If, however, because of the unusual nature of the contract such approximation is not reasonably close to the full value, this method may not be used. The following examples, so far as relating to life insurance contracts, are of gifts of such contracts on which there are no accrued dividends or outstanding indebtedness.</p><p class="depth2">Example (1). A donor purchases from a life insurance company for the benefit of another a life insurance contract or a contract for the payment of an annuity. The value of the gift is the cost of the contract.</p><p class="depth2">Example (2). An annuitant purchased from a life insurance company a single payment annuity contract by the terms of which he was entitled to receive payments of $1,200 annually for the duration of his life. Five years subsequent to such purchase, and when of the age of 50 years, he gratuitously assigns the contract. The value of the gift is the amount which the company would charge for an annuity contract providing for the payment of $1,200 annually for the life of a person 50 years of age.</p><p class="depth2">Example (3). A donor owning a life insurance policy on which no further payments are to be made to the company (e.g., a single premium policy or paid-up policy) makes a gift of the contract. The value of the gift is the amount which the company would charge for a single premium contract of the same specified amount on the life of a person of the age of the insured.</p><p class="depth2">Example (4). A gift is made four months after the last premium due date of an ordinary life insurance policy issued nine years and four months prior to the gift thereof by the insured, who was 35 years of age at date of issue. The gross annual premium is $2,811. The computation follows:
Terminal reserve at end of tenth year.......................  $14,601.00Terminal reserve at end of ninth year.......................   12,965.00</p><p class="depth2">-----------</p><p class="depth2">Increase.................................................    1,636.00One-third of such increase (the gift having been made four        545.33</p><p class="depth2">months following the last preceding premium due date), is..Terminal reserve at end of ninth year                          12,965.00</p><p class="depth2">-----------Interpolated terminal reserve at date of gift...............   13,510.33Two-thirds of gross premium ($2,811)........................    1,874.00</p><p class="depth2">-----------</p><p class="depth2">Value of the gift..........................................   15,384.33</p><p class="depth2">Example (5). A donor purchases from a life insurance company for $15,198, a joint and survivor annuity contract which provides for the payment of $60 a month to the donor during his lifetime, and then to his sister for such time as she may survive him. The premium which would have been charged by the company for an annuity of $60 monthly payable during the life of the donor alone is $10,690. The value of the gift is $4,508 ($15,198 less $10,690).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Valuation of shares in an open-end investment company. (1) The fair market value of a share in an open-end investment company (commonly known as a ``mutual fund'') is the public redemption price of a share. In the absence of an affirmative showing of the public redemption price in effect at the time of the gift, the last public redemption price quoted by the company for the date of the gift shall be presumed to be the applicable public redemption price. If there is no public redemption price quoted by the company for the date of the gift (e.g., the date of the gift is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), the fair market value of the mutual fund share is the last public redemption price quoted by the company for the first day preceding the date of the gift for which there is a quotation. As used in

this paragraph the term ``open-end investment company'' includes only a company which on the date of the gift was engaged in offering its shares to the public in the capacity of an open-end investment company.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fair market value of a share in an open-end investment company (commonly known as a ``mutual fund'') is the public redemption price of a share.
