The top of the first page of each such document will contain the word ``PUBLIC'' or ``NON-PUBLIC,'' to indicate whether it contains exempt information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> One copy of the PUBLIC and NON-PUBLIC versions must be served on counsel for the petitioner and/or the Secretary, and one copy of the PUBLIC version must be served on counsel for each other participant separately represented unless the conditions of Rule 1003 are met, in which situation such counsel must be served with copies of both versions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In compiling appendices, the parties will include only documents specifically cited and relied upon in their pleadings. In light of the fact that the Commission always has access to the Secretary's entire administrative record, the parties must not include irrelevant or repetitive documents in the appendices.
