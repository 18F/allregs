If such a potential  leak is repaired as required in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section,  it is not necessary to monitor the system for leaks by the method  specified in Sec. 63.180(b) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an instrument reading of 10,000 parts per million or greater  for agitators, 5,000 parts per million or greater for pumps handling  polymerizing monomers, 2,000 parts per million or greater for all other  pumps (including pumps in food/medical service), or 500 parts per  million or greater for valves, connectors, instrumentation systems, and  pressure relief devices is measured, a leak is detected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a leak is detected, it shall be repaired as soon as  practicable, but not later than 15 calendar days after it is detected,  except as provided in Sec. 63.171 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5  calendar days after each leak is detected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For equipment identified in paragraph (a) of this section that  is not monitored by the method specified in Sec. 63.180(b), repaired  shall mean that the visual, audible, olfactory, or other indications of  a leak to the atmosphere have been eliminated; that no bubbles are  observed at potential leak sites during a leak check using soap  solution; or that the system will hold a test pressure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> First attempts at repair include, but are not limited to, the  practices described under Secs. 63.163(c)(2) and 63.168(g)   of this subpart, for pumps and valves, respectively.
