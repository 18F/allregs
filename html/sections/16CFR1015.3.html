                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A request for access to records of the Commission shall be in  writing addressed to the Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission,  Washington, DC 20207. Any written request for records covered by this  part shall be deemed to be a request for records pursuant to the Freedom  of Information Act, whether or not the Freedom of Information Act is  mentioned in the request. An oral request for records will not be  considered a request for records pursuant to the Freedom of Information  Act. Responses to oral requests for records shall be made as promptly as  resources and time restraints permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A request for access to records must reasonably describe the  records requested. Where possible, specific information regarding dates,  title, file designations, and other information which may help identify  the records should be supplied by the requester. If the request relates  to a matter in pending litigation, where the Commission is a party, the  court and its location should be identified. Where the information  supplied by the requester is not sufficient to permit identification and  location of the records by Commission personnel without an unreasonable  amount of effort, the requester will be contacted and asked to supply  the necessary information. Every reasonable effort shall be made by  Commission personnel to assist in the identification and location of  requested records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If it is determined that a request would unduly burden or  interfere with the operations of the Commission, the response shall so  state and shall extend to the requester an opportunity to confer with  appropriate Commission personnel in an attempt to reduce the request to  manageable proportions by reformulation and by agreeing on an orderly  procedure for the production of the records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a requested record cannot be located from the information  supplied, or is known to have been destroyed or otherwise disposed of,  the requester shall be so notified by the Secretary or delegate of the  Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Consumer Product Safety Commission uses a multitrack system  to process requests under the Freedom of Information Act that is based  on the amount of work and/or time involved in processing requests.  Requests for records are processed in the order they are received within  each track. Upon receipt of a request for records, the Secretary or  delegate of the Secretary will determine which track is appropriate for  the request. The Secretary or delegate of the Secretary may contact  requesters whose requests do not appear to qualify for the fastest  tracks and provide such requesters the opportunity to limit their  requests so as to qualify for a faster track. Requesters who believe  that their requests qualify for the fastest tracks and who wish to be  notified if the Secretary or delegate of the Secretary disagrees may so  indicate in the request and, where appropriate and feasible, will also  be given an opportunity to limit their requests.
