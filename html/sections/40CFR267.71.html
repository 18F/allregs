Note that the Agency does not intend that the owner or operator of a facility whose procedures under Sec.  267.13(c) include waste analysis must perform that analysis before signing the shipping paper and giving it to the transporter. Section 267.72(b), however, requires reporting an unreconciled discrepancy discovered during later analysis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Immediately give the rail or water (bulk shipment) transporter at least one copy of the manifest or shipping paper (if the manifest has not been received);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within 30 days after the delivery, send a copy of the signed and dated manifest to the generator; however, if the manifest has not been received within 30 days after delivery, the owner or operator, or his agent, must send a copy of the shipping paper signed and dated to the generator. Note that Sec.  262.23(c) of this chapter requires the generator to send three copies of the manifest to the facility when hazardous waste is sent by rail or water (bulk shipment); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Retain at the facility a copy of the manifest and shipping paper (if signed in lieu of the manifest at the time of delivery) for at least three years from the date of delivery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whenever a shipment of hazardous waste is initiated from a facility, the owner or operator of that facility must comply with the requirements of part 262 of this chapter. The Agency notes that the provisions of Sec.  262.34 are applicable to the on-site accumulation of hazardous wastes by generators. Therefore, the provisions of Sec.  262.34 only apply to owners or operators who are shipping hazardous waste which they generated at that facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Within three working days of the receipt of a shipment subject to 40 CFR part 262, subpart H, the owner or operator of the facility must provide a copy of the tracking document bearing all required signatures to the notifier, to the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Office of Compliance, Enforcement Planning, Targeting and Data Division (2222A), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460, and to competent authorities of all other concerned countries. The original copy of the tracking document must be maintained at the facility for at least three years from the date of signature.</p>
