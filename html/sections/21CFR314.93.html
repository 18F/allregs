                                Sec.  314.93  Petition to request a change from a listed drug.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The only changes from a listed drug for which the agency will accept a petition under this section are those changes described in paragraph (b) of this section. Petitions to submit abbreviated new drug applications for other changes from a listed drug will not be approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A person who wants to submit an abbreviated new drug application for a

drug product which is not identical to a listed drug in route of administration, dosage form, and strength, or in which one active ingredient is substituted for one of the active ingredients in a listed combination drug, must first obtain permission from FDA to submit such an abbreviated application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To obtain permission to submit an abbreviated new drug application for a change described in paragraph (b) of this section, a person must submit and obtain approval of a petition requesting the change. A person seeking permission to request such a change from a reference listed drug shall submit a petition in accordance with Sec.  10.20 of this chapter and in the format specified in Sec.  10.30 of this chapter. The petition shall contain the information specified in Sec.  10.30 of this chapter and any additional information required by this section. If any provision of Sec.  10.20 or Sec.  10.30 of this chapter is inconsistent with any provision of this section, the provisions of this section apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The petitioner shall identify a listed drug and include a copy of the proposed labeling for the drug product that is the subject of the petition and a copy of the approved labeling for the listed drug. The petitioner may, under limited circumstances, identify more than one listed drug, for example, when the proposed drug product is a combination product that differs from the combination reference listed drug with regard to an active ingredient, and the different active ingredient is an active ingredient of a listed drug. The petitioner shall also include information to show that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The active ingredients of the proposed drug product are of the same pharmacological or therapeutic class as those of the reference listed drug.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The drug product can be expected to have the same therapeutic effect as the reference listed drug when administered to patients for each condition of use in the reference listed drug's labeling for which the applicant seeks approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the proposed drug product is a combination product with one different active ingredient, including a different ester or salt, from the reference listed drug, that the different active ingredient has previously been approved in a listed drug or is a drug that does not meet the definition of ``new drug'' in section 201(b) of the act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No later than 90 days after the date a petition that is permitted under paragraph (a) of this section is submitted, FDA will approve or disapprove the petition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FDA will approve a petition properly submited under this section unless it finds that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Investigations must be conducted to show the safety and effectiveness of the drug product or of any of its active ingredients, its route of administration, dosage form, or strength which differs from the reference listed drug; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For a petition that seeks to change an active ingredient, the drug product that is the subject of the petition is not a combination drug; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For a combination drug product that is the subject of the petition and has an active ingredient different from the reference listed drug:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The drug product may not be adequately evaluated for approval as safe and effective on the basis of the information required to be submitted under Sec.  314.94; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The petition does not contain information to show that the different active ingredient of the drug product is of the same pharmacological or therapeutic class as the ingredient of the reference listed drug that is to be changed and that the drug product can be expected to have the same therapeutic effect as the reference listed drug when administered to patients for each condition of use in the listed drug's labeling for which the applicant seeks approval; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The different active ingredient is not an active ingredient in a listed drug or a drug that meets the requirements of section 201(p) of the act; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The remaining active ingredients are not identical to those of the listed combination drug; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any of the proposed changes from the listed drug would jeopardize the safe or effective use of the product so as to necessitate significant labeling changes to address the newly introduced safety or effectiveness problem; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> FDA has determined that the reference listed drug has been withdrawn from sale for safety or effectiveness reasons under Sec.  314.161, or the reference listed drug has been voluntarily withdrawn from sale and the agency has not determined whether the withdrawal is for safety or effectiveness reasons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this paragraph, ``investigations must be conducted'' means that information derived from animal or clinical studies is necessary to show that the drug product is safe or effective. Such information may be contained in published or unpublished reports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If FDA approves a petition submitted under this section, the agency's response may describe what additional information, if any, will be required to support an abbreviated new drug application for the drug product. FDA may, at any time during the course of its review of an abbreviated new drug application, request additional information required to evaluate the change approved under the petition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> FDA may withdraw approval of a petition if the agency receives any information demonstrating that the petition no longer satisfies the conditions under paragraph (e) of this section.</p>
