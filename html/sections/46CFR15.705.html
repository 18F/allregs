                                Sec. 15.705  Watches.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Title 46 U.S.C. 8104 applies to the establishment of watches  aboard certain U.S. vessels. The establishment of adequate watches is  the responsibility of the vessel's master. The Coast Guard interprets  the term ``watch'' to be the direct performance of vessel operations,  whether deck or engine, where such operations would routinely be  controlled and performed in a scheduled and fixed rotation. The  performance of maintenance or work necessary to the vessel's safe  operation on a daily basis does not in itself constitute the  establishment of a watch. The minimum safe manning levels specified in a  vessel's COI or other safe manning document take into consideration  routine maintenance requirements and ability of the crew to perform all  operational evolutions, including emergencies, as well as those  functions which may be assigned to persons in watches.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subject to exceptions, 46 U.S.C. 8104 requires that when a  master of a seagoing vessel of more than 100 GRT establishes watches for  the officers, sailors, coal passers, firemen, oilers, and watertenders,  ``the personnel shall be divided, when at sea, into at least three  watches and shall be kept on duty successively to perform ordinary work  incidental to the operation and management of the vessel.'' Solely for  the purposes of this part, the Coast Guard interprets ``sailors'' to  mean those members of the deck department other than officers, whose  duties involve the mechanics of conducting the ship on its voyage, such  as helmsman (wheelsman), lookout, etc., and which are necessary to the  maintenance of a continuous watch. The term ``sailors'' is not  interpreted to include able seamen and ordinary seamen not performing  these duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subject to exceptions, 46 U.S.C. 8104(g) permits the officers  and crew members (except the coal passers, firemen, oilers, and  watertenders) to be divided into two watches when at sea and engaged on  a voyage of less than 600 miles on the following categories of vessels--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Towing vessel;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Offshore supply vessels, except as provided by paragraph (c)(2)  of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Barge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies to an OSV of at least  6,000 GT ITC (500 GRT if GT ITC is not assigned), as defined in  Sec. 125.160 of this chapter, if the individuals engaged on the vessel  are in compliance with the work hours and rest period requirements in  Sec. 15.1111 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Subject to exceptions, 46 U.S.C. 8104(h) permits a master or  mate (pilot) operating a towing vessel that is at least 8 meters (26  feet) in length measured from end to end over the deck (excluding sheer)  to work not more than 12 hours in a consecutive 24-hour period except in  an emergency. The Coast Guard interprets this, in conjunction with other  provisions of the law, to permit masters or mates (pilots) serving as  operators of towing vessels that are not subject to the provisions of  the Officers' Competency Certificates Convention, 1936 (see 46 U.S.C.  8304), to be divided into two watches regardless of the length of the  voyage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Fish processing vessels are subject to various provisions of 46  U.S.C. 8104 concerning watches, including--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For fish processing vessels that entered into service before  January 1, 1988, the following watch requirements apply to the officers  and deck crew:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If more than 5,000 GRT--three watches.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If more than 1,600 GRT and not more than 5,000 GRT--two  watches.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If not more than 1,600 GRT--no watch division specified; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For fish processing vessels that entered into service after  December 31, 1987, the following watch requirements apply to the  officers and deck crew:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If more than 5,000 GRT--three watches.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If not more than 5,000 GRT and having more than 16 individuals  onboard, primarily employed in the preparation of fish or fish  products--two watches.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If not more than 5,000 GRT and having not more than 16  individuals onboard, primarily employed in the preparation of fish or  fish products--no watch division specified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Properly manned uninspected passenger vessels of at least 100  GRT--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Which are underway for no more than 12 hours in any 24-hour  period, and which are adequately moored, anchored, or otherwise secured  in a harbor of safe refuge for the remainder of that 24-hour period, may  operate with one navigational watch;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Which are underway more than 12 hours in any 24-hour period,  must provide a minimum of a two-watch system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In no case may the crew of any watch work more than 12 hours in  any 24-hour period, except in an emergency.
