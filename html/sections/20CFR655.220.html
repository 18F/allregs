                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> NPC Review. Unless otherwise specified in Sec. Sec.  655.200-655.235, the CO will review and process the H-2A Application for Temporary Employment Certification and the Form ETA-790 in accordance with the requirements outlined in Sec. Sec.  655.140-655.145, and will work with the employer to address any deficiencies in the job order in a manner consistent with Sec. Sec.  655.140-655.141.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of acceptance. Once the job order is determined to meet all regulatory requirements, the NPC will issue a Notice of Acceptance consistent with Sec.  655.143(b)(1). The CO will provide notice to the employer authorizing conditional access to the interstate clearance system; identify and transmit a copy of the Form ETA-790 to any one of the SWAs having jurisdiction over the anticipated worksites, and direct the SWA to place the job order promptly in intrastate and interstate clearance (including all States where the work will take place); and commence recruitment of U.S. workers. Where an association of agricultural employers files as a joint employer and submits a single Form ETA-790 on behalf of its employer-members, the CO will transmit a copy of the Form ETA-790 to the SWA having jurisdiction over the location of the association, again directing that SWA to place the job order in intrastate and interstate clearance, including to those other States where the work will take place, and commence recruitment of U.S. workers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Electronic job registry. Under Sec.  655.144(b), where a single job order is approved for an association of agricultural employers filing as a joint employer on behalf of its employer-members with different start dates of need, the Department will keep the job order posted on the OFLC electronic job registry until 50 percent of the period of the work contract has elapsed for all employer-members identified on the job order.</p>
