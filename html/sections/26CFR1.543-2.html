                                Sec. 1.543-2  Limitation on gross income and personal holding company
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(3)</em> and paragraph (b)(6) of Sec. 1.543-1, shall be the net gains  from commodity transactions which reflect personal holding company  income. Any excess of losses over gains from such transactions  (resulting in a net loss) shall not be used to reduce gross income or  personal holding company income. The capital loss carryover under  section 1212 shall not be taken into account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. The P Corporation, not a regular dealer in stocks and  securities, received rentals of $250,000 for its property from a 25- percent shareholder, and also had gains of $50,000 during the taxable  year from the sale of stocks and securities. It also had losses on the  sale of stocks and securities in the amount of $30,000. Accordingly, P  Corporation had gross income during the taxable year of $270,000  ($250,000 plus $20,000 net gain from the sales of stocks and  securities). It had personal holding company income of $20,000. (The  rentals of $250,000 would not be personal holding company income under  section 543(a)(6) since the personal holding company income of the  corporation, $20,000 (after excluding any such income described in  section 543(a)(6)), is not more than 10 percent of its gross income.)</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. The R Corporation, not a regular dealer in stocks or  securities, realized total gains during the taxable year of $900,000  from commodity futures transactions and $200,000 from the sales of  stocks and securities. It also sustained total losses of $1,000,000 on  such commodity futures transactions, resulting in a net gain for the  taxable year or $100,000. None of the commodity futures transactions are  hedging or other types of futures transactions excluded from the  application of section 543(a)(3). No part of the loss on commodity  futures transactions is to be taken into account in determining personal  holding company income and gross income for personal holding company tax  purposes for the taxable year. The full amount of the $200,000 in gains  from the sales of stocks and securities is to be included in personal  holding company income and in gross income for personal holding company  tax purposes for the taxable year.</p>
