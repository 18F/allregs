                                Sec. 320.39  Execution and filing of appeal to Board from decision
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An appeal to the Board from the decision of a hearings officer  shall be filed on the form provided by the Board and shall be executed  in accordance with the instructions on the form. Such appeal shall be  filed within 60 days from the date upon which notice of the decision of  the hearings officer was mailed to the parties. The right to further  review of a decision of a hearings officer shall be forfeited unless  formal final appeal is filed in the manner and within the time  prescribed in this section. Any written request stating an intent to  appeal which is received within the 60-day period will protect the  claimant's right to appeal, Provided that the claimant files the appeal  form within the later of the 60-day period following the date of the  hearing officer's decision, or the 30-day period following the date of  the letter sending the appeal form to the claimant. However, when a  party fails to file an appeal before the Board within the time   prescribed in this section, the Board may waive this requirement if  along with the final appeal, the party in writing requests an extension  of time. The request for an extension of time must give the reasons why  the final appeal form was not filed within the time limit prescribed in  this section. If in the judgment of the Board the reasons given  establish that the party has good cause for not filing the final appeal  form within the time limit prescribed, the Board will consider the  appeal to have been filed in a timely manner. The Board will use the  standards found in Sec. 320.10(e) of this part in determining if good  cause exists.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where a timely appeal seeking waiver of recovery of an erroneous  payment has been filed with the three-member Board, the Board shall not  commence recovery of the erroneous payment by suspension or reduction of  a monthly benefit payable by the Board until a decision with respect to  such appeal seeking waiver has been made and notice thereof has been  mailed to the claimant.
