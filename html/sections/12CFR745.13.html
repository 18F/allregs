This may be  accomplished by placing either a copy of part 745 of these rules, the  appendix, or one or more copies of the NCUA brochure ``Your Insured  Funds'' in each branch office and main office of the credit union.  Copies of these materials shall also be made available to members upon  request. For purposes of this section, an automated teller machine or  point of sale terminal is not a branch office.</p>
