Such modifications or  additions shall not relieve the architect or the borrower of the basic  responsibilities required by the RUS contract form, and shall not alter  any terms and conditions required by law. All substantive changes must  be approved by RUS prior to execution of the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Architectural services contracts are not subject to RUS approval  and need not be submitted to RUS unless specifically requested by RUS on  a case by case basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Closeout. Upon completion of all services and obligations  required under each architectural services contract, including, but not  limited to, submission of final documents, the borrower must closeout  that contract. The borrower shall obtain from the architect a final  statement of cost, which must be supported by detailed information as  appropriate. For example, out-of-pocket expense and per diem types of  compensation should be listed separately with labor, transportation,  etc., itemized for each service involving these types of compensation.  RUS Form 284, Final Statement of Cost for Architectural Service, may be  used. All computations of the compensation must be made in accordance  with the terms of the architectural services contract. Closeout  documents need not be submitted to RUS unless specifically requested by  RUS on a case by case basis.    Sec. Sec. 1724.22-1724.29  [Reserved]</p>
