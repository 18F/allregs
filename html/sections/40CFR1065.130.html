                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Use the exhaust system installed with the engine or one  that represents a typical in-use configuration. This includes any  applicable aftertreatment devices. We refer to exhaust piping as an  exhaust stack; this is equivalent to a tailpipe for vehicle  configurations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Aftertreatment configuration. If you do not use the exhaust  system installed with the engine, configure any aftertreatment devices  as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Position any aftertreatment device so its distance from the  nearest exhaust manifold flange or turbocharger outlet is within the  range specified by the engine manufacturer in the application for  certification. If this distance is not specified, position  aftertreatment devices to represent typical in-use vehicle  configurations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may use exhaust tubing that is not from the in-use exhaust  system upstream of any aftertreatment device that is of diameter(s)  typical of in-use configurations. If you use exhaust tubing that is not  from the in-use exhaust system upstream of any aftertreatment device,  position each aftertreatment device according to paragraph (b)(1) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sampling system connections. Connect an engine's exhaust system  to any raw sampling location or dilution stage, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Minimize laboratory exhaust tubing lengths and use a total  length of laboratory tubing of no more than 10 m or 50 outside  diameters, whichever is greater. The start of laboratory exhaust tubing  should be specified as the exit of the exhaust manifold, turbocharger  outlet, last aftertreatment device, or the in-use exhaust system,  whichever is furthest downstream. The end of laboratory exhaust tubing  should be specified as the sample point, or first point of dilution. If  laboratory exhaust tubing consists of several different outside tubing  diameters, count the number of diameters of length of each individual  diameter, then sum all the diameters to determine the total length of  exhaust tubing in diameters. Use the mean outside diameter of any  converging or diverging sections of tubing. Use outside hydraulic  diameters of any noncircular sections. For multiple stack configurations  where all the exhaust stacks are combined, the start of the laboratory  exhaust tubing may be taken at the last joint of where all the stacks  are combined.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may install short sections of flexible laboratory exhaust  tubing at any location in the engine or laboratory exhaust systems. You  may use up to a combined total of 2 m or 10 outside diameters of  flexible exhaust tubing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Insulate any laboratory exhaust tubing downstream of the first  25 outside diameters of length.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use laboratory exhaust tubing materials that are smooth-walled,  electrically conductive, and not reactive with exhaust constituents.  Stainless steel is an acceptable material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> We recommend that you use laboratory exhaust tubing that has  either a wall thickness of less than 2 mm or is air gap-insulated to  minimize temperature differences between the wall and the exhaust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> We recommend that you connect multiple exhaust stacks from a  single engine into one stack upstream of any emission sampling. For raw  or dilute partial-flow emission sampling, to ensure mixing of the  multiple exhaust streams before emission sampling, we recommend a  minimum Reynolds number, Re #, of 4000 for the combined  exhaust stream, whereRe # is based on the inside diameter of  the combined flow at the first sampling point. You may configure the  exhaust system with turbulence generators, such as orifice plates or  fins, to achieve good mixing; inclusion of turbulence generators may be  required forRe # less than 4000 to ensure good mixing.Re  # is defined in Sec.  1065.640. For dilute full-flow (CVS)  emission sampling, you may configure the exhaust system without regard  to mixing in the laboratory section of the raw exhaust. For example you  may size the laboratory section to reduce its pressure drop even if  theRe #, in the laboratory section of the raw exhaust is less  than 4000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In-line instruments. You may insert instruments into the  laboratory exhaust tubing, such as an in-line   smoke meter. If you do this, you may leave a length of up to 5 outside  diameters of laboratory exhaust tubing uninsulated on each side of each  instrument, but you must leave a length of no more than 25 outside  diameters of laboratory exhaust tubing uninsulated in total, including  any lengths adjacent to in-line instruments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Leaks. Minimize leaks sufficiently to ensure your ability to  demonstrate compliance with the applicable standards. We recommend  performing a chemical balance of fuel, intake air, and exhaust according  to Sec.  1065.655 to verify exhaust system integrity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Grounding. Electrically ground the entire exhaust system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Forced cooldown. You may install a forced cooldown system for an  exhaust aftertreatment device according to Sec.  1065.530(a)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Exhaust restriction. As the manufacturer, you are liable for  emission compliance for all values up to the maximum restriction(s) you  specify for a particular engine. Measure and set exhaust restriction(s)  at the location(s) and at the engine speed and torque values specified  by the manufacturer. Also, for variable-restriction aftertreatment  devices, measure and set exhaust restriction(s) at the aftertreatment  condition (degreening/aging and regeneration/loading level) specified by  the manufacturer. If the manufacturer does not specify a location,  measure this pressure downstream of any turbocharger. If the  manufacturer does not specify speed and torque points, measure pressure  while the engine produces maximum power. Use an exhaust-restriction  setpoint that represents a typical in-use value, if available. If a  typical in-use value for exhaust restriction is not available, set the  exhaust restriction at (80 to 100)% of the maximum exhaust restriction  specified by the manufacturer, or if the maximum is 5 kPa or less, the  set point must be no less than 1.0 kPa from the maximum. For example, if  the maximum back pressure is 4.5 kPa, do not use an exhaust restriction  set point that is less than 3.5 kPa.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Open crankcase emissions. If the standard-setting part requires  measuring open crankcase emissions, you may either measure open  crankcase emissions separately using a method that we approve in  advance, or route open crankcase emissions directly into the exhaust  system for emission measurement. If the engine is not already configured  to route open crankcase emissions for emission measurement, route open  crankcase emissions as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use laboratory tubing materials that are smooth-walled,  electrically conductive, and not reactive with crankcase emissions.  Stainless steel is an acceptable material. Minimize tube lengths. We  also recommend using heated or thin-walled or air gap-insulated tubing  to minimize temperature differences between the wall and the crankcase  emission constituents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Minimize the number of bends in the laboratory crankcase tubing  and maximize the radius of any unavoidable bend.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use laboratory crankcase exhaust tubing that meets the engine  manufacturer's specifications for crankcase back pressure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Connect the crankcase exhaust tubing into the raw exhaust  downstream of any aftertreatment system, downstream of any installed  exhaust restriction, and sufficiently upstream of any sample probes to  ensure complete mixing with the engine's exhaust before sampling. Extend  the crankcase exhaust tube into the free stream of exhaust to avoid  boundary-layer effects and to promote mixing. You may orient the  crankcase exhaust tube's outlet in any direction relative to the raw  exhaust flow.  [73 FR 37293, June 30, 2008, as amended at 79 FR 23754, Apr. 28, 2014]</p>
