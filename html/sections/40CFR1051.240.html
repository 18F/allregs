                                Sec.  1051.240  How do I demonstrate that my engine family complies
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of certification, your engine family is considered  in compliance with the applicable numerical exhaust emission standards  in subpart B of this part if all emission-data vehicles representing  that family have test results showing deteriorated emission levels at or  below these standards. This includes all test points over the course of  the durability demonstration. (Note: if you participate in the ABT  program in subpart H of this part, your FELs are considered to be the  applicable emission standards with which you must comply.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Your engine family is deemed not to comply if any emission-data  vehicle representing that family has test results showing a deteriorated  emission level for any pollutant that is above an applicable FEL or  emission standard. This includes all test points over the course of the  durability demonstration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To compare emission levels from the emission-data vehicle with  the applicable emission standards, apply deterioration factors to the  measured emission levels. Section 1051.243 specifies how to test your  vehicle to develop deterioration factors that represent the  deterioration expected in emissions over your vehicle's full useful  life. Your deterioration factors must take into account any available  data from in-use testing with similar engines. Small-volume  manufacturers may use assigned deterioration factors that we establish.  Apply deterioration factors as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For vehicles that use aftertreatment technology, such as  catalytic converters, use a multiplicative deterioration factor for  exhaust emissions. A multiplicative deterioration factor is the ratio of  exhaust emissions at the end of the useful life and exhaust emissions at  the low-hour test point. In these cases, adjust the official emission  results for each tested vehicle or engine at the selected test point by  multiplying the measured emissions by the deterioration factor. If the  factor is less than one, use one. Multiplicative deterioration factors  must be specified to three significant figures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For vehicles that do not use aftertreatment technology, use an  additive deterioration factor for exhaust emissions. An additive  deterioration factor for a pollutant is the difference between exhaust  emissions at the end of the useful life and exhaust emissions at the  low-hour test point. In these cases, adjust the official emission  results for each tested vehicle or engine at the selected test point by  adding the factor to the measured emissions. If the factor is less than  zero, use zero. Additive deterioration factors must be specified to one  more decimal place than the applicable standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Collect emission data using measurements to one more decimal  place than the applicable standard. Apply the deterioration factor to  the official emission result, as described in paragraph (c) of this  section, then round the adjusted figure to the same number of decimal  places as the emission standard. Compare the rounded emission levels to  the emission standard for each emission-data vehicle. In the case of  HC+NOX standards, add the emission results and apply the  deterioration factor to the sum of the pollutants before rounding.  However, if your deterioration factors are based on emission  measurements that do not cover the vehicle's full useful life, apply the  deterioration factor to each pollutant and then add the results before  rounding.
