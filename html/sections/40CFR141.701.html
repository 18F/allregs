                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Initial round of source water monitoring. Systems must conduct  the following monitoring on the schedule in paragraph (c) of this  section unless they meet the monitoring exemption criteria in paragraph  (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Filtered systems serving at least 10,000 people must sample  their source water for Cryptosporidium, E. coli, and turbidity at least  monthly for 24 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Unfiltered systems serving at least 10,000 people must sample  their source water for Cryptosporidium at least monthly for 24 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Filtered systems serving fewer than 10,000 people must sample  their source water for E. coli at least once every two weeks for 12  months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A filtered system serving fewer than 10,000 people may avoid E.  coli monitoring if the system notifies the State that it will monitor  for Cryptosporidium as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.  The system must notify the State no later than 3 months prior to the  date the system is otherwise required to start E. coli monitoring under  Sec.  141.701(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Filtered systems serving fewer than 10,000 people must sample  their source water for Cryptosporidium at least twice per month for 12  months or at least monthly for 24 months if they meet one of the  following, based on monitoring conducted under paragraph (a)(3) of this  section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For systems using lake/reservoir sources, the annual mean E.  coli concentration is greater than 10 E. coli/100 mL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For systems using flowing stream sources, the annual mean E.  coli concentration is greater than 50 E. coli/100 mL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The system does not conduct E. coli monitoring as described in  paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Systems using ground water under the direct influence of  surface water (GWUDI) must comply with the requirements of paragraph  (a)(4) of this section based on the E. coli level that applies to the  nearest surface water body. If no surface water body is nearby, the  system must comply based on the requirements that apply to systems using  lake/reservoir sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For filtered systems serving fewer than 10,000 people, the State  may approve monitoring for an indicator   other than E. coli under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The State  also may approve an alternative to the E. coli concentration in  paragraph (a)(4)(i), (ii) or (iv) of this section to trigger  Cryptosporidium monitoring. This approval by the State must be provided  to the system in writing and must include the basis for the State's  determination that the alternative indicator and/or trigger level will  provide a more accurate identification of whether a system will exceed  the Bin 1 Cryptosporidium level in Sec.  141.710.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Unfiltered systems serving fewer than 10,000 people must sample  their source water for Cryptosporidium at least twice per month for 12  months or at least monthly for 24 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Systems may sample more frequently than required under this  section if the sampling frequency is evenly spaced throughout the  monitoring period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Second round of source water monitoring. Systems must conduct a  second round of source water monitoring that meets the requirements for  monitoring parameters, frequency, and duration described in paragraph  (a) of this section, unless they meet the monitoring exemption criteria  in paragraph (d) of this section. Systems must conduct this monitoring  on the schedule in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Monitoring schedule. Systems must begin the monitoring required  in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section no later than the month  beginning with the date listed in this table:</p><p class="depth0">Source Water Monitoring Starting Dates Table ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">And must begin the</p><p class="depth0">Must begin the first     second round of</p><p class="depth0">round of source        source water</p><p class="depth0">Systems that serve . . .     water monitoring no   monitoring no later</p><p class="depth0">later than the month     than the month</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> At least 100,000 people.

Alternatively, a system may choose to stop sampling at any point after  it has initiated monitoring if it notifies the State in writing that it  will provide this level of treatment. Systems must install and operate  technologies to provide this level of treatment by the applicable  treatment compliance date in Sec.  141.713.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Plants operating only part of the year. Systems with subpart H  plants that operate for only part of the year must conduct source water  monitoring in accordance with this subpart, but with the following  modifications:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Systems must sample their source water only during the months  that the plant operates unless the State specifies another monitoring  period based on plant operating practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Systems with plants that operate less than six months per year  and that   monitor for Cryptosporidium must collect at least six Cryptosporidium  samples per year during each of two years of monitoring. Samples must be  evenly spaced throughout the period the plant operates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> New sources. A system that begins using a new source of  surface water or GWUDI after the system is required to begin monitoring  under paragraph (c) of this section must monitor the new source on a  schedule the State approves. Source water monitoring must meet the  requirements of this subpart. The system must also meet the bin  classification and Cryptosporidium treatment requirements of Sec. Sec.   141.710 and 141.711 or Sec.  141.712, as applicable, for the new source  on a schedule the State approves.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The requirements of Sec.  141.701(f) apply to subpart H systems  that begin operation after the monitoring start date applicable to the  system's size under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The system must begin a second round of source water monitoring  no later than 6 years following initial bin classification under Sec.   141.710 or determination of the mean Cryptosporidium level under Sec.   141.712, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Failure to collect any source water sample required under this  section in accordance with the sampling schedule, sampling location,  analytical method, approved laboratory, and reporting requirements of  Sec. Sec.  141.702 through 141.706 is a monitoring violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Grandfathering monitoring data. Systems may use (grandfather)  monitoring data collected prior to the applicable monitoring start date  in paragraph (c) of this section to meet the initial source water  monitoring requirements in paragraph (a) of this section. Grandfathered  data may substitute for an equivalent number of months at the end of the  monitoring period. All data submitted under this paragraph must meet the  requirements in Sec.  141.707.</p>
