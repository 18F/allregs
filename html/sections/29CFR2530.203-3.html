                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(3)(B)</em> and this regulation to the extent  (but only to the extent) that suspension of such benefits does not  affect a retiree's entitlement to normal retirement benefits payable  after attainment of normal retirement age, or the actuarial equivalent  thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Suspension rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. A plan may provide for the  permanent withholding of an amount which does not exceed the suspendible  amount of an employee's accrued benefit for each calendar month, or for  each four or five week payroll period ending in a calendar month, during  which an employee is employed in ``section 203(a)(3)(B) service'' as  described in Sec. 2530.203-3(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Resumption of payments. If benefit payments have been suspended  pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, payments shall resume no  later than the first day of the third calendar month after the calendar  month in   which the employee ceases to be employed in section 203(a)(3)(B)  service: Provided, That the employee has complied with any reasonable  procedure adopted by the plan for notifying the plan that he has ceased  such employment. The initial payment upon resumption shall include the  payment scheduled to occur in the calendar month when payments resume  and any amounts withheld during the period between the cessation of  employment and the resumption of payments, less any amounts which are  subject to offset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(B)</em> service, Provided, That such deduction or offset does not  exceed in any one month 25 percent of that month's total benefit payment  which would have been due but for the offset (excluding the initial  payment described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, which may be  subject to offset without limitation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em>, the suspension  notification may refer the employee to relevant pages of the SPD for  information as to a particular item, provided the employee is informed  how to obtain a copy of the SPD, or relevant pages thereof, and provided  requests for referenced information are honored within a reasonable  period of time, not to exceed 30 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> except to the extent  that payments may be withheld and offset pursuant to other provisions of  this regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Status determination. If a plan provides for benefits  suspension, the plan shall adopt a procedure, and so inform employees,  whereunder an employee may request, and the plan administrator in a  reasonable amount of time will render, a determination of whether   specific contemplated employment will be section 203(a)(3)(B) service  for purposes of plan provisions concerning suspension of benefits.  Requests for status determinations may be considered in accordance with  the claims procedure adopted by the plan pursuant to section 503 of the  Act and applicable regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Presumptions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A plan which has adopted verification  requirements described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, and which  complies with the notice requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(7)(ii)  of this section may provide that whenever the plan fiduciaries become  aware that a retiree is employed in section 203(a)(3)(B) service and the  retiree has not complied with the plan's reporting requirements with  regard to that employment, the plan fiduciaries may, unless it is  unreasonable under the circumstances to do so, act on the basis of a  rebuttable presumption that the retiree had worked a period exceeding  the plan's minimum number of hours for that month. In addition, a plan  covering persons employed in the building trades which has adopted  verification requirements described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section  and which complies with the notice requirements set forth in paragraph  (b)(7)(ii) of this section may provide that whenever the plan  fiduciaries become aware that a retiree is employed in section  203(a)(3)(B) service at a construction site and the retiree has not  complied with the plan's reporting requirements with regard to that  employment, then the plan fiduciaries may, unless it is unreasonable  under the circumstances to do so, act on the basis of a rebuttable  presumption that the retiree engaged in such employment for the same  employer in work at that site for so long before the work in question as  that same employer performed that work at that construction site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A plan which provides for a presumption described in paragraph  (b)(7)(i) of this section may employ such presumption only if the  following requirements are met. The plan must describe its employment  verification requirements and the nature and effect of such presumption  in the plan's summary plan description and in any communication to plan  participants which relates to such verification requirements (for  example, employment reporting reminders or forms), and retirees must be  furnished such disclosure, whether through receipt of the above  communications or by special distribution, at least once every 12  months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Section 202(a)(3)(B) service--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Plans other than multiemployer  plans. In the case of a plan other than a multi-employer plan, as  defined in section 3(37) of the Act, the employment of an employee,  subsequent to the time the payment of benefits commenced or would have  commenced if the employee had not remained in or returned to employment,  results in section 203(a)(3)(B) service during a calendar month, or  during a four or five week payroll period ending in a calendar month, if  the employee, in such month or payroll period,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Completes 40 or more hours of service (as defined in 29 CFR  2530.200b-2(a)(1) and (2)) for an employer which maintains the plan,  including employers described in Sec. 2530.210 (d) and (e), as of the  time that the payment of benefits commenced or would have commenced if  the employee had not remained in or returned to employment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Receives from such employer payment for any such hours of  service performed on each of 8 or more days (or separate work shifts) in  such month or payroll period, Provided, That the plan has not for any  purpose determined or used the actual number of hours of service which  would be required to be credited to the employee under Sec. 2530.200b- (2)(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(a)</em>; in --An industry in which employees covered by the plan were employed and  accrued benefits under the plan as a result of such employment at the  time that the payment of benefits commenced or would have commenced if  the employee had not remained in or returned to employment, and --A trade or craft in which the employee was employed at any time under  the plan, and --The geographic area covered by the plan at the time that the payment  of benefits commenced or would have commenced if the employee had not  remained in or returned to employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Industry. The term ``industry'' means the business activities of  the types engaged in by any employers maintaining the plan.</p><p class="depth0">Example. One of the employers contributing to a multiemployer plan  engages in heavy construction, another in textile manufacturing, and  another in communications. Employee E began his career as an employee of  an employer engaged in heavy construction. Later E was employed by an  employer in communications. With both employers, E accrued benefits  under the plan. If E retires and then becomes reemployed in the same  trade or craft and in the same geographic area, employment by E in  either heavy construction, communications or textile manufacturing,  whether or not with an employer who contributes to the plan or in a  self-employed capacity, may be considered by the plan to be employment  in the same industry, assuming that employees covered by the plan were  accruing benefits as a result of employment in these industries at the  time E commenced receiving benefits. This is true even though E did not  previously accrue benefits as a result of employment with an employer  engaged in textile manufacturing because other employees covered by the  plan were employed in that industry and were accruing benefits under the  plan as a result of such employment at the time when benefit payments to  E commenced or would have commenced if E had not returned to employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, the determination whether a particular job  classification, job description or industrial occupation constitutes or  is included in a trade or craft shall be based upon the facts and  circumstances of each case. Factors which may be examined include  whether there is a customary and substantial period of practical, on- the-job training or a period of related supplementary instruction.  Notwithstanding any other factor, the registration of an apprenticeship  program with the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training of the Employment  Training Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor is sufficient  for the conclusion that a skill or skills which is the subject of the  apprenticeship program constitutes a trade or craft.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Participation in a multiemployer plan is limited solely to  electricians. Electrician E retired and then became reemployed as a  foreman of electricians. Because a ``trade or craft'' includes related  supervisory activities, E remains within his trade or craft for purposes  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Geographic area covered by the plan. (A) With the exception of  a plan covering employees in a maritime industry, the ``geographic area  covered by the plan'' consists of any state or any province of Canada in  which contributions were made or were required to be made by or on  behalf of an employer and the remainder of any Standard Metropolitan  Statistical Area (SMSA) which falls in part within such state,  determined as of the time that the payment of benefits commenced or  would have commenced if the employee had not returned to employment.</p><p class="depth0">Example. A multiemployer plan covers plumbers in Pennsylvania. All  contributing employers have always been located within Pennsylvania.  Accordingly, the ``geographic area covered by the plan'' consists of  Pennsylvania and any SMSAs which fall in part within Pennsylvania. Thus,  for example, in the case of the Philadelphia SMSA, Burlington, Camden  and Gloucester Counties in New Jersey are within the ``geographic area  covered by the plan''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> [Reserved--for definition of the geographic area covered by a  plan that   covers employees in a maritime industry.]   For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii), contributions shall not  include amounts contributed: After December 31, 1978 by or on hehalf of  an employer where no contributions were made by or on behalf of that  employer before that date, if the primary purpose of such contribution  is to allow for the suspension of plan benefits in a geographic area not  otherwise covered by the plan; or with respect to isolated projects  performed in states where plan participants were not otherwise employed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(B)</em> service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Suspendable amount--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Life annuity. In the case of benefits  payable periodically on a monthly basis for as long as a life (or lives)  continues, such as a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and  survivor annuity, a plan may provide that an amount not greater than the  portion of a monthly benefit payment derived from employer contributions  may be withheld permanently for a calendar month, or for a four or five  week payroll period ending in a calendar month, in which the employee is  employed in section 203(a)(3)(B) service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Other benefit forms. In the case of benefits payable in a form  other than the form described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, a  plan may provide for the permanent withholding of an amount of the  employer-derived portion of benefit payments for a calendar month, or  for a four or five week payroll period ending in a calendar month, in  which the employee is employed in section 203(a)(3)(B) service, not  exceeding the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of benefits which would have been payable to the  employee if he had been receiving monthly benefits under the plan since  actual retirement based on a single life annuity commencing at actual  retirement age; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.
