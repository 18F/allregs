                            <p class="depth0">Notwithstanding 5 CFR 2635.808(c)(1)(i), an employee of any separate  agency component listed in this section may, in a personal capacity,  personally solicit funds from a person who is a prohibited source if  person is a prohibited source for employees of the component only under  5 CFR 2635.203(d)(3) because the person conducts activities regulated by  the component:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Wage and Hour Division;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Occupational Safety and Health Administration;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Employee Benefits Security Administration;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Veterans' Employment and Training Service; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Remainder of the Department of Labor, as defined in  Sec. 5201.102(c).</p><p class="depth2">Example 1: A training official in the Mine Safety and Health  Administration is president of the local branch of her college alumni  association. The association is seeking used computers from local  businesses to upgrade the college's language lab. The employee may not  seek a contribution from the vice president of a mining company which is  regulated by MSHA. Even though the mining company is not currently under  investigation, it is a prohibited source for the employment because it  is subject to MSHA regulation and MSHA is not one of the agency  components designated as separate for the purpose of fundraising in a  personal capacity.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2: A typist in the Employee Benefits Security Administration  raises money for a local homeless shelter during his off-duty hours. He  may seek a contribution from a firm that is regulated by EBSA under the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act but may not seek contributions  from one that he knows is currently under investigation for a violation  of the Act. While firms regulated by an agency would ordinarily be  prohibited sources for purposes of an employee's fundraising in a  personal capacity, Sec. 5201.103 provides that employees of EBSA and the  other separate agency components listed in that section may seek  charitable contributions from an entity that is a prohibited source only  because its activities are subject to regulation by that separate agency  component. On the other hand, the employee may not engage in fundraising  from a person who he knows is a prohibited source for any other reason,  such as an ongoing enforcement action.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3: An employee of the Employment and Training Administration  may seek charitable contributions from a firm currently under  investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  (OSHA). ETA does not regulate this firm and has had no dealings or  business with it of any kind. Since ETA has been designated as a  separate agency under Sec. 5201.102, ETA employees need only consider  their own official duties and activities and those of ETA in determining  whether a person is a prohibited source for purposes of their  fundraising in a personal capacity. The fact that a person may be a  prohibited source of direct and indirect gifts for OSHA employees is not  relevant in this instance.
