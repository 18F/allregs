                            <p class="depth0">The cost of any bid bond or guaranty posted by a successful bidder  or of any performance bond or guaranty posted by a supplier is eligible  for financing under the implementing document, provided that the bond or  guaranty conforms to the requirements of the invitation for bids or the  contract, as applicable, and to the extent that the principal amount of  the bond or guaranty does not exceed the amount customary in  international trade for the type of transaction and commodity involved.  Bonds or guaranties may be payable in U.S. dollars, or a freely  convertible currency or local currency, and shall be posted in favor of  the purchaser. Nationality requirements for sureties, insurance  companies or banks who issue bonds or guaranties under USAID-financed  transactions are set forth in Sec. 228.38(b) of this chapter.
