If the withdrawal is oral, the inspector will confirm the withdrawal and the reasons for the withdrawal, in writing, within 20 days of oral notification of the withdrawal. Any person whose certificate has been withdrawn may appeal the decision, in writing within 10 days after receiving written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the certificate was wrongfully withdrawn. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. An appeal shall be granted or denied, in writing, as promptly as circumstances allow, and the reasons for the decision shall be stated. In a non-protected area, appeal shall be made to the Administrator. The Administrator shall adopt rules of practice for the hearing. The certificate will remain withdrawn pending decision of the appeal.
