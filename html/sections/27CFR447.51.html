                            <p class="depth0">Pursuant to agreement with the United States, certain foreign  countries are entitled to request certification of legality of  importation of articles on the U.S. Munitions Import List. Upon request  of a foreign government, the appropriate ATF officer will certify the  importation, on Form ITA-645P/ATF-4522/DSP53, for the U.S. importer.  Normally, the U.S. importer will submit this form at the time he applies  for an import permit. This document will serve as evidence to the   government of the exporting company that the U.S. importer has complied  with import regulations of the U.S. Government and is prohibited from  diverting, transshipping, or reexporting the material described therein  without the approval of the U.S. Government. Foreign governments may  also require documentation attesting to the delivery of the material  into the United States. When such delivery certification is requested by  a foreign government, the U.S. importer may obtain directly from the  U.S. District Director of Customs the authenticated Delivery  Verification Certificate (U.S. Department of Commerce Form ITA-647P) for  this purpose.  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  0625-0064)  [T.D. ATF-215, 50 FR 42162, Oct. 18, 1985, as amended by T.D. ATF-484,  67 FR 64526, Oct. 21, 2002]</p>
