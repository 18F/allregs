                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Under this part the original purpose of a loan is controlling.  In other words, if a loan originally is not for the purpose of  purchasing or carrying margin stock, changes in the collateral for the  loan do not change its exempted character.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> However, a so-called increase in the loan is necessarily on an  entirely different basis. So far as the purpose of the credit is  concerned, it is a new loan, and the question of whether or not it is  subject to this part must be determined accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> provides in  that whenever a lender is required to have its customer execute a  ``Statement of Purpose for an Extension of Credit Secured by Margin  Stock,'' the statement must be accepted by the lender ``acting in good  faith.'' The requirement of ``good faith'' is of vital importance here.  Its application will necessarily vary with the facts of the particular  case, but it is clear that the bank must be alert to the circumstances  surrounding the loan. For example, if the loan is to be made to a  customer who is not a broker or dealer in securities, but such a broker  or dealer is to deliver margin stock to secure the loan or is to receive  the proceeds of the loan, the bank would be put on notice that the loan  would probably be subject to this part. It could not accept in good  faith a statement to the contrary without obtaining a reliable and  satisfactory explanation of the situation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Furthermore, the purpose of a loan means just that. It cannot be  altered by some temporary application of   the proceeds. For example, if a borrower is to purchase Government  securities with the proceeds of a loan, but is soon thereafter to sell  such securities and replace them with margin stock, the loan is clearly  for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock.</p>
