The mortgage may be closed before the repair work is completed if the Secretary estimates that the cost of the remaining repair work will not exceed 15 percent of the maximum claim amount and the mortgage contains provisions approved by the Secretary concerning payment for the repairs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Role of mortgagee. The mortgagee shall cause one or more inspections of the property to be made by an inspector approved by the Secretary in order to ensure that the repair work is satisfactory, and prior to the release of funds for the repairs. The mortgagee shall hold back a portion of the contract price attributable to the work done before each interim release of funds, and the total of the hold backs will be released after the final inspection and approval of the release by the mortgagee. The mortgagee shall ensure that all mechanics' and materialmen's liens are released of record.
