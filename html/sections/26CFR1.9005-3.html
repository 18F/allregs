                            <p class="depth0">Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the period  within which the assessment of any deficiency attributable to the  election may be made, or within which the credit or refund of any  overpayment attributable to the election may be made, shall not expire  sooner than one year after the last day for making the election. Thus,  if assessment of a deficiency or credit or refund of an overpayment,  whichever is applicable, was not prevented on September 26, 1961, the  time for making assessment or credit or refund shall not expire for at  least one year after the last day for making the election. Even though  assessment of a deficiency was prevented on September 26, 1961, if  commencement of a suit for recovery of a refund under section 7405 of  the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 may have been made on such date, then  any deficiency resulting from the election may be assessed at any time  within one year after the last day for making the   election. If a taxpayer makes the election, he shall be deemed to have  consented to the application of the provisions of section 2 of the Act  extending the time for assessing a deficiency attributable to the  election. Section 2 of the Act does not shorten the period of  limitations otherwise applicable. An agreement may be entered into under  section 6501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and  corresponding provisions of prior law to extend the period for  assessment.  (Sec. 2(f), 75 Stat. 683; 26 U.S.C. 613 note)  [T.D. 6583, 26 FR 12079, Dec. 16, 1961]</p>
