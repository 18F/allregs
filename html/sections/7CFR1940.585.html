See Sec. 1940.552(b) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The criteria used in the basic formula are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> State's percentage of national rural population--50 percent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> State's percentage of national rural population with incomes below the poverty level--25 percent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> State's percentage of national nonmetropolitan unemployment--25 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Data source for each of these criterion is based on the latest census data available. Each criterion is assigned a specific weight according to its relevance in determining need. The percentage representing each criterion is multiplied by the weight factor and summed to arrive at a State factor (SF). The SF cannot exceed .05.
SF = (criterion (b)(1)(i) x 50 percent) + (criterion (b)(1)(ii) x 25 percent) + (criterion (b)(1)(iii) x 25 percent)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Basic formula allocation. See Sec. 1940.552(c) of this subpart. States receiving administrative allocations do not receive formula allocations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transition formula.
