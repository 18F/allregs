                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. (1) In order to facilitate continuity in its program and to provide accountability to citizens, each jurisdiction should submit its consolidated plan to HUD at least 45 days before the start of its program year. (But see Sec. 92.104 of this subtitle with respect to newly eligible jurisdictions under the HOME program.) With the exception of the August 16 date noted in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, HUD may grant a jurisdiction an extension of the submission deadline for good cause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In no event will HUD accept a submission earlier than November 15 or later than August 16 of the federal fiscal year for which the grant funds are appropriated. Failure to receive the plan by August 16 will automatically result in a loss of the CDBG funds to which the jurisdiction would otherwise be entitled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A jurisdiction may have a program year that coincides with the federal fiscal year (e.g., October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2006, for federal fiscal year 2006 funds). However, the consolidated plan may not be submitted earlier than November 15 of the federal fiscal year and HUD has the period specified in Sec. 91.500 to review the consolidated plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> See Sec. 91.20 for HUD field office authorization to grant exceptions to these provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Frequency of submission. (1) The summary of the citizen participation and consultation process, the action plan, and the certifications must be submitted on an annual basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The housing, and homeless needs assessment, market analysis, and strategic plan must be submitted at least once every five years, or as such time agreed upon by HUD and the jurisdiction in order to facilitate orderly program management, coordinate consolidated plans with time periods used for cooperation agreements, other plans, or the availability of data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A jurisdiction may make amendments that extend the time period covered by their plan if agreed upon by HUD.
