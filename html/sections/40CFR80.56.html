                                Sec. 80.56  Measurement methods for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde will be measured by drawing  exhaust samples from heated lines through either 2,4- Dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) impregnated cartridges or impingers filled  with solutions of DNPH in acetonitrile (ACN) as described in  Sec. Sec. 86.109 and 86.140 of this chapter for formaldehyde analysis.  Diluted exhaust sample volumes must be at least 15 L for impingers  containing 20 ml of absorbing solution (using more absorbing solution in  the impinger requires proportionally more gas sample to be taken) and at  least 4 L for cartridges. As required in Sec. 86.109 of this chapter,  two impingers or cartridges must be connected in series to detect  breakthrough of the first impinger or cartridge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition, sufficient sample must be drawn through the  collecting cartridges or impingers so that the measured quantity of  aldehyde is sufficiently greater than the minimum limit of quantitation  of the test method for at least a portion of the exhaust test procedure.  The limit of quantitation is determined using the technique defined in  Sec. 80.55(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each of the impinger samples are quantitatively transferred to a  25 mL volumetric flask (5 mL more than the sample impinger volume) and  brought to volume with ACN. The cartridge samples are eluted in reversed  direction by gravity feed with 6mL of ACN. The eluate is collected in a  graduated test tube and made up to the 5mL mark with ACN. Both the  impinger and cartridge samples must be analyzed by HPLC without  additional sample preparation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The analysis of the aldehyde derivatives collected is  accomplished with a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC).  Standards consisting of the hydrazone derivative of formaldehyde and  acetaldehyde are used to determine the response, repeatability, and  limit of quantitation of the HPLC method chosen for acetaldehyde and  formaldehyde.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Other sampling and analytical techniques will be allowed if they  can be proven to have equal specificity and equal or better limits of  quantitation. Data from alternative methods that can be demonstrated to  have equivalent or superior limits of detection, precision, and accuracy  may be accepted by the Administrator with individual prior approval.
