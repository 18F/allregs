                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Dependent. As used in this subpart, the term ``dependent''  denotes a person who bears one of the following relationships to his or  her sponsor:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A wife.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A husband if dependent on his sponsor for more than one-half of  his support.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An unmarried legitimate child, including an adopted or stepchild  who is dependent on the sponsor for over one-half of his or her support  and who either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has not passed the 21st birthday; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is incapable of self-support due to a physical or mental  incapacity that existed prior to reaching the age of 21; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Has not passed the 23rd birthday and is enrolled in a full- time course of study in an accredited institution of higher learning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Transfer to naval MTFs in the United States. Do not transfer  personnel covered in this subpart to the United States solely for the  purpose of obtaining medical care at naval MTFs. Consideration may be  given however, in special circumstances following laws of humanity or  principles of international courtesy. Transfer to naval MTFs in the  United States of such persons located outside the United States requires  approval of the Secretary of the Navy. Naval commands, therefore, should  not commit the Navy by a promise of treatment in the United States.  Approval generally will not be granted for treatment of those who suffer  from incurable afflictions, who require excessive nursing or custodial  care, or those who have adequate facilities in their own country. When a  request is received concerning transfer for treatment at a naval MTF in  the United States, the following procedures apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Forward the request to the Chief of Naval Operations (OP-61),  with a copy to the Commander, Naval Medical Command, Washington, DC  20372-5120 for administrative processing. Include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Patient's full name and grade or rate (if dependent, the  sponsor's name and grade or rate also).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Country of which a citizen.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Results of coordination with the chief of the diplomatic  mission of the country involved.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Medical report giving the history, diagnosis, clinical  findings, results of diagnostic tests and procedures, and all other  pertinent medical information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Availability or lack thereof of professional skills and adequacy  of facilities for treatment in the member's own country.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Who will assume financial responsibility for costs of  hospitalization and travel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Chief of Naval Operations (OP-61) will, if appropriate,  obtain State Department clearance and guidance and advise the Secretary  of the Navy accordingly. The Commander, Naval Medical Command will  furnish the Chief of Naval Operations information and recommendations  relative to the medical aspects and the name of the naval MTF with the  capability to provide required care. If approved, the Chief of Naval  Operations will furnish, through the chain of command, the commanding  officer of the designated naval MTF authorization for admission of the  beneficiary for treatment.</p>
