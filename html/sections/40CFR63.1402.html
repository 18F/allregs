For both continuous and batch unit operations, start-up does not include the recharging of equipment in batch operation. For continuous unit operations, start-up includes transitional conditions due to changes in product for flexible operation process units. For batch unit operations, start-up does not include transitional conditions due to changes in product for flexible operation process units.</p><p class="depth2">Steady-state conditions means that all variables (temperatures, pressures, volumes, flow rates, etc.) in a process do not vary significantly with time; minor fluctuations about constant mean values may occur.</p><p class="depth2">Storage vessel means a tank or other vessel that is used to store liquids that contain one or more organic HAP.

Air that is part of the vent stream as a result of the nature of the unit operation is not considered supplemental combustion air. Air required to operate combustion device burner(s) is not considered supplemental combustion air.</p><p class="depth2">Uncontrolled organic HAP emissions means the organic HAP emitted from a unit operation prior to introduction of the emission stream into a control device. Uncontrolled HAP emissions are determined after any condenser that is operating as a process condenser. If an emission stream is not routed to a control device, uncontrolled organic HAP emissions are those organic HAP emissions released to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth2">Vent stream, as used in reference to batch process vents, aggregate batch vent streams, continuous process vents, and storage vessels, means the emissions from that emission point.</p><p class="depth2">Waste management unit means the equipment, structure(s), and/or device(s) used to convey, store, treat, or dispose of wastewater streams or residuals.
