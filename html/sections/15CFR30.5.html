                            <p class="depth0">Prior to filing EEI, the USPPI or the authorized agent must be  certified to file through the AES. A service center shall be certified  to transmit electronically to the AES. The USPPI, authorized agent, or  service center may use a software package designed by a certified vendor  to file EEI through the AES. Once an authorized agent has successfully  completed the certification process, any USPPI using that agent does not  have to be certified. The certified authorized agent shall have a  properly executed power of attorney or written authorization from the  USPPI or FPPI, and be physically located in the United States to file  EEI through the AES. The USPPI or authorized agent that utilizes a  certified software vendor or service center shall complete certification  testing. Service centers may only transmit export information; they may  not prepare and file export information unless they have authorization  from the USPPI in the form of a power of attorney or written  authorization, thus making them authorized agents. The USPPI seeking  approval for postdeparture filing privileges shall be approved before  they or their authorized agent may file on a postdeparture basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> AES application process--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> AES Participation Application. The  USPPI or authorized agent who chooses to file through the AES and seek  approval for   postdeparture filing privileges, must submit a complete on-line LOI at  http://www.census.gov/aes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Certification process--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> AES certification process. The USPPI  or authorized agent shall perform an initial two-part communication test  to ascertain whether its system is capable of both transmitting data to,  and receiving data from, the AES. The USPPI or authorized agent shall  demonstrate specific system application capabilities. The capability to  correctly handle these system applications is the prerequisite to  certification for participation in the AES. The USPPI or authorized  agent shall successfully transmit the AES certification test. CBP's and/ or Census Bureau's client representatives provide assistance during  certification testing. These representatives make the sole determination  as to whether or not the USPPI or authorized agent qualifies for  certification. Upon successful completion of certification testing, the  USPPI's or authorized agent's status is moved from testing mode to  operational status. The AES filers may be required to repeat the  certification testing process at any time. The Census Bureau will  provide the AES filer with a certification notice after the USPPI or  authorized agent has been approved for operational status. The  certification notice will include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date that filers may begin transmitting data;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reporting instructions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Examples of the required AES proof of filing citations,  postdeparture filing citations, AES downtime filing citation, and  exemption legends.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> AESDirect certification process. To become certified for  AESDirect, filers shall demonstrate knowledge of this part and the  ability to successfully transmit EEI. Upon successful completion of the  certification testing, notification by e-mail will be sent to the  account administrator when an account is fully activated for filing via  AESDirect. Certified filers should print and retain the page  congratulating the filer on passing the test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Postdeparture filing approval process. Postdeparture filing is a  privilege granted to approved USPPIs for their EEI to be filed up to  five (5) calendar days after the date of export. The USPPI or its  authorized agent may not transmit EEI postdeparture for certain types of  shipments that are identified in Sec. 30.4(a). The USPPI may apply for  postdeparture filing privileges by submitting a postdeparture filing  application at www.census.gov/aes. An authorized agent may not apply on  behalf of a USPPI. The Census Bureau will distribute the applications  submitted by USPPI's who are applying for postdeparture to the CBP and  the other federal government partnership agencies for their review and  approval. Failure to meet the standards of the Census Bureau, CBP or any  of the partnership agencies is reason for denial of the AES applicant  for postdeparture filing privileges. Each partnership agency will  develop its own internal postdeparture filing acceptance standards, and  each agency will notify the Census Bureau of the USPPI's success or  failure to meet that agency's acceptance standards. Any partnership  agency may require additional information from USPPIs that are applying  for postdeparture filing. The Census Bureau will notify the USPPI of the  decision to either deny or approve its application for postdeparture  filing privileges within ninety (90) calendar days of receipt of the  postdeparture filing application by the Census Bureau.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Grounds for denial of postdeparture filing status. The Census  Bureau may deny a USPPI's application for postdeparture filing  privileges for any of the following reasons:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There is no history of filing for the USPPI through the AES.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The USPPI's volume of EEI reported through the AES does not  warrant participation in postdeparture filing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The USPPI or its authorized agent has failed to submit EEI  through the AES in a timely and accurate manner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The USPPI has a history of noncompliance with the Census Bureau  export regulations contained in this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The USPPI has been indicted, convicted, or is currently under  investigation for a felony involving a violation of federal export laws  or regulations and the Census Bureau has evidence of probable cause  supporting such violation, or the USPPI is in violation of Census Bureau  export regulations contained in this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The USPPI has made or caused to be made in the LOI a false or  misleading statement or omission with respect to any material fact.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The USPPI would pose a significant threat to national security  interests such that its participation in postdeparture filing should be  denied.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The USPPI has multiple violations of either the EAR (15 CFR  730 through 774) or the ITAR (22 CFR 120 through 130) within the last  three (3) years.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> The USPPI fails to demonstrate the ability to meet the AES  predeparture filing requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice of denial. A USPPI denied postdeparture filing privileges  by other agencies shall contact those agencies regarding the specific  reason(s) for nonselection and for their appeal procedures. A USPPI  denied postdeparture filing status by the Census Bureau will be provided  with a specific reason for nonselection and a Census Bureau point of  contact in an electronic notification letter. A USPPI may appeal the  Census Bureau's nonselection decision by following the appeal procedure  and reapplication procedure provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Revocation of postdeparture filing privileges--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Revocation by  the Census Bureau. The Census Bureau may revoke postdeparture filing  privileges of an approved USPPI for the following reasons:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The USPPI's volume of EEI reported in the AES does not warrant  continued participation in postdeparture filing;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The USPPI or its authorized agent has failed to submit EEI  through the AES in a timely and accurate manner;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The USPPI has made or caused to be made in the LOI a false or  misleading statement or omission with respect to material fact;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The USPPI submitting the LOI has been indicted, convicted, or is  currently under investigation for a felony involving a violation of  federal export laws or regulations and the Census Bureau has evidence of  probable cause supporting such violation, or the AES applicant is in  violation of export rules and regulations contained in this part;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The USPPI has failed to comply with existing export regulations  or has failed to pay any outstanding penalties assessed in connection  with such noncompliance; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> The USPPI would pose a significant threat to national security  interests such that its continued participation in postdeparture filing  should be terminated.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> The USPPI or its authorized agent files postdeparture for  commodities that are identified in Sec. 30.4(a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Revocation by other agencies. Any of the other agencies may  revoke a USPPI's postdeparture filing privileges with respect to  transactions subject to the jurisdiction of that agency. When doing so,  the agency shall notify both the Census Bureau and the USPPI whose  authorization is being revoked.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Notice of revocation. Approved postdeparture filing USPPIs whose  postdeparture filing privileges have been revoked by other agencies  shall contact those agencies for their specific revocation and appeal  procedures. When the Census Bureau makes a determination to revoke an  approved USPPI's postdeparture filing privileges, the USPPI will be  notified electronically of the reason(s) for the decision. In most  cases, the revocation shall become effective when the USPPI has either  exhausted all appeal procedures, or thirty (30) calendar days after  receipt of the notice of revocation, if no appeal is filed. However, in  cases judged to affect national security, revocations shall become  effective immediately upon notification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Appeal procedure. Any USPPI whose request for postdeparture  filing   privileges has been denied by the Census Bureau or whose postdeparture  filing privileges have been revoked by the Census Bureau may appeal the  decision by filing an appeal within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt  of the notice of decision. Appeals should be addressed to the Chief,  Foreign Trade Division, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC 20233-6700.  The Census Bureau will issue a written decision to the USPPI within  thirty (30) calendar days from the date of receipt of the appeal by the  Census Bureau. If a written decision is not issued within thirty (30)  calendar days, the Census Bureau will forward to the USPPI a notice of  extension within that time period. The USPPI will be provided with the  reasons for the extension of this time period and an expected date of  decision. The USPPIs who have had their postdeparture filing status  denied or revoked may not reapply for this privilege for one year  following written notification of the denial or revocation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Electronic Export Information filing standards. The data  elements required for filing EEI are contained in Sec. 30.6. When  filing EEI, the USPPI or authorized agent shall comply with the data  transmission procedures determined by CBP and the Census Bureau and  shall agree to stay in complete compliance with all export rules and  regulations in this part. Failure of the USPPI or the authorized agent  of either the USPPI or FPPI to comply with these requirements  constitutes a violation of the regulations in this part, and renders  such principal party or the authorized agent subject to the penalties  provided for in Subpart H of this part. In the case of AESDirect, when  submitting a registration form to AESDirect, the registering company is  certifying that it will be in compliance with all applicable export  rules and regulations. This includes complying with the following  security requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> AESDirect user names and passwords are to be kept secure by the  account administrator and not disclosed to any unauthorized user or any  persons outside the registered company.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Registered companies are responsible for those persons having a  user name and password. If an employee with a user name and password  leaves the company or otherwise is no longer an authorized user, the  company shall immediately deactivate that username in the system to  ensure the integrity and confidentiality of Title 13 data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Antivirus software shall be installed and set to run  automatically on all computers that access AESDirect. All AESDirect  registered companies will maintain subscriptions with their antivirus  software vendor to keep antivirus lists current. Registered companies  are responsible for performing full scans of these systems on a regular  basis, but not less than every thirty (30) days, to ensure the  elimination of any virus contamination. If the registered company's  computer system is infected with a virus, the company shall contact the  Census Bureau's Foreign Trade Division Computer Security Officer and  refrain from using AESDirect until it is virus free. Failure to comply  with these requirements will result in immediate loss of privilege to  use AESDirect until the registered company can establish to the  satisfaction of the Census Bureau's Foreign Trade Division Computer  Security Officer that the company's computer systems accessing AESDirect  are virus free.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Monitoring the filing of EEI. The USPPI's or the authorized  agent's AES filings will be monitored and reviewed for quality,  timeliness, and coverage. The Census Bureau will provide performance  reports to USPPIs and authorized agents who file EEI. The Census Bureau  will take appropriate action to correct specific situations where the  USPPI or authorized agent fails to maintain acceptable levels of data  quality, timeliness, or coverage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Support. The Census Bureau provides online services that allow  the USPPI and the authorized agent to seek assistance pertaining to AES  and this part. For AES assistance, filers may send an e-mail to  ASKAES@census.gov and for FTR assistance, filers may send an e-mail to  FTDREGS@census.gov. AESDirect is supported by a help desk available  twelve (12) hours a day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. EST, seven (7) days a  week. Filers can obtain contact information   from the Web site http://www.aesdirect.gov.  [73 FR 31555, June 2, 2008, as amended at 78 FR 16376, Mar. 14, 2013]</p>
