                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Repurchase by lender. The lender has the option to repurchase  the loan from a holder within 30 days of written demand from the holder  when the borrower is in default not less than 60 days on payment. The  repurchase will be for an amount equal to the unpaid guaranteed portion  of principal and accrued interest less the lender's servicing fee. The  guarantee does not cover the note interest to the holder on the  guaranteed loan accruing after 90 days from the date of the demand  letter to the lender. The holder will concurrently send a copy of the  demand to the Agency. The lender will accept an assignment without  recourse from the holder upon repurchase. The lender is encouraged to  repurchase the loan to facilitate the accounting of funds, resolve the  problem, and permit the borrower to cure the default, where reasonable.  The lender will notify the holder and the Agency of its decision within  30 days of receipt of demand from the holder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agency repurchase. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the lender does not repurchase as  provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the Agency will purchase from  the holder the unpaid principal balance of the guaranteed portion  together with accrued interest to date of repurchase (less the lender's  servicing fee) within 30 days after written demand to the Agency. The  guarantee will not cover the note interest to the holder on the  guaranteed loan accruing after 90 days from the date of the original  demand letter. The lender shall not charge the Agency any servicing fees  nor are any such fees collectible from the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The holder's demand to the Agency must include a copy of the  written demand made upon the lender. The holder or duly authorized agent  must also include evidence of the right to require payment from the  Agency. Such evidence will consist of either the original of the Loan  Note Guarantee properly endorsed to the Agency or the original of the  Assignment Guarantee Agreement properly assigned to the Agency without  recourse including all rights, title, and interest in the loan. The  Agency will be subrogated to all rights of the holder. The holder must  include in the demand the amount due including unpaid principal, unpaid  interest to date of demand, and interest subsequently accruing from the  date of demand to the proposed payment date. Unless otherwise agreed to  by the Agency, such proposed payment will not be later than 30 days from  the date of demand.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The lender must promptly provide the Agency with the information  necessary for the Agency's determination of the appropriate amount due  the holder upon the Agency's notification to the lender of the holder's  demand for payment. This information must be certified by an authorized  officer of the lender. Any discrepancy between the amount claimed by the  holder and the information submitted by the lender must be resolved  before payment will be approved. The Agency will notify both parties and  such conflict will suspend the running of the 30-day payment  requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any purchase by the Agency does not change, alter, or modify any  of the lender's obligations to the Agency arising from the loan or  guarantee nor does it waive any of the Agency's rights against the  lender. The Agency may set off against the lender all rights inuring to  the Agency as the holder of the instrument against the Agency's  obligation to the lender under the Loan Note Guarantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Repurchase for servicing. When the lender determines that  repurchase of the guaranteed portion of the loan is necessary to service  the loan, the holder must sell the guaranteed portion to the lender for  the unpaid principal and interest balance (less the lender's servicing  fee). The guarantee does not cover interest accruing after 90 days from  the date the lender's or Agency's letter requesting the holder to tender  its guaranteed portion. The lender must not repurchase from the holder  for arbitrage purposes to further its own financial gain. Any repurchase  must be made only after the lender obtains the Agency written approval.  If the lender does not repurchase the portion from the holder, the  Agency may, at its option, purchase such guaranteed portion for  servicing purposes.    Sec. 3575.79  [Reserved]</p>
