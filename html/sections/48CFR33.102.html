                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Without regard to the protest venue, contracting officers shall  consider all protests and seek legal advice, whether protests are  submitted before   or after award and whether filed directly with the agency, the  Government Accountability Office (GAO), or the U.S. Court of Federal  Claims. (See 19.302 for protests of small business status, 19.305 for  protests of disadvantaged business status, 19.306 for protests of  HUBZone small business status, and 19.307 for protests of service- disabled veteran-owned small business status, and 19.308 for protests of  the status of an economically disadvantaged women-owned small business  concern or of a women-owned small business concern eligible under the  Women-Owned Small Business Program.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If, in connection with a protest, the head of an agency  determines that a solicitation, proposed award, or award does not comply  with the requirements of law or regulation, the head of the agency may--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Take any action that could have been recommended by the  Comptroller General had the protest been filed with the Government  Accountability Office;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pay appropriate costs as stated in 33.104(h);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Require the awardee to reimburse the Government's costs, as  provided in this paragraph, where a postaward protest is sustained as  the result of an awardee's intentional or negligent misstatement,  misrepresentation, or miscertification. In addition to any other remedy  available, and pursuant to the requirements of Subpart 32.6, the  Government may collect this debt by offsetting the amount against any  payment due the awardee under any contract between the awardee and the  Government.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When a protest is sustained by GAO under circumstances that may  allow the Government to seek reimbursement for protest costs, the  contracting officer will determine whether the protest was sustained  based on the awardee's negligent or intentional misrepresentation. If  the protest was sustained on several issues, protest costs shall be  apportioned according to the costs attributable to the awardee's  actions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The contracting officer shall review the amount of the debt,  degree of the awardee's fault, and costs of collection, to determine  whether a demand for reimbursement ought to be made. If it is in the  best interests of the Government to seek reimbursement, the contracting  officer shall notify the contractor in writing of the nature and amount  of the debt, and the intention to collect by offset if necessary. Prior  to issuing a final decision, the contracting officer shall afford the  contractor an opportunity to inspect and copy agency records pertaining  to the debt to the extent permitted by statute and regulation, and to  request review of the matter by the head of the contracting activity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When appropriate, the contracting officer shall also refer the  matter to the agency debarment official for consideration under Subpart  9.4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 1558, with respect to any protest  filed with the GAO, if the funds available to the agency for a contract  at the time a protest is filed in connection with a solicitation for,  proposed award of, or award of such a contract would otherwise expire,  such funds shall remain available for obligation for 100 days after the  date on which the final ruling is made on the protest. A ruling is  considered final on the date on which the time allowed for filing an  appeal or request for reconsideration has expired, or the date on which  a decision is rendered on such appeal or request, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Protest likely after award. The contracting officer may stay  performance of a contract within the time period contained in  33.104(c)(1) if the contracting officer makes a written determination  that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A protest is likely to be filed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Delay of performance is, under the circumstances, in the best  interests of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An interested party wishing to protest is encouraged to seek  resolution within the agency (see 33.103) before filing a protest with  the GAO, but may protest to the GAO in accordance with GAO regulations  (4 CFR part 21).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> No person may file a protest at GAO for a procurement integrity  violation unless that person reported to the contracting officer the  information constituting evidence of the violation within 14 days after  the person first   discovered the possible violation (41 U.S.C. 2106).
