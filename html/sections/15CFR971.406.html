                            <p class="depth0">Before issuing or transferring a commercial recovery permit, the  Administrator must find that the commercial recovery proposed in the  application cannot reasonably be expected to result in a significant  adverse environmental effect, taking into account the analyses and  information in any applicable EIS and any TCRs associated with the  permit. This finding also will be based upon the requirements in subpart  F. However, as also noted in subpart F, if a determination on this  question cannot be made on the basis of available information, and it is  found that irreparable harm will not occur during a period when an  approved monitoring program is undertaken to further examine the  significant adverse environmental effect issue, a permit may be granted,  subject to modification or suspension and, if necessary and appropriate,  revocation pursuant to Sec. 971.417(a), or subject to emergency  suspension pursuant to Sec. 971.417(h).</p>
