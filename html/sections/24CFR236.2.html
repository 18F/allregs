The increased distributions will be limited  to a maximum amount based on market rents and calculated according to  HUD instructions. Funds that the mortgagor is authorized to retain under  section 236(g)(2) of the National Housing Act are not considered  distributions to the mortgagor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pre-emption. Any State or local law or regulation that restricts  distributions to an amount lower than permitted by subpart A of this  part as in effect immediately before May 1, 1996, contained in the April  1, 1995 edition of 24 CFR, parts 220 to 499, or permitted by the  Commissioner under this section is preempted to the extent provided by  section 524(f) of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and  Affordability Act of 1997.
