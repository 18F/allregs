                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Participants are to obtain or contract for materials or  services as needed to install BMPs. Federal Cost-share payments are to  be made by the administering agency upon certification by the District  Conservationist, NRCS, or its designee, that the BMPs, or an  identifiable unit thereof, have been properly carried out and meet the  appropriate standards and specifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payment maximum. The maximum total Federal cost-share payment to  a participant shall be limited to $50,000. Exceptions to this limit may  be made by the administering agency with concurrence of the  Administrator, NRCS, upon recommedation of the NRCWCC, where it  determines that the main benefits to be derived are essential for  meeting the water quality objectives in the project area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Basis for cost-share payment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cost-share payments are to be  made by the administering agency at the cost-share percentage and by one  of the following methods designated by the administering agency and set  out in the contract:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Average cost, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Actual cost not to exceed average cost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the average cost at the time of starting the installation of  a BMP or identifiable unit is less than the costs specified in the  contract, payment is to be at the lower rate. If the costs at the start  of installation are higher, payment may be made at the higher rate. A  modification will be necessary if the higher cost results in a  significant increase in the total cost-share obligation. Cost-share  payment is not to be made until the modification reflecting the increase  is approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Average cost development. Average costs are to be developed by  the administering agency for each project using cost data from the local  area. These costs should be reviewed by the SRCWCC for consistency with  average costs in other USDA programs. The average cost list is to be  updated annually by the administering agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Application for payment. Cost-share payments can be made by the  administering agency after a participant has carried out a BMP or an  identifiable unit of a BMP. Application for payment must be submitted to  the administering agency, be certified by the NRCS or its designee, and  be supported by such cost receipts as are required by the administering  agency. It is the participant's responsibility to apply for payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Authorizations for payments to suppliers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contract may  authorize that part or all of the Federal cost share for a BMP or an  identifiable unit be made directly to suppliers of materials or  services. The materials or services must be delivered or performed  before payment is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Federal cost shares will not be in excess of the cost share  attributable to the material or service used or not in   excess of the cost share for all identifiable units as may be requested  by the participant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Material inspection and analysis. When authorizations for  payments to suppliers are specified, the administering agency, its  representatives, or the Government reserve the right to inspect, sample,  and analyze materials or services prior to their use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Assignments, set-offs, and claims. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A State or local  administering agency may allow the assignment of payments to the extent  provided by State law. When ASCS is designated as the administering  agency, assignments by any participant who may be entitled to cost-share  payment under the program are prohibited unless they are made in  accordance with the provisions of section 203, Title 31, U.S.C., as  amended, and section 15, Title 41, U.S.C., as amended.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If any participant to whom compensation is payable under RCWP is  indebted to the United States and such indebtedness is listed on the  county register of indebtedness maintained by the County ASC committee,  the compensation due the participant must be used (set-off) to reduce  that idebtedness. Indebtedness to USDA is to be given first  consideration. Deductions for setoffs involving a nonresident alien  shall be made as provided by 26 U.S.C. 871. Setoffs made pursuant to  this section are not to deprive the participant of any right to contest  the justness of the indebtedness involved, either by administrative  appeal or by legal action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any cost-share payment due any participant shall be allowed  without deduction of claims for advances except as provided for above  and without regard to any claim or lien against any crop, or proceeds  thereof, in favor of the participant or any other creditor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Access to land unit and records. Any authorized administering  agency, or NRCS employees or agents, shall have the right of access at  reasonable times to land under application or contract, and the right to  examine any program records to ascertain the accuracy of any  representations made in the application or contract. This is limited to  the right to furnish technical assistance and to inspect work performed  under the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Suspension of payments. No cost-share payments will be made  pending a decision on whether or not a contract violation has occurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Ineligible payments. The filing of requests for payment for  BMP's not carried out, or for BMP's carried out in such a manner that  they do not meet contract specifications, constitutes a violation of the  contract.</p>
