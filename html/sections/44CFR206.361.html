                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may make a Community Disaster Loan to any local government which has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues as a result of a major disaster and which demonstrates a need for Federal financial assistance in order to perform its governmental functions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amount of loan. The amount of the loan is based upon need, not to exceed 25 percent of the operating budget of the local government for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurs, but shall not exceed $5 million. The term fiscal year as used in this subpart means the local government's fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interest rate. The interest rate is the rate for five year maturities as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in effect on the date that the Promissory Note is executed. This rate is from the monthly Treasury schedule of certified interest rates which takes into consideration the current average yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States, adjusted to the nearest \1/8\ percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time limitation. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may approve a loan in either the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred or the fiscal year immediately following that year. Only one loan may be approved under section 417(a) for any local government as the result of a single disaster.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Term of loan. The term of the loan is 5 years, unless otherwise extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may consider requests for an extensions of loans based on the local government's financial condition. The total term of any loan under section 417(a) normally may not exceed 10 years from the date the Promissory Note was executed. However, when extenuating circumstances exist and the Community Disaster Loan recipient demonstrates an inability to repay the loan within the initial 10 years, but agrees to repay such loan over an extended period of time, additional time may be provided for loan repayment. (See Sec. 206.367(c).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Use of loan funds. The local government shall use the loaned funds to carry on existing local government functions of a municipal operation character or to expand such functions to meet disaster-related needs. The funds shall not be used to finance capital improvements nor the repair or restoration of damaged public facilities. Neither the loan nor any cancelled portion of the loans may be used as the nonFederal share of any Federal program, including those under the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Cancellation. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall cancel repayment of all or part of a Community Disaster

Loan to the extent that he/she determines that revenues of the local government during the 3 fiscal years following the disaster are insufficient to meet the operating budget of that local government because of disaster-related revenue losses and additional unreimbursed disaster-related municipal operating expenses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Relation to other assistance. Any community disaster loans including cancellations made under this subpart shall not reduce or otherwise affect any commitments, grants, or other assistance under the Act or these regulations.
