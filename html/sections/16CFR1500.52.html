A suggested contact mechanism appears in figure 1 of Sec. 1500.51.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Loading device. The loading device shall be a scale or force gauge having an accuracy of 0.5 pound (225 grams).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Testing procedure. The test article shall be placed in the contact mechanism in any reasonable position for a penetration of 0.25 to 0.5 inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters), which position utilizes less than 180 degrees of the arc of the contact mechanism, and a test load increasing to 50 pounds 0.5 pound (22.74 kilograms) shall be evenly applied within 5 seconds. This load shall be maintained for an additional 10 seconds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Flexure test--(1) Application. This test shall be applied to each component of a toy containing metal wire(s), or other metal material(s), for stiffening or for retention of form if the component can be bent through a 60-degree arc by a maximum force of 15 pounds 0.5 pound (6.80 kilograms) applied perpendicularly to the major axis of the component at a point 2 inches 0.05 inch (5 centimeters) from the intersection of the component with the main body of the toy or at the end of the component if the component is less than 2 inches 0.05 inch (5 centimeters) long.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Testing procedure. The toy shall be secured in a vise equipped with vise shields that are fabricated from 13-gauge cold-rolled steel or other similar material and that have a 0.375-inch (0.95-centimeter) inside radius. The

component shall then be bent through a 60-degree arc by a force applied at a point on the component 2 inches 0.05 inch (5 centimeters) from the intersection of the component with the main body of the toy or applied at the end of the component if the component is less than 2 inches (5 centimeters) long. The component shall then be bent in the reverse direction through a 120-degree arc. This process shall be repeated for 30 cycles at a rate of one cycle per two seconds with a 60-second rest period occurring after each 10 cycles. Two 120-degree arc bends shall constitute one cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Torque test--(1) Application--(i) General. A toy with a projection, part, or assembly that a child can grasp with at least the thumb and forefinger or the teeth shall be subject to this test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Toys with rotating components. Projections, parts, or assemblies that are rigidly mounted on an accessible rod or shaft designed to rotate along with the projections, parts, or assemblies shall be tested with the rod or shaft clamped to prevent rotation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Test equipment--(i) Loading device. The loading device shall be a torque gauge, torque wrench, or other appropriate device having an accuracy of 0.2 inch-pound (0.23 kilogram-centimeter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Clamp.
