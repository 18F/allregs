Before an  applicant may request a postponement of the second examination to a date  that is more than 90 days after the initial examination, the applicant  must agree in writing to waive the requirement under section 336 of the  Act that the Service must render a determination on the application  within 120 days from the initial interview, and instead to permit the  Service to render a decision within 120 days from the second interview.
