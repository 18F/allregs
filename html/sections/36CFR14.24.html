Where the husband and the wife are native born and a statement to that effect is made, additional information as to the marital status is not required. In other cases, a married woman or widow must show the date of her marriage; a widow must show, in addition, the date of the death of her husband.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Association of Individuals.
