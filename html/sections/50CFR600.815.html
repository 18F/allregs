                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Mandatory contents--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Description and identification of EFH-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Overview. FMPs must describe and identify EFH in text that clearly  states the habitats or habitat types determined to be EFH for each life  stage of the managed species. FMPs should explain the physical,  biological, and chemical characteristics of EFH and, if known, how these  characteristics influence the use of EFH by the species/life stage. FMPs  must identify the specific geographic location or extent of habitats  described as EFH. FMPs must include maps of the geographic locations of  EFH or the geographic boundaries within which EFH for each species and  life stage is found.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Habitat information by life stage. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Councils need basic  information to understand the usage of various habitats by each managed  species. Pertinent information includes the geographic range and habitat  requirements by life stage, the distribution and characteristics of  those habitats, and current and historic stock size as it affects  occurrence in available habitats. FMPs should summarize the life history  information necessary to understand each species' relationship to, or  dependence on, its various habitats, using text, tables, and figures, as  appropriate. FMPs should document patterns of temporal and spatial  variation in the distribution of each major life   stage (defined by developmental and functional shifts) to aid in  understanding habitat needs. FMPs should summarize (e.g., in tables) all  available information on environmental and habitat variables that  control or limit distribution, abundance, reproduction, growth,  survival, and productivity of the managed species. The information  should be supported with citations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Councils should obtain information to describe and identify EFH  from the best available sources, including peer-reviewed literature,  unpublished scientific reports, data files of government resource  agencies, fisheries landing reports, and other sources of information.  Councils should consider different types of information according to its  scientific rigor. FMPs should identify species-specific habitat data  gaps and deficits in data quality (including considerations of scale and  resolution; relevance; and potential biases in collection and  interpretation). FMPs must demonstrate that the best scientific  information available was used in the description and identification of  EFH, consistent with national standard 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Analysis of habitat information. (A) The following approach  should be used to organize the information necessary to describe and  identify EFH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Level 1: Distribution data are available for some or all  portions of the geographic range of the species. At this level, only  distribution data are available to describe the geographic range of a  species (or life stage). Distribution data may be derived from  systematic presence/absence sampling and/or may include information on  species and life stages collected opportunistically. In the event that  distribution data are available only for portions of the geographic area  occupied by a particular life stage of a species, habitat use can be  inferred on the basis of distributions among habitats where the species  has been found and on information about its habitat requirements and  behavior. Habitat use may also be inferred, if appropriate, based on  information on a similar species or another life stage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Level 2: Habitat-related densities of the species are available.  At this level, quantitative data (i.e., density or relative abundance)  are available for the habitats occupied by a species or life stage.  Because the efficiency of sampling methods is often affected by habitat  characteristics, strict quality assurance criteria should be used to  ensure that density estimates are comparable among methods and habitats.  Density data should reflect habitat utilization, and the degree that a  habitat is utilized is assumed to be indicative of habitat value. When  assessing habitat value on the basis of fish densities in this manner,  temporal changes in habitat availability and utilization should be  considered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Level 3: Growth, reproduction, or survival rates within habitats  are available. At this level, data are available on habitat-related  growth, reproduction, and/or survival by life stage. The habitats  contributing the most to productivity should be those that support the  highest growth, reproduction, and survival of the species (or life  stage).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Level 4: Production rates by habitat are available. At this  level, data are available that directly relate the production rates of a  species or life stage to habitat type, quantity, quality, and location.  Essential habitats are those necessary to maintain fish production  consistent with a sustainable fishery and the managed species'  contribution to a healthy ecosystem.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Councils should strive to describe habitat based on the highest  level of detail (i.e., Level 4). If there is no information on a given  species or life stage, and habitat usage cannot be inferred from other  means, such as information on a similar species or another life stage,  EFH should not be designated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> EFH determination. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Councils should analyze available  ecological, environmental, and fisheries information and data relevant  to the managed species, the habitat requirements by life stage, and the  species' distribution and habitat usage to describe and identify EFH.  The information described in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this  section will allow Councils to assess the relative value of habitats.  Councils should interpret this information in a risk-averse fashion to  ensure adequate areas are identified as EFH for managed species. Level 1  information, if available, should be used to identify the geographic  range of the species at   each life stage. If only Level 1 information is available, distribution  data should be evaluated (e.g., using a frequency of occurrence or other  appropriate analysis) to identify EFH as those habitat areas most  commonly used by the species. Level 2 through 4 information, if  available, should be used to identify EFH as the habitats supporting the  highest relative abundance; growth, reproduction, or survival rates;  and/or production rates within the geographic range of a species. FMPs  should explain the analyses conducted to distinguish EFH from all  habitats potentially used by a species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> FMPs must describe EFH in text, including reference to the  geographic location or extent of EFH using boundaries such as longitude  and latitude, isotherms, isobaths, political boundaries, and major  landmarks. If there are differences between the descriptions of EFH in  text, maps, and tables, the textual description is ultimately  determinative of the limits of EFH. Text and tables should explain  pertinent physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of EFH for  the managed species and explain any variability in habitat usage  patterns, but the boundaries of EFH should be static.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If a species is overfished and habitat loss or degradation may  be contributing to the species being identified as overfished, all  habitats currently used by the species may be considered essential in  addition to certain historic habitats that are necessary to support  rebuilding the fishery and for which restoration is technologically and  economically feasible. Once the fishery is no longer considered  overfished, the EFH identification should be reviewed and amended, if  appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Areas described as EFH will normally be greater than or equal to  aquatic areas that have been identified as ``critical habitat'' for any  managed species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered  Species Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Ecological relationships among species and between the species  and their habitat require, where possible, that an ecosystem approach be  used in determining the EFH of a managed species. EFH must be designated  for each managed species, but, where appropriate, may be designated for  assemblages of species or life stages that have similar habitat needs  and requirements. If grouping species or using species assemblages for  the purpose of designating EFH, FMPs must include a justification and  scientific rationale. The extent of the EFH should be based on the  judgment of the Secretary and the appropriate Council(s) regarding the  quantity and quality of habitat that are necessary to maintain a  sustainable fishery and the managed species' contribution to a healthy  ecosystem.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> If degraded or inaccessible aquatic habitat has contributed to  reduced yields of a species or assemblage and if, in the judgment of the  Secretary and the appropriate Council(s), the degraded conditions can be  reversed through such actions as improved fish passage techniques (for  stream or river blockages), improved water quality measures (removal of  contaminants or increasing flows), and similar measures that are  technologically and economically feasible, EFH should include those  habitats that would be necessary to the species to obtain increased  yields.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> EFH mapping requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> FMPs must include maps that  display, within the constraints of available information, the geographic  locations of EFH or the geographic boundaries within which EFH for each  species and life stage is found. Maps should identify the different  types of habitat designated as EFH to the extent possible. Maps should  explicitly distinguish EFH from non-EFH areas. Councils should confer  with NMFS regarding mapping standards to ensure that maps from different  Councils can be combined and shared efficiently and effectively.  Ultimately, data used for mapping should be incorporated into a  geographic information system (GIS) to facilitate analysis and  presentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Where the present distribution or stock size of a species or  life stage is different from the historical distribution or stock size,  then maps of historical habitat boundaries should be included in the  FMP, if known.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> FMPs should include maps of any habitat areas of particular  concern   identified under paragraph (a)(8) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fishing activities that may adversely affect EFH--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Evaluation. Each FMP must contain an evaluation of the potential adverse  effects of fishing on EFH designated under the FMP, including effects of  each fishing activity regulated under the FMP or other Federal FMPs.  This evaluation should consider the effects of each fishing activity on  each type of habitat found within EFH. FMPs must describe each fishing  activity, review and discuss all available relevant information (such as  information regarding the intensity, extent, and frequency of any  adverse effect on EFH; the type of habitat within EFH that may be  affected adversely; and the habitat functions that may be disturbed),  and provide conclusions regarding whether and how each fishing activity  adversely affects EFH. The evaluation should also consider the  cumulative effects of multiple fishing activities on EFH. The evaluation  should list any past management actions that minimize potential adverse  effects on EFH and describe the benefits of those actions to EFH. The  evaluation should give special attention to adverse effects on habitat  areas of particular concern and should identify for possible designation  as habitat areas of particular concern any EFH that is particularly  vulnerable to fishing activities. Additionally, the evaluation should  consider the establishment of research closure areas or other measures  to evaluate the impacts of fishing activities on EFH. In completing this  evaluation, Councils should use the best scientific information  available, as well as other appropriate information sources. Councils  should consider different types of information according to its  scientific rigor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Minimizing adverse effects. Each FMP must minimize to the  extent practicable adverse effects from fishing on EFH, including EFH  designated under other Federal FMPs. Councils must act to prevent,  mitigate, or minimize any adverse effects from fishing, to the extent  practicable, if there is evidence that a fishing activity adversely  affects EFH in a manner that is more than minimal and not temporary in  nature, based on the evaluation conducted pursuant to paragraph  (a)(2)(i) of this section and/or the cumulative impacts analysis  conducted pursuant to paragraph (a)(5) of this section. In such cases,  FMPs should identify a range of potential new actions that could be  taken to address adverse effects on EFH, include an analysis of the  practicability of potential new actions, and adopt any new measures that  are necessary and practicable. Amendments to the FMP or to its  implementing regulations must ensure that the FMP continues to minimize  to the extent practicable adverse effects on EFH caused by fishing. FMPs  must explain the reasons for the Council's conclusions regarding the  past and/or new actions that minimize to the extent practicable the  adverse effects of fishing on EFH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Practicability. In determining whether it is practicable to  minimize an adverse effect from fishing, Councils should consider the  nature and extent of the adverse effect on EFH and the long and short- term costs and benefits of potential management measures to EFH,  associated fisheries, and the nation, consistent with national standard  7. In determining whether management measures are practicable, Councils  are not required to perform a formal cost/benefit analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Options for managing adverse effects from fishing. Fishery  management options may include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Fishing equipment restrictions. These options may include, but  are not limited to: seasonal and areal restrictions on the use of  specified equipment, equipment modifications to allow escapement of  particular species or particular life stages (e.g., juveniles),  prohibitions on the use of explosives and chemicals, prohibitions on  anchoring or setting equipment in sensitive areas, and prohibitions on  fishing activities that cause significant damage to EFH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Time/area closures. These actions may include, but are not  limited to: closing areas to all fishing or specific equipment types  during spawning, migration, foraging, and nursery activities and  designating zones for use as   marine protected areas to limit adverse effects of fishing practices on  certain vulnerable or rare areas/species/life stages, such as those  areas designated as habitat areas of particular concern.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Harvest limits. These actions may include, but are not limited  to, limits on the take of species that provide structural habitat for  other species assemblages or communities and limits on the take of prey  species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Non-Magnuson-Stevens Act fishing activities that may adversely  affect EFH. FMPs must identify any fishing activities that are not  managed under the Magnuson-Stevens Act that may adversely affect EFH.  Such activities may include fishing managed by state agencies or other  authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Non-fishing related activities that may adversely affect EFH.  FMPs must identify activities other than fishing that may adversely  affect EFH. Broad categories of such activities include, but are not  limited to: dredging, filling, excavation, mining, impoundment,  discharge, water diversions, thermal additions, actions that contribute  to non-point source pollution and sedimentation, introduction of  potentially hazardous materials, introduction of exotic species, and the  conversion of aquatic habitat that may eliminate, diminish, or disrupt  the functions of EFH. For each activity, the FMP should describe known  and potential adverse effects to EFH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Cumulative impacts analysis. Cumulative impacts are impacts on  the environment that result from the incremental impact of an action  when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future  actions, regardless of who undertakes such actions. Cumulative impacts  can result from individually minor, but collectively significant actions  taking place over a period of time. To the extent feasible and  practicable, FMPs should analyze how the cumulative impacts of fishing  and non-fishing activities influence the function of EFH on an ecosystem  or watershed scale. An assessment of the cumulative and synergistic  effects of multiple threats, including the effects of natural stresses  (such as storm damage or climate-based environmental shifts) and an  assessment of the ecological risks resulting from the impact of those  threats on EFH, also should be included.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Conservation and enhancement. FMPs must identify actions to  encourage the conservation and enhancement of EFH, including recommended  options to avoid, minimize, or compensate for the adverse effects  identified pursuant to paragraphs (a)(3) through (5) of this section,  especially in habitat areas of particular concern.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Prey species. Loss of prey may be an adverse effect on EFH and  managed species because the presence of prey makes waters and substrate  function as feeding habitat, and the definition of EFH includes waters  and substrate necessary to fish for feeding. Therefore, actions that  reduce the availability of a major prey species, either through direct  harm or capture, or through adverse impacts to the prey species' habitat  that are known to cause a reduction in the population of the prey  species, may be considered adverse effects on EFH if such actions reduce  the quality of EFH. FMPs should list the major prey species for the  species in the fishery management unit and discuss the location of prey  species' habitat. Adverse effects on prey species and their habitats may  result from fishing and non-fishing activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Identification of habitat areas of particular concern. FMPs  should identify specific types or areas of habitat within EFH as habitat  areas of particular concern based on one or more of the following  considerations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The importance of the ecological function provided by the  habitat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The extent to which the habitat is sensitive to human-induced  environmental degradation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether, and to what extent, development activities are, or  will be, stressing the habitat type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The rarity of the habitat type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Research and information needs. Each FMP should contain  recommendations, preferably in priority order, for research efforts that  the Councils and NMFS view as necessary to improve upon the description  and identification of EFH, the identification of threats to EFH from  fishing and other activities, and the development   of conservation and enhancement measures for EFH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Review and revision of EFH components of FMPs. Councils and  NMFS should periodically review the EFH provisions of FMPs and revise or  amend EFH provisions as warranted based on available information. FMPs  should outline the procedures the Council will follow to review and  update EFH information. The review of information should include, but  not be limited to, evaluating published scientific literature and  unpublished scientific reports; soliciting information from interested  parties; and searching for previously unavailable or inaccessible data.  Councils should report on their review of EFH information as part of the  annual Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) report prepared  pursuant to Sec. 600.315(e). A complete review of all EFH information  should be conducted as recommended by the Secretary, but at least once  every 5 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Development of EFH recommendations for Councils. After reviewing  the best available scientific information, as well as other appropriate  information, and in consultation with the Councils, participants in the  fishery, interstate commissions, Federal agencies, state agencies, and  other interested parties, NMFS will develop written recommendations to  assist each Council in the identification of EFH, adverse impacts to  EFH, and actions that should be considered to ensure the conservation  and enhancement of EFH for each FMP. NMFS will provide such  recommendations for the initial incorporation of EFH information into an  FMP and for any subsequent modification of the EFH components of an FMP.  The NMFS EFH recommendations may be provided either before the Council's  development of a draft EFH document or later as a review of a draft EFH  document developed by a Council, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Relationship to other fishery management authorities. Councils  are encouraged to coordinate with state and interstate fishery  management agencies where Federal fisheries affect state and interstate  managed fisheries or where state or interstate fishery regulations  affect the management of Federal fisheries. Where a state or interstate  fishing activity adversely affects EFH, NMFS will consider that action  to be an adverse effect on EFH pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this  section and will provide EFH Conservation Recommendations to the  appropriate state or interstate fishery management agency on that  activity.</p>
