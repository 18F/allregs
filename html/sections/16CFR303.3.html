96 percent Acetate4 percent Spandex.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In making such disclosure, all of the provisions of the Act and regulations in this part setting forth the manner and form of disclosure of fiber content information, including the provisions of Sec. Sec. 303.17 and 303.41 of this part relating to the use of generic names and fiber trademarks, shall be applicable.
