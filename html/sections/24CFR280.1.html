                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This part sets forth the requirements for existing grants under the Nehemiah Housing Opportunity Grants Program (NHOP). NHOP was established by title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (12 U.S.C. 1715l). Under NHOP, HUD made grants to nonprofit organizations to be used to provide loans to families purchasing homes constructed or substantially rehabilitated in accordance with a HUD approved program. NHOP was repealed by Section 289(b) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 12839). Accordingly, no new grants are being awarded under the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose. The purposes of NHOP are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To encourage homeownership by families who are not otherwise able to afford homeownership;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To undertake a concentrated effort to rebuild the depressed areas of cities and to create sound and attractive neighborhoods; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To increase the employment of residents of these neighborhoods.
