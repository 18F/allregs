The new set of pages were sent as replacement for the set of undated pages submitted earlier with the February 12, 2007 Record of Adoption package. In a May 10, 2007 e-mail to Domenico Mastrangelo, EPA, Debra Wolfe, of the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, confirmed February 12, 2007 as the adoption/effective date for the Montana Interstate Transport Rule Declaration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On February 10, 2010, Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer submitted a letter certifying, in part, that Montana's SIP is adequate to meet the interstate transport requirements of CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) for the 2006 PM2.5 NAAQS.
