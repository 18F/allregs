                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice requirement. When a bank makes, increases, extends,  renews, sells, or transfers a loan secured by a building or mobile home  located or to be located in a special flood hazard area, the bank shall  notify the Director of FEMA (or the Director's designee) in writing of  the identity of the servicer of the loan. The Director of FEMA has  designated the insurance provider to receive the bank's notice of the  servicer's identity. This notice may be provided electronically if  electronic transmission is satisfactory to the Director of FEMA's  designee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> shall transfer to the transferee servicer.</p><p class="depth2">Sec. Appendix A to Part 22--Sample Form of Notice of Special Flood</p><p class="depth2">Hazards and Availability of Federal Disaster Relief Assistance</p><p class="depth2">We are giving you this notice to inform you that:</p><p class="depth2">The building or mobile home securing the loan for which you have  applied is or will be located in an area with special flood hazards.</p><p class="depth2">The area has been identified by the Director of the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a special flood hazard area using  FEMA's Flood Insurance Rate Map or the Flood Hazard Boundary Map for the  following community: ________. This area has at least a one percent (1%)  chance of a flood equal to or exceeding the base flood elevation (a 100- year flood) in any given year. During the life of a 30-year mortgage  loan, the risk of a 100-year flood in a special flood hazard area is 26  percent (26%).</p><p class="depth2">Federal law allows a lender and borrower jointly to request the  Director of FEMA to review the determination of whether the property  securing the loan is located in a special flood hazard area. If you  would like to make such a request, please contact us for further  information.</p><p class="depth2">___ The community in which the property securing the loan is located  participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Federal law  will not allow us to make you the loan that you have applied for if you  do not purchase flood insurance. The flood insurance must be maintained  for the life of the loan. If you fail to purchase or renew flood  insurance on the property, Federal law authorizes and requires us to  purchase the flood insurance for you at your expense.</p><p class="depth2">Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP may be purchased  through an insurance agent who will obtain the policy either directly  through the NFIP or through an insurance company that participates in  the NFIP. Flood insurance also may be available from private insurers  that do not participate in the NFIP.</p><p class="depth2">At a minimum, flood insurance purchased must cover the  lesser of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> the outstanding principal balance of the loan; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> the maximum amount of coverage allowed for the type of property  under the NFIP.</p><p class="depth4">Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is limited to the overall  value of the property securing the loan minus the value of the land on  which the property is located.</p><p class="depth4">Federal disaster relief assistance (usually in the form of  a low-interest loan) may be available for damages incurred in excess of  your flood insurance if your community's participation in the NFIP is in  accordance with NFIP requirements.</p><p class="depth4">___ Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is not available for the  property securing the loan because the community in which the property  is located does not participate in the NFIP. In addition, if the non- participating community has been identified for at least one year as  containing a special flood hazard area, properties located in the  community will not be eligible for Federal disaster relief assistance in  the event of a Federally-declared flood disaster.
