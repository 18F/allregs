A document in which an inspector, or a person operating under a compliance agreement, affirms that a specified regulated article has met the criteria in Sec.  301.38-5(b) of this subpart and may be moved interstate to any destination.</p><p class="depth0">Clonally propagated. Reproduced asexually through cuttings, tissue culture, suckers, or crown division. For the purposes of this subpart, a Berberis plant will be considered clonally propagated only if its parent stock is, or was derived from, a seed-propagated black stem rust-resistant plant of more than 2 years' growth.</p><p class="depth0">Compliance agreement. A written agreement between a State that is a protected area or that encompasses a protected area and a person who moves regulated articles interstate, or in a non-protected area between APHIS and

such person, in which that person agrees to comply with this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Departmental permit. A document issued by the Administrator in which he or she affirms that interstate movement of the regulated article identified on the document is for scientific or experimental purposes, and that the regulated article is eligible for interstate movement under the conditions specified on the Departmental permit and found by the Administrator to be adequate to prevent the introduction of rust-susceptible varieties of the genera Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia into protected areas.</p><p class="depth0">Inspector. Any APHIS employee or other person authorized by the Administrator in accordance with law to enforce this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Interstate. From any State into or through any other State.</p><p class="depth0">Limited permit. A document issued by an inspector to allow the interstate movement into or through a protected area of regulated articles not eligible for certification under this subpart to a specified destination outside the protected area.</p><p class="depth0">Moved (movement, move). Shipped, offered to a common carrier for shipment, received for transportation or transported by a common carrier, or carried, transported, moved, or allowed to be moved. ``Movement'' and ``move'' shall be construed in accordance with this definition.</p><p class="depth0">Person.

Infected wheat stems, a primary host of black stem rust, are placed on top of the screen. The plants are moistened and maintained in 100% humidity, causing the spores to swell and fall on the plants lying under the screen. The plants are then observed for 7 days at 20-80% relative humidity. This test procedure is repeated 12 times. If in all 12 tests, the rust-susceptible plant shows signs of infection after 7 days and the test plants do not, USDA will declare the test plant variety rust-resistant. The tests must be performed on new growth, just as the leaves are unfolding.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Rust-susceptible plants. All plants of the genera Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia not listed as rust-resistant under Sec.  301.38-2 (a)(1) and (a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Regulated article. Any article listed in Sec.  301.38-2 (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this subpart or otherwise designated as a regulated article in accordance with Sec.  301.38-2(a)(4) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Seedling. Any plant of the genera Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia grown from seed and having less than 2 years' growth.</p><p class="depth0">State.
