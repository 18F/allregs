practicable after the monitoring excursion in order to minimize excess emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Furnace capture system. You must perform quarterly (once every three months) inspections of the furnace fugitive capture system equipment to ensure that the hood locations have not been changed or obstructed because of contact with cranes or ladles, quarterly inspections of the physical condition of hoods and ductwork to the control device to determine if there are any openings or leaks in the ductwork, quarterly inspections of the hoods and ductwork to determine if there are any flow constrictions in ductwork due to dents or accumulated dust and quarterly examinations of the operational status of flow rate controllers (pressure sensors, dampers, damper switches, etc.) to ensure they are operating correctly.

If you demonstrate compliance with any applicable emissions limit through use of a continuous monitoring system (CMS), where a CMS includes a continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) as well as a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS), you must develop a site-specific monitoring plan and submit this site-specific monitoring plan, if requested, at least 60 days before your initial performance evaluation (where applicable) of your CMS. Your site-specific monitoring plan must address the monitoring system design, data collection and the quality assurance and quality control elements outlined in this paragraph and in Sec. 63.8(d). You must install, operate and maintain each CMS according to the procedures in your approved site-specific monitoring plan. Using the process described in Sec. 63.8(f)(4), you may request approval of monitoring system quality assurance and quality control procedures alternative to those specified in paragraphs (i)(1) through (6) of this section in your site-specific monitoring plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The performance criteria and design specifications for the monitoring system equipment, including the sample interface, detector signal analyzer and data acquisition and calculations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sampling interface location such that the monitoring system will provide representative measurements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Equipment performance checks, system accuracy audits, or other audit procedures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Ongoing operation and maintenance procedures in accordance with the general requirements of Sec. 63.8(c)(1) and (3);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Conditions that define a continuous monitoring system that is out of control consistent with Sec. 63.8(c)(7)(i) and for responding to out of control periods consistent with Sec. 63.8(c)(7)(ii) and (c)(8) or Table 1 to this subpart, as applicable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Ongoing recordkeeping and reporting procedures in accordance with provisions in Sec. 63.10(c), (e)(1) and (e)(2)(i), and Table 1 to this subpart, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> If you have an operating limit that requires the use of a CPMS, you must install, operate and maintain each continuous parameter monitoring system according to the procedures in paragraphs (j)(1) through (7) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The CPMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation for each successive 15-minute period.

A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. You are required to complete monitoring system repairs in response to monitoring system malfunctions and to return the monitoring system to operation as expeditiously as practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> You may not use data recorded during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels.
