                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Formula. (1) After enactment of the annual appropriations act for each fiscal year, and issuance of the NOFA, HUD will publish, on its Web site, the Preliminary Pro Rata Need (PPRN) assigned to metropolitan cities, urban counties, and all other counties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> HUD will apply the formula used to determine PPRN established in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, to the amount of funds being made available under the NOFA. That amount is calculated by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determining the total amount for the Continuum of Care competition in accordance with section 413 of the Act or as otherwise directed by the annual appropriations act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> From the amount in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, deducting the amount published in the NOFA as being set aside to provide a bonus to geographic areas for activities that have proven to be effective in reducing homelessness generally or for specific subpopulations listed in the NOFA or achieving homeless prevention and independent living goals established in the NOFA and to meet policy priorities set in the NOFA; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Deducting the amount of funding necessary for Continuum of Care planning activities and UFA costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> PPRN is calculated on the amount determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section by using the following formula:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Two percent will be allocated among the four insular areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, and the Virgin Islands) on the basis of the ratio of the population of each insular area to the population of all insular areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Seventy-five percent of the remaining amount will be allocated, using the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) formula, to metropolitan cities and urban counties that have been funded under either the Emergency Shelter Grants or Emergency Solutions Grants programs in any one year since 2004.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The amount remaining after the allocation under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section will be allocated, using the CDBG formula, to metropolitan cities and urban counties that have not been funded under the Emergency Solutions Grants program in any year since 2004 and all other counties in the United States and Puerto Rico.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the calculation in paragraph (a)(2) of this section results in an amount less than the amount required to renew all projects eligible for renewal in that year for at least one year, after making adjustments proportional to increases in fair market rents for the geographic area for leasing, operating, and rental assistance for permanent housing, HUD will reduce, proportionately, the total amount required to renew all projects eligible for renewal in that year for at least one year, for each Continuum of Care. HUD will publish, via the NOFA, the total dollar amount that every Continuum will be required to deduct from renewal projects Continuum-wide.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Calculating a Continuum of Care's maximum award amount. (1) Establish the PPRN amount. First, HUD will total the PPRN amounts for each metropolitan city, urban county, other county, and insular area claimed by the Continuum as part of its geographic area, excluding any counties applying for or receiving funding from the Rural Housing Stability Assistance program under 24 CFR part 579.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Establishing renewal demand. Next, HUD will determine the renewal demand within the Continuum's geographic area. Renewal demand is the sum of the annual renewal amounts of all projects within the Continuum eligible to apply for renewal in that fiscal year's competition, before any adjustments to rental assistance, leasing, and operating line items based on FMR changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Establishing FPRN. The higher of PPRN or renewal demand for the Continuum of Care is the FPRN, which is the base for the maximum award amount for the Continuum.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Establishing the maximum award amount. The maximum award amount for the Continuum is the FPRN amount plus any additional eligible amounts for Continuum planning; UFA costs; adjustments to leasing, operating and rental assistance line items based on changes to FMR; and available bonuses.</p>
