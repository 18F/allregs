                            <p class="depth0">If your locomotive is equipped with an auxiliary power unit (APU) that operates during an idle shutdown mode, you must account for the APU's emissions rates as specified in this section, unless the APU is part of an AESS system that was certified separately from the rest of the locomotive. This section does not apply for auxiliary engines that only provide hotel power.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Adjust the locomotive main engine's idle emission rate (g/hr) as specified in Sec.  1033.530. Add the APU emission rate (g/hr) that you determine under paragraph (b) of this section. Use the locomotive main engine's idle power as specified in Sec.  1033.530.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determine the representative emission rate for the APU using one of the following methods.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Installed APU tested separately. If you separately measure emission rates (g/hr) for each pollutant from the APU installed in the locomotive, you may use the measured emissions rates (g/hr) as the locomotive's idle emissions rates when the locomotive is shutdown and the APU is operating. For all testing other than in-use testing, apply appropriate deterioration factors to the measured emission rates. You may ask to carryover APU emission data for a previous test, or use data for the same APU installed on locomotives in another engine family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Uninstalled APU tested separately. If you separately measure emission rates (g/hr) over an appropriate duty-cycle for each pollutant from the APU when it is not installed in the locomotive, you may use the measured emissions rates (g/hr) as the locomotive's idle emissions rates when the locomotive is shutdown and the APU is

operating. For the purpose of this paragraph (b)(2), an appropriate duty-cycle is one that approximates the APU engine's cycle-weighted power when operating in the locomotive. Apply appropriate deterioration factors to the measured emission rates. You may ask to carryover APU emission data for a previous test, or use data for the same APU installed on locomotives in another engine family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> APU engine certification data. If the engine used for the APU has been certified to EPA emission standards you may calculate the APU's emissions based upon existing EPA-certification information about the APU's engine. In this case, calculate the APU's emissions as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For each pollutant determine the brake-specific standard/FEL to which the APU engine was originally EPA-certified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Determine the APU engine's cycle-weighted power when operating in the locomotive.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Multiply each of the APU's applicable brake-specific standards/FELs by the APU engine's cycle-weighted power. The results are the APU's emissions rates (in g/hr).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Use these emissions rates as the locomotive's idle emissions rates when the locomotive is shutdown and the APU is running. Do not apply a deterioration factor to these values.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other. You may ask us to approve an alternative means to account for APU emissions.
