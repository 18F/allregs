                            <p class="depth0">The reporting requirements of section 37 of the CPSA (15 U.S.C. 2084) are in addition to the requirement in section 15 of the CPSA. Section 37 requires a product manufacturer to report certain kinds of lawsuit information. It is intended as a supplement to, not a substitute for, the requirements of section 15(b) of the CPSA. Whether or not a firm has an obligation to provide information under section 37, it must consider whether it has obtained information which reasonably supports the conclusion that its product violates a consumer product safety rule, does not comply with a voluntary safety standard upon which the Commission has relied under section 9, contains a defect which could create a substantial product hazard, or creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death. If a firm has obtained such information, it must report under section 15(b) of the CPSA, whether or not it is required to report under section 37. Further, in many cases the Commission would expect to receive reports under section 15(b) long before the obligation to report under section 37 arises since firms have frequently obtained reportable information before settlements or judgments in their product liability lawsuits.
