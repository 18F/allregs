                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Every grant, loan or contract to which this subpart applies, except an application to which Sec. 4.22 applies, shall, as a condition to its approval by NRC, or by the appropriate NRC contractor or subcontractor, and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant thereto, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the program will be conducted in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart. In the case of a grant, loan, or contract involving Federal financial assistance to provide real property or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended, or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. In the case of personal property the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which he retains ownership or possession of the property. In all other cases the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended pursuant to the grant, loan or contract. The Commission will specify the form of the foregoing assurances and the extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, successors in interest, and other participants. Any such assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the case of real property, structures or improvements thereon, or interests therein, which was acquired with Federal financial assistance, or in the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interest therein from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained from

the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the NRC to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the NRC, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the program and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In such event if a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the NRC may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as the NRC deems appropriate, to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transfers of surplus property are subject to regulations issued by the Administrator of General Services (41 CFR 101-6.2).
