The  response plan must also identify an individual located at the facility  to work with the fire department for petroleum oil fires. This  individual shall also verify that sufficient well-trained firefighting  resources are available within a reasonable response time   to a worst case scenario. The individual may be the qualified individual  as defined in Sec. 154.1020 and identified in the response plan or  another appropriate individual located at the facility.</p>
