The import, export, or re-export of specimens of vicu[ntilde]a must meet the requirements of this section and the other requirements of this part (see subparts B and C of this part for prohibitions and application procedures). Certain populations of vicu[ntilde]a are listed in Appendix II for the exclusive purpose of allowing international trade in wool sheared from live vicu[ntilde]as, cloth made from such wool, and products manufactured from such wool or cloth. All other specimens of vicu[ntilde]a are deemed to be specimens of a species included in Appendix I.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Vicu[ntilde]a Convention means the Convenio para la Conservaci[oacute]n y Manejo de la Vicu[ntilde]a, of which vicu[ntilde]a range countries are signatories.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Vicu[ntilde]a logotype means the logotype adopted by the vicu[ntilde]a range countries under the Vicu[ntilde]a Convention.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Country of origin for the purposes of the vicu[ntilde]a label means the name of the country where the vicu[ntilde]a wool in the cloth or product originated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Wool sheared from live vicu[ntilde]as, cloth from such wool, and products manufactured from such wool or cloth may be imported from Appendix-II populations only when they meet the labeling requirements in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Labeling requirements. Except for cloth containing CITES pre-Convention wool of vicu[ntilde]a, you may import, export, or re-export vicu[ntilde]a cloth only when the reverse side of the cloth bears the vicu[ntilde]a logotype and the selvages bear the words ``VICU[Ntilde]A--COUNTRY OF ORIGIN''. Specimens of other products manufactured from vicu[ntilde]a wool or cloth must bear a label that has the

vicu[ntilde]a logotype and the designation ``VICU[Ntilde]A--COUNTRY OF ORIGIN--ARTESANIA''. Each specimen must bear such a label. For import into the United States of raw wool sheared from live vicu[ntilde]a, see the labeling requirements in 50 CFR 17.40(m).
