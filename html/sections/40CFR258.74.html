                            <p class="depth0">The mechanisms used to demonstrate financial assurance under this section must ensure that the funds necessary to meet the costs of closure, post-closure care, and corrective action for known releases will be available whenever they are needed. Owners and operators must choose from the options specified in paragraphs (a) through (j) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Trust Fund. (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by establishing a trust fund which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph. The trustee

must be an entity which has the authority to act as a trustee and whose trust operations are regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency. A copy of the trust agreement must be placed in the facility's operating record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Payments into the trust fund must be made annually by the owner or operator over the term of the initial permit or over the remaining life of the MSWLF unit, whichever is shorter, in the case of a trust fund for closure or post-closure care, or over one-half of the estimated length of the corrective action program in the case of corrective action for known releases. This period is referred to as the pay-in period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For a trust fund used to demonstrate financial assurance for closure and post-closure care, the first payment into the fund must be at least equal to the current cost estimate for closure or post-closure care, except as provided in paragraph (k) of this section, divided by the number of years in the pay-in period as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The amount of subsequent payments must be determined by the following formula:
Next Payment = [CE - CV]/Y
where CE is the current cost estimate for closure or post-closure care</p><p class="depth0">(updated for inflation or other changes), CV is the current</p><p class="depth0">value of the trust fund, and Y is the number of years</p><p class="depth0">remaining in the pay-in period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For a trust fund used to demonstrate financial assurance for corrective action, the first payment into the trust fund must be at least equal to one-half of the current cost estimate for corrective action, except as provided in paragraph (k) of this section, divided by the number of years in the corrective action pay-in period as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The amount of subsequent payments must be determined by the following formula:
Next Payment = [RB - CV]/Y
where RB is the most recent estimate of the required trust fund balance</p><p class="depth0">for corrective action (i.e., the total costs that will be</p><p class="depth0">incurred during the second half of the corrective action</p><p class="depth0">period), CV is the current value of the trust fund, and Y is</p><p class="depth0">the number of years remaining in the pay-in period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The initial payment into the trust fund must be made before the initial receipt of waste or before the effective date of the requirements of this section (April 9, 1997, or October 9, 1997 for MSWLF units meeting the conditions of Sec. 258.1(f)(1)), whichever is later, in the case of closure and post-closure care, or no later than 120 days after the corrective action remedy has been selected in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 258.58.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If the owner or operator establishes a trust fund after having used one or more alternate mechanisms specified in this section, the initial payment into the trust fund must be at least the amount that the fund would contain if the trust fund were established initially and annual payments made according to the specifications of this paragraph and paragraph (a) of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The owner or operator, or other person authorized to conduct closure, post-closure care, or corrective action activities may request reimbursement from the trustee for these expenditures. Requests for reimbursement will be granted by the trustee only if sufficient funds are remaining in the trust fund to cover the remaining costs of closure, post-closure care, or corrective action, and if justification and documentation of the cost is placed in the operating record. The owner or operator must notify the State Director that the documentation of the justification for reimbursement has been placed in the operating record and that reimbursement has been received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The trust fund may be terminated by the owner or operator only if the owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section or if he is no longer required to demonstrate financial responsibility in accordance with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 258.71(b), 258.72(b), or 258.73(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Surety Bond Guaranteeing Payment or Performance. (1) An owner or operator may demonstrate financial assurance for closure or post-closure care by obtaining a payment or performance surety bond which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph. An

owner or operator may demonstrate financial assurance for corrective action by obtaining a performance bond which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph. The bond must be effective before the initial receipt of waste or before the effective date of the requirements of this section (April 9, 1997, or October 9, 1997 for MSWLF units meeting the conditions of Sec. 258.1(f)(1)), whichever is later, in the case of closure and post-closure care, or no later than 120 days after the corrective action remedy has been selected in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 258.58. The owner or operator must notify the State Director that a copy of the bond has been placed in the operating record. The surety company issuing the bond must, at a minimum, be among those listed as acceptable sureties on Federal bonds in Circular 570 of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The penal sum of the bond must be in an amount at least equal to the current closure, post-closure care or corrective action cost estimate, whichever is applicable, except as provided in Sec. 258.74(k).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Under the terms of the bond, the surety will become liable on the bond obligation when the owner or operator fails to perform as guaranteed by the bond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The owner or operator must establish a standby trust fund. The standby trust fund must meet the requirements of Sec. 258.74(a) except the requirements for initial payment and subsequent annual payments specified in Sec. 258.74 (a)(2), (3), (4) and (5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Payments made under the terms of the bond will be deposited by the surety directly into the standby trust fund. Payments from the trust fund must be approved by the trustee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Under the terms of the bond, the surety may cancel the bond by sending notice of cancellation by certified mail to the owner and operator and to the State Director 120 days in advance of cancellation. If the surety cancels the bond, the owner or operator must obtain alternate financial assurance as specified in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The owner or operator may cancel the bond only if alternate financial assurance is substituted as specified in this section or if the owner or operator is no longer required to demonstrate financial responsibility in accordance with Sec. 258.71(b), Sec. 258.72(b) or Sec. 258.73(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Letter of credit. (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by obtaining an irrevocable standby letter of credit which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph. The letter of credit must be effective before the initial receipt of waste or before the effective date of the requirements of this section (April 9, 1997, or October 9, 1997 for MSWLF units meeting the conditions of Sec. 258.1(f)(1)), whichever is later, in the case of closure and post-closure care, or no later than 120 days after the corrective action remedy has been selected in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 258.58. The owner or operator must notify the State Director that a copy of the letter of credit has been placed in the operating record. The issuing institution must be an entity which has the authority to issue letters of credit and whose letter-of-credit operations are regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A letter from the owner or operator referring to the letter of credit by number, issuing institution, and date, and providing the following information: Name, and address of the facility, and the amount of funds assured, must be included with the letter of credit in the operating record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The letter of credit must be irrevocable and issued for a period of at least one year in an amount at least equal to the current cost estimate for closure, post-closure care or corrective action, whichever is applicable, except as provided in paragraph (k) of this section. The letter of credit must provide that the expiration date will be automatically extended for a period of at least one year unless the issuing institution has cancelled the letter of credit by sending notice of cancellation by certified mail to the owner and operator and to the State Director 120 days in advance of cancellation. If the letter of credit is cancelled by the issuing institution, the owner or operator must obtain alternate financial assurance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The owner or operator may cancel the letter of credit only if alternate financial assurance is substituted as

specified in this section or if the owner or operator is released from the requirements of this section in accordance with Sec. 258.71(b), Sec. 258.72(b) or Sec. 258.73(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Insurance. (1) An owner or operator may demonstrate financial assurance for closure and post-closure care by obtaining insurance which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph. The insurance must be effective before the initial receipt of waste or before the effective date of the requirements of this section (April 9, 1997, or October 9, 1997 for MSWLF units meeting the conditions of Sec. 258.1(f)(1)), whichever is later, in the case of closure and post-closure care, or no later than 120 days after the corrective action remedy has been selected in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 258.58. At a minimum, the insurer must be licensed to transact the business of insurance, or eligible to provide insurance as an excess or surplus lines insurer, in one or more States. The owner or operator must notify the State Director that a copy of the insurance policy has been placed in the operating record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The closure or post-closure care insurance policy must guarantee that funds will be available to close the MSWLF unit whenever final closure occurs or to provide post-closure care for the MSWLF unit whenever the post-closure care period begins, whichever is applicable. The policy must also guarantee that once closure or post-closure care begins, the insurer will be responsible for the paying out of funds to the owner or operator or other person authorized to conduct closure or post-closure care, up to an amount equal to the face amount of the policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The insurance policy must be issued for a face amount at least equal to the current cost estimate for closure or post-closure care, whichever is applicable, except as provided in paragraph (k) of this section. The term face amount means the total amount the insurer is obligated to pay under the policy. Actual payments by the insurer will not change the face amount, although the insurer's future liability will be lowered by the amount of the payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An owner or operator, or any other person authorized to conduct closure or post-closure care, may receive reimbursements for closure or post-closure expenditures, whichever is applicable. Requests for reimbursement will be granted by the insurer only if the remaining value of the policy is sufficient to cover the remaining costs of closure or post-closure care, and if justification and documentation of the cost is placed in the operating record. The owner or operator must notify the State Director that the documentation of the justification for reimbursement has been placed in the operating record and that reimbursement has been received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Each policy must contain a provision allowing assignment of the policy to a successor owner or operator. Such assignment may be conditional upon consent of the insurer, provided that such consent is not unreasonably refused.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The insurance policy must provide that the insurer may not cancel, terminate or fail to renew the policy except for failure to pay the premium. The automatic renewal of the policy must, at a minimum, provide the insured with the option of renewal at the face amount of the expiring policy. If there is a failure to pay the premium, the insurer may cancel the policy by sending notice of cancellation by certified mail to the owner and operator and to the State Director 120 days in advance of cancellation. If the insurer cancels the policy, the owner or operator must obtain alternate financial assurance as specified in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> For insurance policies providing coverage for post-closure care, commencing on the date that liability to make payments pursuant to the policy accrues, the insurer will thereafter annually increase the face amount of the policy. Such increase must be equivalent to the face amount of the policy, less any payments made, multiplied by an amount equivalent to 85 percent of the most recent investment rate or of the equivalent coupon-issue yield announced by the U.S. Treasury for 26-week Treasury securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The owner or operator may cancel the insurance policy only if alternate financial assurance is substituted as specified in this section or if the owner or operator, is no longer required to

demonstrate financial responsibility in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 258.71(b), Sec. 258.72(b) or Sec. 258.73(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Corporate financial test. An owner or operator that satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (e) may demonstrate financial assurance up to the amount specified in this paragraph (e):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Financial component. (i) The owner or operator must satisfy one of the following three conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A current rating for its senior unsubordinated debt of AAA, AA, A, or BBB as issued by Standard and Poor's or Aaa, Aa, A or Baa as issued by Moody's; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A ratio of less than 1.5 comparing total liabilities to net worth; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A ratio of greater than 0.10 comparing the sum of net income plus depreciation, depletion and amortization, minus $10 million, to total liabilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The tangible net worth of the owner or operator must be greater than: (A) The sum of the current closure, post-closure care, corrective action cost estimates and any other environmental obligations, including guarantees, covered by a financial test plus $10 million except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> $10 million in net worth plus the amount of any guarantees that have not been recognized as liabilities on the financial statements provided all of the current closure, post-closure care, and corrective action costs and any other environmental obligations covered by a financial test are recognized as liabilities on the owner's or operator's audited financial statements, and subject to the approval of the State Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The owner or operator must have assets located in the United States amounting to at least the sum of current closure, post-closure care, corrective action cost estimates and any other environmental obligations covered by a financial test as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.

To be eligible to use the financial test, the owner's or operator's financial statements must receive an unqualified opinion from the independent certified public accountant. An adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion, or other qualified opinion will be cause for disallowance, with the potential exception for qualified opinions provided in the next sentence. The Director of an approved State may evaluate qualified opinions on a case-by-case basis and allow use of the financial test in cases where the Director deems that the matters which form the basis for the qualification are insufficient to warrant disallowance of the test. If the Director of an approved State does not allow use of the test, the owner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance that meets the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the chief financial officer's letter providing evidence of financial assurance includes financial data showing that owner or operator satisfies paragraph (e)(1)(i)(B) or (e)(1)(i)(C) of this section that are different from data in the audited financial statements referred to in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section or any other audited financial statement or data filed with the SEC, then a special report from the owner's or operator's

independent certified public accountant to the owner or operator is required. The special report shall be based upon an agreed upon procedures engagement in accordance with professional auditing standards and shall describe the procedures performed in comparing the data in the chief financial officer's letter derived from the independently audited, year-end financial statements for the latest fiscal year with the amounts in such financial statements, the findings of that comparison, and the reasons for any differences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If the chief financial officer's letter provides a demonstration that the firm has assured for environmental obligations as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, then the letter shall include a report from the independent certified public accountant that verifies that all of the environmental obligations covered by a financial test have been recognized as liabilities on the audited financial statements, how these obligations have been measured and reported, and that the tangible net worth of the firm is at least $10 million plus the amount of any guarantees provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An owner or operator must place the items specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section in the operating record and notify the State Director that these items have been placed in the operating record before the initial receipt of waste or before the effective date of the requirements of this section (April 9, 1997 or October 9, 1997 for MSWLF units meeting the conditions of Sec. 258.1(f)(1)), whichever is later in the case of closure, and post-closure care, or no later than 120 days after the corrective action remedy has been selected in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 258.58.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> After the initial placement of items specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section in the operating record, the owner or operator must annually update the information and place updated information in the operating record within 90 days following the close of the owner or operator's fiscal year. The Director of a State may provide up to an additional 45 days for an owner or operator who can demonstrate that 90 days is insufficient time to acquire audited financial statements.
