                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The following guidelines govern the application of DoD Directive 5400.11 \15\ to those financial institutions that operate under this part:---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\15\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 231.1(a).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Financial institutions and their branches and facilities operating on DoD military installations do not fall within the purview of 5 U.S.C. 552 et seq.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> These financial institutions do not fit the definition of ``agency'' to which the Privacy Act applies, that is, any executive department, Military Department, government corporation, government-controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the government (including the Executive Office of the President), or an independent regulatory agency (5 U.S.C. 552(e) and 552a(a)(1)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> These financial institutions are not ``government contractors'' within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 552a(o), as they do not operate a system of records on behalf of an agency to accomplish an agency function. According to the Office of Management and Budget Privacy Act Guidelines, the provision relating to government contractors applies only to systems of records actually taking the place of a federal system which, but for the contract, would have been performed by an agency and covered by the Privacy Act. Clearly, the subject institutions do not meet these criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Since the Act does not apply to them, these financial institutions are not required to comply with 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) in obtaining and making use of personal information in their relationships with personnel authorized to use such institutions. Thus, these institutions are not required to inform individuals from whom information is requested of the authority for its solicitation, the principal purpose for which it is intended to be used, the routine uses that may be made of it, or the effects of not providing the information. There also is no requirement to post information of this nature within on-base banking and credit union offices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The financial institutions concerned hold the same position and relationship to their account holders, members, and to the government as they did before enactment of OMB Circular A-130. Within their usual business relationships, they still are responsible for safeguarding the information provided by their account holders or members and for obtaining only such information as is reasonable and necessary to conduct business. This includes credit information and proper

identification, which may include social security number, as a precondition for the cashing of checks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Financial institutions may incorporate the following conditions of disclosure of personal identification in all contracts, including loan agreements, account signature cards, certificates of deposit agreements, and any other agreements signed by their account holders or members:</p><p class="depth0">I hereby authorize the Department of Defense and its various Components to verify my social security number or other identifier and disclose my home address to authorized (name of financial institution) officials so that they may contact me in connection with my business with (name of financial institution). All information furnished will be used solely in connection with my financial relationship with (name of financial institution).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When the financial institution presents such signed authorizations, the receiving military command or installation shall provide the appropriate information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Even though an agreement described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section has not been obtained, the Department of Defense may provide these financial institutions with salary information and, when pertinent, the length or type of civilian or military appointment, consistent with DoD Directives 5400.11 and 5400.7. \16\ Some examples of personal information pertaining to DoD personnel that normally can be released without creating an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy are name, rank, date of rank, salary, present and past duty assignments, future assignments that have been finalized, office phone number, source of commission, and promotion sequence number.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\16\ See footnote 1 to 231.1(a).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> When DoD personnel with financial obligations are reassigned and fail to inform the financial institution of their whereabouts, they should be located by contacting the individual's last known commander or supervisor at the official position or duty station within that particular DoD Component. That commander or supervisor either shall furnish the individual's new official duty location address to the financial institution, or shall forward, through official channels, any correspondence received pertaining thereto to the individual's new commander or supervisor for appropriate assistance and response. Correspondence addressed to the individual concerned at his or her last official place of business or duty station shall be forwarded as provided by postal regulations to the new location. Once an individual's affiliation with the Department of Defense is terminated through separation or retirement, however, the Department's ability to render locator assistance (i.e., disclose a home address) is severely curtailed unless the public interest dictates disclosure of the last known home address. The Department may, at its discretion, forward correspondence to the individual's last known home address. The Department may not act as an intermediary for private matters concerning former DoD personnel who are no longer affiliated with the Department.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Questions concerning this guidance should be forwarded through channels to the Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), The Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-1100.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

Appendix B to Part 231--In-Store Banking</p><p class="depth0">A. Selection Process. The purpose of this guidance is to assure an impartial and thorough process to select the best on-base financial institution to provide in-store banking services when such services are desired and approved by the installation commander.</p><p class="depth0">1. Consistent with DoD Component delegation, the final decision to solicit for an in-store banking office rests with the installation commander.</p><p class="depth0">2. The DoD Component seeking in-store banking (e.g., in buildings operated by the Defense Commissary Agency, Military Exchange Services and MWR activities) shall draft the solicitation letter.</p><p class="depth0">3. Close coordination among all cognizant DoD organizations is essential throughout the selection process.</p><p class="depth0">B. Specific Procedures</p><p class="depth0">1. The need for in-store banking service may be identified from either:</p><p class="depth0">a. An unsolicited proposal from an on-base financial institution,</p><p class="depth0">b. A DoD Component's request, or</p><p class="depth0">c. An installation commander's request.</p><p class="depth0">2. The cognizant installation commander (or designee) is responsible for assessing the environment and authorizing the Bank/Credit Union Liaison Officer(s) to pursue the acquisition of in-store banking services. If no authorization is given, no further action is required.</p><p class="depth0">3. The cognizant installation commander shall determine whether a solicitation is required. (A solicitation shall be required whenever there are two or more financial institutions on a DoD installation.) If no solicitation is required, then the Bank/Credit Union Liaison Officer shall work directly with the on-base financial institution to obtain the requested services. Where there is neither a banking office nor an on-base credit union, use the solicitation process outlined in Sec. 231.5(c) of this chapter, as supplemented by the provisions outlined in paragraph A, above.</p><p class="depth0">4. The solicitation letter shall identify the financial services being requested and classify these services as either mandatory or optional. In addition, the solicitation letter shall highlight any services that will be weighed as more important than others during the evaluation of the proposals. Any space consideration and terms of the proposed agreement also shall be identified in the letter.</p><p class="depth0">5. The installation commander (or designee) formally shall notify the selected financial institution and request that institution to coordinate with the proper activity to begin any construction, modifications or renovations necessary to open the in-store banking office. The cognizant facility management personnel shall begin the process of obtaining the necessary outgrant instruments. Concurrently, the requesting DoD Component representative and the financial institution representative shall draft the appropriate amendment to the operating agreement. The amendment should contain provisions regarding:</p><p class="depth0">a. The roles and responsibilities of all parties involved.</p><p class="depth0">b. The financial services to be provided, and</p><p class="depth0">c. The logistical support arrangements to include custodial services and security provisions. The amendment should be coordinated with the Bank/Credit Union Liaison Officer(s) prior to forwarding that document to the installation commander for signature. The amendment shall be signed by the installation commander (or designee) and the appropriate financial institution official with a copy furnished to the Secretary of the Military Department concerned (or designee) and the Director, DFAS (or designee).
