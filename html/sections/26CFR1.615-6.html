                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of the Tax Reform Act of 1969).  For example, assume that, in his return for his taxable year ending  December 31, 1966, a calendar-year taxpayer deducts exploration  expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966, and does not  attach to his return the statement described in paragraph (a) of this  section. However, all of the exploration expenditures paid or incurred  by the taxpayer   after September 12, 1966, and before the end of the taxable year were  paid or incurred with respect to minerals located neither in the United  States nor on the Outer Continental Shelf. The taxpayer will be deemed  to have made an election under section 615(e) by deducting all or part  of those expenditures as expenses in his income tax return.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Information to be furnished. A taxpayer who makes or has made an  election under section 615(e) with respect to expenditures paid or  incurred after September 12, 1966, and before January 1, 1970, shall  indicate clearly on his income tax return for each taxable year for  which he deducts any such expenditures the amount of the deduction  claimed under section 615 (a) or (b) with respect to each property or  mine. The property or mine shall be identified by a description adequate  to permit application of the rules of section 615(g) (relating to effect  of transfer of mineral property).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effect of election--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A taxpayer who has made or  is deemed to have made an election under section 615(e) may not make an  election under section 617(a) with respect to expenditures made before  January 1, 1970, unless, within the period set forth in section 615(e),  he revokes his election under section 615(e). Except as provided in  paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.615-2, a taxpayer who makes an election under  section 615(e) may not change his treatment of exploration expenditures  deducted, deferred, or capitalized pursuant to such election unless he  revokes the election made under section 615(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)</em> for rules  under which amounts deducted under section 617(a) by a transferor may be  subject to recapture in the hands of a transferee who has made an  election under section 615(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> may not be made after the expiration of the 3-year period even  though the taxpayer charged to capital account, or erroneously deducted  as development expenditures under section 616, all exploration  expenditures paid or incurred by him after September 12, 1966, and  before the end of his first taxable year ending after September 12,  1966, in which he paid or incurred such expenditures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Revocation of section 615(e) election--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Manner of revoking  election. A taxpayer may revoke an election made by him under section  615(e) by filing with the director of the Internal Revenue service  center with whom the taxpayer's income tax return is required to be  filed, within the period set forth in subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph, a statement, signed by the taxpayer or his authorized  representative, which sets forth that the taxpayer is revoking the  election previously made by him with respect to exploration expenditures  paid or incurred after September 12, 1966, and states with whom and  where the document making the election was filed. Such revocation shall  be a revocation for all taxable years for which the taxpayer's election  was in effect and the taxpayer revoking such an election shall file  amended income tax returns, reflecting any increase or decrease in tax  attributable to the revocation of election. In applying the revocation  of election to the years affected there shall be taken into account the  effect that any adjustments resulting from the revocation of   election shall have on other items affected thereby (such as the  deduction for charitable contributions, the foreign tax credit, net  operating loss, and other deductions or credits the amount of which is  limited by the taxpayer's income) and the effect that adjustments of any  such items have on items in other taxable years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Time for revoking election under section 615(e). An election  under section 615(e) may be revoked at any time before the expiration of  the 3-year period described in paragraph (e) of this section. Such an  election may not be revoked after the expiration of the 3-year period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Additional information to be furnished by a transferor of  mineral property. If, before revoking his election, the taxpayer has  transferred any mineral property with respect to which he deducted  exploration expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966, and  before January 1, 1970, to another person in a transaction as a result  of which the basis of such property in the hands of the transferee is  determined by reference to the basis in the hands of the transferor, the  statement submitted pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall  state that such property has been so transferred and shall identify the  transferee, the property transferred, and the date of the transfer. The  preceding sentence shall not apply in the case of any mineral property  transferred after December 31, 1969.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Taxable years beginning before September 13, 1966, and ending  after September 12, 1966--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. An election made under section  615(e) applies only to expenditures paid or incurred after September 12,  1966. The income tax treatment of exploration expenditures paid or  incurred before September 13, 1966, will be determined in accordance  with the provisions of section 615 prior to its amendment by the Act of  September 12, 1966 (Public Law 89-570, 80 Stat. 759). If a taxpayer  makes an election under section 615(e) in his income tax return for a  taxable year which begins before September 13, 1966, and which ends  after September 12, 1966, amounts deducted and amounts deferred under  section 615 with respect to expenditures paid or incurred during such  taxable year but before September 13, 1966, will be taken into account  in determining whether the $100,000 limitation set forth in section  615(a) is reached during the taxable year. Similarly, a taxpayer who  makes an election under section 615(e) shall take into account  expenditures deducted or deferred under section 615 for the period prior  to September 13, 1966, in determining when the $400,000 overall  limitation set forth in section 615(c) is reached. The fact that a  taxpayer deducts or defers under section 615 exploration expenditures  paid or incurred prior to September 13, 1966, shall not affect his right  to make an election under section 617(a) to deduct under section 617  expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Allocation in case of inadequate records. If a taxpayer pays or  incurs exploration expenditures during a taxable year beginning before  September 13, 1966, and ending after September 12, 1966, but his records  as to any mine or property are inadequate to permit a determination of  the amount paid or incurred during the portion of the year ending after  September 12, 1966, and the amount paid or incurred on or before such  date, the exploration expenditures, as to which the records are  inadequate, paid or incurred with respect to the mine or property during  the taxable year shall be allocated to each part year (that is, the part  occurring before September 13, 1966, and the part occurring after  September 12, 1966) in the same ratio which the number of days in each  such part year bears to the number of days in the entire taxable year.  For example, if the records of a calendar year taxpayer for 1966 are  inadequate to permit a determination of the amount of exploration  expenditures paid or incurred with respect to a certain mine or property  after September 12, 1966, and the amount paid or incurred before  September 13, 1966, 255/365 of the total exploration expenditures paid  or incurred by the taxpayer with respect to the mine or property during  1966 shall be allocated to the period beginning January 1, 1966, and  ending September 12, 1966, and 110/365 of the total exploration  expenditures paid or incurred with respect to the mine or property  during 1966 shall be allocated   to the period beginning September 13, 1966, and ending December 31,  1966.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Partnership elections. With respect to exploration expenditures  paid or incurred by a partnership before September 13, 1966, the option  to deduct under section 615(a) and the election to defer under section  615(b) shall be made by the partnership, rather than by the individual  partners. With respect to exploration expenditures paid or incurred by a  partnership after September 12, 1966, all elections under sections 615  and 617 as to the tax treatment of a partner's distributive share of  exploration expenditures paid or incurred by a partnership of which he  is a member shall be made by the individual partner, rather than by the  partnership. See section 703(b) and the regulations thereunder.  [T.D. 7192, 37 FR 12939, June 30, 1972]</p>
