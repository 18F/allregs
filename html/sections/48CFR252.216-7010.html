The quantities of supplies or services specified in the Schedule are estimates only and are not purchased by this contract. Except as this contract may otherwise provide, if the Government's requirements do not result in orders in the quantities described as ``estimated'' or ``maximum'' in the Schedule, that fact shall not constitute the basis for an equitable price adjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Delivery or performance shall be made only as authorized by orders issued in accordance with the Ordering clause. Subject to any limitations in the Order Limitations clause or elsewhere in this contract, the Contractor shall furnish to the Government all supplies or services specified in the Schedule and called for by orders issued in accordance with the Ordering clause. The Government may issue orders requiring delivery to multiple destinations or performance at multiple locations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except as this contract otherwise provides, the Government shall order from the Contractor all the supplies or services specified in the Schedule that are required to be purchased by the Government activity or activities specified in the Schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Government is not required to purchase from the Contractor requirements in excess of any limit on total orders under this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the Government urgently requires delivery of any quantity of an item before the earliest date that delivery may be specified under this contract, and if the Contractor will not accept an order providing for the accelerated delivery, the Government may acquire the urgently required goods or services from another source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Orders issued during the effective period of this contract and not completed within that time shall be completed by the Contractor within the time specified in the order.

The quantities of supplies or services specified in the Schedule are estimates only and are not purchased by this contract. Except as this contract may otherwise provide, if the Government's requirements do not result in orders in the quantities described as ``estimated'' or ``maximum'' in the Schedule, that fact shall not constitute the basis for an equitable price adjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Delivery or performance shall be made only as authorized by orders issued in accordance with the Ordering clause.

The Government may issue orders requiring delivery to multiple destinations or performance at multiple locations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Government's requirements for each item or subitem of supplies or services described in the Schedule are being purchased through one non-set-aside contract and one set-aside contract. Therefore, the Government shall order from each Contractor approximately one-half of the total supplies or services specified in the Schedule

that are required to be purchased by the specified Government activity or activities. The Government may choose between the set-aside Contractor and the non-set-aside Contractor in placing any particular order. However, the Government shall allocate successive orders, in accordance with its delivery requirements, to maintain as close a ratio as is reasonably practicable between the total quantities ordered from the two Contractors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Government is not required to purchase from the Contractor requirements in excess of any limit on total orders under this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the Government urgently requires delivery of any quantity of an item before the earliest date that delivery may be specified under this contract, and if the Contractor will not accept an order providing for the accelerated delivery, the Government may acquire the urgently required goods or services from another source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Orders issued during the effective period of this contract and not completed within that time shall be completed by the Contractor within the time specified in the order.
