The  Secretary's designee may, in his or her discretion, review the decision  of the Administrative Law Judge on the petition of either the respondent  or the Director, or upon his or her own motion. The Secretary's designee  shall determine whether to review a decision:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If a petition for review has been filed by the respondent or the  Director, not later than 30 days after that date the Administrative Law  Judge filed his or her report with the Secretary's designee pursuant to  paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If no petition for review has been filed by the respondent or  the Director, not later than 40 days after the date the Administrative  Law Judge filed his or her decision with the Secretary's designee  pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In determining whether to review a decision upon petition of  the respondent or the Director, the Secretary's designee shall consider  whether the petition for review makes a reasonable showing that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A prejudicial error was committed in the conduct of the  proceeding; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The decision embodies:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A finding or conclusion of material fact that is clearly  erroneous;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A conclusion of law that is erroneous; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An exercise of discretion or decision of law or policy that is  important and that the Secretary's designee should review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interlocutory review of ruling. The Secretary's designee shall  review any ruling of an Administrative Law Judge involving privileged or  confidential material that is the subject of a petition for review. See  Sec. 501.725.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Filing.

The petition shall state why the Secretary's designee  should review the Administrative Law Judge's decision or ruling,  including: Whether the Administrative Law Judge's decision or ruling  raises an important question of law, policy or discretion; whether  review by the Secretary's designee will resolve a question about which  the Department's Administrative Law Judges have rendered differing  opinions; whether the Administrative Law Judge's decision or ruling is  contrary to law or Department precedent; whether a finding of material  fact is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence; or whether a  prejudicial error of procedure or an abuse of discretion was committed.  A petition should concisely state the portions of the decision or ruling  for which review is sought. A petition shall not incorporate by  reference a brief or legal memorandum.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> When filing effective. A petition for review is filed when  received by the Administrative Law Judge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Statements in opposition to petition. Not later than 8 days  after the filing of a petition for review, either the respondent or the  Director may file a statement in opposition to a petition. A statement  in opposition to a petition for review shall be filed in the manner  specified in this section for filing of petitions for review. Statements  in opposition shall concisely state why the Administrative Law Judge's  decision or ruling should not be reviewed with respect to each portion  of the petition to which it is addressed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Number of copies. An original and three copies of a petition or  a statement in opposition to a petition shall be filed with the  Administrative Law Judge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Prerequisite to judicial review.
