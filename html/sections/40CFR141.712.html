(1) Following completion of the initial source water monitoring required under Sec.  141.701(a), unfiltered systems must calculate the arithmetic mean of all Cryptosporidium sample concentrations reported under Sec.  141.701(a). Systems must report this value to the State for approval no later than 6 months after the month the system is required to complete initial source water monitoring based on the schedule in Sec.  141.701(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Following completion of the initial source water monitoring required under Sec.  141.701(a), unfiltered systems must calculate the arithmetic mean of all Cryptosporidium sample concentrations reported under Sec.  141.701(a).

Systems must report this value to the State for approval no later than 6 months after the month the system is required to complete the second round of source water monitoring based on the schedule in Sec.  141.701(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the monthly Cryptosporidium sampling frequency varies, systems must first calculate a monthly average for each month of monitoring. Systems must then use these monthly average concentrations, rather than individual sample concentrations, in the calculation of the mean Cryptosporidium level in paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The report to the State of the mean Cryptosporidium levels calculated under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section must include a summary of the source water monitoring data used for the calculation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Failure to comply with the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section is a violation of the treatment technique requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cryptosporidium inactivation requirements.

Unfiltered systems must use chlorine dioxide, ozone, or UV as described in Sec.  141.720 to meet the Cryptosporidium inactivation requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Systems that use chlorine dioxide or ozone and fail to achieve the Cryptosporidium inactivation required in paragraph (b) of this section on more than one day in the calendar month are in violation of the treatment technique requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Systems that use UV light and fail to achieve the Cryptosporidium inactivation required in paragraph (b) of this section by meeting the criteria in Sec.  141.720(d)(3)(ii) are in violation of the treatment technique requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use of two disinfectants. Unfiltered systems must meet the combined Cryptosporidium inactivation requirements of this section and Giardia lamblia and virus inactivation requirements of Sec.  141.72(a) using a minimum of two disinfectants, and each of two disinfectants must separately achieve the

total inactivation required for either Cryptosporidium, Giardia lamblia, or viruses.</p>
