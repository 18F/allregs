                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(3)</em>, reporting is waived for a  person (that would be a filer if not for the waiver) for an information  year if, for the plan year ending within the information year, the  aggregate 4010 funding shortfall for all plans (including any exempt  plans) maintained by the person's controlled group (disregarding those  plans with no 4010 funding shortfall) does not exceed $15 million.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other waiver authority. PBGC may waive the requirement to submit  information with respect to one or more filers or plans or may extend  the applicable due date or dates specified in Sec. 4010.10 of this part.  PBGC will exercise this discretion in appropriate cases where it finds  convincing evidence supporting a waiver or extension; any waiver or  extension may be subject to conditions. A request for a waiver or  extension must be filed in writing with PBGC at the address provided in  Sec. 4010.10(c) no later than 15 days before the applicable due date  specified in Sec. 4010.10 of this part, and must state the   facts and circumstances on which the request is based.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> 4010 funding shortfall for waivers and exemptions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General.  Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a plan's 4010  funding shortfall for a plan year equals the funding shortfall as  provided under ERISA section 303(c)(4) and Code section 430(c)(4)  determined as of the valuation date for the plan year, except that the  value of plan assets is determined without regard to the reduction under  ERISA section 303(f)(4)(B) and Code section 430(f)(4)(B) (dealing with  reduction of assets by the amount of prefunding and funding standard  carryover balances).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transition rule for plan years beginning before 2008. For plan  years beginning before 2008, a plan's 4010 funding shortfall for a plan  year equals the excess, if any, of the plan's current liability over the  value of plan assets. For this purpose, both current liability and plan  assets are determined in the manner provided in Sec. 4010.4(b)(3),  except that assets are not reduced by the credit balance in the funding  standard account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Multiple employer plans. For purposes of Sec. 4010.8(c) and  paragraph (a) of this section, the entire 4010 funding shortfall of any  multiple employer plan of which the filer or any member of the filer's  controlled group is a contributing sponsor is included.
