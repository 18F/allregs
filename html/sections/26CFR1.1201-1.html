For taxable  years beginning after December 31, 1954, and before January 1, 1958, the  alternative tax imposed by section 1201(a) shall also be in lieu of the  tax imposed by section 802(a), as amended by the Life Insurance Company  Tax Act for 1955 (70 Stat. 38), if such alternative tax is less than the  tax imposed by such section. See section 802(e), as added by the Life  Insurance Company Tax Act for 1955 (70 Stat. 39).

For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A binding contract entered into on or before October 9, 1969,  means a contract, whether written or unwritten, which on or before that  date was legally enforceable against the taxpayer under applicable law.  If on or before October 9, 1969, a taxpayer grants an irrevocable option  or irrevocable contractual right to another party to buy certain  property and such other party exercises that option or right after  October 9, 1969, the sale of such property is a sale pursuant to a  binding contract entered into on or before October 9, 1969. The  application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following  example:</p><p class="depth0">Example: During 1964, A, B, and C formed a closely held corporation,  and A was appointed as president of the organization. On July 1, 1964, A  received for consideration 100 shares of common stock in the corporation  subject to the agreement that, if A should retire from the management of  the corporation or die, A or his estate would first offer his shares of  stock to the corporation for purchase and that, if the corporation did  not buy the stock within 60 days, the stock could be sold to any party  other than the corporation. On September 1, 1970, A retired from the  management of the corporation and offered his shares to the corporation  for purchase. Pursuant to the agreement, the corporation purchased A's  stock on September 30, 1970. A's sale of such stock was pursuant to a  binding contract entered into on or before October 9, 1969.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A contract which pursuant to subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph constitutes a binding contract entered into on or before  October 9, 1969, does not cease to qualify as such a contract by reason  of the fact that after October 9, 1969, there is a modification of the  terms of the contract such as a change in the time of performance, or in  the amount of the debt or in the terms and mode of payment, or in the  rate of interest, or there is a change in the form or nature of the  obligation or the character of the security, so long as the taxpayer is  at all times on and after October 9, 1969, legally bound by such  contract. The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On August 1, 1969, A sold certain capital assets to B on  the installment plan and elected to return the gain therefrom under  section 453, the agreement providing for payments over a period of 2  years. At the time of the sale these assets had been held by A for more  than 6 months. On July 31, 1970, A and B agreed to a modification of the  terms of payment under the sales agreement, the only change in the  contract being that the installment payments due after July 31, 1970,  would be paid over a 3-year period. For purposes of this paragraph the  payments received by A after July 31, 1970, are considered amounts  received from the sale on August 1, 1969. (See section 483 for rules  with respect to interest on deferred payments.)</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On April 1, 1969, A sold certain capital assets to B on  the installment plan and elected to return the gain therefrom under  section 453, the agreement providing   for payments over a period of 3 years. At the time of the sale these  assets had been held by A for more than 6 months. On March 31, 1970, C  assumed B's obligation to pay the balance of the installments which were  due after that date. For purposes of this paragraph any installment  payments received by A after March 31, 1970, from C are considered  amounts received from a sale made on or before October 9, 1969.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. On May 1, 1969, A offers to sell certain capital assets  to B if B accepts the offer within 1 year, unless it is previously  withdrawn by A. B accepts the offer on November 1, 1969, and the  transaction is consummated shortly thereafter. For purposes of this  paragraph, any payment received by A pursuant to the sale is not  considered an amount received from a sale made on or before October 9,  1969, or from a sale pursuant to a binding contract entered into on or  before that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An amount which is considered under section 402(a)(2) or  403(a)(2) as gain of the taxpayer from the sale or exchange of a capital  asset held for more than 6 months shall be treated as gain subject to  the provisions of section 1201 (d)(1) and subdivision (i) of such  subparagraph, but only if on or before October 9, 1969, (a) the employee  with respect to whom such amount is distributed or paid, died or was  otherwise separated from the service, and (b) the terms of the plan  required, or the employee elected, that total distributions or amounts  payable be paid to the taxpayer within 1 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Gain described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2) with respect to a  partnership, estate, or trust, which is required to be included in the  gross income of a partner in such partnership, or of a beneficiary of  such estate or trust, shall be treated as such gain with respect to such  partner or beneficiary. Thus, for example, if during 1974 a partnership  which uses the calendar year as its taxable year receives amounts which  give rise to section 1201(d)(1) gain, a partner who uses the fiscal year  ending June 30 as his taxable year shall treat his distributive share of  such gain as subsection (d) gain for his taxable year ending June 30,  1975, even though such share is distributed to him after December 31,  1974. See Sec. 1.706-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> An individual shall be considered married for purposes of  subdivision (iii) of such subparagraph if for the taxable year he may  elect with his spouse to make a joint return under section 6013(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> In applying such subparagraph for purposes of section 21(a) (1)  long-term capital gains arising from amounts received before January 1,  1970, shall be taken into account if such amounts are received during  the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Illustrations. The application of this section may be  illustrated by the following examples in which the assumption is made  that section 56 (relating to minimum tax for tax preferences) does not  apply:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, a single individual, has for the calendar year 1954  taxable income (exclusive of capital gains and losses) of $99,400. He  realizes in 1954 a gain of $50,000 on the sale of a capital asset held  for 19 months and sustains a loss of $20,000 on the sale of a capital  asset held for 5 months. He had no other capital gains or losses. Since  the alternative tax is less than the tax otherwise computed under  section 1, the tax payable is the alternative tax, that is $74,298. The  tax is computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Tax Under Section 1 Taxable income exclusive of capital gains and losses.........    $99,400 Net long-term capital gain (100 percent of            $50,000</p><p class="depth0">$50,000).........................................

A husband and wife, who file a joint return for the  calendar year 1970, have taxable income (exclusive of capital gains and  losses) of $100,000.

Since the alternative tax under section  1201(b) is less than the tax otherwise computed under section 1, the tax  payable for 1970 is the alternative tax, that is, $97,430 plus the tax  surcharge under section 51. The tax (without regard to the tax  surcharge) is computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Tax Under Section 1 Taxable income exclusive of capital gains and losses.........   $100,000 Net section 1201 gain (net capital gain for taxable years        200,000</p><p class="depth0">beginning after December 31, 1976) (excess of net long-term</p><p class="depth0">capital gain over the net short-term capital loss)..........</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0">Total....................................................    300,000 Deduction of 50 percent of net section 1201 (net capital gain    100,000</p><p class="depth0">for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) gain</p><p class="depth0">(section 1202)..............................................</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0">Taxable income...........................................    200,000</p><p class="depth0">============ Tax under section 1..........................................    110,980</p><p class="depth0">Alternative Tax Under Section 1201(b) (1) Net section 1201 gain (net capital gain for taxable years   $200,000</p><p class="depth0">beginning after December 31, 1976)..........................</p><p class="depth0">------------ (2) Subsection (d) gain:</p><p class="depth0">Section 1201(d)(1).........................................    100,000</p><p class="depth0">Section 1201(d)(2).........................................     50,000</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0">Total subsection (d) gain................................    150,000</p><p class="depth0">============ (3) Net section 1201 (net capital gain for taxable years          50,000</p><p class="depth0">beginning after December 31, 1976) gain in excess of</p><p class="depth0">subsection (d) gain ($200,000 less $150,000)................</p><p class="depth0">------------ (4) Tax under section 1201(b)(1):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Taxable income..............................   $200,000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Less: 50% of item (1)......................    100,000</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Amount subject to tax under section           100,000</p><p class="depth0">1201(b)(1).....................................</p><p class="depth0">===========</p><p class="depth0">Partial tax (computed under section 1)...................     45,180 (5) Tax under section 1201(b)(2): (25% of item (1) or of item     37,500</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, whichever is lesser [25% of $150,000]).................

A husband and wife, who file a joint return for the  calendar year 1971, have taxable income (exclusive of capital gains and  losses) of $80,000. In 1971 they realize long-term capital gain of  $30,000 arising from a sale consummated on July 1, 1969, the income from  which is returned on the installment method under section 453. From  securities transactions in 1971 they have long-term capital gains of  60,000 and a short-term capital loss of $10,000. Since the alternative  tax under section 1201(b) is less than the tax otherwise computed under  section 1, the tax payable is the alternative tax, that is, $55,140. The  tax is computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Tax Under Section 1 Taxable income exclusive of capital gains and losses.........    $80,000 Net long-term capital gains (100% of $90,000).....    $90,000</p><p class="depth0">Net short-term capital loss (100% of $10,000)...     10,000</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Net section 1201 gain (net capital gain for taxable years       80,000</p><p class="depth0">beginning after December 31, 1976)........................</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0">Total....................................................    160,000 Deduction of 50% of net section 1201 gain (net capital gain       40,000</p><p class="depth0">for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976)</p><p class="depth0">(section 1202)..............................................</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0">Taxable income...........................................    120,000</p><p class="depth0">============ Tax under section 1..........................................     57,580</p><p class="depth0">Alternative Tax Under Section 1201(b) (1) Net section 1201 gain (net capital gain for taxable years    $80,000</p><p class="depth0">beginning after December 31, 1976)..........................</p><p class="depth0">------------ (2) Subsection (d) gain:</p><p class="depth0">Section 1201(d)(1).........................................     30,000</p><p class="depth0">Section 1201(d)(2).........................................</p><p class="depth0">Section 1201(d)(3) ($50,000 less $30,000)..................     20,000</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0">Total subsection (d) gain................................     50,000</p><p class="depth0">============ (3) Net section 1201 (net capital gain for taxable years          30,000</p><p class="depth0">beginning after December 31, 1976) gain in excess of</p><p class="depth0">subsection (d) gain ($80,000 less $50,000)..................</p><p class="depth0">------------ (4) Tax under section 1201(b)(1):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Taxable income..............................   $120,000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Less: 50% of item (1)......................     40,000</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Amount subject to tax under section            80,000</p><p class="depth0">1201(b)(1).....................................</p><p class="depth0">===========</p><p class="depth0">Partial tax (computed under section 1)...................     33,340 (5) Tax under section 1201(b)(2): (25% of item (1) or of item     12,500</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, whichever is lesser [25% of $50,000])..................

A husband and wife, who file a joint return for the  calendar year 1973, have taxable income (exclusive of capital gains and  losses) of $250,000. In 1973 they realize long-term capital gains (not  described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2)) of $140,000 and a short-term  capital loss of $50,000. Since the alternative tax under section 1201(b)  is less than the tax otherwise computed under section 1, the tax payable  is the alternative tax, that is, $172,480.
