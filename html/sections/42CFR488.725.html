                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basic rule. All HHA surveys must be unannounced and conducted with procedures and scheduling that renders the onsite surveys as unpredictable in their timing as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> State survey agency's scheduling and surveying procedures. CMS reviews each survey agency's scheduling and surveying procedures and practices to assure that the survey agency has taken all reasonable steps to avoid giving notice of a survey through the scheduling procedures and conduct of the surveys.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Civil money penalties. Any individual who notifies an HHA, or causes an HHA to be notified, of the time or date on which a standard survey is scheduled to be conducted is subject to a Federal civil money penalty not to exceed $2,000.</p>
