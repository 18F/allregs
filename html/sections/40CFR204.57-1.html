The test request will also provide for situations in which the selected configuration or category is unavailable for testing. The test request may include an alternative category or configuration selected for testing in the event that compressors of the first specified category or configuration are not available for testing because the compressors are not being manufactured at the specified plant and/or are not being manufactured during the specified time or not being stored at the specified plant or storage facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any manufacturer shall, upon receipt of the test request, select and test a batch sample of compressors from two consecutively produced batches of the compressor category or configurations specified in the test request in accordance with these regulations and the conditions specified in the test request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> Any testing conducted by the manufacturer pursuant to a test request shall be initiated within such period as is specified in the test request; Except, that such initiation may be delayed for increments of 24 hours or one business day where ambient test site weather conditions in any 24-hour period do not permit testing: Provided, That ambient test site weather conditions for that period are recorded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any testing conducted by the manufacturer pursuant to a test request shall be initiated within such period as is specified in the test request; Except, that such initiation may be delayed for increments of 24 hours or one business day where ambient test site weather conditions in any 24-hour period do not permit testing: Provided, That ambient test site weather conditions for that period are recorded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The manufacturer shall complete noise emission testing on a minimum of five compressors per day, unless otherwise provided for by the Administrator or unless ambient test site conditions only permit the testing of a lesser number: Provided, That ambient test site weather conditions for that period are recorded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The manufacturer will be allowed 24 hours to ship compressors from a batch sample from the assembly plant to the testing facility if the facility is not located at the plant or in close proximity to the plant; Except, that the Administrator may approve more
