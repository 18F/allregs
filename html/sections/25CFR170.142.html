BIA annually solicits proposals from tribes for use of these funds. Proposals are processed under 25 CFR part 181. Tribes may obtain a contract or agreement under ISDEAA for these projects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> FHWA provides funds to the States under 23 U.S.C. 402, 405, 408, and 410. States annually solicit proposals

from tribes and local governments. Tribes may request:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To administer these programs under the State's locally administered project program; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That for projects that are otherwise contractible under Public Law 93-638 (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.), that the State return the funds to FHWA and have them transferred to BIA for tribal self-determination contracts or self-governance agreements under ISDEAA.</p>
