                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Procedure. A party to an appeal may be represented in any matter related to the appeal. Parties may designate a representative, revoke such a designation, and change such a designation in a signed submission, submitted as a pleading.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A party may choose any representative as long as that person is willing and available to serve. The other party or parties may challenge the designation, however, on the ground that it involves a conflict of interest or a conflict of position. Any party who challenges the designation must do so by filing a motion with the judge within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of designation or 15 days after a party becomes aware of the conflict. The judge will rule on the motion before considering the merits of the appeal. These procedures apply equally to each designation of representative, regardless of whether the representative was the first one designated by a party or a subsequently designated representative. If a representative is disqualified, the judge will give the party whose representative was disqualified a reasonable time to obtain another one.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The judge, on his or her own motion, may disqualify a party's representative on the grounds described in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e) of Sec. 1201.43 of this part, a judge may exclude a representative from all or any portion of the proceeding before him or her for contumacious conduct

or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.
