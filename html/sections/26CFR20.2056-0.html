Property interests which passed from a decedent to  his surviving spouse fall within two general categories:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Those with respect to which the marital deduction is authorized,  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Those with respect to which the marital deduction is not  authorized.  These categories are referred to in this section and other sections of  the regulations under section 2056 as ``deductible interests'' and  ``nondeductible interests'', respectively (see paragraph (b) of this  section). Subject to any applicable limitations set forth in Sec.  20.2056(a)-1(c), the amount of the marital deduction is the aggregate  value of the deductible interests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Deductible interests. An interest passing to a decedent's  surviving spouse is a ``deductible interest'' if it does not fall within  one of the following categories of ``nondeductible interests'';</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any property interest which passed from the decedent to his  surviving spouse is a ``nondeductible interest'' to the extent it is not  included in the decedent's gross estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> for commissioners allowed to the  surviving spouse as executor are ``nondeductible interests''.

[T.D. 6296, 23 FR 4529, June 24, 1958; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as  amended by T.D. 8522, 59 FR 9649, Mar. 1, 1994]    Sec. 20.2056(b)-1  Marital deduction; limitation in case of life  estate or other ``terminable interest''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 2056(b) provides that no marital deduction  is allowed with respect to certain property interests, referred to  generally as ``terminable interests'', passing from a decedent to his  surviving spouse. The phrase ``terminable interest'' is defined in  paragraph (b) of this section. However, the fact that an interest in  property passing to a decedent's surviving spouse is a ``terminable  interest'' makes it nondeductible only (1) under the circumstances  described in paragraph (c) of this section, and (2) if it does not come  within one of the exceptions referred to in paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Terminable interests. A ``terminable interest'' in property is  an interest which will terminate or fail on the lapse of time or on the  occurrence or the failure to occur of some contingency. Life estates,  terms for years, annuities, patents, and copyrights are therefore  terminable interests. However, a bond, note, or similar contractual  obligation, the discharge of which would not have the effect of an  annuity or a term for years, is not a terminable interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Nondeductible terminable interests. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A property interest  which constitutes a terminable interest, as defined in paragraph (b) of  this section, is nondeductible if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Another interest in the same property passed from the decedent  to some other person for less than an adequate and full consideration in  money or money's worth, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> By reason of its passing, the other person or his heirs or  assigns may possess or enjoy any part of the property after the  termination or failure of the spouse's interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Even though a property interest which constitutes a terminable  interest is not nondeductible by reason of the rules stated in  subparagraph (1) of   this paragraph, such an interest is nondeductible if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The decedent has directed his executor or a trustee to acquire  such an interest for the decedent's surviving spouse (see further  paragraph (f) of this section), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Such an interest passing to the decedent's surviving spouse may  be satisfied out of a group of assets which includes a nondeductible  interest (see further Sec. 20.2056(b)-2. In this case, however, full  nondeductibility may not result.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exceptions. A property interest passing to a decedent's  surviving spouse is deductible (if it is not otherwise disqualified  under Sec. 20.2056(a)-2) even though it is a terminable interest, and  even though an interest therein passed from the decedent to another  person, if it is a terminable interest only because--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It is conditioned on the spouse's surviving for a limited  period, in the manner described in Sec. 20.2056(b)-3;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It is a right to income for life with a general power of  appointment, meeting the requirements set forth in Sec. 20.2056(b)-5;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> It consists of life insurance or annuity payments held by the  insurer with a general power of appointment in the spouse, meeting the  requirements set forth in Sec. 20.2056(b)-6;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> It is qualified terminable interest property, meeting the  requirements set forth in Sec. 20.2056(b)-7; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> It is an interest in a qualified charitable remainder trust in  which the spouse is the only noncharitable beneficiary, meeting the  requirements set forth in Sec. 20.2056(b)-8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Miscellaneous principles. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In determining whether an interest  passed from the decedent to some other person, it is immaterial whether  interests in the same property passed to the decedent's spouse and  another person at the same time, or under the same instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In determining whether an interest in the same property passed  from the decedent both to his surviving spouse and to some other person,  a distinction is to be drawn between ``property'', as such term is used  in section 2056, and an ``interest in property''. The term ``property''  refers to the underlying property in which various interests exist; each  such interest is not for this purpose to be considered as ``property''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whether or not an interest is nondeductible because it is a  terminable interest is to be determined by reference to the property  interests which actually passed from the decedent. Subsequent  conversions of the property are immaterial for this purpose. Thus, where  a decedent bequeathed his estate to his wife for life with remainder to  his children, the interest which passed to his wife is a nondeductible  interest, even though the wife agrees with the children to take a  fractional share of the estate in fee in lieu of the life interest in  the whole, or sells the life estate for cash, or acquires the remainder  interest of the children either by purchase or gift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The terms passed from the decedent, passed from the decedent to  his surviving spouse and passed from the decedent to a person other than  his surviving spouse are defined in Sec. Sec. 20.2056(c)-1 through  20.2056(c)-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Direction to acquire a terminable interest. No marital deduction  is allowed with respect to a property interest which a decedent directs  his executor or a trustee to covert after his death into a terminable  interest for his surviving spouse. The marital deduction is not allowed  even though no interest in the property subject to the terminable  interest passes to another person and even though the interest would  otherwise come within the exceptions described in Sec. Sec. 20.2056(b)- 5 and 20.2056(b)-6 (relating to life estates and life insurance and  annuity payments with powers of appointment). However, a general  investment power, authorizing investments in both terminable interests  and other property, is not a direction to invest in a terminable  interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Examples. The application of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples. In each example, it is assumed that the executor  made no election under section 2056(b)(7) (even if under the specific  facts the election would have been available), that any property  interest passing from the decedent to a person other than the surviving  spouse passed for less than full and adequate consideration in money   or money's worth, and that section 2056(b)(8) is inapplicable.</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). H (the decedent) devised real property to W (his  surviving wife) for life, with remainder to A and his heirs. The  interest which passed from H to W is a nondeductible interest since it  will terminate upon her death and A (or his heirs or assigns) will  thereafter possess or enjoy the property.</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). H bequeathed the residue of his estate in trust for the  benefit of W and A. The trust income is to be paid to W for life, and  upon her death the corpus is to be distributed to A or his issue.  However, if A should die without issue, leaving W surviving, the corpus  is then to be distributed to W. The interest which passed from H to W is  a nondeductible interest since it will terminate in the event of her  death if A or his issue survive, and A or his issue will thereafter  possess or enjoy the property.</p><p class="depth0">Example (3). H during his lifetime purchased an annuity contract  providing for payments to himself for life and then to W for life if she  should survive him. Upon the death of the survivor of H and W, the  excess, if any, of the cost of the contract over the annuity payments  theretofore made was to be refunded to A. The interest which passed from  H to W is a nondeductible interest since A may possess or enjoy a part  of the property following the termination of the interest of W. If,  however, the contract provided for no refund upon the death of the  survivor of H and W, or provided that any refund was to go to the estate  of the survivor, then the interest which passed from H to W is (to the  extent it is included in H's gross estate) a deductible interest.</p><p class="depth0">Example (4). H, in contemplation of death, transferred a residence  to A for life with remainder to W provided W survives A, but if W  predeceases A, the property is to pass to B and his heirs. If it is  assumed that H died during A's lifetime, and the value of the residence  was included in determining the value of his gross estate, the interest  which passed from H to W is a nondeductible interest since it will  terminate if W predeceases A and the property will thereafter be  possessed or enjoyed by B (or his heirs or assigns). This result is not  affected by B's assignment of his interest during H's lifetime, whether  made in favor of W or another person, since the term ``assigns'' (as  used in section 2056(b)(1)(B)) includes such an assignee. However, if it  is assumed that A predeceased H, the interest of B in the property was  extinguished, and, viewed as of the time of the subsequent death of H,  the interest which passed from him to W is the entire interest in the  property and, therefore, a deductible interest.</p><p class="depth0">Example (5). H transferred real property to A by gift (reserving the  right to the rentals of the property for a term of 20 years. H died  within the 20-year term, bequeathing the right to the remaining rentals  to a trust for the benefit of W. The terms of the trust satisfy the five  conditions stated in Sec. 20.2056(b)-5, so that the property interest  which passed in trust is considered to have passed from H to W. However,  the interest is a nondeductible interest since it will terminate upon  the expiration of the term and A will thereafter possess or enjoy the  property.</p><p class="depth0">Example (6). H bequeathed a patent to W and A as tenants in common.  In this case, the interest of W will terminate upon the expiration of  the term of the patent, but possession or enjoyment of the property by A  must necessarily cease at the same time. Therefore, since A's possession  or enjoyment cannot outlast the termination of W's interest, the latter  is a deductible interest.</p><p class="depth0">Example (7). A decedent bequeathed $100,000 to his wife, subject to  a direction to his executor to use the bequest for the purchase of an  annuity for the wife. The bequest is a nondeductible interest.</p><p class="depth0">Example (8). Assume that pursuant to local law an allowance for  support is payable to the decedent's surviving spouse during the period  of the administration of the decedent's estate, but that upon her death  or remarriage during such period her right to any further allowance will  terminate. Assume further that the surviving spouse is sole beneficiary  of the decedent's estate. Under such circumstances, the allowance  constitutes a deductible interest since any part of the allowance not  receivable by the surviving spouse during her lifetime will pass to her  estate under the terms of the decedent's will. If, in this example, the  decedent bequeathed only one-third of his residuary estate to his  surviving spouse, then two-thirds of the allowance for support would  constitute a nondeductible terminable interest.  [T.D. 6296, 23 FR 4529, June 24, 1958; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as  amended by T.D. 8522, 59 FR 9649, Mar. 1, 1994]    Sec. 20.2056(b)-2  Marital deduction; interest in unidentified assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 2056(b)(2) provides that if an interest  passing to a decedent's surviving spouse may be satisfied out of assets  (or their proceeds) which include a particular asset that would be a  nondeductible interest if it passed from the decedent to his spouse, the  value of the interest passing to the spouse is reduced, for the purpose  of the marital deduction, by the value of the particular asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(2)</em> to apply, two circumstances must coexist, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The property interest which passed from the decedent to his  surviving spouse must be payable out of a group of assets included in  the gross estate. Examples of property interests payable out of a group  of assets are a general legacy, a bequest of the residue of the  decedent's estate or of a proportion of the residue, and a right to a  share of the corpus of a trust upon its termination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> is not applicable merely because the group  of assets includes a terminable interest, but would only be applicable  if the terminable interest were nondeductible under the provisions of  Sec. 20.2056(b)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Interest nondeductible if circumstances present. If both of the  circumstances set forth in paragraph (b) of this section are present,  the property interest payable out of the group of assets is (except as  to any excess of its value over the aggregate value of the particular  asset or assets which would not be deductible if passing specifically to  the surviving spouse) a nondeductible interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Example. The application of this section may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A decedent bequeathed one-third of the residue of his  estate to his wife. The property passing under the decedent's will  included a right to the rentals of an office building for a term of  years, reserved by the decedent under a deed of the building by way of  gift to his son. The decedent did not make a specific bequest of the  right to such rentals. Such right, if passing specifically to the wife,  would be a nondeductible interest (see example (5) of paragraph (g) of  Sec. 20.2056(b)-1). It is assumed that the value of the bequest of one- third of the residue of the estate to the wife was $85,000, and that the  right to the rentals was included in the gross estate at a value of  $60,000. If the decedent's executor had the right under the decedent's  will or local law to assign the entire lease in satisfaction of the  bequest, the bequest is a nondeductible interest to the extent of  $60,000. If the executor could only assign a one-third interest in the  lease in satisfaction of the bequest, the bequest is a nondeductible  interest to the extent of $20,000. If the decedent's will provided that  his wife's bequest could not be satisfied with a nondeductible interest,  the entire bequest is a deductible interest. If, in this example, the  asset in question had been foreign real estate not included in the  decedent's gross estate, the results would be the same.  [T.D. 6296, 23 FR 4529, June 24, 1958; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as  amended by T.D. 8522, 59 FR 9649, Mar. 1, 1994]    Sec. 20.2056(b)-3  Marital deduction; interest of spouse conditioned  on survival for limited period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Generally, no marital deduction is allowable if the  interest passing to the surviving spouse is a terminable interest as  defined in paragraph (b) of Sec. 20.2056(b)(1). However, section  2056(b)(3) provides an exception to this rule so as to allow a deduction  if (1) the only condition under which it will terminate is the death of  the surviving spouse within 6 months after the decedent's death, or her  death as a result of a common disaster which also resulted in the  decedent's death, and (2) the condition does not in fact occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(3)</em> will not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Common disaster. If a property interest passed from the decedent  to his surviving spouse subject to the condition that she does not die  as a result of a common disaster which also resulted in the decedent's  death, the exception provided by section 2056(b)(3) will not be applied  in the final audit of the return if there is still a possibility that  the surviving spouse may be deprived of the property interest by  operation of the common disaster provision as given effect by the local  law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The application of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). A decedent bequeathed his entire estate to his spouse  on condition that she survive him by 6 months. In the event his spouse  failed to survive him by 6 months, his estate was to go to his niece and  her heirs. The decedent was survived by his spouse. It will be observed  that, as of the time of the decedent's death, it was possible that the  niece would, by reason of the interest which passed to her from the  decedent possess or enjoy the estate after the termination of the  interest which passed to the spouse. Hence, under the general rule set  forth in Sec. 20.2056(b)-1, the interest which passed to the spouse  would be regarded as a nondeductible interest. If the surviving spouse  in fact died within 6 months after the decedent's death, that general  rule is to be applied, and the interest which passed to the spouse is a  nondeductible interest. However, if the spouse in fact survived the  decedent by 6 months, thus extinguishing the interest of the niece, the  case comes within the exception provided by section 2056(b)(3), and the  interest which passed to the spouse is a deductible interest. (It is  assumed for the purpose of this example that no other factor which would  cause the interest to be nondeductible is present.)</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). The facts are the same as in example (1) except that  the will provided that the estate was to go to the niece either in case  the decedent and his spouse should both die as a result of a common  disaster, or in case the spouse should fail to survive the decedent by 3  months. It is assumed that the decedent was survived by his spouse. In  this example, the interest which passed from the decedent to his  surviving spouse is to be regarded as a nondeductible interest if the  surviving spouse in fact died either within 3 months after the  decedent's death or as a result of a common disaster which also resulted  in the decedent's death. However, if the spouse in fact survived the  decedent by 3 months, and did not thereafter die as a result of a common  disaster which also resulted in the decedent's death, the exception  provided under section 2056(b)(3) will apply and the interest will be  deductible.</p><p class="depth0">Example (3). The facts are the same as in example (1) except that  the will provided that the estate was to go to the niece if the decedent  and his spouse should both die as a result of a common disaster and if  the spouse failed to survive the decedent by 3 months. If the spouse in  fact survived the decedent by 3 months, the interest of the niece is  extinguished, and the interest passing to the spouse is a deductible  interest.</p><p class="depth0">Example (4). A decedent devised and bequeathed his residuary estate  to his wife if she was living on the date of distribution of his estate.  The devise and bequest is a nondeductible interest even though  distribution took place within 6 months after the decedent's death and  the surviving spouse in fact survived the date of distribution.    Sec. 20.2056(b)-4  Marital deduction; valuation of interest passing  to surviving spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(3)</em> of Sec. 20.2032-1. The marital deduction may be taken only with  respect to the net value of any deductible interest which passed from  the decedent to his surviving spouse, the same principles being  applicable as if the amount of a gift to the spouse were being  determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Property interest subject to an encumbrance or obligation. If a  property interest passed from the decedent to his surviving spouse  subject to a mortgage or other encumbrance, or if an obligation is  imposed upon the surviving spouse by the decedent in connection with the  passing of a property interest, the value of the property interest is to  be reduced by the amount of the mortgage, other encumbrance, or  obligation. However, if under the terms of the decedent's will or under  local law the executor is required to discharge, out of other assets of  the decedent's estate, a mortgage or other encumbrance on property  passing from the decedent to his surviving spouse, or is required to  reimburse the surviving spouse for the amount of the mortgage or other  encumbrance, the payment or reimbursement constitutes an additional  interest passing to the surviving spouse. The passing of a property  interest subject to the imposition of an obligation by the decedent does  not include a bequest, devise, or transfer in lieu of dower, curtesy, or  of a statutory estate created in lieu of dower or curtesy, or of other  marital rights in the decedent's property or estate. The passing of a  property interest subject to the imposition of an obligation by the  decedent does, however, include a bequest, etc., in lieu of the interest  of his surviving spouse under community property laws unless such  interest was,   immediately prior to the decedent's death, a mere expectancy. The  following examples are illustrative of property interests which passed  from the decedent to his surviving spouse subject to the imposition of  an obligation by the decedent:</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). A decedent devised a residence valued at $25,000 to his  wife, with a direction that she pay $5,000 to his sister. For the  purpose of the marital deduction, the value of the property interest  passing to the wife is only $20,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). A decedent devised real property to his wife in  satisfaction of a debt owing to her. The debt is a deductible claim  under section 2053. Since the wife is obligated to relinquish the claim  as a condition to acceptance of the devise, the value of the devise is,  for the purpose of the marital deduction, to be reduced by the amount of  the claim.</p><p class="depth0">Example (3). A decedent bequeathed certain securities to his wife in  lieu of her interest in property held by them as community property  under the law of the State of their residence. The wife elected to  relinquish her community property interest and to take the bequest. For  the purpose of the marital deduction, the value of the bequest is to be  reduced by the value of the community property interest relinquished by  the wife.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effect of death taxes. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the determination of the value of  any property interest which passed from the decedent to his surviving  spouse, there must be taken into account the effect which the Federal  estate tax, or any estate, succession, legacy, or inheritance tax, has  upon the net value to the surviving spouse of the property interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For example, assume that the only bequest to the surviving  spouse is $100,000 and the spouse is required to pay a State inheritance  tax in the amount of $1,500. If no other death taxes affect the net  value of the bequest, the value, for the purpose of the marital  deduction, is $98,500.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> As another example, assume that a decedent devised real property  to his wife having a value for Federal estate tax purposes of $100,000  and also bequeathed to her a nondeductible interest for life under a  trust. The State of residence valued the real property at $90,000 and  the life interest at $30,000, and imposed an inheritance tax (at  graduated rates) of $4,800 with respect to the two interests. If it is  assumed that the inheritance tax on the devise is required to be paid by  the wife, the amount of tax to be ascribed to the devise is:  (90,000/120,000)x$4,800=$3,600.   Accordingly, if no other death taxes affect the net value of the  bequest, the value, for the purpose of the marital deduction, is  $100,000 less $3,600, or $96,400.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the decedent bequeaths his residuary estate, or a portion of  it, to his surviving spouse, and his will contains a direction that all  death taxes shall be payable out of the residuary estate, the value of  the bequest, for the purpose of the marital deduction, is based upon the  amount of the residue as reduced pursuant to such direction, if the  residuary estate, or a portion of it, is bequeathed to the surviving  spouse, and by the local law the Federal estate tax is payable out of  the residuary estate, the value of the bequest, for the purpose of the  marital deduction, may not exceed its value as reduced by the Federal  estate tax. Methods of computing the deduction, under such  circumstances, are set forth in supplemental instructions to the estate  tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effect of administration expenses--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Management expenses. Estate management expenses are expenses that are  incurred in connection with the investment of estate assets or with  their preservation or maintenance during a reasonable period of  administration. Examples of these expenses could include investment  advisory fees, stock brokerage commissions, custodial fees, and  interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transmission expenses. Estate transmission expenses are  expenses that would not have been incurred but for the decedent's death  and the consequent necessity of collecting the decedent's assets, paying  the decedent's debts and death taxes, and distributing the decedent's  property to those who are entitled to receive it. Estate transmission  expenses include any administration expense that is not a management  expense. Examples of these expenses could include executor commissions  and attorney fees (except to the   extent of commissions or fees specifically related to investment,  preservation, or maintenance of the assets), probate fees, expenses  incurred in construction proceedings and defending against will  contests, and appraisal fees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Marital share. The marital share is the property or interest  in property that passed from the decedent for which a deduction is  allowable under section 2056(a). The marital share includes the income  produced by the property or interest in property during the period of  administration if the income, under the terms of the governing  instrument or applicable local law, is payable to the surviving spouse  or is to be added to the principal of the property interest passing to,  or for the benefit of, the surviving spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effect of transmission expenses. For purposes of determining the  marital deduction, the value of the marital share shall be reduced by  the amount of the estate transmission expenses paid from the marital  share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effect of management expenses attributable to the marital share.  For purposes of determining the marital deduction, the value of the  marital share shall not be reduced by the amount of the estate  management expenses attributable to and paid from the marital share.  Pursuant to section 2056(b)(9), however, the amount of the allowable  marital deduction shall be reduced by the amount of any such management  expenses that are deducted under section 2053 on the decedent's Federal  estate tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effect of management expenses not attributable to the marital  share. For purposes of determining the marital deduction, the value of  the marital share shall be reduced by the amount of the estate  management expenses paid from the marital share but attributable to a  property interest not included in the marital share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (d):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. The decedent dies after 2006 having made no lifetime  gifts. The decedent makes a bequest of shares of ABC Corporation stock  to the decedent's child. The bequest provides that the child is to  receive the income from the shares from the date of the decedent's  death. The value of the bequeathed shares on the decedent's date of  death is $3,000,000. The residue of the estate is bequeathed to a trust  for which the executor properly makes an election under section  2056(b)(7) to treat as qualified terminable interest property. The value  of the residue on the decedent's date of death, before the payment of  administration expenses and Federal and State estate taxes, is  $6,000,000. Under applicable local law, the executor has the discretion  to pay administration expenses from the income or principal of the  residuary estate. All estate taxes are to be paid from the residue. The  State estate tax equals the State death tax credit available under  section 2011.</p><p class="depth0">During the period of administration, the estate incurs estate  transmission expenses of $400,000, which the executor charges to the  residue. For purposes of determining the marital deduction, the value of  the residue is reduced by the Federal and State estate taxes and by the  estate transmission expenses. If the transmission expenses are deducted  on the Federal estate tax return, the marital deduction is $3,500,000  ($6,000,000 minus $400,000 transmission expenses and minus $2,100,000  Federal and State estate taxes). If the transmission expenses are  deducted on the estate's Federal income tax return rather than on the  estate tax return, the marital deduction is $3,011,111 ($6,000,000 minus  $400,000 transmission expenses and minus $2,588,889 Federal and State  estate taxes).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that,  instead of incurring estate transmission expenses, the estate incurs  estate management expenses of $400,000 in connection with the residue  property passing for the benefit of the spouse. The executor charges  these management expenses to the residue. In determining the value of  the residue passing to the spouse for marital deduction purposes, a  reduction is made for Federal and State estate taxes payable from the  residue but no reduction is made for the estate management expenses. If  the management expenses are deducted on the estate's income tax return,  the net value of the property passing to the spouse is $3,900,000  ($6,000,000 minus $2,100,000 Federal and State estate taxes). A marital  deduction is claimed for that amount, and the taxable estate is  $5,100,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the  estate management expenses of $400,000 are incurred in connection with  the bequest of ABC Corporation stock to the decedent's child. The  executor charges these management expenses to the residue. For purposes  of determining the marital deduction, the value of the residue is  reduced by the Federal and State estate taxes and by the management  expenses. The management expenses reduce the value of   the residue because they are charged to the property passing to the  spouse even though they were incurred with respect to stock passing to  the child. If the management expenses are deducted on the estate's  Federal income tax return, the marital deduction is $3,011,111  ($6,000,000 minus $400,000 management expenses and minus $2,588,889  Federal and State estate taxes). If the management expenses are deducted  on the estate's Federal estate tax return, rather than on the estate's  Federal income tax return, the marital deduction is $3,500,000  ($6,000,000 minus $400,000 management expenses and minus $2,100,000 in  Federal and State estate taxes).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The decedent, who dies in 2000, has a gross estate of  $3,000,000. Included in the gross estate are proceeds of $150,000 from a  policy insuring the decedent's life and payable to the decedent's child  as beneficiary. The applicable credit amount against the tax was fully  consumed by the decedent's lifetime gifts. Applicable State law requires  the child to pay any estate taxes attributable to the life insurance  policy. Pursuant to the decedent's will, the rest of the decedent's  estate passes outright to the surviving spouse. During the period of  administration, the estate incurs estate management expenses of $150,000  in connection with the property passing to the spouse. The value of the  property passing to the spouse is $2,850,000 ($3,000,000 less the  insurance proceeds of $150,000 passing to the child). For purposes of  determining the marital deduction, if the management expenses are  deducted on the estate's income tax return, the marital deduction is  $2,850,000 ($3,000,000 less $150,000) and there is a resulting taxable  estate of $150,000 ($3,000,000 less a marital deduction of $2,850,000).  Suppose, instead, the management expenses of $150,000 are deducted on  the estate's estate tax return under section 2053 as expenses of  administration. In such a situation, claiming a marital deduction of  $2,850,000 would be taking a deduction for the same $150,000 in property  under both sections 2053 and 2056 and would shield from estate taxes the  $150,000 in insurance proceeds passing to the decedent's child.  Therefore, in accordance with section 2056(b)(9), the marital deduction  is limited to $2,700,000, and the resulting taxable estate is $150,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The decedent dies after 2006 having made no lifetime  gifts. The value of the decedent's residuary estate on the decedent's  date of death is $3,000,000, before the payment of administration  expenses and Federal and State estate taxes. The decedent's will  provides a formula for dividing the decedent's residuary estate between  two trusts to reduce the estate's Federal estate taxes to zero. Under  the formula, one trust, for the benefit of the decedent's child, is to  be funded with that amount of property equal in value to so much of the  applicable exclusion amount under section 2010 that would reduce the  estate's Federal estate tax to zero. The other trust, for the benefit of  the surviving spouse, satisfies the requirements of section 2056(b)(7)  and is to be funded with the remaining property in the estate. The State  estate tax equals the State death tax credit available under section  2011. During the period of administration, the estate incurs  transmission expenses of $200,000. The transmission expenses of $200,000  reduce the value of the residue to $2,800,000. If the transmission  expenses are deducted on the Federal estate tax return, then the formula  divides the residue so that the value of the property passing to the  child's trust is $1,000,000 and the value of the property passing to the  marital trust is $1,800,000. The allowable marital deduction is  $1,800,000. The applicable exclusion amount shields from Federal estate  tax the entire $1,000,000 passing to the child's trust so that the  amount of Federal and State estate taxes is zero. Alternatively, if the  transmission expenses are deducted on the estate's Federal income tax  return, the formula divides the residue so that the value of the  property passing to the child's trust is $800,000 and the value of the  property passing to the marital trust is $2,000,000. The allowable  marital deduction is $2,000,000. The applicable exclusion amount shields  from Federal estate tax the entire $800,000 passing to the child's trust  so that the amount of Federal and State estate taxes remains zero.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. The facts are the same as in Example 5, except that the  decedent's will provides that the child's trust is to be funded with  that amount of property equal in value to the applicable exclusion  amount under section 2010 allowable to the decedent's estate. The  residue of the estate, after the payment of any debts, expenses, and  Federal and State estate taxes, is to pass to the marital trust. The  applicable exclusion amount in this case is $1,000,000, so the value of  the property passing to the child's trust is $1,000,000. After deducting  the $200,000 of transmission expenses, the residue of the estate is  $1,800,000 less any estate taxes. If the transmission expenses are  deducted on the Federal estate tax return, the allowable marital  deduction is $1,800,000, the taxable estate is zero, and the Federal and  State estate taxes are zero. Alternatively, if the transmission expenses  are deducted on the estate's Federal income tax return, the net value of  the property passing to the spouse is $1,657,874 ($1,800,000 minus  $142,106 estate taxes). A marital deduction is claimed for that amount,  the taxable estate is $1,342,106, and the Federal and State estate taxes  total $142,106.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. The decedent, who dies in 2000, makes an outright  pecuniary bequest of $3,000,000 to the decedent's surviving spouse, and  the residue of the estate, after the payment of all debts, expenses, and  Federal and   State estate taxes, passes to the decedent's child. Under the terms of  the governing instrument and applicable local law, a beneficiary of a  pecuniary bequest is not entitled to any income on the bequest. During  the period of administration, the estate pays estate transmission  expenses from the income earned by the property that will be distributed  to the surviving spouse in satisfaction of the pecuniary bequest. The  income earned on this property is not part of the marital share.  Therefore, the allowable marital deduction is $3,000,000, unreduced by  the amount of the estate transmission expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Effective date. The provisions of this paragraph (d) apply to  estates of decedents dying on or after December 3, 1999.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Remainder interests. If the income from property is made payable  to another individual for life, or for a term of years, with remainder  absolutely to the surviving spouse or to her estate, the marital  deduction is based upon the present value of the remainder. The present  value of the remainder is to be determined in accordance with the rules  stated in Sec. 20.2031-7. For example, if the surviving spouse is to  receive $50,000 upon the death of a person aged 31 years, the present  value of the remainder is $14,466. If the remainder is such that its  value is to be determined by a special computation (see paragraph (b) of  Sec. 20.2031-7), a request for a specific factor may be submitted to  the Commissioner. The request should be accompanied by a statement of  the date of birth of each person, the duration of whose life may affect  the value of the remainder, and copies of the relevant instruments. The  Commissioner may, if conditions permit, supply the factor requested. If  the Commissioner does not furnish the factor, the claim for deduction  must be supported by a full statement of the computation of the present  value made in accordance with the principles set forth in the applicable  paragraphs of Sec. 20.2031-7.

Section 2056(b)(5) provides that if an interest in  property passes from the decedent to his surviving spouse (whether or  not in trust) and the spouse is entitled for life to all the income from  the entire interest or all the income from a specific portion of the  entire interest, with a power in her to appoint the entire interest or  the specific portion, the interest which passes to her is a deductible  interest, to the extent that it satisfies all five of the conditions set  forth below (see paragraph (b) of this section if one or more of the  conditions is satisfied as to only a portion of the interest):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The surviving spouse must be entitled for life to all of the  income from the entire interest or a specific portion of the entire  interest, or to a specific portion of all the income from the entire  interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The income payable to the surviving spouse must be payable  annually or at more frequent intervals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The surviving spouse must have the power to appoint the entire  interest or the specific portion to either herself or her estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The power in the surviving spouse must be exercisable by her  alone and (whether exercisable by will or during life) must be  exercisable in all events.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The entire interest or the specific portion must not be subject  to a power in any other person to appoint any part to any person other  than the surviving spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Specific portion; deductible amount. If either the right to  income or the power of appointment passing to the surviving spouse  pertains only to a specific portion of a property interest passing from  the decedent, the marital deduction is allowed only to the extent that  the rights in the surviving spouse meet all of the five conditions  described in paragraph (a) of this section. While the rights over the  income and the power must coexist as to the same interest in property,  it is not necessary that the rights over the income or the power as to  such interest be in the same proportion. However, if the rights over  income meeting the required conditions set forth in paragraph (a) (1)   and (2) of the section extend over a smaller share of the property  interest than the share with respect to which the power of appointment  requirements set forth in paragraph (a) (3) through (5) of this section  are satisfied, the deductible interest is limited to the smaller share.  Correspondingly, if a power of appointment meeting all the requirements  extends to a smaller portion of the property interest than the portion  over which the income rights pertain, the deductible interest cannot  exceed the value of the portion to which such power of appointment  applies. Thus, if the decedent leaves to his surviving spouse the right  to receive annually all of the income from a particular property  interest and a power of appointment meeting the specifications  prescribed in paragraph (a) (3) through (5) of this section as to only  one-half of the property interest, then only one-half of the property  interest is treated as a deductible interest. Correspondingly, if the  income interest of the spouse satisfying the requirements extends to  only one-fourth of the property interest and a testamentary power of  appointment satisfying the requirements extends to all of the property  interest, then only one-fourth of the interest in the spouse qualifies  as a deductible interest. Further, if the surviving spouse has no right  to income from a specific portion of a property interest but a  testamentary power of appointment which meets the necessary conditions  over the entire interest, then none of the interest qualifies for the  deduction. In addition, if, from the time of the decedent's death, the  surviving spouse has a power of appointment meeting all of the required  conditions over three-fourths of the entire property interest and the  prescribed income rights over the entire interest, but with a power in  another person to appoint one-half of the entire interest, the value of  the interest in the surviving spouse over only one-half of the property  interest will qualify as a deductible interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Meaning of specific portion--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided  in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, a partial interest in  property is not treated as a specific portion of the entire interest. In  addition, any specific portion of an entire interest in property is  nondeductible to the extent the specific portion is subject to invasion  for the benefit of any person other than the surviving spouse, except in  the case of a deduction allowable under section 2056(b)(5), relating to  the exercise of a general power of appointment by the surviving spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fraction or percentage share. Under section 2056(b)(10), a  partial interest in property is treated as a specific portion of the  entire interest if the rights of the surviving spouse in income, and the  required rights as to the power described in Sec. 20.2056(b)-5(a),  constitute a fractional or percentage share of the entire property  interest, so that the surviving spouse's interest reflects its  proportionate share of the increase or decrease in the value of the  entire property interest to which the income rights and the power  relate. Thus, if the spouse's right to income and the spouse's power  extend to a specified fraction or percentage of the property, or the  equivalent, the interest is in a specific portion of the property. In  accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, if the spouse has the  right to receive the income from a specific portion of the trust  property (after applying paragraph (c)(3) of this section) but has a  power of appointment over a different specific portion of the property  (after applying paragraph (c)(3) of this section), the marital deduction  is limited to the lesser specific portion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rule in the case of estates of decedents dying on or  before October 24, 1992, and certain decedents dying after October 24,  1992, with wills or revocable trusts executed on or prior to that date.  </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of estates of decedents within the purview of the  effective date and transitional rules contained in paragraphs (c)(3)  (ii) and (iii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> if any  person other than the surviving spouse may receive, during the surviving  spouse's lifetime, any distribution of the property.

The following examples illustrate the application of  paragraphs (a) through (c)(4) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Spouse entitled to the lesser of an annuity or a fraction  of trust income. The decedent, D, died prior to October 24, 1992. D  bequeathed in trust 500 identical shares of X company stock, valued for  estate tax purposes at $500,000. The trust provides that during the  lifetime of D's spouse, S, the trustee is to pay annually to S the  lesser of one-half of the trust income or $20,000. Any trust income not  paid to S is to be accumulated in the trust and may not be distributed  during S's lifetime. S has a testamentary general power of appointment  over the entire trust principal. The applicable interest rate for  valuing annuities as of D's date of death under section 7520 is 10  percent. For purposes of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, S  is treated as receiving all of the income from the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> One half of the stock ($250,000); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> $200,000, the specific portion of the stock which, as  determined in accordance with Sec. 20.2056(b)-5(c)(3)(i)(A), would  produce annual income of $20,000 (20,000/.10). Accordingly, the marital  deduction is limited to $200,000 (200,000/500,000 or \2/5\ of the value  of the trust).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Spouse possesses power and income interest over different  specific portions of trust. The facts are the same as in Example 1  except that S's testamentary general power of appointment is exercisable  over only \1/4\ of the trust principal. Consequently, under section  2056(b)(5), the marital deduction is allowable only for the value of \1/ 4\ of the trust ($125,000); i.e., the lesser of the value of the portion  with respect to which S is deemed to be entitled to all of the income  (\2/5\ of the trust or $200,000), or the value of the portion with  respect to which S possesses the requisite power of appointment (\1/4\  of the trust or $125,000).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Power of appointment over pecuniary amount. The decedent,  D, died prior to October 24, 1992. D bequeathed property valued at  $400,000 for estate tax purposes in trust. The trustee is to pay  annually to D's spouse, S, one-fourth of the trust income. Any trust  income not paid to S is to be accumulated in the trust and may not be  distributed during S's lifetime. The will gives S a testamentary general  power of appointment over the sum of $160,000. Because D died prior to  October 24, 1992, S's power of appointment over $160,000 is treated as a  power of appointment over a specific portion of the entire trust  interest. The marital deduction allowable under section 2056(b)(5) is  limited to $100,000; that is, the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The value of the trust corpus ($400,000);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The value of the trust corpus over which S has a power of  appointment ($160,000); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> That specific portion of the trust with respect to which S is  entitled to all the income ($100,000).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Power of appointment over shares of stock constitutes a  power over a specific portion. Under D's will, 250 shares of Y company  stock were bequeathed in trust pursuant to which all trust income was  payable annually to S, D's spouse, for life. S was given a testamentary  general power of appointment over 100 shares of stock. The trust  provides that if the trustee sells the Y company stock, S's general  power of appointment is exercisable with respect to the sale proceeds or  the property in which the proceeds are reinvested. Because the amount of  property represented by a single share of stock would be altered if the  corporation split its stock, issued stock dividends, made a distribution  of capital, etc., a power to appoint 100 shares at the time of S's death  is not necessarily a power to appoint the entire interest that the 100  shares represented on the date of D's death. If it is shown that, under  local law, S has a general power to appoint not only the 100 shares  designated by D but also 100/250 of any distributions by the corporation  that are included in trust principal, the requirements of paragraph  (c)(2) of this section are satisfied and S is treated as having a  general power to appoint 100/250 of the entire interest in the 250  shares. In that case, the marital deduction is limited to 40 percent of  the trust principal. If local law does not give S that power, the 100  shares would not constitute a specific portion under Sec. 20.2056(b)- 5(c) (including Sec. 20.2056(b)-5(c)(3)(i)(B)). The nature of the asset  is such that a change in the capitalization of the corporation could  cause an alteration in the original value represented by the shares at  the time of D's death and, thus, it does not represent a specific  portion of the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Meaning of entire interest. Because a marital deduction is  allowed for each separate qualifying interest in property passing from  the decedent to the decedent's surviving spouse (subject to any  applicable limitations in Sec. 20.2056(a)-l(c)), for purposes of  paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, each property interest with  respect to which the surviving spouse received any rights is considered  separately in determining whether the surviving spouse's rights extend  to the entire interest or to a specific portion of the entire interest.  A property interest which consists of several identical units of  property (such as a block of 250 shares of stock, whether the ownership  is evidenced by one or several certificates) is considered one property  interest, unless certain of the units are to be segregated and accorded  different treatment, in which case each segregated group of items is  considered a separate property interest. The bequest of a specified sum  of money constitutes the bequest of a separate property interest if  immediately following distribution by the executor and thenceforth it,  and the investments made with it, must be so segregated or accounted for  as to permit its identification as a separate item of property. The  application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following  examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). The decedent transferred to a trustee three adjoining  farms, Blackacre, Whiteacre, and Greenacre. His will provided that  during the lifetime of the surviving spouse the trustee should pay her  all of the income from the trust. Upon her death, all of Blackacre, a  one-half interest in White- acre, and a one-third interest in Greenacre  were to be distributed to the person or persons appointed by her in her  will. The surviving spouse is considered as being entitled to all of the  income from the entire interest in Blackacre, all of the income from the  entire interest in Whiteacre, and all of the income from the entire  interest in Greenacre. She also is considered as having a power of  appointment over the entire interest in Blackacre, over one-half of the  entire interest in Whiteacre, and over one-third of the entire interest  in Greenacre.</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). The decedent bequeathed $250,000 to C, as trustee. C is  to invest the money and pay all of the income from the investments to W,  the decedent's surviving spouse, annually. W was given a general power,  exercisable by will, to appoint one-half of the corpus of the trust.  Here, immediately following distribution by the executor, the $250,000  will be sufficiently segregated to permit its identification as a  separate item, and the $250,000 will constitute an entire property  interest. Therefore, W has a right to income and a power of appointment  such that one-half of the entire interest is a deductible interest.</p><p class="depth0">Example (3). The decedent bequeathed 100 shares of Z corporation  stock to D, as trustee. W, the decedent's surviving spouse, is to  receive all of the income of the trust annually and is given a general  power, exercisable by will, to appoint out of the trust corpus the sum  of $25,000. In this case the $25,000 is not, immediately following  distribution, sufficiently segregated to permit its identification as a  separate item of property in which the surviving spouse has the entire  interest.   Therefore, the $25,000 does not constitute the entire interest in a  property for the purpose of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Application of local law. In determining whether or not the  conditions set forth in paragraph (a) (1) through (5) of this section  are satisfied by the instrument of transfer, regard is to be had to the  applicable provisions of the law of the jursidiction under which the  interest passes and, if the transfer is in trust, the applicable  provisions of the law governing the administration of the trust. For  example, silence of a trust instrument as to the frequency of payment  will not be regarded as a failure to satisfy the condition set forth in  paragraph (a)(2) of this section that income must be payable to the  surviving spouse annually or more frequently unless the applicable law  permits payment to be made less frequently than annually. The principles  outlined in this paragraph and paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section  which are applied in determining whether transfers in trust meet such  conditions are equally applicable in ascertaining whether, in the case  of interests not in trust, the surviving spouse has the equivalent in  rights over income and over the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Right to income. (1) If an interest is transferred in trust, the  surviving spouse is ``entitled for life to all of the income from the  entire interest or a specific portion of the entire interest'', for the  purpose of the condition set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section,  if the effect of the trust is to give her substantially that degree of  beneficial enjoyment of the trust property during her life which the  principles of the law of trusts accord to a person who is unqualifiedly  designated as the life beneficiary of a trust. Such degree of enjoyment  is given only if it was the decedent's intention, as manifested by the  terms of the trust instrument and the surrounding circumstances, that  the trust should produce for the surviving spouse during her life such  an income, or that the spouse should have such use of the trust property  as is consistent with the value of the trust corpus and with its  preservation. The designation of the spouse as sole income beneficiary  for life of the entire interest or a specific portion of the entire  interest will be sufficient to qualify the trust unless the terms of the  trust and the surrounding circumstances considered as a whole evidence  an intention to deprive the spouse of the requisite degree of enjoyment.  In determining whether a trust evidences that intention, the treatment  required or permitted with respect to individual items must be  considered in relation to the entire system provided for the  administration of the trust. In addition, the surviving spouse's  interest shall meet the condition set forth in paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this  section if the spouse is entitled to income as determined by applicable  local law that provides for a reasonable apportionment between the  income and remainder beneficiaries of the total return of the trust and  that meets the requirements of Sec. 1.643(b)-1 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the over-all effect of a trust is to give to the surviving  spouse such enforceable rights as will preserve to her the requisite  degree of enjoyment, it is immaterial whether that result is effected by  rules specifically stated in the trust instrument, or, in their absence,  by the rules for the management of the trust property and the allocation  of receipts and expenditures supplied by the State law. For example, a  provision in the trust instrument for amortization of bond premium by  appropriate periodic charges to interest will not disqualify the  interest passing in trust even though there is no State law specifically  authorizing amortization, or there is a State law denying amortization  which is applicable only in the absence of such a provision in the trust  instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of a trust, the rules to be applied by the trustee  in allocation of receipts and expenses between income and corpus must be  considered in relation to the nature and expected productivity of the  assets passing in trust, the nature and frequency of occurrence of the  expected receipts, and any provisions as to change in the form of  investments. If it is evident from the nature of the trust assets and  the rules provided for management of the trust that the allocation to  income of such receipts as rents, ordinary cash dividends, and interest  will give to the   spouse the substantial enjoyment during life required by the statute,  provisions that such receipts as stock dividends and proceeds from the  conversion of trust assets shall be treated as corpus will not  disqualify the interest passing in trust. Similarly, provision for a  depletion charge against income in the case of trust assets which are  subject to depletion will not disqualify the interest passing in trust,  unless the effect is to deprive the spouse of the requisite beneficial  enjoyment. The same principle is applicable in the case of depreciation,  trustees' commissions, and other charges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Provisions granting administrative powers to the trustee will  not have the effect of disqualifying an interest passing in trust unless  the grant of powers evidences the intention to deprive the surviving  spouse of the beneficial enjoyment required by the statute. Such an  intention will not be considered to exist if the entire terms of the  instrument are such that the local courts will impose reasonable  limitations upon the exercise of the powers. Among the powers which if  subject to reasonable limitations will not disqualify the interest  passing in trust are the power to determine the allocation or  apportionment of receipts and disbursements between income and corpus,  the power to apply the income or corpus for the benefit of the spouse,  and the power to retain the assets passing to the trust. For example, a  power to retain trust assets which consist substantially of unproductive  property will not disqualify the interest if the applicable rules for  the administration of the trust require, or permit the spouse to  require, that the trustee either make the property productive or convert  it within a reasonable time. Nor will such a power disqualify the  interest if the applicable rules for administration of the trust require  the trustee to use the degree of judgment and care in the exercise of  the power which a prudent man would use if he were owner of the trust  assets. Further, a power to retain a residence or other property for the  personal use of the spouse will not disqualify the interest passing in  trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> An interest passing in trust will not satisfy the condition set  forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section that the surviving spouse be  entitled to all the income if the primary purpose of the trust is to  safeguard property without providing the spouse with the required  beneficial enjoyment. Such trusts include not only trusts which  expressly provide for the accumulation of the income but also trusts  which indirectly accomplish a similar purpose. For example, assume that  the corpus of a trust consists substantially of property which is not  likely to be income producing during the life of the surviving spouse  and that the spouse cannot compel the trustee to convert or otherwise  deal with the property as described in subparagraph (4) of this  paragraph. An interest passing to such a trust will not qualify unless  the applicable rules for the administration require, or permit the  spouse to require, that the trustee provide the required beneficial  enjoyment such as by payments to the spouse out of other assets of the  trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If a trust is created during the decedent's life, it is  immaterial whether or not the interest passing in trust satisfied the  conditions set forth in paragraph (a) (1) through (5) of this section  prior to the decedent's death. If a trust may be terminated during the  life of the surviving spouse, under her exercise of a power of  appointment or by distribution of the corpus to her, the interest  passing in trust satisfies the condition set forth in paragraph (a)(1)  of this section (that the spouse be entitled to all the income) if she  (i) is entitled to the income until the trust terminates, or (ii) has  the right, exercisable in all events, to have the corpus distributed to  her at any time during her life.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> An interest passing in trust fails to satisfy the condition set  forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, that the spouse be entitled  to all the income, to the extent that the income is required to be  accumulated in whole or in part or may be accumulated in the discretion  of any person other than the surviving spouse; to the extent that the  consent of any person other than the surviving spouse is required as a  condition precedent to distribution of the income; or to the extent that  any person other than the surviving spouse   has the power to alter the terms of the trust so as to deprive her of  her right to the income. An interest passing in trust will not fail to  satisfy the condition that the spouse be entitled to all the income  merely because its terms provide that the right of the surviving spouse  to the income shall not be subject to assignment, alienation, pledge,  attachment or claims of creditors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> In the case of an interest passing in trust, the terms  ``entitled for life'' and ``payable annually or at more frequent  intervals,'' as used in the conditions set forth in paragraph (a) (1)  and (2) of this section, require that under the terms of the trust the  income referred to must be currently (at least annually; see paragraph  (e) of this section) distributable to the spouse or that she must have  such command over the income that it is virtually hers. Thus, the  conditions in paragraph (a) (1) and (2) of this section are satisfied in  this respect if, under the terms of the trust instrument, the spouse has  the right exercisable annually (or more frequently) to require  distribution to herself of the trust income, and otherwise the trust  income is to be accumulated and added to corpus. Similarly, as respects  the income for the period between the last distribution date and the  date of the spouse's death, it is sufficient if that income is subject  to the spouse's power to appoint. Thus, if the trust instrument provides  that income accrued or undistributed on the date of the spouse's death  is to be disposed of as if it had been received after her death, and if  the spouse has a power of appointment over the trust corpus, the power  necessarily extends to the undistributed income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> An interest is not to be regarded as failing to satisfy the  conditions set forth in paragraph (a) (1) and (2) of this section (that  the spouse be entitled to all the income and that it be payable annually  or more frequently) merely because the spouse is not entitled to the  income from estate assets for the period before distribution of those  assets by the executor, unless the executor is, by the decedent's will,  authorized or directed to delay distribution beyond the period  reasonably required for administration of the decedent's estate. As to  the valuation of the property interest passing to the spouse in trust  where the right to income is expressly postponed, see Sec. 20.2056(b)- 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Power of appointment in surviving spouse. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The conditions set  forth in paragraph (a) (3) and (4) of this section, that is, that the  surviving spouse must have a power of appointment exercisable in favor  of herself or her estate and exercisable alone and in all events are not  met unless the power of the surviving spouse to appoint the entire  interest or a specific portion of it falls within one of the following  categories:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A power so to appoint fully exercisable in her own favor at any  time following the decedent's death (as, for example, an unlimited power  to invade); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A power so to appoint exercisable in favor of her estate. Such  a power, if exercisable during life, must be fully exercisable at any  time during life, or, if exercisable by will, must be fully exercisable  irrespective of the time of her death (subject in either case to the  provisions of Sec. 20.2053(b)-3, relating to interests conditioned on  survival for a limited period); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A combination of the powers described under subdivisions (i)  and (ii) of this subparagraph. For example, the surviving spouse may,  until she attains the age of 50 years, have a power to appoint to  herself and thereafter have a power to appoint to her estate. However,  the condition that the spouse's power must be exercisable in all events  is not satisfied unless irrespective of when the surviving spouse may  die the entire interest or a specific portion of it will at the time of  her death be subject to one power or the other (subject to the exception  in Sec. 20.2053(b)-3, relating to interests contingent on survival for  a limited period).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The power of the surviving spouse must be a power to appoint the  entire interest or a specific portion of it as unqualified owner (and  free of the trust if a trust is involved, or free of the joint tenancy  if a joint tenancy is involved) or to appoint the entire interest or a  specific portion of it as a part of her estate (and free of the trust if  a trust is involved), that is, in effect, to dispose of it to whomsoever  she pleases. Thus, if the decedent devised property to a son and the  surviving spouse   as joint tenants with right of survivorship and under local law the  surviving spouse has a power of severance exercisable without consent of  the other joint tenant, and by exercising this power could acquire a  one-half interest in the property as a tenant in common, her power of  severance will satisfy the conditions set forth in paragraph (a)(3) of  this section that she have a power of appointment in favor of herself or  her estate. However, if the surviving spouse entered into a binding  agreement with the decedent to exercise the power only in favor of their  issue, that condition is not met. An interest passing in trust will not  be regarded as failing to satisfy the condition merely because takers in  default of the surviving spouse's exercise of the power are designated  by the decedent. The decedent may provide that, in default of exercise  of the power, the trust shall continue for an additional period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A power is not considered to be a power exercisable by a  surviving spouse alone and in all events as required by paragraph (a)(4)  of this section if the exercise of the power in the surviving spouse to  appoint the entire interest or a specific portion of it to herself or to  her estate requires the joinder or consent of any other person. The  power is not ``exercisable in all events'', if it can be terminated  during the life of the surviving spouse by any event other than her  complete exercise or release of it. Further, a power is not  ``exercisable in all events'' if it may be exercised for a limited  purpose only. For example, a power which is not exercisable in the event  of the spouse's remarriage is not exercisable in all events. Likewise,  if there are any restrictions, either by the terms of the instrument or  under applicable local law, on the exercise of a power to consume  property (whether or not held in trust) for the benefit of the spouse,  the power is not exercisable in all events. Thus, if a power of invasion  is exercisable only for the spouse's support, or only for her limited  use, the power is not exercisable in all events. In order for a power of  invasion to be exercisable in all events, the surviving spouse must have  the unrestricted power exercisable at any time during her life to use  all or any part of the property subject to the power, and to dispose of  it in any manner, including the power to dispose of it by gift (whether  or not she has power to dispose of it by will).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The power in the surviving spouse is exercisable in all events  only if it exists immediately following the decedent's death. For  example, if the power given to the surviving spouse is exercisable  during life, but cannot be effectively exercised before distribution of  the assets by the executor, the power is not exercisable in all events.  Similarly, if the power is exercisable by will, but cannot be  effectively exercised in the event the surviving spouse dies before  distribution of the assets by the executor, the power is not exercisable  in all events. However, an interest will not be disqualified by the mere  fact that, in the event the power is exercised during administration of  the estate, distribution of the property to the appointee will be  delayed for the period of administration. If the power is in existence  at all times following the decedent's death, limitations of a formal  nature will not disqualify an interest. Examples of formal limitations  on a power exercisable during life are requirements that an exercise  must be in a particular form, that it must be filed with a trustee  during the spouse's life, that reasonable notice must be given, or that  reasonable intervals must elapse between successive partial exercises.  Examples of formal limitations on a power exercisable by will are that  it must be exercised by a will executed by the surviving spouse after  the decedent's death or that exercise must be by specific reference to  the power.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the surviving spouse has the requisite power to appoint to  herself or her estate, it is immaterial that she also has one or more  lesser powers. Thus, if she has a testamentary power to appoint to her  estate, she may also have a limited power of withdrawal or of  appointment during her life. Similarly, if she has an unlimited power of  withdrawal, she may have a limited testamentary power.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Requirement of survival for a limited period. A power of  appointment in the surviving spouse will not be treated as failing to  meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section even   though the power may terminate, if the only conditions which would cause  the termination are those described in paragraph (a) of Sec.  20.2056(b)-3, and if those conditions do not in fact occur. Thus, the  entire interest or a specific portion of it will not be disqualified by  reason of the fact that the exercise of the power in the spouse is  subject to a condition of survivorship described in Sec. 20.2056(b)-3  if the terms of the condition, that is, the survivorship of the  surviving spouse, or the failure to die in a common disaster, are  fulfilled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Existence of a power in another. Paragraph (a)(5) of this  section provides that a transfer described in paragraph (a) is  nondeductible to the extent that the decedent created a power in the  trustee or in any other person to appoint a part of the interest to any  person other than the surviving spouse. However, only powers in other  persons which are in opposition to that of the surviving spouse will  cause a portion of the interest to fail to satisfy the condition set  forth in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Thus, a power in a trustee to  distribute corpus to or for the benefit of a surviving spouse will not  disqualify the trust. Similarly, a power to distribute corpus to the  spouse for the support of minor children will not disqualify the trust  if she is legally obligated to support such children. The application of  this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). Assume that a decedent created a trust, designating his  surviving spouse as income beneficiary for life with an unrestricted  power in the spouse to appoint the corpus during her life. The decedent  further provided that in the event the surviving spouse should die  without having exercised the power, the trust should continue for the  life of his son with a power in the son to appoint the corpus. Since the  power in the son could become exercisable only after the death of the  surviving spouse, the interest is not regarded as failing to satisfy the  condition set forth in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). Assume that the decedent created a trust, designating  his surviving spouse as income beneficiary for life and as donee of a  power to appoint by will the entire corpus. The decedent further  provided that the trustee could distribute 30 percent of the corpus to  the decedent's son when he reached the age of 35 years. Since the  trustee has a power to appoint 30 percent of the entire interest for the  benefit of a person other than the surviving spouse, only 70 percent of  the interest placed in trust satisfied the condition set forth in  paragraph (a)(5) of this section. If, in this case, the surviving spouse  had a power, exercisable by her will, to appoint only one-half of the  corpus as it was constituted at the time of her death, it should be  noted that only 35 percent of the interest placed in the trust would  satisfy the condition set forth in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.  [T.D. 6296, 23 FR 4529, June 24, 1958; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as  amended by T.D. 8522, 59 FR 9649, Mar. 1, 1994; T.D. 9102, 69 FR 20,  Jan. 2, 2004]    Sec. 20.2056(b)-6  Marital deduction; life insurance or annuity  payments with power of appointment in surviving spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 2056(b)(6) provides that an interest in  property passing from a decedent to his surviving spouse, which consists  of proceeds held by an insurer under the terms of a life insurance,  endowment, or annuity contract, is a ``deductible interest'' to the  extent that is satisfied all five of the following conditions (see  paragraph (b) of this section if one or more of the conditions is  satisfied as to only a portion of the proceeds):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The proceeds, or a specific portion of the proceeds, must be  held by the insurer subject to an agreement either to pay the entire  proceeds or a specific portion thereof in installments, or to pay  interest thereon, and all or a specific portion of the installments or  interest payable during the life of the surviving spouse must be payable  only to her.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The installments or interest payable to the surviving spouse  must be payable annually, or more frequently, commencing not later than  13 months after the decedent's death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The surviving spouse must have the power to appoint all or a  specific portion of the amounts so held by the insurer to either herself  or her estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The power in the surviving spouse must be exercisable by her  alone and (whether exercisable by will or during life) must be  exercisable in all events.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The amounts or the specific portion of the amounts payable under  such contract must not be subject to a power in any other person to  appoint   any part thereof to any person other than the surviving spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Specific portion; deductible interest. If the right to receive  interest or installment payments or the power of appointment passing to  the surviving spouse pertains only to a specific portion of the proceeds  held by the insurer, the marital deduction is allowed only to the extent  that the rights of the surviving spouse in the specific portion meet the  five conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section. While the  rights to interest, or to receive payment in installments, and the power  must coexist as to the proceeds of the same contract, it is not  necessary that the rights to each be in the same proportion. If the  rights to interest meeting the required conditions set forth in  paragraph (a) (1) and (2) of this section extend over a smaller share of  the proceeds than the share with respect to which the power of  appointment requirements set forth in paragraph (a) (3) through (5) of  this section are satisfied, the deductible interest is limited to the  smaller share. Similarly, if the portion of the proceeds payable in  installments is a smaller portion of the proceeds than the portion to  which the power of appointment meeting such requirements relates, the  deduction is limited to the smaller portion. In addition, if a power of  appointment meeting all the requirements extends to a smaller portion of  the proceeds than the portion over which the interest or installment  rights pertain, the deductible interest cannot exceed the value of the  portion to which such power of appointment applies. Thus, if the  contract provides that the insurer is to retain the entire proceeds and  pay all of the interest thereon annually to the surviving spouse and if  the surviving spouse has a power of appointment meeting the  specifications prescribed in paragraph (a) (3) through (5) of this  section, as to only one-half of the proceeds held, then only one-half of  the proceeds may be treated as a deductible interest. Correspondingly,  if the rights of the spouse to receive installment payments or interest  satisfying the requirements extend to only one-fourth of the proceeds  and a testamentary power of appointment satisfying the requirements of  paragraph (a) (3) through (5) of this section extends to all of the  proceeds, then only one-fourth of the proceeds qualifies as a deductible  interest. Further, if the surviving spouse has no right to installment  payments (or interest) over any portion of the proceeds but a  testamentary power of appointment which meets the necessary conditions  over the entire remaining proceeds, then none of the proceeds qualifies  for the deduction. In addition, if, from the time of the decedent's  death, the surviving spouse has a power of appointment meeting all of  the required conditions over three-fourths of the proceeds and the right  to receive interest from the entire proceeds, but with a power in  another person to appoint one-half of the entire proceeds, the value of  the interest in the surviving spouse over only one-half of the proceeds  will qualify as a deductible interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Applicable principles. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The principles set forth in paragraph  (c) of Sec. 20.2056(b)-5 for determining what constitutes a ``specific  portion of the entire interest'' for the purpose of section 2056(b)(5)  are applicable in determining what constitutes a ``specific portion of  all such amounts'' for the purpose of section 2056(b)(6). However, the  interest in the proceeds passing to the surviving spouse will not be  disqualified by the fact that the installment payments or interest to  which the spouse is entitled or the amount of the proceeds over which  the power of appointment is exercisable may be expressed in terms of a  specific sum rather than a fraction or a percentage of the proceeds  provided it is shown that such sums are a definite or fixed percentage  or fraction of the total proceeds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section are applicable  with respect to a property interest which passed from the decedent in  the form of proceeds of a policy of insurance upon the decedent's life,  a policy of insurance upon the life of a person who predeceased the  decedent, a matured endowment policy, or an annuity contract, but only  in case the proceeds are to be held by the insurer. With respect to  proceeds under any such contract which are to be held by a trustee, with  power of appointment in the surviving spouse, see Sec. 20.2056(b)-5. As  to the   treatment of proceeds not meeting the requirements of Sec. 20.2056(b)-5  or of this section, see Sec. 20.2056(a)-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of a contract under which payments by the insurer  commenced during the decedent's life, it is immaterial whether or not  the conditions in subparagraphs (1) through (5) of paragraph (a) of this  section were satisfied prior to the decedent's death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Payments of installments or interest. The conditions in  subparagraphs (1) and (2) of paragraph (a) of this section relative to  the payments of installments or interest to the surviving spouse are  satisfied if, under the terms of the contract, the spouse has the right  exercisable annually (or more frequently) to require distribution to  herself of installments of the proceeds or a specific portion thereof,  as the case may be, and otherwise such proceeds or interest are to be  accumulated and held by the insurer pursuant to the terms of the  contract. A contract which otherwise requires the insurer to make annual  or more frequent payments to the surviving spouse following the  decedent's death, will not be disqualified merely because the surviving  spouse must comply with certain formalities in order to obtain the first  payment. For example, the contract may satisfy the conditions in  subparagraphs (1) and (2) of paragraph (a) of this section even though  it requires the surviving spouse to furnish proof of death before the  first payment is made. The condition in paragraph (a)(1) of this section  is satisfied where interest on the proceeds or a specific portion  thereof is payable, annually or more frequently, for a term, or until  the occurrence of a specified event, following which the proceeds or a  specific portion thereof are to be paid in annual or more frequent  installments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Powers of appointment. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In determining whether the terms of  the contract satisfy the conditions in subparagraph (3), (4), or (5) of  paragraph (a) of this section relating to a power of appointment in the  surviving spouse or any other person, the principles stated in Sec.  20.2056(b)-5 are applicable. As stated in Sec. 20.2056(b)-5, the  surviving spouse's power to appoint is ``exercisable in all events''  only if it is in existence immediately following the decedent's death,  subject, however, to the operation of Sec. 20.2056(b)-3 relating to  interests conditioned on survival for a limited period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>. See paragraph (b) of Sec. 20.2041-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this section that the surviving spouse have the power to  appoint amounts held by the insurer to herself or her estate if the  surviving spouse has the unqualified power, exercisable in favor of  herself or her estate, to appoint amounts held by the insurer which are  payable after her death. Such power to appoint need not extend to  installments or interest which will be paid to the spouse during her  life. Further, the power to appoint need not be a power to require  payment in a single sum. For example, if the proceeds of a policy are  payable in installments, and if the surviving spouse has the power to  direct that all installments payable after her death be paid to her  estate, she has the requisite power.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> It is not necessary that the phrase ``power to appoint'' be used  in the contract. For example, the condition in paragraph (a)(3) of this  section that the surviving spouse have the power to appoint amounts held  by the insurer to herself or her estate is satisfied by terms of a  contract which give the surviving spouse a right which is, in substance  and effect, a power to appoint to herself or her estate, such as a right  to withdraw the amount remaining in the fund held by the insurer, or a  right to   direct that any amount held by the insurer under the contract at her  death shall be paid to her estate.

Section  2056(b)(7)(B)(i) provides the definition of qualified terminable  interest property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Terminable interests described in section 2056(b)(1)(C) cannot  qualify as qualified terminable interest property. Thus, if the decedent  directs the executor to purchase a terminable interest with estate  assets, the terminable interest acquired will not qualify as qualified  terminable interest property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of section 2056(b)(7)(B)(i), the term property  generally means the entire interest in property (within the meaning of  Sec. 20.2056(b)-5(d)) or a specific portion of the entire interest  (within the meaning of Sec. 20.2056(b)-5(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Property for which an election may be made--(i) In general. The  election may relate to all or any part of property that meets the  requirements of section 2056(b)(7)(B)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>, provided that any partial  election must be made with respect to a fractional or percentage share  of the property so that the elective portion reflects its proportionate  share of the increase or decrease in value of the entire property for  purposes of applying sections 2044 or 2519. The fraction or percentage  may be defined by formula.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Division of trusts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. A trust may be divided into  separate trusts to reflect a partial election that has been made, or is  to be made, if authorized under the governing instrument or otherwise  permissible under local law. Any such division must be accomplished no  later than the end of the period of estate administration. If, at the  time of the filing of the estate tax return, the trust has not yet been  divided, the intent to divide the trust must be unequivocally signified  on the estate tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Manner of dividing and funding trust. The division of the trust  must be done on a fractional or percentage basis to reflect the partial  election. However, the separate trusts do not have to be funded with a  pro rata portion of each asset held by the undivided trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Local law. A trust may be divided only if the fiduciary is  required, either by applicable local law or by the express or implied  provisions of the governing instrument, to divide the trust on the basis  of the fair market value of the assets of the trust at the time of the  division.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Persons permitted to make the election. The election referred to  in section 2056(b)(7)(B)(i)(III) must be made by the executor that is  appointed, qualified, and acting within the United States, within the  meaning of section 2203, regardless of whether the property with respect  to which the election is to be made is in the executor's possession. If  there is no executor appointed, qualified, and acting within the United  States, the election may be made by any person with respect to property  in the actual or constructive possession of that person and may also be  made by that person with respect to other property not in the actual or  constructive possession of that person if the person in actual or  constructive possession of such other property does not make the  election. For example, in the absence of an appointed executor, the  trustee of an intervivos trust (that is included in the gross estate of  the decedent) can make the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Manner and time of making the election--(i) In general. The  election referred to in section 2056(b)(7)(B)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(III)</em> and (v) is made on  the return of tax imposed by section 2001 (or section 2101). For  purposes of this paragraph, the term return of tax imposed by section  2001 means the last estate tax return filed by the executor on or before  the   due date of the return, including extensions or, if a timely return is  not filed, the first estate tax return filed by the executor after the  due date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Election irrevocable. The election, once made, is irrevocable,  provided that an election may be revoked or modified on a subsequent  return filed on or before the due date of the return, including  extensions actually granted. If an executor appointed under local law  has made an election on the return of tax imposed by section 2001 (or  section 2101) with respect to one or more properties, no subsequent  election may be made with respect to other properties included in the  gross estate after the return of tax imposed by section 2001 is filed.  An election under section 2056(b)(7)(B)(v) is separate from any  elections made under section 2056A(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Protective elections--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A protective election may  be made to treat property as qualified terminable interest property only  if, at the time the federal estate tax return is filed, the executor of  the decedent's estate reasonably believes that there is a bona fide  issue that concerns whether an asset is includible in the decedent's  gross estate, or the amount or nature of the property the surviving  spouse is entitled to receive, i.e., whether property that is includible  is eligible for the qualified terminable interest property election. The  protective election must identify either the specific asset, group of  assets, or trust to which the election applies and the specific basis  for the protective election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Protective election irrevocable. The protective election, once  made on the return of tax imposed by section 2001, cannot be revoked.  For example, if a protective election is made on the basis that a bona  fide question exists regarding the inclusion of a trust corpus in the  gross estate and it is later determined that the trust corpus is so  includible, the protective election becomes effective with respect to  the trust corpus and cannot thereafter be revoked.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Qualifying income interest for life--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section  2056(b)(7)(B)(ii) provides the definition of qualifying income interest  for life. For purposes of section 2056(b)(7)(B)(ii)(II), the surviving  spouse is included within the prohibited class of powerholders referred  to therein. A power under applicable local law that permits the trustee  to adjust between income and principal to fulfill the trustee's duty of  impartiality between the income and remainder beneficiaries that meets  the requirements of Sec. 1.643(b)-1 of this chapter will not be  considered a power to appoint trust property to a person other than the  surviving spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Entitled for life to all income. The principles of Sec.  20.2056(b)-5(f), relating to whether the spouse is entitled for life to  all of the income from the entire interest, or a specific portion of the  entire interest, apply in determining whether the surviving spouse is  entitled for life to all of the income from the property regardless of  whether the interest passing to the spouse is in trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> also applies  to estates of decedents whose estate tax returns were due on or before  February 18, 1997, that meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Estates of decedents whose estate tax returns were due on or  before February 18, 1997, that did not make the election under section  2056(b)(7)(B)(v) because the surviving spouse's income interest in the  property was contingent upon the election or because the nonelected  portion of the property was to pass to a beneficiary other than the  surviving spouse are granted an extension of time to make the QTIP  election   if the following requirements are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The period of limitations on filing a claim for credit or refund  under section 6511(a) has not expired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A claim for credit or refund is filed on Form 843 with a revised  Recapitulation and Schedule M, Form 706 (or 706NA) that signifies the  QTIP election.

The statement must be signed, under penalties of perjury, by  the surviving spouse, the surviving spouse's legal representative (if  the surviving spouse is legally incompetent), or the surviving spouse's  executor (if the surviving spouse is deceased).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Income between last distribution date and date of spouse's  death. An income interest does not fail to constitute a qualifying  income interest for life solely because income between the last  distribution date and the date of the surviving spouse's death is not  required to be distributed to the surviving spouse or to the estate of  the surviving spouse. See Sec. 20.2044-1 relating to the inclusion of  such undistributed income in the gross estate of the surviving spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> constitutes a qualifying income interest  for life for purposes of section 2056(b)(7)(B)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Power to distribute principal to spouse. An income interest in a  trust will not fail to constitute a qualifying income interest for life  solely because the trustee has a power to distribute principal to or for  the benefit of the surviving spouse. The fact that property distributed  to a surviving spouse may be transferred by the spouse to another person  does not result in a failure to satisfy the requirement of section  2056(b)(7)(B)(ii)(II). However, if the surviving spouse is legally bound  to transfer the distributed property to another person without full and  adequate consideration in money or money's worth, the requirement of  section 2056(b)(7)(B)(ii)(II) is not satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Annuities payable from trusts in the case of estates of  decedents dying on or before October 24, 1992, and certain decedents  dying after October 24, 1992, with wills or revocable trusts executed on  or prior to that date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. In the case of estates of  decedents within the purview of the effective date and transitional  rules contained in Sec. 20.2056(b)-7(e)(5), a surviving spouse's  lifetime annuity interest payable from a trust or other group of assets  passing from the decedent is treated as a qualifying income interest for  life for purposes of section 2056(b)(7)(B)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Deductible interest. The deductible interest, for purposes of  Sec. 20.2056(a)-2(b), is the specific portion of the property that,  assuming the applicable interest rate for valuing annuities, would  produce income equal to the minimum amount payable annually to the  surviving spouse. If, based on the applicable interest rate, the entire  property from which the annuity may be satisfied is insufficient to  produce income equal to the minimum annual payment, the value of the  deductible interest is the entire value of the property. The value of  the deductible interest may not exceed the value of the property from  which the annuity is payable. If the annual payment may increase, the  increased amount is not taken into account in valuing the deductible  interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Distributions permissible only to surviving spouse. An annuity  interest is not treated as a qualifying income interest for life for  purposes of section 2056(b)(7)(B)(ii) if any person other than the  surviving spouse may receive, during the surviving spouse's lifetime,  any distribution of the property or its income (including any  distribution under an annuity contract) from which the annuity is  payable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Applicable interest rate. To determine the applicable interest  rate for valuing annuities, see sections 2031 and 7520 and the  regulations under those sections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Effective dates. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The rules contained in Sec. 20.2056(b)- 7(e) apply with respect to estates of decedents dying on or before  October 24, 1992.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The rules contained in Sec. 20.2056(b)-7(e) apply in the case  of decedents dying after October 24, 1992, if property passes to the  spouse pursuant to a will or revocable trust executed on or before  October 24, 1992, and either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> On that date, the decedent was under a mental disability to  change the disposition of his property and did not regain his competence  to dispose of such property before the date of death; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The decedent dies prior to October 24, 1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rules contained in Sec.  20.2056(b)-7(e) do not apply if the will or revocable trust is amended  after October 24, 1992, in any respect that increases the amount of the  transfer qualifying for the marital deduction or alters the terms by  which the interest so passes to the surviving spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Joint and survivor annuities. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Application of local law. The provisions of local law are taken  into account in determining whether the conditions of section  2056(b)(7)(B)(ii)(I) are satisfied. For example, silence of a trust  instrument as to the frequency of payment is not regarded as a failure  to satisfy the requirement that the income must be payable to the  surviving spouse annually or more frequently unless applicable local law  permits payments less frequently.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section. In each example, it is  assumed that the decedent, D, was survived by S, D's spouse and that,  unless stated otherwise, S is not the trustee of any trust established  for S's benefit.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Life estate in residence. D owned a personal residence  valued at $250,000 for estate tax purposes. Under D's will, the  exclusive and unrestricted right to use the residence (including the  right to continue to occupy the property as a personal residence or to  rent the property and receive the income) passes to S for life. At S's  death, the property passes to D's children. Under applicable local law,  S must consent to any sale of the property. If the executor elects to  treat all of the personal residence as qualified terminable interest  property, the deductible interest is $250,000, the value of the  residence for estate tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Power to make property productive. D's will established a  trust funded with property valued for estate tax purposes at $500,000.  The assets include both income producing assets and non-productive  assets. S was given the power, exercisable annually, to require  distribution of all of the trust income to herself. No trust property  may be distributed during S's lifetime to any person other than S.  Applicable local law permits S to require that the trustee either make  the trust property productive or sell the property and reinvest in  productive property within a reasonable time after D's death. If the  executor elects to treat all of the trust as qualified terminable  interest property, the deductible interest is $500,000. If the executor  elects to treat only 20 percent of the trust as qualified terminable  interest property, the deductible interest is $100,000, i.e., 20 percent  of $500,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Power of distribution over fraction of trust income. The  facts are the same as in Example 2 except that S is given the right  exercisable annually for S's lifetime to require distribution to herself  of only 50 percent of the trust income for life. The remaining trust  income is to be accumulated or distributed among S and the decedent's  children in the trustee's discretion. The maximum amount that D's  executor may elect to treat as qualified terminable interest property is  $250,000; i.e., the estate tax value of the trust ($500,000) multiplied  by the percentage of the trust in which S has a qualifying income  interest for life (50 percent). If D's executor elects to treat only 20  percent of the portion of the trust in which S has a qualifying income  interest as qualified terminable interest property, the deductible  interest is $50,000, i.e., 20 percent of $250,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Power to distribute trust corpus to other beneficiaries.  D's will established a trust providing that S is entitled to receive at  least annually all the trust income. The trustee is given the power to  use annually during S's lifetime $5,000 from the trust for the  maintenance and support of S's minor child, C. Any such distribution  does not necessarily relieve S of S's obligation to support and maintain  C. S does not have a qualifying income interest for life in any portion  of the trust because the bequest fails to satisfy the condition that no  person have a power, other than a power the exercise of which takes  effect only at or after S's death, to appoint any part of the property  to any person other than S. The trust would also be nondeductible under  section 2056(b)(7) if S, rather than the trustee, held the power to  appoint a portion of the principal to C. However, in the latter case, if  S made a qualified disclaimer (within the meaning of section 2518) of  the   power to appoint to C, the trust could qualify for the marital deduction  pursuant to section 2056(b)(7), assuming that the power is personal to S  and S's disclaimer terminates the power. Similarly, in either case, if C  made a qualified disclaimer of C's right to receive distributions from  the trust, the trust would qualify under section 2056(b)(7), assuming  that C's disclaimer effectively negates the trustee's power under local  law.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Spouse's income interest terminable on remarriage. D's  will established a trust providing that all of the trust income is  payable at least annually to S for S's lifetime, provided that, if S  remarries, S's interest in the trust will pass to X. The trust is not  deductible under section 2056(b)(7). S's income interest is not a  qualifying income interest for life because it is not for life but,  rather, is terminable upon S's remarriage.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Spouse's qualifying income interest for life contingent  on executor's election. D's will established a trust providing that S is  entitled to receive the income, payable at least annually, from that  portion of the trust that the executor elects to treat as qualified  terminable interest property. The portion of the trust which the  executor does not elect to treat as qualified terminable interest  property passes as of D's date of death to a trust for the benefit of C,  D's child. Under these facts, the executor is not considered to have a  power to appoint any part of the trust property to any person other than  S during S's life.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Formula partial election. D's will established a trust  funded with the residue of D's estate. Trust income is to be paid  annually to S for life, and the principal is to be distributed to D's  children upon S's death. S has the power to require that all the trust  property be made productive. There is no power to distribute trust  property during S's lifetime to any person other than S. D's executor  elects to deduct a fractional share of the residuary estate under  section 2056(b)(7). The election specifies that the numerator of the  fraction is the amount of deduction necessary to reduce the Federal  estate tax to zero (taking into account final estate tax values) and the  denominator of the fraction is the final estate tax value of the  residuary estate (taking into account any specific bequests or  liabilities of the estate paid out of the residuary estate). The formula  election is of a fractional share. The value of the share qualifies for  the marital deduction even though the executor's determinations to claim  administration expenses as estate or income tax deductions and the final  estate tax values will affect the size of the fractional share.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Formula partial election. The facts are the same as in  Example 7 except that, rather than defining a fraction, the executor's  formula states: ``I elect to treat as qualified terminable interest  property that portion of the residuary trust, up to 100 percent,  necessary to reduce the Federal estate tax to zero, after taking into  account the available unified credit, final estate tax values and any  liabilities and specific bequests paid from the residuary estate.'' The  formula election is of a fractional share. The share is equivalent to  the fractional share determined in Example 7.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. Severance of QTIP trust. D's will established a trust  funded with the residue of D's estate. Trust income is to be paid  annually to S for life, and the principal is to be distributed to D's  children upon S's death. S has the power to require that all of the  trust property be made productive. There is no power to distribute trust  property during S's lifetime to any person other than S. D's will  authorizes the executor to make the election under section 2056(b)(7)  only with respect to the minimum amount of property necessary to reduce  estate taxes on D's estate to zero, authorizes the executor to divide  the residuary estate into two separate trusts to reflect the election,  and authorizes the executor to charge any payment of principal to S to  the qualified terminable interest trust. S is the sole beneficiary of  both trusts during S's lifetime. The authorizations in the will do not  adversely affect the allowance of the marital deduction. Only the  property remaining in the marital deduction trust, after payment of  principal to S, is subject to inclusion in S's gross estate under  section 2044 or subject to gift tax under section 2519.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. Payments to spouse from individual retirement account. S  is the life beneficiary of sixteen remaining annual installments payable  from D's individual retirement account.

Each installment is equal to  all the income earned on the remaining principal in the account plus a  share of the remaining principal equal to \1/19\ in the first year, \1/ 18\ in the second year, \1/17\ in the third year, etc. Under the terms  of the account, S has no right to withdraw any other amounts from the  account. Any payments remaining after S's death pass to D's children.

Spouse's interest in trust in the form of an annuity. D  died prior to October 24, 1992. D's will established a trust funded with  income producing property valued at $500,000 for estate tax purposes.  The trustee is required by the trust instrument to pay $20,000 a year to  S for life. Trust income in excess of the annuity amount is to be  accumulated in the trust and may not be distributed during S's lifetime.  S's lifetime annuity interest is treated as a qualifying income interest  for life. If the executor elects to treat the entire   portion of the trust in which S has a qualifying income interest as  qualified terminable interest property, the value of the deductible  interest is (assuming that 10 percent is the applicable interest rate  under section 7520 for valuing annuities on the appropriate valuation  date) $200,000, because that amount would yield an income to S of  $20,000 a year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 12.

A property interest is treated as passing to the surviving spouse only  if it passes to the spouse as beneficial owner, except to the extent  otherwise provided in Sec. Sec. 20.2056(b)-5 through 20.2056(b)-7. For  this purpose, where a property interest passed from the decedent in  trust, such interest is considered to have passed from him to his  surviving spouse to the extent of her beneficial interest therein. The  deduction may not be taken with respect to a property interest which  passed to such spouse merely as trustee, or subject to a binding  agreement by the spouse to dispose of the interest in favor of a third  person. An allowance or award paid to a surviving spouse pursuant to  local law for her support during the administration of the decedent's  estate constitutes a property interest passing from the decedent to his  surviving spouse.

Such a bona fide recognition will be presumed where  the assignment or surrender was pursuant to a decision of a local court  upon the merits in an adversary proceeding following a genuine and  active contest. However, such a decree will be accepted only to the  extent that the court passed upon the facts upon which deductibility of  the property interest depends.

Interests which passed to a person  other than the surviving spouse include interests so passing under the  decedent's exercise, release, or nonexercise of a nontaxable power to  appoint. It is immaterial whether the property interest which passed  from the decedent to a person other than his surviving spouse is  included in the decedent's gross estate. The term ``person other than  his surviving spouse'' includes the possible unascertained takers of a  property interest, as, for example, the members of a class to be  ascertained in the future.

If an interest in property  passes to a decedent's surviving spouse in a taxable transfer made by a  decedent dying before January 1, 1977, and the decedent's surviving  spouse makes a disclaimer of this property interest the disclaimed  interest is considered as passing from the decedent to the person or  persons entitled to receive the interest as a result of the disclaimer.  A disclaimer is a complete and unqualified refusal to accept the rights  to which one is entitled. It is, therefore, necessary to distinguish  between the surviving spouse's   disclaimer of a property interest and such surviving spouse's acceptance  and subsequent disposal of a property interest. For example, if proceeds  of insurance are payable to the surviving spouse and the proceeds are  refused so that they consequently pass to an alternate beneficiary  designated by the decedent, the proceeds are considered as having passed  from the decedent to the alternate beneficiary. On the other hand, if  the insurance company is directed by the surviving spouse to hold the  proceeds at interest during such spouse's life and, upon this spouse's  death, to pay the principal sum to another person designated by the  surviving spouse, thus effecting a transfer of a remainder interest, the  proceeds are considered as having passed from the decedent to the  surviving spouse.

For the  purpose of these transfers, it is unnecessary to distinguish for the  purpose of the marital deduction between a disclaimer by a person other  than the surviving spouse and a transfer by such person. If the  surviving spouse becomes entitled to receive an interest in property  from the decedent as a result of a disclaimer made by some other person,  the interest is, nevertheless, considered as having passed from the  decedent, not to the surviving spouse, but to the person who made the  disclaimer, as though the disclaimer had not been made.

Subject to the special rules provided in section  7815(d)(14) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Pub.

Under section 7815(d)(14) of the Omnibus Budget  Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101-239, 103 Stat. 2106) certain  special rules apply in the case of transfers governed by certain estate  and gift tax treaties to which the United States is a party. In the case  of the estate of, or gift by, an individual who was not a citizen or  resident of the United States but was a resident of a foreign country  with which the United States has a tax treaty with respect to estate,  inheritance, or gift taxes, the amendments made by section 5033 of the  Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-647, 102  Stat. 3342) do not apply to the extent such amendments would be  inconsistent with the provisions of such treaty relating to estate,  inheritance, or gift tax marital deductions. Under this rule, the estate  may choose either the statutory deduction under section 2056A or the  marital deduction allowed under the treaty. Thus, the estate may not  avail itself of both the marital deduction under the treaty and the  marital deduction under the QDOT provisions of section 2056A and chapter  11 of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the remainder of the  marital property that is not deductible under the treaty.

For purposes of determining whether no more  than 35 percent of the fair market value of the QDOT assets consists of  foreign real property, if the QDOT owns more than 20% of the voting  stock or value in a corporation with 15 or fewer shareholders, or more  than 20% of the capital interest of a partnership with 15 or fewer  partners, then all assets owned by the corporation or partnership are  deemed to be owned directly by the QDOT to the extent of the QDOT's pro  rata share of the assets of that corporation or partnership. For a  partnership, the QDOT partner's pro rata share is based on the greater  of its interest in the capital or profits of the partnership. For  purposes of this paragraph, all stock in the corporation, or interests  in the partnership, as the case may be, owned by or held for the benefit  of the surviving spouse, or any members of the surviving spouse's family  (within the meaning of section 267(c)(4)), are treated as owned by the  QDOT solely for purposes of determining the number of partners or  shareholders in the entity and the QDOT's percentage voting interest or  value in the corporation or capital interest in the partnership, but not  for the purpose of determining the QDOT's pro rata share of the assets  of the entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Interests in other entities.

For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1)(iv), a  personal residence is either the principal residence of the surviving  spouse within the meaning of section 1034 or one other residence of the  surviving spouse. In order to be used by or held for the use of the  spouse as a personal residence, the residence must be available at all  times for use by the surviving spouse. The residence may not be rented  to another party, even when not occupied by the spouse.

However, if the residence is sold, the exclusion continues to apply if,  within 12 months of the date of sale, the amount of the adjusted sales  price (as defined in section 1034(b)(1)) is reinvested to purchase a new  personal residence for the spouse. If less than the amount of the  adjusted sales price is reinvested, the amount of the exclusion equals  the amount reinvested in the new residence plus any amount previously  allocated to a residence that continues to qualify for the exclusion, up  to a total of $600,000. If the QDOT ceases to qualify for all or any  portion of the initially claimed exclusions, paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this  section, if applicable (determined as if the portion of the exclusions  disallowed had not been initially claimed by the QDOT), must be complied  with no later than 120 days after the effective date of the cessation.  In addition, if a residence ceases to be used by, or held for the use of  the spouse as a personal residence of the spouse or if the personal  residence is sold during the term of the QDOT, the personal residence  exclusion may be allocated to another residence that is held in either  the same QDOT or in another QDOT that is established for the surviving  spouse, if the other residence qualifies as being used by, or held for  the use of the spouse as a personal residence. The trustee may allocate  up to $600,000 to the new personal residence (less the amount previously  allocated to a residence that continues to qualify for the exclusion)  even if the entire $600,000 exclusion was not previously utilized with  respect to the original personal residence(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> if the U.S. Trustee that is  selected is a domestic corporation established with insubstantial  capitalization by the surviving spouse or members of the spouse's  family.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Individual trustees.

Subject to the time period prescribed in section  2056A(d), the election to treat a trust as a QDOT must be made on the  last federal estate tax return filed before the due date (including  extensions of time to file actually granted) or, if a timely return is  not filed, on the first federal estate tax return filed after the due  date. The election, once made, is irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(2)(ii)</em> prior to the due date for the election, a QDOT  election may be made for any one or more of the severed trusts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Protective elections. A protective election may be made to treat  a trust   as a QDOT only if at the time the federal estate tax return is filed,  the executor of the decedent's estate reasonably believes that there is  a bona fide issue that concerns either the residency or citizenship of  the decedent, the citizenship of the surviving spouse, whether an asset  is includible in the decedent's gross estate, or the amount or nature of  the property the surviving spouse is entitled to receive. For example,  if at the time the federal estate tax return is filed either the estate  is involved in a bona fide will contest, there is uncertainty regarding  the inclusion in the gross estate of an asset which, if includible,  would be eligible for the QDOT election, or there is uncertainty  regarding the status of the decedent as a resident alien or a  nonresident alien for estate tax purposes, or a similar uncertainty  regarding the citizenship status of the surviving spouse, a protective  QDOT election may be made. The protective election is in addition to,  and is not in lieu of, the requirements set forth in Sec. 20.2056A-4.  The protective QDOT election must be made on a written statement signed  by the executor under penalties of perjury and must be attached to the  return described in paragraph (a) of this section, and must identify the  specific assets to which the protective election refers and the specific  basis for the protective election. However, the protective election may  otherwise be defined by means of a formula (such as the minimum amount  necessary to reduce the estate tax to zero). Once made, the protective  election is irrevocable. For example, if a protective election is made  because a bona fide question exists as to the includibility of an asset  in the decedent's gross estate and it is later finally determined that  the asset is so includible, the protective election becomes effective  with respect to the asset and cannot thereafter be revoked.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Manner of election. The QDOT election under paragraph (a) of  this section is made in the form and manner set forth in the decedent's  estate tax return, including applicable instructions.

If an interest in property  passes from the decedent to a trust for the benefit of a noncitizen  surviving spouse and if the trust otherwise qualifies for a marital  deduction but for the provisions of section 2056(d)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(A)</em>, the property  interest is treated as passing to the surviving spouse in a QDOT if the  trust is reformed, either in accordance with the terms of the decedent's  will or trust agreement or pursuant to a judicial proceeding, to meet  the requirements of a QDOT. For this purpose, the requirements of a QDOT  include all of the applicable requirements set forth in Sec. 20.2056A- 2, and the requirements of Sec. 20.2056A-2T(d). A reformation pursuant  to the terms of the decedent's will or trust instrument must be  completed by the time prescribed (including extensions) for filing the  decedent's estate tax return. For purposes of this paragraph (a), a  return filed prior to the due date (including extensions) is considered  filed on the last date that the return is required to be filed  (including extensions), and a late return filed at any time after the  due date is considered filed on the date that it is actually filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Judicial reformations. In general, a reformation pursuant to a  judicial proceeding is permitted under this section if the reformation  is commenced on or before the due date (determined with regard to  extensions actually granted) for filing the return of tax imposed by  chapter 11 of the Internal Revenue Code, regardless of the date that the  return is actually filed. The reformation (either pursuant to a judicial  proceeding or otherwise) must result in a trust that is effective under  local law. The reformed trust may be revocable by the spouse, or  otherwise be subject to the spouse's general power of appointment,  provided that no person (including the spouse) has the power to amend  the trust during the continued existence of the trust such that it would  no longer qualify as a QDOT. Prior to the time that the judicial  reformation is completed, the trust must   be treated as a QDOT. Thus, the trustee of the trust is responsible for  filing the Form 706-QDT, paying any section 2056A estate tax that  becomes due, and filing the annual statement required under Sec.  20.2056A-2T(d)(3), if applicable. Failure to comply with these  requirements may cause the trust to be subject to the anti-abuse rule  under Sec. 20.2056A-2T(d)(1)(iv). In addition, if the judicial  reformation is terminated prior to the time that the reformation is  completed, the estate of the decedent is required to pay the increased  estate tax imposed on the decedent's estate (plus interest and any  applicable penalties) that becomes due at the time of such termination  as a result of the failure of the trust to comply with section 2056(d).  See section 6511 as to applicable time periods for credit or refund of  tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Tolling of statutory assessment period.

Similarly, if  the decedent, a nonresident not a citizen of the United States,  bequeaths foreign situs assets to a trust created under his will, the  surviving spouse may not transfer U.S. situs assets passing to the  spouse outside of the will to that trust under this paragraph. See Sec.  20.2056A-3(c) with respect to protective elections. See Sec. 20.2056A- 3(a) with respect to the time limitations for making the QDOT election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Form of transfer or assignment. A transfer or assignment of  property to a QDOT must be in writing and otherwise be in accordance  with all local law requirements for such assignment or transfer. The  transfer or assignment may be of a specific asset or a group of assets,  or a fractional share of either, or may be of a pecuniary amount. A  transfer or assignment of less than an entire interest in an asset or a  group of assets may be expressed by means of a formula (such as the  minimum amount necessary to reduce the estate tax to zero). In the case  of a transfer, a copy of the trust instrument evidencing the transfer  must be submitted with the decedent's estate tax return. In the   case of an assignment, a copy of the assignment must be submitted with  the decedent's estate tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Pecuniary assignment--special rules. If the assignment is  expressed in the form of a pecuniary amount (such as a fixed dollar  amount or a formula designed to reduce the decedent's estate tax to  zero), the assignment must specify that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assets actually transferred to the QDOT in satisfaction of the  assignment have an aggregate fair market value on the date of actual  transfer to the QDOT amounting to no less than the amount of the  pecuniary transfer or assignment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The assets actually transferred to the QDOT be fairly  representative of appreciation or depreciation in the value of all  property available for transfer to the QDOT between the valuation date  and the date of actual transfer to the QDOT, if the assignment is to be  satisfied by accounting for the assets on the basis of their fair market  value as of some date before the date of actual transfer to the QDOT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Transfer tax treatment of transfer or assignment. Property  assigned or transferred to a QDOT pursuant to section 2056(d)(2)(B) is  treated as passing from the decedent to a QDOT solely for purposes of  section 2056(d)(2)(A). For all other purposes (e.g., income, gift,  estate, generation-skipping transfer tax, and section 1491 excise tax),  the surviving spouse is treated as the transferor of the property to the  QDOT. However, the spouse is not considered the transferor of property  to a QDOT if the transfer by the spouse constitutes a transfer that  satisfies the requirements of section 2518(c)(3). For a special  exception to the valuation rules of section 2702 in the case of a  transfer by the surviving spouse to a QDOT, see Sec. 25.2702-1(c)(8) of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Period for completion of transfer. Property irrevocably assigned  but not actually transferred to the QDOT before the estate tax return is  filed must actually be conveyed and transferred to the QDOT under  applicable local law before the administration of the decedent's estate  is completed. If there is no administration of the decedent's estate  (because for example, none of the decedent's assets are subject to  probate under local law), the conveyance must be made on or before the  date that is one year after the due date (including extensions) for  filing the decedent's estate tax return. If an actual transfer to the  QDOT is not timely made, section 2056(d)(1)(A) applies and the marital  deduction is not allowed. The executor of the decedent's estate (or  other authorized legal representative) may request a private letter  ruling from the Internal Revenue Service requesting an extension of the  time for completing the conveyance or waiving the actual conveyance  under specified circumstances under Sec. 301.9100-1(a) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Retirement accounts and annuities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

Individual retirement  annuities described in section 408(b) are not assignable pursuant to  section 408(b)(1) and thus, do not come within the purview of this  paragraph (b)(7).

Unless the terms of the  account provide otherwise, individual retirement accounts described in  section 408(a) are assignable and subject to the provisions of this  paragraph (b)(7). However, under paragraph (c) of this section, the  surviving spouse may treat an individual retirement account as  nonassignable and, therefore, eligible for the procedures in paragraph  (c) of this section if the spouse timely complies with the requirements  in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Other effects of assignment. The provisions of this paragraph  (b)(7) apply solely for purposes of qualifying the annuity or account  under the rules of Sec. 20.2056A-2 and this section. See, for example,  section 408(d) and 4980A regarding the consequences of an assignment for  purposes other than this paragraph (b)(7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Protective assignment. A protective assignment of property to a  QDOT may be made only if, at the time the federal estate tax return is  filed, the executor of the decedent's estate reasonably believes that  there is a bona fide issue that concerns either the residency or  citizenship of the decedent, the citizenship of the surviving spouse,  whether all or a portion of an asset is includible in the decedent's  gross estate, or the amount or nature of the property the surviving  spouse is entitled to receive. For example, if at the time the federal  estate tax return is filed, either the estate is involved in a bona fide  will contest, there is uncertainty regarding the inclusion in the gross  estate of an asset which, if includible, would be eligible for the QDOT  election, or there is uncertainty regarding the status of the decedent  as a resident alien or a nonresident alien for estate tax purposes, or a  similar uncertainty regarding the citizenship status of the surviving  spouse, a protective assignment may be made. The protective assignment  must be made on a written statement signed by the assignor under  penalties of perjury on or before the date prescribed under paragraph  (b)(1) of this section, and must identify the specific assets to which  the assignment refers and the specific basis for the protective  assignment. However, the protective assignment may otherwise be defined  by means of a formula (such as the minimum amount necessary to reduce  the estate tax to zero). Once made, the protective assignment cannot be  revoked. For example, if a protective assignment is made because a bona  fide question exists as to the includibility of an asset in the  decedent's gross estate and it is later finally determined that the  asset is so includible, the protective assignment becomes effective with  respect to the asset and cannot thereafter be revoked. Protective  assignments are, in all events, subject to paragraph (b)(6) of this  section. A copy of the protective assignment must be submitted with the  decedent's estate tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em>, a  surviving spouse's interest as beneficiary of an individual retirement  annuity described in section 408(b) is a nonassignable annuity or other  arrangement.

For purposes of this paragraph (c),  a surviving spouse's interest as beneficiary of an individual retirement  account described in section 408(a), although assignable under that  section, is considered to be a nonassignable annuity or other  arrangement eligible for the procedures contained in this paragraph (c),  at the option of the surviving spouse, if the requirements of this  paragraph are otherwise satisfied. See paragraph (b)(7) of this section  if the spouse elects to treat the account as assignable. In the case of  a plan, annuity, or other arrangement which is not assignable or  transferable (or is treated as such), the property passing under the  plan from the decedent is treated as meeting the   requirements Sec. 20.2056A-2, and the requirements of Sec. 20.2056A- 2T(d) (pertaining, respectively, to general requirements, qualified  marital interest requirements, statutory requirements, and requirements  to ensure collection of the tax) if the requirements of either paragraph  (c)(2) or (3) of this section are satisfied. Thus, the property will be  treated as passing in the form of a QDOT, notwithstanding that the  spouse does not irrevocably transfer or assign the annuity or other  payment to the QDOT as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

The provisions of this section are illustrated by the  following   examples. In each of the following examples the decedent, D, a citizen  of the United States, died after August 22, 1995, and D's surviving  spouse, S, is not a United States citizen at the time of D's death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> S is the beneficiary of the following probate and  nonprobate assets included in D's gross estate:  Pecuniary bequest under will...............................     $400,000 Proceeds of life insurance.................................      200,000 D's interest in property owned jointly with S includible in      300,000</p><p class="depth0">the gross estate under Sec. 2040(a).....................

S retains a power of appointment over the  disposition of the remainder to ensure that S does not make an immediate  gift of the remainder of the trust. Also, before the estate tax return  is filed and before the date that the QDOT election must be made, S  transfers the life insurance proceeds and the specifically devised real  property to the QDOT. S decides not to transfer the property that had  been jointly owned to the QDOT. Because S has not received distribution  of the pecuniary bequest before D's estate tax return is filed and  before the date that the QDOT election must be made, S irrevocably  assigns the interest in the pecuniary bequest to the QDOT. Assume that  the pecuniary bequest is in fact transferred by S to the QDOT before the  estate administration is concluded. D's executor makes a QDOT election  on the estate tax return for the $700,000 in property that S has  transferred and assigned to the QDOT. A marital deduction of $700,000 is  allowed to D's estate assuming the estate tax return is filed and the  QDOT election is made within the time limitation prescribed in Sec.  20.2056A-3(a). No marital deduction is allowed for the $300,000 interest  in jointly-owned property not transferred to the QDOT.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Formula assignment. Under the terms of D's will, the  entire probate estate passes outright to S. Prior to the date D's estate  tax return is filed and before the date that the QDOT election must be  made, S establishes a QDOT and S executes an irrevocable assignment in  which S assigns to the QDOT, ``that portion of the gross estate  necessary to reduce the estate tax to zero, taking into account all  available credits and deductions.'' The assignment meets the  requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, assuming that the QDOT is  funded by the time that administration of D's estate is completed.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Jointly owned property. At the time of D's death, D and S  hold real property as joint tenants with right of survivorship. In  accordance with section 2056(d)(1)(B), section 2040(a), and Sec.  20.2056A-8(a), 60 percent of the value of the property is included in  D's gross estate. S establishes a QDOT and, prior to the date the estate  tax return is filed and before the date that the QDOT election must be  made, S transfers a 60 percent interest in the real property to the  QDOT. The transfer satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At  the time of D's death on or after May 1, 2009, D is a participant in an  employees' pension plan described in section 401(a). On D's death, D's  spouse S, a resident of the United States, becomes entitled to receive a  survivor's annuity of $72,000 per year, payable monthly, for life. At  the time of D's death, S is age 60. Assume that under section 7520, the  appropriate discount rate to be used for valuing annuities in the case  of this decedent is 6.0 percent. The annuity factor at 6.0 percent for a  person age 60 is 11.0625 (1.000000 minus .33625, divided by .06). The  adjustment factor at 6.0 percent in Table K for monthly payments is  1.0272. Accordingly, the right to receive $72,000 per year on a monthly  basis is equal to the right to receive $73,958.40 ($72,000 x 1.0272) on  an annual basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The corpus portion of each annuity payment received by S is  determined as follows. The first step is to determine the annuity factor  for the number of years that would be required to exhaust a hypothetical  fund that has a present value and a payout corresponding to S 's  interest in the payments under the plan, determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Present value of S 's annuity: $73,958.40 x 11.0625 =  $818,164.80.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Annuity Factor for Expected Annuity Term: $818,164.80/$73,958.40  = 11.0625.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The second step is to determine the number of years that would  be required for S 's annuity to exhaust a hypothetical fund of  $818,164.80. The term certain annuity factor of 11.0625 falls between  the annuity factors for 18 and 19 years in a 6.0 percent term certain  annuity table (Column 1 of Table B, Publication 1457 Actuarial  Valuations Version 3A, which may be obtained on the IRS Internet site).  Accordingly, the expected annuity term is 19 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The third step is to determine the corpus amount by dividing  the expected term of 19 years into the present value of the hypothetical  fund as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Corpus amount of annual payment: $818,164.80/19 = $43,061.31.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In the fourth step, the corpus portion of each annuity payment  is determined by dividing the corpus amount of each annual payment by  the annual annuity payment (adjusted for payments more frequently than  annually as in (i) of this Example 4) as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Corpus portion of each annuity payment: $43,061.31/$73,958.40 =  .58.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Accordingly, 58 percent of each payment to S is deemed to be a  distribution of corpus. A marital deduction is allowed for $818,164.80,  the present value of the annuity as of D's date of death, if either: S  agrees to roll over the corpus portion of each payment to a QDOT and the  executor files the Information Statement described in paragraph (c)(5)  of this section and the Roll Over Agreement described in paragraph  (c)(7) of this section; or S agrees to pay the tax due on the corpus  portion of each payment and the executor files the Information Statement  described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section and the Payment Agreement  described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Transfer to QDOT subject to gift tax. D's will bequeaths  $700,000 outright to S. The bequest qualifies for a marital deduction  under section 2056(a) except that it does not pass in a QDOT. S creates  an irrevocable trust that meets the requirements for a QDOT and  transfers the $700,000 to the QDOT. The QDOT instrument provides that S  is entitled to all the income from the QDOT payable at least annually  and that, upon the death of S, the property remaining in the QDOT is to  be distributed to the grandchildren of D and S in equal shares. The  trust instrument contains all other provisions required to qualify as a  QDOT. On D's estate tax return, D's executor makes a QDOT election under  section 2056A(a)(3). Solely for purposes of the marital deduction, the  property is deemed to pass from D to the QDOT. D's estate is entitled to  a marital deduction for the $700,000 value of the property passing from  D to S. S's transfer of property to the QDOT is treated as a gift of the  remainder interest for gift tax purposes because S's transfer creates a  vested remainder interest in the grandchildren of D and S. Accordingly,  as of the date that S transfers the property to the QDOT, a gift tax is  imposed on the present value of the remainder interest. See Sec.  25.2702-1(c)(8) of this chapter exempting S's transfer from the special  valuation rules contained in section 2702. At S's death, S is treated as  the transferor of the property into the trust for estate tax and  generation-skipping transfer tax purposes. See, e.g., sections 2036 and  2652(a)(1). The trust is not eligible for a reverse QTIP election by D's  estate under section 2652(a)(3) because a QTIP election cannot be made  for the QDOT.

An estate tax is imposed under section 2056A(b)(1)  on the occurrence of a taxable event, as defined in section 2056A(b)(9).  The tax is generally equal to the amount of estate tax that would have  been imposed if the amount involved in the taxable event had been  included in the decedent's taxable estate and had not been deductible  under section 2056. See section 2056A(b)(3) and paragraph (c) of this  section for certain exceptions from taxable events.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Amounts subject to tax--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Distribution of principal during the  spouse's lifetime. If a taxable event occurs during the noncitizen  surviving spouse's lifetime, the amount on which the section 2056A  estate tax is imposed is the amount of money and the fair market value  of the property that is the subject of the distribution (including  property distributed from the trust pursuant to the exercise of a power  of appointment), including any amount withheld from the distribution by  the U.S. Trustee to pay the tax. If, however, the tax is not withheld by  the U.S. Trustee but is paid by the U.S. Trustee out of other assets of  the QDOT, an amount equal to the tax so paid is treated as an additional  distribution to the spouse in the year that the tax is paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Death of surviving spouse. If a taxable event occurs as a result  of the death of the surviving spouse, the amount subject to tax is the  fair market value of the trust assets on the date of the spouse's death  (or alternate valuation date if applicable). See also section 2032A. Any  corpus portion amounts, within the meaning of Sec. 20.2056A-4(c)(4)(i),  remaining in a   QDOT upon the surviving spouse's death, are subject to tax under section  2056A(b)(1)(B), as well as any residual payments resulting from a  nonassignable plan or arrangement that, upon the surviving spouse's  death, are payable to the spouse's estate or to successor beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Trust ceases to qualify as QDOT. If a taxable event occurs as a  result of the trust ceasing to qualify as a QDOT (for example, the trust  ceases to have at least one U.S. Trustee), the amount subject to tax is  the fair market value of the trust assets on the date of  disqualification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Distributions and dispositions not subject to tax--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Distributions of principal on account of hardship. Section  2056A(b)(3)(B) provides an exemption from the section 2056A estate tax  for distributions to the surviving spouse on account of hardship. A  distribution of principal is treated as made on account of hardship if  the distribution is made to the spouse from the QDOT in response to an  immediate and substantial financial need relating to the spouse's  health, maintenance, education, or support, or the health, maintenance,  education, or support of any person that the surviving spouse is legally  obligated to support. A distribution is not treated as made on account  of hardship if the amount distributed may be obtained from other sources  that are reasonably available to the surviving spouse; e.g., the sale by  the surviving spouse of personally owned, publicly traded stock or the  cashing in of a certificate of deposit owned by the surviving spouse.  Assets such as closely held business interests, real estate and tangible  personalty are not considered sources that are reasonably available to  the surviving spouse. Although a hardship distribution of principal is  exempt from the section 2056A estate tax, it must be reported on Form  706-QDT even if it is the only distribution that occurred during the  filing period. See Sec. 20.2056A-11 regarding filing requirements for  Form 706-QDT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> or  in administrative guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service,  income does not include items constituting income in respect of a  decedent (IRD) under section 691. However, in cases where a QDOT is  designated by the decedent as a beneficiary of a pension or profit  sharing plan described in section 401(a) or an individual retirement  account or annuity described in section 408, the proceeds of which are  payable to the QDOT in the form of an annuity, any payments received by  the QDOT may be allocated between income and corpus using the method  prescribed under Sec. 20.2056A-4(c) for determining the corpus and  income portion of an annuity payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certain miscellaneous distributions and dispositions. Certain  miscellaneous distributions and dispositions of trust   assets are exempt from the section 2056A estate tax, including but not  limited to the following--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Payments for ordinary and necessary expenses of the QDOT  (including bond premiums and letter of credit fees);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payments to applicable governmental authorities for income tax  or any other applicable tax imposed on the QDOT (other than a payment of  the section 2056A estate tax due on the occurrence of a taxable event as  described in paragraph (b) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Dispositions of trust assets by the trustees (such as sales,  exchanges, or pledging as collateral) for full and adequate  consideration in money or money's worth; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em>, the amount of attributable tax eligible for  reimbursement is the difference between the actual income tax liability  of the spouse and the spouse's income tax liability determined as if the  item had not been included in the spouse's gross income in the  applicable taxable year.

Section 2056A(b)(2) provides for the  computation of the section 2056A estate tax. For purposes of sections  2056A(b)(2)(A) (i) and (ii), in determining the tax that would have been  imposed under section 2001 on the estate of the first decedent, the  rates in effect on the date of the first decedent's death are used. For  this purpose, the provisions of section 2001(c)(2) (pertaining to  phaseout of graduated rates and unified credit) apply. In addition, for  purposes of sections 2056A(b)(2)(A) (i) and (ii), the tax which would  have been imposed by section 2001 on the estate of the decedent means  the net tax determined under section 2001 or 2101, as the case may be,  after allowance of any allowable credits, including the unified credit  allowable under section 2010, the credit for state death taxes under  section 2011, the credit for tax on prior transfers under section 2013,  and the credit for foreign death taxes under section 2014. See paragraph  (b)(4) of this section regarding the application of the credits under  sections 2011 and 2014. In the case of a decedent nonresident not a  citizen of the United States, the applicable credits are determined  under section 2102. The estate tax (net of any applicable credits)  imposed under section 2056A(b)(1) constitutes an estate tax for purposes  of section 691(c)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Benefits allowed in determining amount of section 2056A estate  tax--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Section 2056A(b)(10) provides for the allowance  of certain benefits in computing the section 2056A estate tax. Except as  provided in this section, the rules of each of the credit, deduction and  deferral provisions, as provided in the Internal Revenue Code must be  complied with.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment as resident. For purposes of section 2056A(b)(10)(A),  a noncitizen spouse is treated as a resident of the United States for  purposes of determining whether the QDOT property is includible in the  spouse's gross estate under chapter 11 of the Internal Revenue Code, and  for purposes of determining whether any of the credits, deductions or  deferral provisions are allowable with respect to the QDOT property to  the estate of the spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rule in the case of trusts described in section  2056(b)(8). In the case of a QDOT in which the spouse's interest  qualifies for a marital deduction   under section 2056(b)(8), the provisions of section 2056A(b)(10)(A)  apply in determining the allowance of a charitable deduction in  computing the section 2056A estate tax, notwithstanding that the QDOT is  not includible in the spouse's gross estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Credit for state and foreign death taxes. If the assets of the  QDOT are included in the surviving spouse's gross estate for federal  estate tax purposes, or would have been so includible if the spouse had  been a United States resident, and state or foreign death taxes are paid  by the spouse's estate with respect to the QDOT, the taxes paid by the  spouse's estate with respect to the QDOT are creditable, to the extent  allowable under section 2011 or 2014, as applicable, in computing the  section 2056A estate tax. In addition, state or foreign death taxes  previously paid by the decedent/transferor's estate are also creditable  in computing the section 2056A estate tax to the extent allowable under  sections 2011 and 2014. Specifically, the tax that would have been  imposed on the decedent's estate if the taxable estate had been  increased by the value of the QDOT assets on the spouse's death plus the  amount involved in prior taxable events (section 2056A(b)(2)(A)(i)), is  determined after allowance of a credit equal to the lesser of the state  or foreign death tax previously paid by the decedent's estate, or the  amount prescribed under section 2011(b) or 2014(b) computed based on a  taxable estate increased by such amounts. Similarly, the tax that would  have been imposed on the decedent's estate if the taxable estate had  been increased only by the amount involved in prior taxable events  (section 2056A(b)(2)(A)(ii)) is determined after allowance of a credit  equal to the lesser of the state or foreign death tax previously paid by  the decedent's estate, or the amount prescribed under section 2011(b) or  2014(b) computed based on a taxable estate increased by the amount  involved in such prior taxable events. See paragraph (d), Example 2, of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Alternate valuation and special use valuation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  In order to claim the benefits of alternate valuation under section  2032, or special use valuation under section 2032A, for purposes of  computing the section 2056A estate tax, an election must be made on the  Form 706-QDT that is filed with respect to the balance remaining in the  QDOT upon the death of the surviving spouse. In addition, the separate  requirements for making the section 2032 and/or section 2032A elections  under those sections and the regulations thereunder must be complied  with except that, for this purpose, the surviving spouse is treated as a  resident of the United States regardless of the surviving spouse's  actual residency status. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (b)(5),  the citizenship of the first decedent is immaterial.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Alternate valuation. For purposes of the alternate valuation  election under section 2032, the election may not be made unless the  election decreases both the value of the property remaining in the QDOT  upon the death of the surviving spouse and the net amount of section  2056A estate tax due. Once made, the election is irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special use valuation. For purposes of section 2032A, the  Designated Filer (in the case of multiple QDOTs) or the U.S. Trustee may  elect to value certain farm and closely held business real property at  its farm or business use value, rather than its fair market value, if  all of the requirements under section 2032A and the applicable  regulations are met, except that, for this purpose, the surviving spouse  is treated as a resident of the United States regardless of the spouse's  actual residency status. The total value of property valued under  section 2032A in the QDOT cannot be decreased from fair market value by  more than $750,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Miscellaneous rules.

In accordance with Sec. 25.2511-1(h)(5) of this  chapter, one-half of the value of the property is a gift to S. D dies in  1995. Because S is not a United States citizen, the provisions of  section 2040(a) are determinative of the extent to which the real  property is includible in D's gross estate. Because the joint tenancy  was established before July 14, 1988, and under the applicable  provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations the transfer was  treated as a gift of one-half of the property, one-half of the value of  the property is deemed attributable to consideration furnished by S for  purposes of section 2040(a).

The designation of a  person responsible for filing a return under section 2056A(b)(2)(C)(i)  (the Designated Filer) must be made on the decedent's federal estate tax  return, or on the first Form 706-QDT that is due and is   filed by its prescribed date, including extensions. The Designated Filer  must be a U.S. Trustee. If the U.S. Trustee is an individual, that  individual must have a tax home (as defined in section 911(d)(3)) in the  United States. At least sixty days before the due date for filing the  tax returns for all of the QDOTs, the U.S. Trustee(s) of each of the  QDOTs must provide to the Designated Filer all of the necessary  information relating to distributions from their respective QDOTs. The  section 2056A estate tax due from each QDOT is allocated on a pro rata  basis (based on the ratio of the amount of each respective distribution  constituting a taxable event to the amount of all such distributions),  unless a different allocation is required under the terms of the  governing instrument or under local law. Unless the decedent has  provided for a successor Designated Filer, if the Designated Filer  ceases to qualify as a U.S. Trustee, or otherwise becomes unable to  serve as the Designated Filer, the remaining trustees of each QDOT must  select a qualifying successor Designated Filer (who is also a U.S.  Trustee) prior to the due date for the filing of Form 706-QDT (including  extensions). The selection is to be indicated on the Form 706-QDT.  Failure to select a successor Designated Filer will result in the  application of section 2056A(b)(2)(C).

In the case of multiple QDOTs with respect to the  same decedent, each trustee of a QDOT is personally liable for the  amount of the section 2056A estate tax imposed on any taxable event with  respect to that trustee's QDOT, but is not personally liable for tax  imposed with respect to taxable events involving QDOTs of which that  person is not a trustee. However, the assets of any QDOT are subject to  collection by the Internal Revenue Service for any tax resulting from a  taxable event with respect to any other QDOT established with respect to  the same decedent. The trustee may also be personally liable as a  withholding agent under section 1461 or other applicable provisions of  the Internal Revenue Code.
