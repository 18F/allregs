In response to national, tribal, regional, or State  fish and wildlife habitat concerns, the Chief may focus program  implementation in any given year to specific geographic areas or to  address specific habitat development needs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The State Conservationist, with recommendations from the State  Technical Committee and Tribal Conservation Advisory Council (for tribal  land), may give priority to WHIP projects that will address unique  habitats or special geographic areas identified in the State. Subsequent  cost-share agreement offers that would complement previous cost-share  agreements due to geographic proximity of the lands involved or other  relationships may receive priority consideration for participation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> NRCS will evaluate the applications and make enrollment  decisions based on the fish and wildlife habitat need using some or all  of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contribution to resolving an identified habitat concern of  national, tribal, regional, or State importance including at-risk  species;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Relationship to any established wildlife or conservation  priority areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Duration of benefits to be obtained from the habitat development  practices;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Self-sustaining nature of the habitat development practices;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Availability of other partnership matching funds or reduced  funding request by the person applying for participation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Estimated costs of fish and wildlife habitat development  activities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Other factors determined appropriate by NRCS to meet the  objectives of the program; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Willingness of the applicant to complete all conservation  improvements during the first 2 years of the WHIP cost-share agreement.</p>
