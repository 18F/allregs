Detailed specifications for presenting relevant information by any interested party may be prescribed in guidance documents published from

The Administrator may approve or disapprove such limitation(s) or specify another limitation(s) upon review of any record of any proceedings held in connection with the permit issuance or modification and any other evidence available to him. If he takes no action within ninety days of his receipt of the notification of the action of the permit issuing authority and any record thereof, the action of the State permit issuing authority shall be deemed to be approved.</p>
