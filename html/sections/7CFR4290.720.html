                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Re-lenders or re-investors. You are not permitted to finance any Enterprise that is a re-lender or re-investor. The primary business activity of re-lenders or re-investors involves, directly or indirectly, providing funds to others, purchasing debt obligations, factoring, or long-term leasing of equipment with no provision for maintenance or repair.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Passive Enterprises. You are not permitted to finance a passive Enterprise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition. An Enterprise is passive if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is not engaged in a regular and continuous business operation (for purposes of this paragraph (b), the mere receipt of payments such as dividends, rents, lease payments, or royalties is not considered a regular and continuous business operation); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Its employees are not carrying on the majority of day to day operations, and the Enterprise does not provide effective control and supervision, on a day to day basis, over persons employed under contract; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> It passes through substantially all of the proceeds of the Financing to another entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception for pass-through of proceeds to subsidiary. With the prior written approval of the Secretary, you may finance a passive Enterprise if it passes

substantially all of the proceeds through to one or more subsidiary companies, each of which is an eligible Enterprise that is not passive. For the purpose of this paragraph (b)(2), ``subsidiary company'' means a company in which at least 50 percent of the outstanding voting securities are owned by the Financed passive Enterprise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exception for certain Partnership RBICs or LLC RBICs. With the prior written approval of the Secretary, if you are a Partnership RBIC or LLC RBIC, you may form one or more wholly owned corporations in accordance with this paragraph (b)(3). The sole purpose of such corporation(s) must be to provide Financing to one or more eligible, unincorporated Enterprise. You may form such corporation(s) only if a direct Financing to such Enterprise would cause any of your investors to incur unrelated business taxable income under section 511 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 511). Your investment of funds in such corporation(s) will not constitute a violation of Sec. 4290.730(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Real Estate Enterprises. (1) You are not permitted to finance:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You are not permitted to finance:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any Enterprise classified under sector 233 (Building, Developing, and General Contracting) of the NAICS Manual, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any Enterprise listed under sector 531 (Real Estate) unless at least 80 percent of its revenue is derived from non-Affiliate sources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You are not permitted to finance an Enterprise, regardless of NAICS classification, if the Financing is to be used to acquire or refinance real property, unless the Enterprise:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is acquiring an existing property and will use at least 51 percent of the usable square footage for an eligible business or commercial purpose; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is constructing or renovating a building and will use at least 67 percent of the usable square footage for an eligible business or commercial purpose; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Occupies the subject property and uses at least 67 percent of the usable square footage for an eligible business or commercial purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Project Financing. You are not permitted to finance an Enterprise if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The assets of the Enterprise are to be reduced or consumed, generally without replacement, as the life of the Enterprise progresses, and the nature of the Enterprise requires that a stream of cash payments be made to the Enterprise's financing sources, on a basis associated with the continuing sale of assets. Examples include real estate development projects and oil and gas wells; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The primary purpose of the Financing is to fund production of a single item or defined limited number of items, generally over a defined production period, and such production will constitute the majority of the activities of the Enterprise. Examples include motion pictures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Farm land purchases. You are not permitted to finance the acquisition of farmland. Farmland means land which is or is intended to be used for agricultural or forestry purposes such as the production of food, fiber, or wood, or is so taxed or zoned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Public interest. You are not permitted to finance any business if the proceeds are to be used for purposes contrary to the public interest, including but not limited to or activities which are in violation of law, or inconsistent with free competitive enterprise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Foreign investment--(1) General rule. You are not permitted to finance an Enterprise if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. You are not permitted to finance an Enterprise if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The funds will be used substantially for a foreign operation; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At the time of the Financing or within one year thereafter, more than 49 percent of the employees or tangible assets of the Enterprise are located outside the United States (unless you can show, to the Secretary's satisfaction, that the Financing was used for a specific domestic purpose).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception. This paragraph (g) does not prohibit a Financing used to acquire foreign materials and equipment or foreign property rights for use or sale in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Financing RBICs, SBICs, or New Markets Venture Capital Companies (NMVC Companies). (1) You are not permitted to provide funds, directly or indirectly, that will be used:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You are not permitted to provide funds, directly or indirectly, that will be used:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To purchase stock in or otherwise provide capital to a RBIC, SBIC or NMVC Company; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To repay an indebtedness incurred for the purpose of investing in a RBIC, SBIC, or NMVC Company.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``NMVC Company'' is defined in 13 CFR 108.50.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Entities ineligible for Farm Credit System Assistance. If one or more Farm Credit System Institutions or their Affiliates owns more than 25 percent of the ownership interests of a Rural Business Investment Company, either alone or in conjunction with other Farm Credit System Institutions (or affiliates), the Rural Business Investment Company may not provide Financing to any entity that is not otherwise eligible to receive Financing from a Farm Credit System Institution under the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (12 U.S.C. 2001 et seq.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Gaming establishments. You are not permitted to Finance an Enterprise that derives, or is expected to derive, more than one-third of its gross annual revenue from legal gaming activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Change of ownership of an Enterprise. You are not permitted to Finance a change of ownership of an Enterprise unless otherwise approved by the Secretary.
