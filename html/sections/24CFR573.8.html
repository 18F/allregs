                            <p class="depth0">The environmental review requirements at 24 CFR part 50 are applicable to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Environmental procedures. Before any lender's submission requesting a

loan guarantee for the acquisition, rehabilitation, or construction of real property can be selected for a loan guarantee, HUD shall determine whether any environmental thresholds are exceeded in accordance with 24 CFR part 50, which implements the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the related Federal environmental laws and authorities listed under 24 CFR 50.4. To assist in complying with environmental requirements, Borrowers are encouraged to select sites that are free of environmental hazards and are to provide HUD with environmental data needed to make a determination of compliance. For successful Borrowers, the costs for preparing the environmental data are eligible as project costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If HUD determines that one or more of the thresholds are exceeded, HUD shall conduct a compliance review of the issue and, if appropriate, establish mitigating measures that the applicant shall carry out for the property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The lender's submissions under Sec.  573.6 shall provide HUD with:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Documentation for environmental threshold review; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any previously issued environmental reviews prepared by local, State, or other Federal agencies for the proposed property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In providing the above information, the Borrower is encouraged to contact the local community development agency to obtain any previously issued environmental reviews for the proposed property as well as for other relevant information that can be used in the applicant documentation for the environmental threshold review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> HUD reserves the right to disqualify any request where one or more environmental thresholds are exceeded if HUD determines that the compliance review cannot be satisfactorily completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If Guaranteed Loan Funds are requested for acquisition, rehabilitation, or construction, Borrowers and Financial Institutions are prohibited from committing or expending State, local, or other funds to undertake property acquisition, rehabilitation or construction under this part until HUD issues a letter of commitment notifying the lender of HUD approval of the loan guarantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Environmental thresholds. HUD shall determine whether a NEPA environmental assessment is required. Also, HUD shall determine whether the proposed property triggers thresholds for the applicable Federal environmental laws and authorities listed under 24 CFR 50.4 as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For minor rehabilitation of a building and acquisition of any property, Federal environmental laws and authorities may apply when the property is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Located within designated coastal barrier resources;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contaminated by toxic chemicals or radioactive materials;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Located within a floodplain;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A building for which flood insurance protection is required;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Located within a runway clear zone at a civil airport or within a clear zone or accident potential zone at a military airfield; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Listed on, or eligible for listing on, the National Register of Historic Places; located within, or adjacent to, an historic district, or is a property whose area of potential effects includes a historic district or property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For major rehabilitation of a building or for new construction or rebuilding, and environmental assessment under NEPA is required and, in addition to paragraph (b)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section, other Federal environmental laws and authorities may apply when the property:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Affects coastal zone management;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is located near hazardous industrial operations handling fuels or chemicals of an explosive or flammable nature;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Affects a sole source aquifer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Affects endangered species;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Is located within a designated wetland; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Is located in a high noise area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Qualified data sources. The environmental threshold information provided by applicants mut be from qualified data sources. A qualified data source means any Federal, State, or local agency with expertise or experience in environmental protection (e.g., the local community development agency; the local planning agency; the

State environmental protection agency; or the State Historic Preservation Officer) or any other source qualified to provide reliable information on the particular property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Definition. Minor rehabilitation means proposed fixing and repairs:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whose estimated cost is less than 75 percent of the estimated cost of replacement after completion;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That does not involve changes in land use from residential to nonresidential, or from nonresidential to residential; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of residential properties, that does not increase density more than 20 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Project consultants. In achieving compliance with these procedures, Borrower's architectural and engineering consultants shall consider these environmental factors and provide information in their plan narratives as to how their construction plans conform with the above environmental factors. To facilitate HUD's compliance with part 50, the Borrower is required to submit the consultant's information and plan narrative discussing the pertinent environmental factors under this section.</p>
