                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Types of condominium ownership. The following types of basic  ownership arrangements are generally acceptable provided they are  established in compliance with the applicable condominium law of the  jurisdiction(s) in which the condominium is located:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ownership of units by individual owners coupled with an  undivided interest in all common elements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ownership of units by individual owners coupled with an  undivided interest in general common elements and specified limited  common elements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Individual ownership of units coupled with an undivided interest  in the general common elements and/or limited common elements, with  title to additional property for common use vested in an association of  unit owners, with mandatory membership by unit owners or owners'  associations. Any such arrangement must not be precluded by applicable  State law.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(6))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Estate of unit owner. The legal estate of each unit owner must  comply with the provisions of Sec. 36.4354. The declaration or  equivalent document shall allocate an undivided interest in the common  elements to each unit. Such interest may be allocated equally to each  unit, may be proportionate to that unit's relative size or value, or may  be allocated according to any other specified criteria provided that the  method chosen is equitable and reasonable for that condominium.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(c)(1), (d)(3), 3710(a)(6))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Condominium documentation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compliance with applicable law.  The declaration, bylaws and other enabling documentation shall conform  to the laws governing the establishment and maintenance of condominium  regimes within the jurisdiction in which the condominium is located, and  to all other laws which apply to the condominium.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Recordation. The declaration and all amendments or modifications  thereof shall be placed of record in the manner prescribed by the  appropriate jurisdiction. If recording of plats, plans, or bylaws or  equivalent documents and all amendments or modifications thereof is the  prevailing practice or is required by law within the jurisdiction where  the project is located, then such documents shall be placed of record.  If the bylaws are not recorded, then covenants, restrictions and other  matters requiring record notice should be contained in the declaration  or equivalent document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> shall at least mean available for inspection, upon  request, during normal business hours or under other reasonable  circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Amendments to documents after Department of Veterans Affairs  project approval. While the declarant is in control of the owners'  association, amendments to the declaration, bylaws or other enabling  documentation must be approved by the Secretary. The declarant should  have proposed amendments reviewed prior to recordation. This provision  does not apply to amendments which annex additional phases to the  condominium regime in accordance with a general plan of development  (Sec. Sec. 36.4364(a)(3) and 36.4365(b)(6)).   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(c)(1), 3710(a)(6))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Real property descriptions in the declaration--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Clarity-- conformity with the law of the jurisdiction. The description of the  units, common elements, any recreational facilities and other related  amenities, and any limited common elements shall be clear and in  conformity with the law of the jurisdiction where the project is  located. Responsibility for maintenance and repair of all portions of  the condominium shall be set forth clearly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Developmental plan--proposed condominiums. The declaration or  other legally enforceable and binding document must state in a  reasonable manner the overall development plan of the condominium,  including building types, architectural style and the size of the units  for those phases of the condominium which are required to be built.  Under the applicable provisions of the declaration or such other legally  enforceable and binding document, the development of the required  portion of the condominium must be consistent with the overall plan,  except that the declarant may reserve the right to change the overall  plan or decide not to construct planned units or improvements to the  common elements if the declaration sets forth the conditions required to  be satisfied prior to the exercise of that right the time within which  the right may be exercised, and any other limitations and criteria that  would be necessary or appropriate under the particular circumstances.  Such conditions, time restraints and other limitations must be  reasonable in light of the overall plan for the condominium. In an  expandable project, additional phases which are not required to be built  may be described in the development plan in very general terms, or the  declaration may provide that the declarant makes no assurances  concerning the construction, building types, architectural style and  size of the units, etc. of these phases. However, the minimum number of  units to be built should be that which would be adequate to reasonably  support the common elements. (See Sec. 36.4364(a)(6).)
