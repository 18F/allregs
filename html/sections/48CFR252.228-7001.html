The Contractor shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the contract price for any insurance costs extending from the end of the third working day after the Government's receipt of the Contractor's notice of correction until the Contractor is notified that the Government will resume the risk of loss.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the Government does not again assume the risk of loss and the unreasonable conditions have been corrected, the Contractor shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment for insurance costs, if any, extending after the third working day after the Government's receipt of the Contractor's notice of correction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The Government's termination of its assumption of risk of loss does not relieve the Contractor of its obligation to comply with all other provisions of this clause, including the combined regulation/instruction entitled ``Contractor's Flight and Ground Operations.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exclusions from the Government's assumption of risk. The Government's assumption of risk shall not extend to damage, loss, or destruction of aircraft which--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Results from failure of the Contractor, due to willful misconduct or lack of good faith of any of the Contractor's managerial personnel, to maintain and administer a program for the protection and preservation of aircraft in the open and during operation in accordance with sound industrial practice, including oversight of a subcontractor's program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is sustained during flight if either the flight or the flight crew members have not been approved in advance of any flight in writing by the Government Flight Representative, who has been authorized in accordance with the combined regulation/instruction entitled ``Contractor's Flight and Ground Operations'';</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Occurs in the course of transportation by rail, or by conveyance on public streets, highways, or waterways, except for Government-furnished property;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Is covered by insurance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Consists of wear and tear; deterioration (including rust and corrosion); freezing; or mechanical, structural, or electrical breakdown or failure, unless these are the result of other loss, damage or destruction covered by this clause. (This exclusion does not apply to Government-furnished property if damage consists of reasonable wear and tear or deterioration, or results from inherent vice, e.g., a known condition or design defect in the property); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Is sustained while the aircraft is being worked on and is a direct result of the work unless such damage, loss, or destruction would be covered by insurance which would have been maintained by the Contractor, but for the Government's assumption of risk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Contractor's share of loss and Contractor's deductible under the Government's self-insurance.

loss and shall be responsible for the Contractor's share of loss under the Government's self-insurance. That share is the lesser of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor assumes the risk of
