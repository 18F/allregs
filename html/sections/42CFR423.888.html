                                Sec. 423.888  Payment methods, including provision of necessary information.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basis. The provisions of Sec. 423.301 through Sec. 423.343,  including requirements to provide information necessary to ensure  accurate subsidy payments, govern payment under Sec. 423.886 except to  the extent the provisions in this section specify otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General payment rules. Payment under Sec. 423.886 is conditioned  on provision of accurate information. The information must be submitted,  in a form and manner and at the times provided in this paragraph and  under other guidance specified by CMS, by the sponsor or its designee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Timing. Payment can be made on a monthly, quarterly or annual  basis, as elected by the plansponsor under guidance specified by CMS,  unless CMS determines that the options must be restricted because of  operational limitations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this section on the same monthly or  quarterly basis, or at such time as CMS specifies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Annual payments. If the sponsor elects an annual payment, it  must submit to CMS actual rebate and other price concession data within  15 months after the end of the plan year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submission of cost data--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Monthly or quarterly payments. If  the plan sponsor elects to receive payment on a monthly or quarterly  basis, it must submit to CMS, in a manner specified by CMS, the gross  covered retiree plan-related prescription drug costs (as defined in  Sec. 423.882) incurred for its qualifying covered retirees during the  payment period for which it is claiming a subsidy payment and any other  data CMS may require. Except as otherwise provided by CMS in future  guidance, the sponsor must also submit, using historical data and  generally accepted actuarial principles, an estimate of the extent to  which its expected allowable retiree costs differs from the gross  covered retiree plan-related prescription drug costs, based on expected  rebates and other price concessions for the upcoming plan year. The  estimate must be used to reduce the periodic payments for the plan year.  Final allocation of price concession data must occur after the end of  the year under the reconciliation provisions of paragraph (b)(4) of this  section</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this section, and any other  data CMS may require. The alternative is that the sponsor can elect an  interim annual payment, in which case it must submit the following to  CMS, at a time and in a manner specified by CMS: the gross covered  retiree plan-related prescription drug costs (as defined in  Sec. 423.882) incurred for all of its qualifying covered retirees during  the payment period for which it is claiming a subsidy payment; an  estimate (using historical data and generally accepted actuarial  principles) of the difference between such gross costs and allowable  costs (based on expected rebates and other price concessions for the  upcoming plan year); and any other data CMS may require.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Payment by CMS. CMS makes payment after the sponsor's submission  of the cost data at a time and in a manner to be specified by CMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reconciliation. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sponsors who elect either monthly, quarterly  or an interim annual payment must submit to CMS, within 15 months, or  within any other longer time limit specified by CMS, after the end of  its plan year, the total gross covered retiree plan-related prescription  drug costs (as defined in Sec. 423.882), in a manner specified by CMS;  actual rebate and other price concession data for the plan year in  question; and any other data CMS may require.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Upon receiving this data, CMS adjusts the payments made for the  plan year in question in a manner to be specified by CMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Special rule for insured plans--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Interim payments. Sponsors  of group health plans that provide benefits through health insurance  coverage (as defined in 45 CFR 144.103) and that choose either monthly  payments, quarterly payments or an interim annual payment in paragraphs  (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, may elect to determine gross covered  plan-related retiree prescription drug costs for purposes of the  monthly, quarterly or interim annual payments based on a portion of the  premium costs paid by the sponsor (or by the qualifying covered  retirees) for coverage of the covered retirees under the group health  plan. Premium costs that are determined, using generally accepted  actuarial principles, may be attributable to the gross covered plan- related retiree prescription drug costs incurred by the health insurance  issuer (as defined in 45 CFR 144.103) for the sponsor's qualifying  covered retirees, except that administrative costs and risk charges must  be subtracted from the premium.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Final payments. At the end of the plan year, actual gross  retiree plan-related prescription drug costs incurred by the insurer (or  the retiree), and the allowable costs attributable to the gross costs,  are determined for each of the sponsor's qualifying covered retirees and  submitted for reconciliation after the end of the plan year as specified  in paragraph (b)(4)of this section. The data for the reconciliation can  be submitted directly to CMS by the insurer in a manner to be specified  by CMS. Upon receiving this data, CMS adjusts the payments made for the  relevant plan year in a manner to be specified by CMS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use of information provided. Officers, employees and contractors  of the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Office of  Inspector General (OIG), may use information collected under this  section only for the purposes of, and to the extent necessary in,  carrying out this subpart including, but not limited to, determination  of payments and payment-related oversight and program integrity  activities, or as otherwise required by law. This restriction does not  limit OIG authority to conduct audits and evaluations necessary for  carrying out these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Maintenance of records. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The sponsor of the qualified retiree  prescription drug plan (or a designee), as applicable, must maintain,  and furnish to CMS or the OIG upon request, the records enumerated in  paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The records must be maintained for 6  years after the expiration of the plan year in which the costs   were incurred for the purposes of audits and other oversight activities  conducted by CMS to assure the accuracy of the actuarial attestation and  the accuracy of payments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CMS or the OIG may extend the 6-year retention requirement for  the records enumerated in paragraph (d)(3) of this section in the event  of an ongoing investigation, litigation, or negotiation involving civil,  administrative or criminal liability. In addition, the sponsor of the  qualified retiree prescription drug plan (or a designee), as applicable,  must maintain the records enumerated in paragraph (d)(3) of this section  longer than 6 years if it knows or should know that the records are the  subject of an ongoing investigation, litigation or negotiation involving  civil, administrative or criminal liability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The records that must be retained are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reports and working documents of the actuaries who wrote the  attestation submitted in accordance with Sec. 423.884(a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All documentation of costs incurred and other relevant  information utilized for calculating the amount of the subsidy payment  made in accordance with Sec. 423.886, including the underlying claims  data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any other records specified by CMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> CMS may issue additional guidance addressing recordkeeping  requirements, including (but not limited to) the use of electronic  media.
