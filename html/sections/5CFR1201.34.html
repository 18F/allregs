                                Sec. 1201.34  Intervenors and amicus curiae.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Explanation of Intervention. Intervenors are organizations or  persons who want to participate in a proceeding because they believe the  proceeding, or its outcome, may affect their rights or duties.  Intervenors as a ``matter of right'' are those parties who have a  statutory right to participate. ``Permissive'' intervenors are those  parties who may be permitted to participate if the proceeding will  affect them directly and if intervention is otherwise appropriate under  law. A request to intervene may be made by motion filed with the judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Intervenors as a matter of right. (1) The Director of the Office  of Personnel Management may intervene as a matter of right under 5  U.S.C. 7701(d)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>. The motion to intervene must be filed at the earliest  practicable time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section,  the Special Counsel may intervene as a matter of right under 5 U.S.C.  1212(c). The motion to intervene must be filed at the earliest  practicable time.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Special Counsel may not intervene in an action brought by  an individual under 5 U.S.C. 1221, or in an appeal brought by an  individual under 5 U.S.C. 7701, without the consent of that individual.  The Special Counsel must present evidence that the individual has  consented to the intervention at the time the motion to intervene is  filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Permissive intervenors. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any person, organization or agency  may, by motion, ask the judge for permission to intervene. The motion  must explain the reason why the person, organization or agency should be  permitted to intervene.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A motion for permission to intervene will be granted where the  requester will be affected directly by the outcome of the proceeding.  Any person alleged to have committed a prohibited personnel practice  under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b) may request permission to intervene. A judge's  denial of a motion for permissive intervention may be appealed to the  Board under Sec. 1201.91 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Role of intervenors. Intervenors have the same rights and duties  as parties, with the following two exceptions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Intervenors do not have an independent right to a hearing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Permissive intervenors may participate only on the issues  affecting them. The judge is responsible for determining the issues on  which permissive intervenors may participate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Amicus curiae. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An amicus curiae is a person or organization  who, although not a party to an appeal, gives advice or suggestions by  filing a brief with the judge or the Board regarding an appeal. Any  person or organization, including those who do not qualify as  intervenors, may request permission to file an amicus brief. The Board  may solicit amicus briefs on its own motion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request to file an amicus curiae brief must include a  statement of the person's or organization's interest in the appeal and  how the brief will be relevant to the issues involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The request may be granted, in the discretion of the judge or  the Board, if the person or organization has a legitimate interest in  the proceedings, and such participation will not unduly delay the  outcome and may contribute materially to the proper disposition thereof.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The amicus curiae shall submit its brief within the time limits  set by the judge or the Board and must comply with any further orders by  the judge or the Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An amicus curiae is not a party to the proceeding and may not  participate in any way in the conduct of the hearing, including the  presentation of evidence or the examination of witnesses. The Board, in  its discretion, may invite an amicus curiae to participate in oral   argument in proceedings in which oral argument is scheduled.
